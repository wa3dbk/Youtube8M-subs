did<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:37.860> my<00:01:37.950> Archer<00:01:38.280> clean<00:01:38.520> didn't<00:01:39.240> have<00:01:39.360> any

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
did have my Archer clean didn't have any

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.969 
did have my Archer clean didn't have any
claim<00:01:39.689> castle<00:01:40.350> troops<00:01:40.470> didn't<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:40.860> my

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
claim castle troops didn't have my

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.499 
claim castle troops didn't have my
bbqing<00:01:41.430> didn't<00:01:41.670> have<00:01:41.790> anything<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.390> we're

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
bbqing didn't have anything so we're

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.910 
bbqing didn't have anything so we're
gonna<00:01:42.600> speed<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:42.990> up<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.350> make<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.799> little

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
gonna speed this up and make it a little

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.670 
gonna speed this up and make it a little
bit<00:01:44.100> quicker<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:45.020> think<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.110> guy<00:01:46.229> might<00:01:46.320> have

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
bit quicker I think this guy might have

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.039 
bit quicker I think this guy might have
been<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.890> town<00:01:47.100> hall<00:01:47.369> 10<00:01:48.210> I'm<00:01:48.420> not<00:01:48.509> too<00:01:48.689> sure<00:01:48.869> but

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
been a town hall 10 I'm not too sure but

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.630 
been a town hall 10 I'm not too sure but
all<00:01:49.200> he<00:01:49.350> did<00:01:49.500> was<00:01:49.530> use<00:01:49.770> hogs<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.250> heal<00:01:50.369> spells

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
all he did was use hogs and heal spells

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.510 
all he did was use hogs and heal spells
and<00:01:51.409> destroyed<00:01:52.409> my<00:01:52.439> defenses<00:01:52.950> my<00:01:53.100> defenses

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
and destroyed my defenses my defenses

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.800 
and destroyed my defenses my defenses
right<00:01:53.729> now<00:01:53.850> aren't<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.299> best<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.659> my<00:01:54.780> opinion

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
right now aren't the best in my opinion

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.080 
right now aren't the best in my opinion
I<00:01:55.259> have<00:01:55.409> some<00:01:55.590> really<00:01:55.799> weak<00:01:56.070> defenses<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.850> need

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
I have some really weak defenses I need

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.740 
I have some really weak defenses I need
to<00:01:57.149> do<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> lot<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.509> upgrades<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:59.600> yeah<00:02:00.600> it's

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
to do a lot of upgrades and yeah it's

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.840 
to do a lot of upgrades and yeah it's
just<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.960> little<00:02:01.200> unfortunate<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:02.159> he<00:02:02.399> he

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
just a little unfortunate but he he

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.359 
just a little unfortunate but he he
absolutely<00:02:03.299> obliterated<00:02:04.079> my<00:02:04.170> my<00:02:04.619> my<00:02:05.130> camp

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
absolutely obliterated my my my camp

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.609 
absolutely obliterated my my my camp
with<00:02:05.579> pretty<00:02:06.090> much<00:02:06.210> ease<00:02:06.509> looks<00:02:07.259> like<00:02:07.409> he<00:02:07.530> had

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
with pretty much ease looks like he had

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.130 
with pretty much ease looks like he had
a<00:02:07.649> couple<00:02:07.890> hogs<00:02:08.190> left<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.789> i<00:02:08.840> think<00:02:09.840> if<00:02:09.899> i<00:02:09.959> had

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
a couple hogs left and i think if i had

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.370 
a couple hogs left and i think if i had
my<00:02:11.060> some<00:02:12.060> client<00:02:12.390> castle<00:02:12.690> troops<00:02:12.810> for<00:02:13.080> my

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
my some client castle troops for my

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.840 
my some client castle troops for my
archer<00:02:13.530> queen<00:02:13.740> or<00:02:13.950> my<00:02:14.040> bbqing<00:02:14.460> it<00:02:14.580> might<00:02:14.760> have

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
archer queen or my bbqing it might have

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.340 
archer queen or my bbqing it might have
been<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.000> little<00:02:15.120> different<00:02:15.660> but<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.870> highly

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
it's gotta head out 300k elixir which I

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.290 
it's gotta head out 300k elixir which I
was<00:02:43.590> mostly<00:02:43.860> going<00:02:44.070> for<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.610> that's<00:02:45.120> why<00:02:45.270> I

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
was mostly going for and that's why I

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.030 
was mostly going for and that's why I
kind<00:02:45.570> of<00:02:45.630> started<00:02:45.810> my<00:02:45.990> Clank<00:02:46.290> out<00:02:46.530> my<00:02:46.710> troops

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
kind of started my Clank out my troops

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.470 
kind of started my Clank out my troops
on<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.190> left<00:02:47.430> side<00:02:47.580> because<00:02:47.880> this<00:02:48.000> elixir<00:02:48.270> was

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
on the left side because this elixir was

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.930 
on the left side because this elixir was
pretty<00:02:48.870> full<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.950> don't<00:02:50.520> think<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.790> had

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
pretty full and I don't think I had

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.580 
pretty full and I don't think I had
healing<00:02:51.300> spells<00:02:51.570> or<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:51.960> did<00:02:52.230> have<00:02:52.380> healing

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
healing spells or I did have healing

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.900 
healing spells or I did have healing
tools<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:52.980> think<00:02:53.160> there's<00:02:53.340> one<00:02:53.400> video<00:02:53.610> where<00:02:53.880> I

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
tools I think there's one video where I

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.970 
tools I think there's one video where I
don't<00:02:54.120> have<00:02:54.240> healing<00:02:54.420> spells<00:02:54.720> or<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.380> just<00:02:55.860> had

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
so that's what I was mostly going for on

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.270 
so that's what I was mostly going for on
this<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:18.440> I'm<00:04:19.440> going<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.650> speed<00:04:19.830> it<00:04:19.859> up<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.100> two

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
this and I'm going to speed it up to two

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.380 
this and I'm going to speed it up to two
times<00:04:20.310> speed<00:04:20.790> because<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.060> gets<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.239> little

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
times speed because it gets a little

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.840

boring<00:04:21.600> I<00:04:22.010> spread<00:04:23.010> out<00:04:23.100> my<00:04:23.220> troops<00:04:23.460> fairly

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
boring I spread out my troops fairly

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:24.950

his<00:04:25.229> storages<00:04:25.919> were<00:04:26.039> outside<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.430> base<00:04:26.669> so

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
his storages were outside the base so

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.400 
his storages were outside the base so
that's<00:04:27.000> what<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.180> was<00:04:27.360> kind<00:04:27.539> of<00:04:27.569> focusing<00:04:28.050> on<00:04:28.139> I

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
that's what I was kind of focusing on I

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.110 
that's what I was kind of focusing on I
feel<00:04:28.620> like<00:04:28.740> that's<00:04:29.039> where<00:04:29.250> most<00:04:29.400> of<00:04:29.580> his<00:04:29.789> gold

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
feel like that's where most of his gold

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.480 
feel like that's where most of his gold
and<00:04:30.389> loot<00:04:30.569> was<00:04:30.810> was<00:04:31.440> in<00:04:31.620> these<00:04:31.800> uh<00:04:31.860> those

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
and loot was was in these uh those

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.860 
and loot was was in these uh those
literature<00:04:32.940> storages<00:04:33.389> so<00:04:33.509> that's<00:04:33.690> where<00:04:33.840> i

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
literature storages so that's where i

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.140 
literature storages so that's where i
went<00:04:33.930> and<00:04:34.319> it<00:04:35.099> really<00:04:35.430> really<00:04:35.789> worked<00:04:36.030> out

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
went and it really really worked out

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.559 
went and it really really worked out
well<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:37.580> if<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.669> could<00:04:38.759> do<00:04:38.910> one<00:04:39.090> more<00:04:39.210> thing<00:04:39.270> i

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
well and if I could do one more thing i

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:44.330 
well and if I could do one more thing i
think<00:04:39.630> i<00:04:39.900> would<00:04:40.080> actually<00:04:41.960> probably<00:04:43.310> do<00:04:44.310> a

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
think i would actually probably do a

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.770 
think i would actually probably do a
couple<00:04:44.669> giants<00:04:45.240> over<00:04:45.389> here<00:04:45.539> in<00:04:45.599> this<00:04:45.720> corner

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
couple giants over here in this corner

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.689 
couple giants over here in this corner
cuz<00:04:46.080> this<00:04:46.169> elixir<00:04:46.470> with<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.949> stores<00:04:47.490> was

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
cuz this elixir with the stores was

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.100 
cuz this elixir with the stores was
really<00:04:47.910> full<00:04:48.120> i<00:04:48.389> think<00:04:48.750> i<00:04:48.810> should<00:04:48.960> have<00:04:49.080> done

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
really full i think i should have done

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.510 
really full i think i should have done
that<00:04:49.259> but<00:04:49.560> overall<00:04:49.860> I<00:04:49.979> think<00:04:50.069> I<00:04:50.250> put<00:04:50.430> this

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
that but overall I think I put this

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.850 
that but overall I think I put this
pretty<00:04:50.759> well<00:04:51.289> one<00:04:52.289> little<00:04:52.410> mistake<00:04:52.560> right

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
pretty well one little mistake right

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.589 
pretty well one little mistake right
there<00:04:52.919> as<00:04:53.160> I<00:04:53.250> drop<00:04:53.460> by<00:04:53.610> some<00:04:53.910> archers<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.300> little

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
there as I drop by some archers a little

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.570 
there as I drop by some archers a little
too<00:04:54.690> early<00:04:54.720> in<00:04:55.050> my<00:04:55.139> opinion<00:04:55.349> but<00:04:55.949> I<00:04:56.250> guess<00:04:56.430> they

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
too early in my opinion but I guess they

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.159 
too early in my opinion but I guess they
tanked<00:04:56.940> kind<00:04:57.389> of<00:04:57.479> tanked<00:04:57.780> them<00:04:57.870> for<00:04:58.050> the

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
tanked kind of tanked them for the

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.170 
tanked kind of tanked them for the
Giants<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:58.620> stuff<00:04:58.800> like<00:04:58.949> that<00:04:59.009> but<00:04:59.460> overall<00:05:00.120> I

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
Giants and stuff like that but overall I

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.550 
Giants and stuff like that but overall I
thought<00:05:00.360> I'd<00:05:00.479> play<00:05:00.630> this<00:05:00.810> really<00:05:01.110> well<00:05:01.320> I

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
thought I'd play this really well I

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.200 
thought I'd play this really well I
think<00:05:01.800> one<00:05:02.190> more<00:05:02.310> thing<00:05:02.490> that<00:05:02.520> I<00:05:02.759> needed<00:05:02.970> to<00:05:03.060> do

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
think one more thing that I needed to do

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.300 
think one more thing that I needed to do
is<00:05:03.449> start<00:05:03.900> carrying<00:05:04.259> a<00:05:04.349> little<00:05:04.560> bit<00:05:04.770> more<00:05:05.039> wall

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
is start carrying a little bit more wall

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.890 
is start carrying a little bit more wall
breakers<00:05:05.699> with<00:05:05.849> me<00:05:05.970> so<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.120> don't<00:05:06.330> have<00:05:06.449> my<00:05:06.570> my

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
breakers with me so I don't have my my

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.390 
breakers with me so I don't have my my
archer<00:05:07.229> queen<00:05:07.410> just<00:05:07.620> hitting<00:05:07.800> a<00:05:07.860> wall<00:05:08.070> over

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
archer queen just hitting a wall over

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.420 
archer queen just hitting a wall over
and<00:05:08.430> over<00:05:08.639> again<00:05:08.820> I<00:05:09.949> think<00:05:10.949> that<00:05:11.220> would<00:05:11.340> help

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
and over again I think that would help

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.360 
and over again I think that would help
out<00:05:11.610> quite<00:05:11.910> a<00:05:11.940> bit<00:05:12.060> and<00:05:12.440> help<00:05:13.440> my<00:05:13.560> giants<00:05:14.039> get

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
out quite a bit and help my giants get

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.399 
out quite a bit and help my giants get
through<00:05:14.610> some<00:05:14.910> some<00:05:15.509> of<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:16.080> middle<00:05:16.320> of

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
through some some of the the middle of

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:18.050 
through some some of the the middle of
the<00:05:16.530> map<00:05:16.710> I<00:05:17.009> think<00:05:17.430> that's<00:05:17.520> one<00:05:17.729> of<00:05:17.759> the<00:05:17.880> big

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
the map I think that's one of the big

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.490 
the map I think that's one of the big
problems<00:05:18.090> i<00:05:18.449> have<00:05:18.630> is<00:05:18.840> getting<00:05:19.259> through<00:05:19.409> the

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
problems i have is getting through the

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.460 
problems i have is getting through the
middle<00:05:19.710> of<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:19.830> map<00:05:21.440> with<00:05:22.440> my<00:05:22.680> with<00:05:23.580> my<00:05:23.759> my<00:05:24.659> my

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
middle of the map with my with my my my

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.600 
middle of the map with my with my my my
giants<00:05:25.830> and<00:05:25.919> stuff<00:05:26.069> like<00:05:26.159> that<00:05:26.250> so<00:05:26.370> right

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
giants and stuff like that so right

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.749 
giants and stuff like that so right
there<00:05:26.819> I<00:05:26.849> got<00:05:27.000> 250<00:05:27.419> K<00:05:27.659> loop<00:05:27.840> 300<00:05:28.740> k<00:05:28.860> gold<00:05:29.099> now

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
there I got 250 K loop 300 k gold now

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.129 
there I got 250 K loop 300 k gold now

and lured his barbarian King out and his
Barbie<00:05:57.060> odeon<00:05:57.509> came<00:05:57.750> out<00:05:57.870> in<00:05:57.990> like<00:05:58.169> a<00:05:58.199> weird

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469 
Barbie odeon came out in like a weird

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:01.129 
Barbie odeon came out in like a weird
place<00:05:58.800> because<00:05:59.159> like<00:05:59.460> my<00:06:00.060> my<00:06:00.449> archers<00:06:00.840> wanted

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
place because like my my archers wanted

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.439 
place because like my my archers wanted
to<00:06:01.229> go<00:06:01.320> for<00:06:01.500> that<00:06:01.680> that<00:06:02.669> laboratory<00:06:03.060> or<00:06:03.360> the

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
to go for that that laboratory or the

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:04.909 
to go for that that laboratory or the
research<00:06:03.780> factory<00:06:04.199> I'm<00:06:04.440> pretty<00:06:04.680> sure<00:06:04.800> it's

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
research factory I'm pretty sure it's

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:07.219 
research factory I'm pretty sure it's
the<00:06:04.949> laboratory<00:06:05.490> but<00:06:05.789> overall<00:06:06.509> I<00:06:07.169> really

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
the laboratory but overall I really

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.110 
the laboratory but overall I really
really<00:06:07.830> want<00:06:07.979> to<00:06:08.039> get<00:06:08.159> all<00:06:08.340> these<00:06:08.580> storages<00:06:09.030> on

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
really want to get all these storages on

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.189 
really want to get all these storages on
the<00:06:09.210> side<00:06:09.389> because<00:06:09.570> I<00:06:09.630> know<00:06:09.690> that's<00:06:10.050> where

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
the side because I know that's where

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.270 
the side because I know that's where
most<00:06:10.349> of<00:06:10.500> his<00:06:10.620> gold<00:06:10.860> was<00:06:11.070> and<00:06:13.099> again<00:06:14.099> this

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
most of his gold was and again this

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.790 
most of his gold was and again this
space<00:06:14.490> kind<00:06:14.849> of<00:06:14.969> has<00:06:15.150> that<00:06:15.479> elixir<00:06:16.229> storage<00:06:16.650> on
