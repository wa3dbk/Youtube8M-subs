00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.820
 Good 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.269
 Just with the part of the past 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.899
 I can not be with you 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:12.329
 It unfolds 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:15.329
 Which coat is the ally 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.650
 Overwintering and pr 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.119
 I think I got it 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.119
 What is your appointment in that month 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.970
 Take me 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.970
 It was close 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.180
 I wanted to notice 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.180
 It is true 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.810
 But I'm tuning this time 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.720
 Neatly 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.780
 I want to pull 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.050
 So overwhelming 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.910
 With sheet key 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.450
 Is it rice? 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.450
 Right 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.600
 Key type 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.600
 Please do not worry about the roots of the previous section 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.570
 Well then 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.000
 Cubs 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Shall we go from allies? 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.680
 First 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.310
 Left 2 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.040
 Left drop is also found 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.380
 It is not a red circle but a number 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.730
 It is written but 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.840
 Is haste the only difference? 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.050
 It is a doko game, but also Yokosan is simply No. 1 Ueda 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.610
 1 less 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.350
 mh but 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.860
 Six yen is advanced medical 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.860
 It is with the publication 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.050
 Then the production foot 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.500
 First 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.380
 Shall we draw 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.570
 This couple from the left 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.499
 4 can 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:10.859
 So first 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:12.349
 3 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.209
 3 of high 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.379
 Plateau 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.259
 Like this 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.259
 I hear my heart 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:31.229
 Renovation of the tree 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.229
 Next is four zero 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:37.919
 4 less 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.919
 4 less 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:43.720
 Like this 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.879
 40-0 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.869
 But here is 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:51.669
 I will not fly 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:53.449
 I do not go here 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:54.779
 It means 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.039
 Open 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:58.139
 Because it will appear 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.249
 You do not need to associate anything 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:03.449
 Nothing is held Figure 2 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.449
 In this case 4 decrease 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.709
 4. Please pull 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.159
 In the next 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.739
 Yeah 2 and 3 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.369
 Of the same sound source 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:24.369
 Subtract 2 and 3 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:29.179
 4 You are a modern person 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:33.069
 Oh 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.069
 The summit 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.649
 In this 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:41.919
 Turned over 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.919
 It is perfect 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:49.619
 Isn't it like this? 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:53.509
 Three houses-0 really 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:56.839
 Match 0 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:58.729
 Shrub 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:00.219
 Perhaps 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.109
 I learned to say tab 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.279
 I'm a fireman but 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:07.279
 It is perfect 

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:12.059
 Three houses-0 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:15.059
 Because zero one open 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.739
 If you ask the other wallet 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.180
 What is 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.979
 In order 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.550
 Over the base 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.930
 When it comes to Pudong 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.650
 Because I think 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.729
 Please try it
