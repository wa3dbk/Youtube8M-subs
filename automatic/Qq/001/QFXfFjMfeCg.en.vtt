we have one and you can also do other
things<00:02:32.250> too<00:02:32.519> so<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.150> basic<00:02:33.599> one<00:02:33.720> but<00:02:34.050> if

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
things too so this is a basic one but if

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.509 
things too so this is a basic one but if
we<00:02:34.230> wanted<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.530> make<00:02:34.680> add<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.040> little<00:02:35.310> bit<00:02:35.430> of

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
we wanted to make add a little bit of

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.509 
we wanted to make add a little bit of
interest<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:36.420> can<00:02:36.569> then<00:02:36.720> tie<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.080> on<00:02:38.010> this<00:02:38.250> end

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
interest you can then tie it on this end

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.059 
interest you can then tie it on this end
so<00:02:38.819> it<00:02:39.030> sticks<00:02:39.299> out<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.540> bit<00:02:39.810> from<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.350> side<00:02:40.380> you

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
so it sticks out a bit from the side you

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.080 
so it sticks out a bit from the side you
see<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.340> have<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.459> little<00:02:41.760> flag<00:02:43.340> like<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.610> but

see you have a little flag like that but

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.580 
see you have a little flag like that but
