just underneath

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.240 
just underneath
skin<00:02:13.510> then<00:02:14.110> what<00:02:14.410> they<00:02:14.530> do<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.740> they<00:02:14.950> eat<00:02:14.980> the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
skin then what they do is they eat the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.800 
skin then what they do is they eat the
flesh<00:02:15.490> from<00:02:15.790> between<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.300> skin<00:02:16.570> and<00:02:16.750> the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
inside and they make little tunnels

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.980 
inside and they make little tunnels
they're<00:02:18.580> very<00:02:18.730> hard<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.120> actually<00:02:19.240> find<00:02:19.750> and

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
they're very hard to actually find and

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.100 
they're very hard to actually find and
get<00:02:20.140> out<00:02:20.320> so<00:02:21.150> once<00:02:22.150> they<00:02:22.390> infect<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.870> fruit

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
get out so once they infect the fruit

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.340 
get out so once they infect the fruit
this<00:02:23.350> one<00:02:23.620> here<00:02:24.180> would<00:02:25.180> be<00:02:25.420> alright<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.840> cut<00:02:26.230> up

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.200 
might be a little bit too tiny to see at
the<00:02:47.920> moment<00:02:48.040> but<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.400> can<00:02:48.550> start<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:48.940> see<00:02:49.060> the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
and that is perfectly edible and won't

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.900 
and that is perfectly edible and won't
go<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.720> waste<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.860> prove<00:03:06.040> so<00:03:06.250> holy<00:03:06.580> some

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910

of<00:03:24.430> them<00:03:24.580> i<00:03:24.820> pickled<00:03:25.300> up<00:03:25.450> two<00:03:25.690> jars<00:03:25.930> worth<00:03:26.230> of

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
of them i pickled up two jars worth of

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.770 
of them i pickled up two jars worth of
this<00:03:26.530> using<00:03:26.890> a<00:03:26.950> recipe<00:03:27.340> day<00:03:27.520> or<00:03:27.940> colder<00:03:28.360> posted

so<00:03:29.470> I<00:03:30.120> can't<00:03:31.120> see<00:03:31.270> the<00:03:31.390> point<00:03:31.630> in<00:03:31.720> letting<00:03:31.990> it

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
so I can't see the point in letting it

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.750 
so I can't see the point in letting it
go<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.260> waste

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
go to waste

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.800

right now we'll have a look at these

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.030 
right now we'll have a look at these

little cocoons in here just to show you
what<00:03:39.190> they<00:03:39.310> look<00:03:39.340> like<00:03:39.520> I<00:03:39.910> don't<00:03:40.540> think<00:03:40.720> you'd

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
what they look like I don't think you'd

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.660 
what they look like I don't think you'd
actually<00:03:40.960> see<00:03:41.380> these<00:03:41.530> in<00:03:41.740> the<00:03:41.830> wild<00:03:42.190> they<00:03:42.340> tend

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
actually see these in the wild they tend

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.220 
actually see these in the wild they tend
to<00:03:42.790> fall<00:03:43.030> with<00:03:43.240> the<00:03:43.360> fruit<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:43.840> rot<00:03:44.080> on<00:03:44.200> the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
to fall with the fruit and rot on the

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.530 
to fall with the fruit and rot on the
ground<00:03:44.760> but<00:03:45.760> they're<00:03:45.910> interesting<00:03:46.300> to<00:03:46.330> look

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
ground but they're interesting to look

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.130 
ground but they're interesting to look
at<00:03:46.690> anyway<00:03:47.050> so<00:03:48.510> why<00:03:49.510> do<00:03:49.570> there's<00:03:49.870> actually

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
at anyway so why do there's actually

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.810 
at anyway so why do there's actually
quite<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.410> few<00:03:50.590> there's<00:03:50.800> one<00:03:50.950> two<00:03:51.190> three<00:03:51.580> four

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
quite a few there's one two three four

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.390 
quite a few there's one two three four
five<00:03:52.090> six<00:03:52.360> in<00:03:52.600> here<00:03:52.780> so<00:03:53.620> I'll<00:03:53.950> just<00:03:54.100> tip<00:03:54.280> them

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
five six in here so I'll just tip them

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.080 
five six in here so I'll just tip them
out<00:03:54.550> onto<00:03:54.730> my<00:03:54.880> hand<00:03:56.610> so<00:03:57.610> that's<00:03:57.760> what<00:03:57.940> these

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
out onto my hand so that's what these

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.490 
out onto my hand so that's what these
guys<00:03:58.300> look<00:03:58.540> like<00:03:58.570> they<00:03:58.960> haven't<00:03:59.140> hatched<00:03:59.350> yet

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
guys look like they haven't hatched yet

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.230 
guys look like they haven't hatched yet
and<00:03:59.830> they're<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.070> little<00:04:00.160> pupae<00:04:00.640> you

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
and they're the little pupae you

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.600 
and they're the little pupae you
normally<00:04:01.600> wouldn't<00:04:01.810> see<00:04:01.870> these<00:04:02.230> guys<00:04:02.610> they'd

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
normally wouldn't see these guys they'd

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.450 
normally wouldn't see these guys they'd
fall<00:04:03.910> with<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.180> fruit<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.660> just<00:04:05.280> pupate<00:04:06.280> in

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
fall with the fruit and just pupate in

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.060 
fall with the fruit and just pupate in
the<00:04:06.580> ground<00:04:06.820> and<00:04:07.180> they<00:04:07.840> would<00:04:08.500> emerge<00:04:08.800> his

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
the ground and they would emerge his

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.160 
the ground and they would emerge his
fruit<00:04:09.280> flight<00:04:09.550> to<00:04:10.180> wreak<00:04:10.660> havoc<00:04:10.690> on<00:04:11.110> your

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
fruit flight to wreak havoc on your

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.520 
fruit flight to wreak havoc on your
crops<00:04:11.590> so<00:04:12.370> I'll<00:04:13.240> destroy<00:04:13.570> these<00:04:13.960> guys<00:04:14.230> in<00:04:14.470> a

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
crops so I'll destroy these guys in a

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.560 
crops so I'll destroy these guys in a
minute<00:04:14.770> so<00:04:15.520> what<00:04:15.730> what<00:04:16.060> we're<00:04:16.210> doing<00:04:16.450> to

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
around things and fly underneath I've

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.890 
around things and fly underneath I've
actually<00:04:44.020> visited<00:04:44.289> a<00:04:44.800> place<00:04:45.250> where<00:04:45.759> Steve<00:04:46.719> and

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
actually visited a place where Steve and

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.450 
actually visited a place where Steve and
Eydie<00:04:46.990> have<00:04:47.199> actually<00:04:47.590> put<00:04:47.919> fruit<00:04:48.189> fly

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
Eydie have actually put fruit fly

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.640 
Eydie have actually put fruit fly
netting<00:04:48.939> over<00:04:49.449> the<00:04:49.569> top<00:04:49.750> of<00:04:49.780> their<00:04:50.080> arm<00:04:50.349> stone

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.129 
netting over the top of their arm stone
fruit<00:04:50.919> tree<00:04:51.159> and<00:04:51.580> they<00:04:52.539> haven't<00:04:52.750> had<00:04:52.990> any

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
fruit tree and they haven't had any

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.110 
fruit tree and they haven't had any
strike<00:04:53.469> as<00:04:53.680> of<00:04:53.800> yet<00:04:53.979> from<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.669> last<00:04:54.849> time<00:04:55.000> I

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
strike as of yet from the last time I

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.550 
strike as of yet from the last time I
saw<00:04:55.300> there<00:04:55.479> and<00:04:55.659> they<00:04:55.750> got<00:04:55.870> probably<00:04:56.349> half

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
saw there and they got probably half

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.260 
saw there and they got probably half
those<00:04:56.800> fruit<00:04:57.129> now<00:04:57.310> I<00:04:57.610> think<00:04:57.789> it<00:04:57.909> was<00:04:57.969> a<00:04:58.060> peach

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
those fruit now I think it was a peach

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.439 
those fruit now I think it was a peach
tree<00:04:58.740> so<00:04:59.740> it<00:05:00.370> appears<00:05:00.669> to<00:05:00.849> be<00:05:00.940> working<00:05:01.360> and

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
tree so it appears to be working and

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.059 
tree so it appears to be working and
that<00:05:01.539> was<00:05:01.719> what<00:05:01.870> was<00:05:01.990> recommended<00:05:02.560> to<00:05:02.590> them<00:05:02.800> by

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
that was what was recommended to them by

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:06.180 
that was what was recommended to them by
a<00:05:03.099> fruit<00:05:04.000> tree<00:05:04.389> grow<00:05:04.659> by<00:05:05.169> fruit<00:05:05.469> grower<00:05:05.710> so<00:05:05.979> I'm

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
a fruit tree grow by fruit grower so I'm

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.100 
a fruit tree grow by fruit grower so I'm
stir<00:05:06.370> a<00:05:06.400> trap<00:05:06.729> they're<00:05:07.509> the<00:05:07.629> little<00:05:07.750> traps

give<00:05:22.330> out<00:05:22.479> a<00:05:22.509> strong<00:05:22.840> scent<00:05:23.199> so<00:05:23.860> what<00:05:24.310> I'm

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
give out a strong scent so what I'm

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.399 
give out a strong scent so what I'm
thinking<00:05:24.460> is<00:05:25.029> the<00:05:25.360> capsicum<00:05:25.810> actually

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:26.409 
thinking is the capsicum actually

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.830 
thinking is the capsicum actually
overrides<00:05:27.099> the<00:05:27.610> scent<00:05:27.879> of<00:05:28.199> the<00:05:30.479> Serra<00:05:31.479> fruit

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
overrides the scent of the Serra fruit

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.029 
overrides the scent of the Serra fruit
trap<00:05:32.050> to<00:05:32.319> lure<00:05:32.469> the<00:05:32.889> bait<00:05:33.539> so<00:05:34.539> yeah<00:05:35.259> they're

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
trap to lure the bait so yeah they're

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:37.260 
trap to lure the bait so yeah they're
pretty<00:05:36.219> much<00:05:36.340> for<00:05:36.520> blowing<00:05:36.759> the<00:05:36.940> capsicums

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
pretty much for blowing the capsicums

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.119 
pretty much for blowing the capsicums
because<00:05:37.779> the<00:05:37.900> mango<00:05:38.319> is<00:05:38.379> not<00:05:38.650> a<00:05:38.680> metre<00:05:38.949> and<00:05:39.069> a

more fly netting halls actually just

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.920 
more fly netting halls actually just
insect<00:06:58.880> netting<00:06:59.180> but<00:06:59.330> it<00:06:59.480> seems<00:06:59.720> to<00:06:59.840> be

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 
insect netting but it seems to be

clips<00:07:09.230> I<00:07:09.350> might<00:07:09.500> actually<00:07:09.650> do<00:07:10.040> one<00:07:10.250> on<00:07:10.550> the

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.140 
clips I might actually do one on the

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.680 
clips I might actually do one on the
fruit<00:07:12.140> fly<00:07:12.410> proofing<00:07:12.980> of<00:07:13.130> those<00:07:13.340> boxes<00:07:14.000> so<00:07:14.420> all

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
fruit fly proofing of those boxes so all

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.500 
fruit fly proofing of those boxes so all
those<00:07:14.840> beds<00:07:15.520> another<00:07:16.520> idea<00:07:16.910> I'm<00:07:17.030> interested

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:17.510 
those beds another idea I'm interested

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.630 
those beds another idea I'm interested
in<00:07:17.660> is<00:07:17.870> making<00:07:18.140> up<00:07:18.470> some<00:07:18.680> insect<00:07:19.010> bags<00:07:19.250> just

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:19.640 
in is making up some insect bags just

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.670 
in is making up some insect bags just
out<00:07:19.790> of<00:07:19.820> this<00:07:20.090> stuff<00:07:20.300> itself<00:07:20.660> just<00:07:21.260> sewing<00:07:21.560> up

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 
out of this stuff itself just sewing up

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.580 
out of this stuff itself just sewing up
large<00:07:22.070> bags<00:07:22.430> probably<00:07:22.970> about<00:07:23.180> a<00:07:23.510> two<00:07:24.350> foot

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:24.590 
large bags probably about a two foot

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.470 
large bags probably about a two foot
across<00:07:24.920> by<00:07:25.190> about<00:07:25.430> three<00:07:25.730> foot<00:07:25.940> long<00:07:26.180> so

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:26.480 
across by about three foot long so

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.690 
across by about three foot long so
probably<00:07:26.960> about<00:07:27.140> sixty<00:07:27.680> centimeters<00:07:28.250> or<00:07:28.460> six

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:28.700

hundred mill by a thousand mill making
up<00:07:31.160> some<00:07:31.340> large<00:07:31.580> bags<00:07:31.910> so<00:07:32.240> they<00:07:32.270> can<00:07:32.570> actually

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:32.870 
up some large bags so they can actually

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.780 
up some large bags so they can actually
go<00:07:32.990> over<00:07:33.020> whole<00:07:33.410> branches<00:07:33.830> of<00:07:33.980> tomatoes<00:07:34.430> so<00:07:34.760> I

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:34.790 
go over whole branches of tomatoes so I

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.580 
go over whole branches of tomatoes so I
might<00:07:34.970> try<00:07:35.090> a<00:07:35.180> growing<00:07:35.540> some<00:07:35.780> tomatoes<00:07:36.560> and

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:36.590 
might try a growing some tomatoes and

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.650 
might try a growing some tomatoes and
capsicum<00:07:37.100> is<00:07:37.340> out<00:07:37.520> just<00:07:37.940> in<00:07:38.060> their<00:07:38.270> garden

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:42.410 
top branches or maybe a whole plant if I

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.680 
top branches or maybe a whole plant if I
get<00:07:42.560> small<00:07:42.830> capsicums<00:07:43.190> and<00:07:43.310> see<00:07:44.240> how<00:07:44.419> we<00:07:44.480> go

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:44.690 
get small capsicums and see how we go

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.200 
get small capsicums and see how we go
with<00:07:44.870> that<00:07:44.990> so<00:07:45.610> there<00:07:46.610> are<00:07:46.760> other<00:07:46.970> ways<00:07:47.180> you

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:47.210 
with that so there are other ways you

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.570 
with that so there are other ways you
don't<00:07:47.630> have<00:07:47.780> to<00:07:47.900> build<00:07:48.020> a<00:07:48.140> whole<00:07:48.350> insect<00:07:49.070> house

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:49.580 
don't have to build a whole insect house

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.210 
don't have to build a whole insect house
to<00:07:50.330> try<00:07:50.540> and<00:07:50.660> combat<00:07:50.930> these<00:07:51.200> guys<00:07:51.470> but<00:07:51.740> as<00:07:51.919> it
