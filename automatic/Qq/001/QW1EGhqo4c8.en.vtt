sort of review and tests and different
sorts<00:02:16.829> of<00:02:16.859> practices<00:02:17.159> we<00:02:17.370> did<00:02:17.549> with<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.730> we

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
sorts of practices we did with it we

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.429 
sorts of practices we did with it we
found<00:02:18.329> that<00:02:18.510> was<00:02:18.659> just<00:02:18.810> too<00:02:18.989> heavy<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.349> it

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
found that was just too heavy and it

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.629 
found that was just too heavy and it
dragged<00:02:19.739> out<00:02:19.859> the<00:02:19.980> dogfight

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:20.639 
dragged out the dogfight

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.489 
dragged out the dogfight
well<00:02:20.909> necessarily<00:02:21.599> and<00:02:21.719> just<00:02:21.959> stopped

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:22.499 
well necessarily and just stopped

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.739 
well necessarily and just stopped
fighter<00:02:22.980> pilots<00:02:23.430> from<00:02:23.519> really<00:02:23.849> using<00:02:24.209> tactics

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:24.749 
fighter pilots from really using tactics

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:27.080 
fighter pilots from really using tactics
and<00:02:25.230> going<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.650> more<00:02:25.889> to<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.069> head-on<00:02:26.459> sort<00:02:26.999> of

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
and going on more to a head-on sort of

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.059 
and going on more to a head-on sort of
collision<00:02:27.599> now<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.019> next<00:02:28.379> thing<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.769> very

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
collision now the next thing is very

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.369 
collision now the next thing is very
important<00:02:29.700> after<00:02:30.329> much<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.540> your<00:02:30.750> feedback<00:02:30.989> we

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
important after much of your feedback we

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.080 
important after much of your feedback we
found<00:02:31.650> out<00:02:31.889> that<00:02:32.129> many<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.489> you<00:02:32.609> are<00:02:32.639> fearing

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
found out that many of you are fearing

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.569 
found out that many of you are fearing
no<00:02:33.359> ships<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:34.170> would<00:02:34.379> rammer<00:02:34.739> into<00:02:35.430> each

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
no ships that would rammer into each

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.490 
no ships that would rammer into each
other<00:02:35.849> and<00:02:36.150> that's<00:02:36.510> why<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:36.900> decided<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.349> ship

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
other and that's why we decided to ship

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.110 
other and that's why we decided to ship
that<00:02:37.680> specifically<00:02:38.189> designed<00:02:38.639> for<00:02:38.730> ramming

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
that specifically designed for ramming

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.149 
that specifically designed for ramming
are<00:02:39.329> not<00:02:39.599> allowed<00:02:39.989> when<00:02:40.439> it<00:02:40.590> comes<00:02:40.769> to<00:02:41.010> the

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
are not allowed when it comes to the

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.159 
are not allowed when it comes to the
choice<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.639> cockpit<00:02:41.849> you<00:02:42.389> must<00:02:42.629> use<00:02:42.840> the

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:43.169 
choice of the cockpit you must use the

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:44.599 
choice of the cockpit you must use the
fighter<00:02:43.409> cockpit<00:02:43.769> we<00:02:44.010> decided<00:02:44.370> on<00:02:44.489> this

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
fighter cockpit we decided on this

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.459 
fighter cockpit we decided on this
because<00:02:44.849> it's<00:02:45.269> much<00:02:45.480> larger<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:46.079> presents<00:02:46.409> a

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:46.469 
because it's much larger it presents a

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:48.559 
because it's much larger it presents a
much<00:02:46.590> more<00:02:46.859> easier<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.579> engage<00:02:48.060> rather<00:02:48.480> than

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
much more easier to engage rather than

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.240 
much more easier to engage rather than
the<00:02:48.689> smaller<00:02:49.019> one<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.319> can<00:02:49.680> be<00:02:49.799> tucked<00:02:50.040> away

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
the smaller one that can be tucked away

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.490 
the smaller one that can be tucked away
it<00:02:50.790> also<00:02:50.939> has<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.150> better<00:02:51.449> arc<00:02:51.810> for<00:02:52.199> the<00:02:52.290> player

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
it also has a better arc for the player

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.530 
it also has a better arc for the player
to<00:02:52.709> see<00:02:52.859> out<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.489> one<00:02:54.269> of<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.419> most

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
to see out of and one of the most

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.030 
to see out of and one of the most
important<00:02:55.049> things<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.319> I<00:02:55.469> want<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:55.829> really

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
important things that I want to really

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.399 
important things that I want to really
enforce<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.969> cockpit<00:02:57.389> can't<00:02:57.810> be<00:02:58.049> hidden

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
enforce is the cockpit can't be hidden

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.979 
enforce is the cockpit can't be hidden
within<00:02:58.889> the<00:02:59.129> ship<00:02:59.189> you<00:02:59.790> must<00:03:00.090> be<00:03:00.269> able<00:03:00.419> to<00:03:00.599> see

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
within the ship you must be able to see

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.770 
within the ship you must be able to see
out<00:03:01.319> of<00:03:01.379> it<00:03:01.799> using<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.699> first<00:03:02.879> person<00:03:03.389> even<00:03:03.599> if

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
out of it using the first person even if

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.899 
out of it using the first person even if
that<00:03:03.900> means<00:03:04.079> using<00:03:04.439> a<00:03:04.530> very<00:03:04.889> sort<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.549> smaller

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
that means using a very sort of smaller

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.240 
that means using a very sort of smaller
low<00:03:06.239> profile<00:03:06.689> gap<00:03:06.930> out<00:03:07.139> the<00:03:07.409> front<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.980> must

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
low profile gap out the front you must

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.399 
low profile gap out the front you must
be<00:03:08.400> able<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.579> see<00:03:08.790> out<00:03:08.909> of<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.209> in<00:03:09.449> first<00:03:09.900> person

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
be able to see out of it in first person

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.409 
be able to see out of it in first person
now<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.040> final<00:03:11.489> rule<00:03:11.699> I<00:03:11.879> want<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.120> discuss

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
now the final rule I want to discuss

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.869 
now the final rule I want to discuss
with<00:03:12.569> you<00:03:12.840> is<00:03:13.019> it<00:03:13.260> must<00:03:13.500> be<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.949> small<00:03:14.430> ship<00:03:14.730> it

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
with you is it must be a small ship it

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.490 
with you is it must be a small ship it
can't<00:03:15.090> be<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.269> large<00:03:15.540> ship<00:03:15.780> disguised<00:03:16.260> as<00:03:16.469> a

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
can't be a large ship disguised as a

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.069 
can't be a large ship disguised as a
small<00:03:16.799> ship<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.489> must<00:03:17.729> just<00:03:18.000> be<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.419> small<00:03:18.780> ship

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
small ship it must just be a small ship

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.740 
small ship it must just be a small ship
using<00:03:19.650> small<00:03:20.129> ship<00:03:20.430> blocks<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.239> I'm<00:03:21.599> gonna

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
using small ship blocks and I'm gonna

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.569 
using small ship blocks and I'm gonna
leave<00:03:21.989> you<00:03:22.199> with<00:03:22.439> your<00:03:22.709> imagination<00:03:23.220> to

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
leave you with your imagination to

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.159 
leave you with your imagination to
actually<00:03:23.879> build<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.479> must<00:03:24.780> also<00:03:25.019> be

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
actually build it it must also be
