hi<00:00:02.639> Eric<00:00:02.969> beard<00:00:03.240> back<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.689> talk<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:04.200> little<00:00:05.100> bit

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
hi Eric beard back to talk a little bit

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.220 
hi Eric beard back to talk a little bit
about<00:00:05.520> biomechanics<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.629> spine<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:06.930> I'm

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
about biomechanics the spine and I'm

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.740 
about biomechanics the spine and I'm
gonna<00:00:07.379> touch<00:00:08.190> based<00:00:08.490> on<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:08.850> old<00:00:09.059> warhorse

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
gonna touch based on this old warhorse

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.539 
gonna touch based on this old warhorse

we overload the ligaments we have the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.030 
we overload the ligaments we have the
muscular<00:00:52.050> system<00:00:52.079> doing<00:00:52.710> too<00:00:52.860> much<00:00:52.980> work

instead of being able to hold ourselves

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.319 
instead of being able to hold ourselves
here<00:00:55.829> very<00:00:56.040> efficiently<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:57.000> line<00:00:57.180> ourselves

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
here very efficiently we line ourselves

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.420 
here very efficiently we line ourselves
up<00:00:57.690> correctly<00:00:58.110> and<00:00:58.440> then<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:58.950> want<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.250> allow

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
up correctly and then we want to allow

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.250 
up correctly and then we want to allow
ourselves<00:00:59.610> to<00:00:59.940> rotate<00:01:00.450> things<00:01:00.719> happen<00:01:01.050> much

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
ourselves to rotate things happen much

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.459 
ourselves to rotate things happen much
better<00:01:01.530> from<00:01:01.739> here<00:01:01.910> than<00:01:02.910> down<00:01:03.180> here<00:01:03.660> now<00:01:04.290> what

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:04.469 
better from here than down here now what

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:06.649 
better from here than down here now what
happens<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.949> that's<00:01:05.129> transition<00:01:06.030> into<00:01:06.359> an

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
happens is that's transition into an

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.749 
happens is that's transition into an
exercise<00:01:06.929> standpoint<00:01:07.499> we<00:01:08.249> examine<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
exercise standpoint we examine the

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.730 
exercise standpoint we examine the

biomechanics lumbar spine we have

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.069 
biomechanics lumbar spine we have
approximately<00:01:11.009> two<00:01:11.639> degrees<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.270> transverse

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.589 
here and make sure we promote mobility
here<00:03:47.280> especially<00:03:47.459> on<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:47.879> transverse<00:03:48.360> plane

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
here especially on the transverse plane

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.750 
here especially on the transverse plane
because<00:03:49.349> the<00:03:49.439> lumbar<00:03:49.769> spine<00:03:49.860> is<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.340> terrible

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
because the lumbar spine is a terrible

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.360 
because the lumbar spine is a terrible
thing<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.090> waste<00:03:51.620> transverse<00:03:52.620> plane<00:03:52.860> action

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
thing to waste transverse plane action

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.640 
thing to waste transverse plane action
for<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:53.640> thoracic<00:03:54.209> spine<00:03:54.540> help<00:03:55.079> posture

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
for that thoracic spine help posture
