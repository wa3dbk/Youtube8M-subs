00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.940
Hi, I'm Bente-Helen from @Flettemamma.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.640
Today Rebecka and I are going to show you how to do a Linked Chain Waterfall Braid.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.120
This braid is the waterfall version of my Linked Chain Braid, that I made instructions for in my first book.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.560
A technique I came up with 1,5 years ago while experimenting in a cabin in the mountains.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.240
Now I'll show you how to do the waterfall version of this braid.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:59.060
It's a knotted braid and the two strands on the sides will be knotted around the middle section,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.800
You start by picking up hair from the temple, and divide this into three parts.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.800
The middle section will not actually be a part of the braid, only go through it.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.840
You can finish the braid on the back of the head, make one braid from each side and tie them together,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.300
or you can make it go all the way around the head as I'm going to show you now.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.200
If you're going all the way around the head, make sure the middle strand reach to the other side of the head.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.320
If not, I'll recommend you to make one braid from each side and let them meet at the back of the head.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.040
We're ready to start the knotting. Divide the hair into three strands.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.120
The top strand and the bottom strand will be knotted around the middle section.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.980
Make a bow of the top strand and place it over the middle section.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.060
We're knotting the hair by placing the bottom strand over the end of the top strand,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.280
then under and up through the bow we made in the beginning.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.220
Tighten the two outermost strands while you also hold on to the middle one.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.080
Be careful when you tighten to avoid fly aways as you pull towards the direction of the hair.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.040
Then you let the bottom strand down, and this is your first waterfall section.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.300
You can either get the one you braid to hold the sections, or you can just leave them or secure with a clip.

00:02:14.385 --> 00:02:18.385
Pick a new section of hair right behind where you left the other down.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.780
This one is the new bottom strand.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.740
We're back to where we started, and we are going to start adding hair from the top of the head.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.700
My model has very thick hair so I only a little bit of hair to avoid the braid being too big.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.360
Add the new hair to the top section.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.940
Start over again with making a bow of the top strand and the new hair over the middle strand.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:58.200
The bottom strand goes over the end of the top strand, under and through the loop or the bow.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.780
Tighten the two strands on the sides at the same time as you hold on to the middle one.

00:03:07.185 --> 00:03:11.465
Let the waterfall section down, and this one can be hold together with the first one.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.140
This is not necessary, you can either just leave them hanging, or put it away in a clip.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.800
Pic up new hair right behind the waterfall section,

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:30.760
Add new hair to the top strand, and make a bow.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.240
Tie the bottom strand as a regular knot,

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.700
the only difference is that you do the knotting around a middle strand.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.800
Pick up a new bottom strand,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.980
As you can see I add the hair from the hairline on the forehead.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.240
Try to let the hair go in straight lines from the forehead and into the braid for a neat finished look.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.000
Continue braiding the same way as described.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:29.060
Make the bow with the top strand and new hair, the bottom strand goes over, under and through the bow.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:04.980
Here you can clearly see the middle strand that is going as a line through the braid.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.620
Almost finished.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:28.100
The last hair I add is the hair right over the ear,

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.640
this makes a nice and clean result and the braid looks good from the front as well.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.360
The middle strand is getting shorter so it's about time to finish it off.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.640
Make one last knot.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.280
This braid might take a couple of attempts before you get the hang of it, since knotting is a special technique.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.440
Let the bottom strand loose, this makes the last waterfall section.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.520
Then finally you secure the last two strands with bobby pins.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:33.280
I use the bobby pins upside down with the loops turning against the head for better grip of the hair.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.740
You can please hold this for me just as I secure the bobby pins.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.720
The bobby pin goes into the hair, then turn it the opposite direction and secure it.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:53.480
If you want to lock the hair even better you use a second bobby pin and cross this through the first one.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:08.220
If your hair is thinner or you want a fuller look of the braid you can carefully pull on the knots.

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:11.939
Adjust it the way you want.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.300
Then we're finished and ready for the last spin.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:35.120
A quite simple and cool braid that can be used on lots of different occations.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.600
Bye, and thanks for watching!
