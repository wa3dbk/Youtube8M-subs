think there's any doubt that the best

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.569 
think there's any doubt that the best
partner<00:01:49.530> for<00:01:49.560> Cahill<00:01:49.920> would<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.310> been<00:01:50.430> John

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
partner for Cahill would have been John

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.480 
partner for Cahill would have been John
Terry<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.659> was<00:01:51.810> too<00:01:52.140> much<00:01:52.290> water<00:01:52.530> under

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
Terry but it was too much water under

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.550 
Terry but it was too much water under
the<00:01:53.520> bridge<00:01:53.670> there<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.329> John<00:01:55.049> Terry<00:01:55.350> wasn't

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
the bridge there and John Terry wasn't

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.999 
the bridge there and John Terry wasn't
called<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.659> or<00:01:57.659> didn't<00:01:57.990> turn<00:01:58.229> change<00:01:58.740> his<00:01:58.860> mind

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
called in or didn't turn change his mind

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.130 
called in or didn't turn change his mind
in<00:01:59.219> terms<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.610> retirement<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.990> you

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
in terms of retirement so it you

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.780 
in terms of retirement so it you
probably<00:02:01.320> play<00:02:01.590> Phil<00:02:01.860> Jagielka<00:02:02.070> now<00:02:02.549> Jackie

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
probably play Phil Jagielka now Jackie

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.969 
probably play Phil Jagielka now Jackie

the one thing that will be important for
that<00:02:43.350> central<00:02:43.800> defense<00:02:44.100> is<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.400> have<00:02:44.580> good

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
that central defense is to have good

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.400 
that central defense is to have good
protection<00:02:45.210> in<00:02:45.450> front<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.110> that's<00:02:46.230> the

protection in front of it and that's the

protection in front of it and that's the
other<00:02:46.740> thing<00:02:46.890> that's<00:02:47.160> slightly<00:02:47.430> concerning

other thing that's slightly concerning

other thing that's slightly concerning
is<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.720> England<00:02:49.080> don't<00:02:49.350> really<00:02:49.620> have

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
is that England don't really have

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.260 
is that England don't really have
natural<00:02:50.310> holding<00:02:50.610> players<00:02:50.850> we've<00:02:51.030> seen

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
natural holding players we've seen

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.810 
natural holding players we've seen
obviously<00:02:51.510> Stevie<00:02:52.080> Gerrard<00:02:52.640> converted<00:02:53.640> into

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
obviously Stevie Gerrard converted into

Rodgers so you know we can comfort
ourselves<00:02:58.320> in<00:02:58.740> that<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:59.100> stevie<00:02:59.760> has<00:02:59.790> found

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
ourselves in that that stevie has found

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.000 
ourselves in that that stevie has found
this<00:03:00.360> discipline<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.350> late<00:03:01.560> stage<00:03:01.860> of

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
this discipline and the late stage of

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.960 
this discipline and the late stage of
his<00:03:02.190> career<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.670> play<00:03:02.880> there<00:03:03.180> but<00:03:04.080> after<00:03:04.620> Steve

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
his career to play there but after Steve

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.580 
his career to play there but after Steve
we<00:03:05.970> don't<00:03:06.000> really<00:03:06.600> have<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.780> natural<00:03:07.230> holding

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
we don't really have a natural holding

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.680 
we don't really have a natural holding
role<00:03:08.010> player<00:03:08.550> because<00:03:09.000> obviously<00:03:09.510> Michael

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
role player because obviously Michael

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.090 
role player because obviously Michael
counts<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.230> other<00:03:10.350> one<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.620> he's<00:03:10.740> been<00:03:10.920> left

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
counts the other one and he's been left

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.120 
counts the other one and he's been left
out<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:12.920> we're<00:03:13.920> not<00:03:14.010> better<00:03:14.340> just<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:14.760> attack
