00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.400
 seen and thought me sounds 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.250
 Interesting and that makes it easier 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.420
 I try everything a bit today 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.670
 amend 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.930
 but I'll show you what it is 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.570
 at all goes 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.340
 it's all about this recipe here so much 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.910
 has following ingredients for the bread 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.700

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.559

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.230

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.020
 tablespoons sunflower seeds 150 grams 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.170
 zucchini got a pack 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.510
 baking powder and a pinch since the whole 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.510
 has it in the preheated oven to 150 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.969
 baked for about 40 to 50 minutes 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.000
 As far as I know he should have the bread from 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.270
 sophia be juicy and so saw the well 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.580
 I really want the ingredients 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.860
 but change something and try 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.110
 time to make my variant of it 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.840
 just imitate is boring look 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.270
 we will 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.850
 live experiment what I make of it 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.679
 So stay tuned and have fun here 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.719
 come the audience I'll see how 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:25.390
 I can change all this here 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:27.520
 You could at the lean quark to you 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.649
 Taken 300 grams I would so with 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.840
 the baking powder would be the same 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.929
 Immediately let a park watch men to the 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.799
 celebrate has achim recipe I used 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:42.100
 live only five eggs sofia has 100 grams 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.439
 ground almonds taken or just 100 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.659
 gram flour says it in the video 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:52.060
 but I will take only 50 grams of it 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.119
 because I have the experience as soon as possible 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.030
 I mean I mixed my client 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.030
 would this he a cake or 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.509
 as a bread or bun 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.909
 because of that I reduce the defects of 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.000
 community mannen to 50 degrees 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.060
 I would instead of the remaining 50 grams 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.410
 take almonds rather wheat bran and 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.739
 although 40 grams 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.290
 Because white dress fits very well in bread 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.660
 or buns clearly find I'm not 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.250
 something the liquid too and it is 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.340
 very healthy and very high in fiber 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.349
 the so 4 takes 100 grams of shredded 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.690
 Flaxseed I now have the following to 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.829
 hand but the 100 grams of gravel 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.680
 lending slowly and once gold tells you 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:42.190
 This is a little lower calorie 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.150
 less fat more protein but also more 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.220
 carbohydrates 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.530
 this one has a little more calories less 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.290
 carbohydrates less protein for more 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.430
 for now I take 50 grams from the 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.819
 gold leyen 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.939
 has and 50 grams of the gravel 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:04.450
 leyen recruits the songs sofia has 140 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:06.790
 had grilled zucchini in her boat and 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.420
 I follow your tip with the carrots 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.519
 and combine a zucchini with one 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.969
 carrot and although I take here of 100 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.769
 gram and here from 50 1 pinch of salt 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:21.189

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.510
 bread seasoned with rhinish sofia 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:24.790
 nor sunflower seeds have I taken 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.939
 just skip it now and then 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.549
 If you want you can also like to 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:32.739
 top or linseed too 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.790
 I would now in oven to 150 degrees 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.370
 preheat 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.019
 and yes the ingredients are called me 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.519
 Let's say we do not go in 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.519
 worked on my snail shells 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:45.619
 carry over the day into one now 

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:45.619
 box shape I 'll take you with me 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:54.020
 i have a big box shape for 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:56.389
 this red we want so yes 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.120
 a little bit of sophia 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:02.240
 you can see that it is natural 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.900
 for filled up here i hope 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.520
 of course that the roadmaps because we 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.919
 I 've done it all for free 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.310
 and that would be a shame i say that now 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.259
 times in the oven to 140 degrees that is 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.819
 now preheated as long as that lasts 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:19.120
 I know, of course, not have it 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:21.050
 have not tried the exact one yet 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.620
 I will call you the same time 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.409
 Of course my full bread is 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.919
 finished I had the total for 60 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:36.789
 minutes in the preheated oven I show 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.789
 you get the result it looks like 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:42.589
 Of course, now I hope it is exactly 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:45.819
 as juicy as so much is good because of that 

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:45.819
 cut me that 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:02.010
 I think they are really fantastic 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:08.220
 I did not think that would be so 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:08.220
 good looking juicy is nice and soft 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.110
 and now, of course , we come to 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.790
 tasting that does not have to 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.660
 just look good but also good 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:24.520
 taste 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:27.340
 I'll try it all the time 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:30.520
 really really delicious juicy 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.080
 bread in combination with one 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.590
 I have never eaten zucchini 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:38.080
 and I would be very excited about that 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.479
 less I say like the would I 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.070
 recommend the inner cores of the 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.020
 to remove zucchini 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:48.789
 they are well known to leave 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:50.979
 a lot of water out and then that would be 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:53.160
 In any case I will fit the bread 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:56.169
 maybe with a tasty fish 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.120
