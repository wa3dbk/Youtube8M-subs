is the dead giveaway at the back my

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.720 
is the dead giveaway at the back my
train<00:00:38.360> is<00:00:38.390> actually<00:00:38.800> longer<00:00:39.800> it's<00:00:40.250> actually

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
train is actually longer it's actually

exactly four to five studs longer at the
front<00:00:48.309> the<00:00:49.309> reason<00:00:49.460> why<00:00:50.409> mmm

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
front the reason why mmm

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.360 
front the reason why mmm
I<00:00:51.879> built<00:00:52.879> a<00:00:53.000> new<00:00:53.030> tender<00:00:53.659> and<00:00:54.019> to<00:00:54.320> make<00:00:54.500> it<00:00:54.530> fit

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
I built a new tender and to make it fit

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.770 
I built a new tender and to make it fit
into<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.269> theme<00:00:56.600> of<00:00:56.629> my<00:00:57.440> Lone<00:00:57.769> Ranger<00:00:58.420> train<00:00:59.420> I

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
into the theme of my Lone Ranger train I

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.880 
into the theme of my Lone Ranger train I
actually<00:01:00.080> built<00:01:01.070> it<00:01:01.309> to<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.670> movies<00:01:02.860> Tendo

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
actually built it to the movies Tendo

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.899 
actually built it to the movies Tendo
actually<00:01:04.460> had<00:01:04.640> dual<00:01:04.909> bogies<00:01:05.500> but<00:01:06.500> as<00:01:06.800> well<00:01:07.580> I

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
actually had dual bogies but as well I

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.990 
actually had dual bogies but as well I
actually<00:01:08.320> integrated<00:01:09.320> my<00:01:10.010> power<00:01:10.370> functions

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
actually integrated my power functions

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.360 
actually integrated my power functions
motor<00:01:12.190> sensor<00:01:13.190> and<00:01:14.180> train<00:01:14.960> motor<00:01:15.260> along<00:01:16.100> for

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
motor sensor and train motor along for

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.440 
motor sensor and train motor along for
the<00:01:16.460> tender<00:01:16.909> it<00:01:17.870> actually<00:01:18.229> pushes<00:01:18.470> it<00:01:18.830> long<00:01:19.040> I

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
the tender it actually pushes it long I

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.210 
the tender it actually pushes it long I
extended<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:20.870> then<00:01:21.170> I've<00:01:21.290> put<00:01:21.560> this<00:01:21.710> extra

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
extended it and then I've put this extra

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.250 
extended it and then I've put this extra
wheel<00:01:23.000> here<00:01:23.740> to<00:01:24.740> make<00:01:24.950> it<00:01:25.220> a<00:01:25.430> lot<00:01:26.060> easier<00:01:26.840> for

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
wheel here to make it a lot easier for

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.770 
wheel here to make it a lot easier for
it<00:01:27.800> to<00:01:27.830> UM<00:01:28.720> go<00:01:29.720> around<00:01:29.990> corners<00:01:30.350> plus<00:01:31.450> just<00:01:32.450> get

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
it to UM go around corners plus just get

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.780 
it to UM go around corners plus just get
that<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:32.990> little<00:01:33.260> bit<00:01:33.560> more<00:01:33.740> of<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:34.100> longer<00:01:34.610> look

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
that a little bit more of a longer look

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.330 
that a little bit more of a longer look
what<00:01:35.150> I<00:01:35.390> feel<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:36.230> only<00:01:36.440> major<00:01:36.710> train<00:01:37.100> was<00:01:37.310> a

what I feel the only major train was a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.160 
what I feel the only major train was a
little<00:01:37.940> bit<00:01:38.120> too<00:01:38.360> short<00:01:38.390> for<00:01:38.980> my<00:01:39.980> liking<00:01:40.670> so

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
little bit too short for my liking so

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.600 
little bit too short for my liking so
changed<00:01:42.170> it<00:01:42.350> around<00:01:42.590> a<00:01:42.770> bit<00:01:42.800> add<00:01:43.220> another

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
changed it around a bit add another

this is how I made it so the ball couple
and<00:04:09.550> that<00:04:09.730> makes<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.620> train<00:04:11.620> thing<00:04:11.950> I<00:04:12.100> just

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
and that makes the train thing I just

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.310 
and that makes the train thing I just
built<00:04:12.519> that<00:04:12.580> up<00:04:12.880> with<00:04:13.060> bricks<00:04:13.330> and<00:04:13.720> then<00:04:13.930> I

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
built that up with bricks and then I

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.800 
built that up with bricks and then I
redid<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.560> bottom<00:04:17.950> of<00:04:18.070> this<00:04:18.400> as<00:04:19.299> you<00:04:19.480> can<00:04:19.570> see

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
in under there I want to modify make

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.310 
in under there I want to modify make
this<00:04:27.760> a<00:04:27.820> little<00:04:28.090> bit<00:04:28.300> shorter<00:04:28.720> because<00:04:28.780> I<00:04:28.990> feel

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
this a little bit shorter because I feel

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.660 
this a little bit shorter because I feel
it's<00:04:29.470> a<00:04:29.590> little<00:04:29.800> bit<00:04:29.890> too
