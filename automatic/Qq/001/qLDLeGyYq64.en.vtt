real<00:00:20.609> quick<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.150> gameplay<00:00:22.400> this<00:00:23.400> was<00:00:23.880> my

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
real quick on the gameplay this was my

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.890 
real quick on the gameplay this was my
first<00:00:24.779> game<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.439> day<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.359> it<00:00:27.359> was<00:00:27.390> my

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
first game of the day and it was my

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.189 
first game of the day and it was my
first<00:00:28.230> game<00:00:28.590> with<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> m16<00:00:29.929> when<00:00:30.929> they<00:00:31.050> made

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
first game with the m16 when they made

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.889 
first game with the m16 when they made
it<00:00:31.320> better<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.610> dropped<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.120> MOAB<00:00:33.420> with<00:00:33.660> it

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
it better and I dropped a MOAB with it

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.280 
it better and I dropped a MOAB with it
so<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.800> pretty<00:00:34.950> good<00:00:35.130> call<00:00:35.730> duty<00:00:35.910> for<00:00:36.290> m16s

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
so it's pretty good call duty for m16s

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.030 
so it's pretty good call duty for m16s

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
moved there to live with him because

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.400 
moved there to live with him because
that's<00:04:29.680> what<00:04:30.310> he<00:04:30.490> wanted<00:04:30.850> to<00:04:30.910> do<00:04:31.180> I<00:04:31.210> guess<00:04:31.600> and

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
that's what he wanted to do I guess and

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.680 
that's what he wanted to do I guess and
that's<00:04:32.710> where<00:04:32.920> he<00:04:33.160> ended<00:04:33.400> up<00:04:33.550> dying<00:04:33.790> from

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
that's where he ended up dying from

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.150 
that's where he ended up dying from
drugs<00:04:35.430> he<00:04:36.430> again<00:04:37.240> I<00:04:37.540> think<00:04:38.440> him<00:04:38.650> moving<00:04:39.010> there

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
drugs he again I think him moving there

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.800 
drugs he again I think him moving there
was<00:04:39.310> supposed<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.550> be<00:04:39.610> like<00:04:39.760> a<00:04:39.790> new<00:04:39.880> start<00:04:40.030> in

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.200 
was supposed to be like a new start in
life<00:04:41.040> like<00:04:42.040> you<00:04:42.280> made<00:04:42.460> all<00:04:42.640> new<00:04:42.790> people

life like you made all new people

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.230 
life like you made all new people
basically<00:04:43.540> just<00:04:43.900> start<00:04:44.200> over<00:04:45.060> but<00:04:46.060> it

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
basically just start over but it

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.440 
basically just start over but it
actually<00:04:46.419> got<00:04:46.720> worse<00:04:47.020> and<00:04:48.180> that's<00:04:49.180> where<00:04:49.390> he

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
actually got worse and that's where he

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.780 
actually got worse and that's where he
started<00:04:49.690> experimenting<00:04:50.140> with<00:04:50.830> different

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
started experimenting with different

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:57.770 
started experimenting with different
drugs<00:04:52.950> so<00:04:53.950> in<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:55.840> end<00:04:55.870> what<00:04:56.620> killed<00:04:56.980> him<00:04:57.190> was

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
drugs so in the end what killed him was

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.860 
drugs so in the end what killed him was
or<00:04:58.780> what<00:04:58.960> they<00:04:59.080> found<00:04:59.410> in<00:04:59.890> the<00:05:00.870> toxicology
