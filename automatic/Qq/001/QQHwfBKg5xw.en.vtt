00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.160
 this video servers hello friends today 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.110
 let's make the swords of chaos or 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.610
 soft play that I use as milk is said 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.740
 well they are very easy to make and 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.180
 we will simply need the templates 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.550
 that are in the description of the video 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.609
 download them print a little tail 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.570
 white a brush a pair of scissors 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.580
 use the one on the right because the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.680
 left I have a little tocadita already and 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.720
 carton cardboard television that then 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.120
 then we will see it better but you do not have the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.040
 double layer here we have the templates 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.710
 we have a face and face to print 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.420
 four per per sword that then 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.700
 we will put one on each side and they will form the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.129
 sword and good also simple so 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.600
 to cut the trim because it does not have 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.219
 secret everyone knows how to look good 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.129
 little one is teaching us the school 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.170
 we trimmed them cut with a lot 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.120
 careful to make it clear because 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.340
 then the sword will also be like 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.430
 we have cut and pasted so the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.170
 cut is 50% of the good sword 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.490
 we do the same with the rest of the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.250
 templates 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.050
 faces we see them and we see that 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.400
 when they are not perfect here we have 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.200
 the two swords 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.940
 that's why there are 44 faces that's why they're two 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.400
 good swords this is the good cardboard 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.840
 TV times is not difficult to 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.580
 get one because with another world today 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.240
 in day against televisions of these like this 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.580
 how good we get a cardboard and 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.520
 we just have to paste as it looks 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.830
 the image first we will stick the edge and 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.510
 then the good handle we're going to do the 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.420
 mix of white tail because the tail 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.100
 white as it comes out of the boat comes out very 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.380
 thick so we're going to add 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.050
 water as much as necessary to 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.450
 leave it then not liquid liquid but yes 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.400
 that we can paint the cardboard without 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.430
 problem that remains 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.840
 aguada good we present it more or less 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.000
 we know the space that we have to 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.030
 paint and we are painting as a painting 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.520
 will try let's give it a good layer there 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.870
 without passing us but generously 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.100
 we go 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.360
 and we're hitting center a little bit more 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.580
 or less to take advantage of what we have 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.010
 painted if something is missing because it is rectified 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.030
 well we have it, we are giving it there to 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.800
 that they stick well what are the edges 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.160
 this hits pretty fast and so 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.770
 although it seems that it is still 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.720
 humid medium at this point no longer 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.060
 could take off because it absorbs very well 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.450
 the cardboard what is the tail and good 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.730
 we have followed dry leaf 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.730
 stuck and we're going to stick the handle so what 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.010
 same we apply white glue and we put it 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.170
 we have to square it very very well not 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.030
 It is difficult but we have to do it well 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.220
 because what I said because then not 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.840
 we will be able to correct in passing 510 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.940
 seconds is going to be the difficult thing 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.580
 to take off well there we have it already 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.580
 square we put a little tail in 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.050
 the margins and we give again 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.600
 well do not worry about giving it for 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.550
 over because if you do not pass either 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.460
 nothing has to happen and although now 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.890
 look like it's whitish then the 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.960
 white tail as it dries is 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.730
 is transparent so good there 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.310
 we are seeing that there it is half dry 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.850
 some pieces are left blank but 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.540
 almost nothing and this already well inside 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.780
 it's been a while and it's totally 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.570
 dry 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.460
 let's cut with the cutter this is the 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.950
 more laborious and more delicate work 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.650
 because the cardboard is double 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.260
 quite thick and has a lot of corner 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.700
 so we go with a lot of patience and 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:36.310
 trimming and good to leave it like that is that it is 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.900
 patience and careful to leave it like that 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.180
 now let's paste the other side that is 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.239
 exactly the same procedure as 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.910
 what we have done we put first the 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.540
 White glue 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.250
 we paste now clear we have to 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.300
 adjust it to 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.720
 profile to silhouette 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.510
 and we stick the handle the same with the 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.140
 white and adjust to the silhouette and 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.140
 own sheet 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.750
 we can be with the finger and good perfect 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.580
 now we would give for the same 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.230
 graffiti on top and so we 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.440
 we assure you have a little bit of 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.010
 protection and this is the most 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.680
 firm good sign the best done what 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.940
 best possible this good the goal 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.890
 It's a bit dirty and it looks bad but 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.860
 well, it does not matter there, we see that the edges 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.450
 in the last face we have made are not 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.700
 totally perfect so we're going to 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.500
 perfect them with the cutter we're going 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.110
 giving we are going eliminating those parts 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.290
 white and we are adjusting it but not 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.590
 difficult and good we have here our 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:45.080
 swords of chaos and let's try them to 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.840
 see how they work let's go there 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.729
 hello good friends before teaching you 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.099
 how are the final results of 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.629
 the desire of kratos how to play I go to 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.039
 teach a little trick that sure 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:57.080
 many of you already know but 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:59.840
 good for those who do not seem the same 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.529
 interesting how to make a hood 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.959
 ninja 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:06.119
 here in Spain this is called in 

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:07.889
 military panties there are in several 

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:10.469
 colors 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:14.129
 instead of dark military the blacks 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:19.289
 well we need 2 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:21.270
 you proceed by putting the first one until the 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.670
 height of the nose 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:28.580
 we climb back a little and then we give 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.580
 the turn to cover the forehead 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.330
 it goes more or less like this 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.440
 and now with the other 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.560
 we cover the rest 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.880
 in this way it would be perfectly in 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:59.040
 our face our face hidden and 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.430
 ready to take our sores off 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.430
 degrees 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.759
 what am I going to do any attack 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:09.420
 special let's try it 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:11.870
 I do not know if it will come out but there is good hour 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.870
 ah
