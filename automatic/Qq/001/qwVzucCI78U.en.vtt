okay<00:00:27.650> first<00:00:28.650> I'm<00:00:28.890> going<00:00:29.040> to<00:00:29.100> turn<00:00:29.280> on<00:00:30.770> cellular

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
okay first I'm going to turn on cellular

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.930 
okay first I'm going to turn on cellular
data<00:00:35.360> now<00:00:36.360> first<00:00:36.690> we're<00:00:36.810> going<00:00:36.900> to<00:00:36.960> test<00:00:37.290> some

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
data now first we're going to test some

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.959 
data now first we're going to test some
porgy

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:52.670

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:25.240 

begin<00:01:07.960> test

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.930 

okay<00:01:26.170> so<00:01:27.170> it's<00:01:27.350> about<00:01:27.730> nine<00:01:28.730> megabytes<00:01:30.940> nine

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
okay so it's about nine megabytes nine

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.040 
okay so it's about nine megabytes nine
sorry<00:01:32.450> nine<00:01:32.690> make<00:01:32.990> up<00:01:33.140> its<00:01:33.290> per<00:01:33.650> second

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
sorry nine make up its per second

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
sorry nine make up its per second
download<00:01:36.050> and<00:01:36.560> four<00:01:37.280> upload<00:01:37.670> about<00:01:38.620> one<00:01:39.620> point

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
download and four upload about one point

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.230 
download and four upload about one point
zero<00:01:40.390> seven<00:01:41.390> megabit<00:01:42.080> per<00:01:42.110> second<00:01:43.210> now<00:01:44.210> let's

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
zero seven megabit per second now let's

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.230 
zero seven megabit per second now let's
turn<00:01:44.690> on<00:01:44.900> I'll<00:01:45.560> see<00:01:45.890> how<00:01:46.100> 4G<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:46.760> LTE<00:01:46.880> is

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
turn on I'll see how 4G and LTE is

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.469 
turn on I'll see how 4G and LTE is
different<00:01:48.760> okay<00:01:49.760> so<00:01:49.820> I'm<00:01:50.119> going<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.330> turn<00:01:50.420> on

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
different okay so I'm going to turn on

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:58.270 
different okay so I'm going to turn on
LTE<00:01:52.360> it<00:01:53.360> should<00:01:53.720> say<00:01:53.960> LTE<00:01:56.110> there<00:01:57.110> we<00:01:57.259> go<00:01:57.410> so<00:01:57.800> LT

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
LTE it should say LTE there we go so LT

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:28.229 
LTE it should say LTE there we go so LT
is<00:01:58.490> on<00:01:58.670> now<00:02:00.759> focus<00:02:01.759> be<00:02:01.970> test

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.910 

software<00:02:29.170> download<00:02:29.969> file<00:02:30.969> T<00:02:31.269> is<00:02:31.540> about<00:02:31.810> 12<00:02:32.200> to

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
software download file T is about 12 to

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.039 
software download file T is about 12 to
13<00:02:32.950> megabit<00:02:33.849> per<00:02:33.879> second<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:36.750> bar<00:02:37.750> upload

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
13 megabit per second and bar upload

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.380 
13 megabit per second and bar upload
about<00:02:38.290> five<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.829> six<00:02:39.040> megabit<00:02:39.579> per<00:02:39.609> second<00:02:40.209> I

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
about five to six megabit per second I

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.559 
about five to six megabit per second I
think<00:02:41.019> that's<00:02:41.170> probably<00:02:41.379> ok<00:02:41.980> but<00:02:42.010> not<00:02:42.489> but<00:02:43.329> not

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
think that's probably ok but not but not

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.209 
think that's probably ok but not but not
