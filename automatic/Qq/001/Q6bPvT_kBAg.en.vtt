00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.780
 very good kids in this video I'm going to 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.060
 show you how the double shot affects 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.680
 the semiautomatic weapons tell you that 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.990
 semiautomatic weapons are those that 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.820
 for every time we take the trigger though 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.730
 let's just press a bullet 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.260
 On the other hand, if they were automatic, 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.570
 let's press the bullets out 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.430
 to finish the charger and that 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.860
 will automatically reload and continue 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.630
 shooting is worth in this case I'm telling you 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.820
 let's see how it affects weapons 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.770
 semiautomatic because the other day in the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.600
 record of five that by the way we were 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.129
 the connection in both in the two 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.929
 games we did 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.690
 the doubt arose alvarito me 

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:38.010
 commented that yes it affected the weapons 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.989
 semiautomatic devices at least 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.640
 mustang he said and he said no and 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.230
 Well the case is as simple as 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.640
 check it so that's what I've done 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.949
 in this video step because you already know 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.210
 all and one less doubt that we have 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.710
 although it does not work for us, you have raised it 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.159
 never but good this way already 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.839
 you will know I have tried it with the likes with 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.760
 the eleven since I have not tried it with 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.719
 all semiautomatic weapons 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.899
 simply for which I am being the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.210
 in the box and well we go there the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.640
 mustang here I am testing them with 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.570
 double shot is worth what I do is empty the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.500
 charger to all 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.210
 to my fingers left my skin there and it goes like this 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.710
 a couple of chargers to see this I would 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.950
 I looked in slow motion to see 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.300
 exactly if I was going or when to see 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.380
 when we leave there there I do magic 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.670
 tram we stay all your bat you know that 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.229
 from time to time the grenades fail 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.000
 he failed me one that was precisely 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.009
 holding to select me but 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.320
 good that we would not have the theme ay 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.380
 You have seen how I have used two 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.540
 loaders of each gustaran I went out to all 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.950
 that has lasted more or less a 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.869
 second and a half to valerio and I tell you that 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.149
 I ended up in slow motion and I was 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.520
 looking good to know when just 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.380
 when not and now it is without double shot 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.090
 see how they come out at the same speed 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.970
 is checking it out and going out to it 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.560
 speed so they show salt and it gives 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.289
 even the double shot does not affect at all 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.899
 Then I got lage 11, so I say good 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.119
 by the empty test all the charger and 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.680
 Ditto over lage June 11 seconds 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.600
 late in emptying all the charger giving it 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.980
 and all host and here with the double shot 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.770
 more of the same 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.230
 if there could be a small but 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.450
 practically nothing difference because it 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.920
 there were three thousandths there was not a 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.440
 second difference in everything that took 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.330
 in emptying the charger so yes that 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.310
 it could affect but it could 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.310
 affect the speed with which they come out 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.700
 the bullets the three bullets that fire and 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.100
 so you may win a little are 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.380
 a thousandths of me then the voice of 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.880
 he is going to do it came out to me also and also 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.430
 I was testing today on these and that 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.900
 affects it is important, although I also 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.400
 It seems that this weapon, I'm not going to 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.620
 try it but this weapon seems to me to be 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.290
 automatic, even if you do not believe it, I think 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.320
 it's automatic but good using the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.270
 giving the trigger yes that affects fixed 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.630
 as there shoots a tad faster 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.330
 but calculation above two seconds without 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.480
 double shot and second and a half with double 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.220
 shot that is very little but good 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.710
 it may be that this affects already I tell you 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.360
 that I like in salt and ya g11 no but 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.830
 so you can try it with the rest 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.870
 of weapons with special weapons types 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.020
 you can try it with everyone and 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.890
 you can put it here to see what 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.500
 results I get I have not gotten to 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.200
 try it with all the weapons 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.120
 and finally I wanted to tell you one thing that 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.650
 does not know practically anyone and that is 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.970
 look at how slow I was shooting 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.760
 until now look at how fast 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.440
 shot right now is worth the only 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.780
 difference is that I keep the square 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.360
 pressed that is a fact that simply 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.770
 Well, I did not remember Diego 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.380
 stereo so look I'll take it and I'll 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.880
 I teach so you know if you play 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.400
 be in a corner while your 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.910
 fellow together in front and you have that 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.230
 weapon 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.790
 valeo the enchilada and I think that also 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.010
 it works but good in this function is 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.930
 sure if you have it and improve if you want 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.510
 shoot fast because you keep the 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.130
 square pressed and it will go faster 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.890
 just as you have precipitation that does not 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.330
 It works just the way it so 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.150
 that I do not badly hope that they have 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.209
 cleared doubts me at least the 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.670
 clear for me to teach you and me 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.040
 at least and sometimes and nothing more 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.290
 Tell me what you think if you know 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.760
 some weapon that is automatic and that the 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.070
 people think that it is not automatic or 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.120
 things like that and we see it for the 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.290
 comments 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.290
 nothing more kids so far
