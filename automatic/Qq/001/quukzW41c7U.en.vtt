299<00:01:57.299> instead<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.960> 199<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:59.240> made<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.360> mistake<00:02:00.390> by

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
299 instead of 199 I made the mistake by

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.840 
299 instead of 199 I made the mistake by
trying<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.560> save<00:02:01.740> money<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.399> went<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.700> like

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
trying to save money and I went to like

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.700 
trying to save money and I went to like
a<00:02:02.909> different<00:02:03.390> store<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.020> bought<00:02:04.259> red<00:02:04.469> cherry

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
a different store and bought red cherry

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.550 
a different store and bought red cherry
lashes<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.369> guess<00:02:05.579> they<00:02:05.729> were<00:02:05.850> fake<00:02:06.210> and

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
lashes and I guess they were fake and

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.100 
lashes and I guess they were fake and
they're<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.860> thin<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.220> gross<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.300> look<00:02:09.869> back

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110
