00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
thirty years of that and we'll let that

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.130 
thirty years of that and we'll let that
dry<00:00:36.760> after<00:00:37.480> that<00:00:37.629> I'm<00:00:37.780> going<00:00:37.899> to<00:00:37.960> hit<00:00:38.079> that

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
dry after that I'm going to hit that

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.259 
dry after that I'm going to hit that
with<00:00:38.440> some<00:00:38.500> more<00:00:38.859> the<00:00:39.010> black<00:00:39.250> violin<00:00:39.879> fabric

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
with some more the black violin fabric

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:42.240 
with some more the black violin fabric
spray<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:41.230> unique<00:00:41.500> thing<00:00:41.679> about<00:00:41.710> this<00:00:42.070> as

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
spray the unique thing about this as

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.319 
spray the unique thing about this as
well<00:00:42.460> as<00:00:42.609> it<00:00:42.760> has<00:00:42.879> a<00:00:42.910> denver<00:00:43.420> nozzle<00:00:43.839> on<00:00:43.989> it<00:00:44.140> and

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
well as it has a denver nozzle on it and

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.900 
well as it has a denver nozzle on it and
what<00:00:46.329> we<00:00:46.420> can<00:00:46.570> do<00:00:46.660> with<00:00:46.809> this<00:00:46.989> is<00:00:47.789> since<00:00:48.789> the

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
what we can do with this is since the

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.790 
what we can do with this is since the
dashboard<00:00:49.359> has<00:00:49.510> a<00:00:49.570> lot<00:00:49.929> of<00:00:50.109> areas<00:00:50.559> that<00:00:50.589> it

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
dashboard has a lot of areas that it

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.169 
dashboard has a lot of areas that it
might<00:00:51.010> be<00:00:51.100> difficult<00:00:51.550> to<00:00:51.640> get<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:51.940> it<00:00:52.089> the

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179 
might be difficult to get to it the

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.200 
might be difficult to get to it the
standard<00:00:52.589> nozzle<00:00:53.589> you<00:00:54.159> can<00:00:54.339> actually<00:00:54.609> change

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
standard nozzle you can actually change

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.329 
standard nozzle you can actually change
the<00:00:55.629> direction<00:00:55.899> of<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:56.499> spray<00:00:56.739> pattern<00:00:56.980> on

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
the direction of the spray pattern on

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.340 
the direction of the spray pattern on
the<00:00:57.579> nozzle<00:00:57.789> itself<00:00:58.390> I'm<00:00:58.929> going<00:00:59.019> to<00:00:59.170> go<00:00:59.260> ahead

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
the nozzle itself I'm going to go ahead

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.689 
the nozzle itself I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:59.499> demonstrate<00:00:59.589> that<00:01:00.039> for<00:01:00.100> you<00:01:00.339> just<00:01:00.370> to<00:01:00.550> see

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
and demonstrate that for you just to see

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.300 
and demonstrate that for you just to see
what<00:01:00.819> I<00:01:00.850> mean<00:01:02.609> hit<00:01:03.609> this<00:01:03.789> once<00:01:05.100> shoots<00:01:06.100> a<00:01:06.189> nice

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
what I mean hit this once shoots a nice

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.700 
what I mean hit this once shoots a nice
vertical<00:01:06.579> pattern<00:01:06.939> there<00:01:07.329> you<00:01:07.560> know<00:01:08.560> that's

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
vertical pattern there you know that's

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.560 
vertical pattern there you know that's
good<00:01:08.890> for<00:01:09.040> your<00:01:09.130> for<00:01:09.549> your<00:01:09.579> Y<00:01:09.790> areas<00:01:10.180> here<00:01:10.420> and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
good for your for your Y areas here and

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.850 
good for your for your Y areas here and
then<00:01:10.750> if<00:01:10.869> you<00:01:10.960> wanted<00:01:11.229> to<00:01:11.290> change<00:01:11.470> direction

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
then if you wanted to change direction

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.760 
then if you wanted to change direction
that<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:12.450> face<00:01:13.450> of<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:13.689> nozzle<00:01:14.229> you<00:01:14.740> can

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
that the face of the nozzle you can

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:22.550 
that the face of the nozzle you can
rotate<00:01:15.340> it<00:01:18.030> right<00:01:19.030> there<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:21.130> hit<00:01:21.280> it<00:01:21.310> again

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
rotate it right there and hit it again

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.700 
rotate it right there and hit it again
then<00:01:23.560> it<00:01:23.649> shoots<00:01:24.540> horizontal<00:01:25.540> pattern<00:01:25.840> just

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
then it shoots horizontal pattern just

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.410 
then it shoots horizontal pattern just
to<00:01:26.799> get<00:01:26.920> in<00:01:27.040> any<00:01:27.250> little<00:01:27.549> area<00:01:27.820> that<00:01:27.969> you<00:01:28.060> that

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
to get in any little area that you that

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.639 
to get in any little area that you that
you<00:01:28.509> cannot<00:01:28.750> get<00:01:28.869> into<00:01:29.020> with<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.320> standard

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
you cannot get into with the standard

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:30.749 
you cannot get into with the standard
now<00:01:29.770> so<00:01:29.950> that's<00:01:30.100> unique<00:01:30.340> thing<00:01:30.490> about<00:01:30.549> the

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
now so that's unique thing about the

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.910 
now so that's unique thing about the
danver<00:01:31.090> nozzle<00:01:31.630> and<00:01:31.719> also<00:01:32.020> it's<00:01:32.200> very<00:01:32.259> easy<00:01:32.649> in

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
danver nozzle and also it's very easy in

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.929 
danver nozzle and also it's very easy in
your<00:01:32.979> finger<00:01:33.280> your<00:01:33.399> fingers<00:01:33.640> not<00:01:33.759> going<00:01:33.880> to

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
your finger your fingers not going to

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.149 
your finger your fingers not going to
get<00:01:34.030> tired<00:01:34.240> when<00:01:34.420> you're<00:01:34.539> spraying<00:01:34.810> it<00:01:35.020> so<00:01:35.890> I'm

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
get tired when you're spraying it so I'm

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.050 
get tired when you're spraying it so I'm
going<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.340> go<00:01:36.399> ahead<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.610> start<00:01:36.789> spraying

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
going to go ahead and start spraying

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.120 
going to go ahead and start spraying
this<00:01:37.240> but<00:01:37.450> like<00:01:37.570> I<00:01:37.689> mentioned<00:01:38.020> before<00:01:38.049> you<00:01:38.979> can

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
and we've already hit it with some

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.230 
and we've already hit it with some
adhesion<00:02:36.870> promoter<00:02:37.230> now<00:02:37.470> typically<00:02:38.120> when<00:02:39.120> you

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
adhesion promoter now typically when you

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.030 
adhesion promoter now typically when you
use<00:02:39.330> vinyl<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.840> fabric<00:02:39.870> after<00:02:40.410> you<00:02:40.620> clean<00:02:40.890> it

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.390 
that's really all you need because there
is<00:02:42.690> adhesion<00:02:43.020> promoter<00:02:43.500> built<00:02:43.830> in<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.280> the

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
is adhesion promoter built in to the

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.880 
is adhesion promoter built in to the
paint<00:02:44.640> however<00:02:45.420> due<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.930> age<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.470> this

automobile we want to make sure that
that<00:02:49.110> paints<00:02:49.410> really<00:02:49.770> going<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:49.980> stick<00:02:50.250> now

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
that paints really going to stick now

that paints really going to stick now
we're<00:02:51.120> using<00:02:51.270> vinyl<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:51.930> fabric<00:02:52.220> because

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
we're using vinyl and fabric because

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.010 
we're using vinyl and fabric because
obviously<00:02:54.270> this<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:55.020> vinyl<00:02:55.440> but<00:02:56.660> also<00:02:57.660> because

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
obviously this is vinyl but also because

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.010 
obviously this is vinyl but also because
this<00:02:58.290> paint<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:59.150> flexible<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.360> won't<00:03:00.570> crack<00:03:00.840> or

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
this paint is flexible it won't crack or

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.330 
this paint is flexible it won't crack or
chip<00:03:01.050> with<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.500> expanding<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.250> contracting

chip with the expanding and contracting
of<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.060> vinyl<00:03:03.420> here<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:03.810> also<00:03:04.380> it's<00:03:04.740> UV

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
of the vinyl here and also it's UV

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.220 
of the vinyl here and also it's UV
resistant<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.450> not<00:03:06.600> going<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.810> fade<00:03:07.050> in

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
resistant so it's not going to fade in

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:21.440

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
so I'm going the opposite direction on

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.520 
so I'm going the opposite direction on
the<00:03:25.150> piece<00:03:25.450> just<00:03:25.690> so<00:03:25.840> I<00:03:25.900> can<00:03:25.989> make<00:03:26.230> sure<00:03:26.380> I<00:03:26.410> get

adhesion promoter on it because of its

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.449 
adhesion promoter on it because of its
age<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:41.140> you'll<00:03:41.830> notice<00:03:42.040> there's<00:03:42.310> some

to<00:05:01.509> use<00:05:01.569> the<00:05:01.810> vinyl<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.080> fabric<00:05:02.470> vinyl<00:05:03.370> and

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
to use the vinyl and fabric vinyl and

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.969 
to use the vinyl and fabric vinyl and
fabric<00:05:03.580> perfect<00:05:04.539> application<00:05:04.870> for<00:05:05.199> this<00:05:05.319> will

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
fabric perfect application for this will

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:27.159 
fabric perfect application for this will
show<00:05:06.130> exactly<00:05:06.400> how<00:05:06.580> well<00:05:06.819> it<00:05:06.940> works

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.719 

all<00:05:27.680> right<00:05:27.770> bride's<00:05:28.069> gonna<00:05:28.189> start<00:05:28.490> hitting

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
all right bride's gonna start hitting

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.459 
all right bride's gonna start hitting
the<00:05:28.819> fabric<00:05:29.270> first<00:05:29.539> because<00:05:29.870> a<00:05:29.900> fabric<00:05:30.319> is

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:30.469 
the fabric first because a fabric is

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:32.589 
the fabric first because a fabric is
going<00:05:30.620> to<00:05:30.680> take<00:05:30.830> a<00:05:30.860> lot<00:05:31.129> more<00:05:31.490> than<00:05:32.300> what<00:05:32.449> the

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
going to take a lot more than what the

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.179 
going to take a lot more than what the
vinyl<00:05:32.960> will<00:05:33.080> because<00:05:33.349> it's<00:05:33.469> going<00:05:33.590> to<00:05:33.650> soak<00:05:33.949> in

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:34.189 
vinyl will because it's going to soak in

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:35.679 
vinyl will because it's going to soak in
so<00:05:34.460> we're<00:05:34.610> really<00:05:34.789> going<00:05:34.969> to<00:05:35.030> hit<00:05:35.150> that<00:05:35.389> first

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:35.689 
so we're really going to hit that first

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:37.149 
so we're really going to hit that first
make<00:05:36.080> sure<00:05:36.110> we<00:05:36.319> have<00:05:36.469> that<00:05:36.499> covered<00:05:36.979> and<00:05:37.069> then

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
make sure we have that covered and then

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:38.950 
make sure we have that covered and then
we're<00:05:37.249> going<00:05:37.370> to<00:05:37.430> go<00:05:37.550> around<00:05:37.669> the<00:05:37.879> vinyl<00:05:38.810> and

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
we're going to go around the vinyl and

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.200 
we're going to go around the vinyl and
hit<00:05:39.080> that<00:05:39.310> yeah<00:05:40.310> you<00:05:40.400> can<00:05:40.550> see<00:05:40.669> this<00:05:40.819> soaking

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
hit that yeah you can see this soaking

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.899 
hit that yeah you can see this soaking

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
up quite a bit yeah just going to hit it

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:45.700 
up quite a bit yeah just going to hit it
both<00:05:44.060> directions<00:05:44.090> as<00:05:44.779> well<00:05:44.990> because<00:05:45.439> all<00:05:45.469> the

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
both directions as well because all the

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.489 
both directions as well because all the
different<00:05:46.009> fibers<00:05:46.460> in<00:05:46.550> the<00:05:46.639> fabric<00:05:47.379> with<00:05:48.379> the

00:05:48.489 --> 00:05:48.499 
different fibers in the fabric with the

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:50.080 
different fibers in the fabric with the
Denver<00:05:48.830> nozzle<00:05:49.219> like<00:05:49.310> I<00:05:49.460> showed<00:05:49.669> earlier<00:05:49.699> you

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
Denver nozzle like I showed earlier you

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.239 
Denver nozzle like I showed earlier you
can<00:05:50.240> go<00:05:50.330> ahead<00:05:50.449> and<00:05:50.569> switch<00:05:51.069> switch<00:05:52.069> it

00:05:52.239 --> 00:05:52.249 
can go ahead and switch switch it

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:54.969 
can go ahead and switch switch it
vertical<00:05:52.729> to<00:05:52.819> horizontal<00:05:53.710> to<00:05:54.710> get<00:05:54.830> all<00:05:54.919> the

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:54.979 
vertical to horizontal to get all the

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:10.580 
vertical to horizontal to get all the
different<00:05:55.249> areas<00:05:55.490> of<00:05:55.580> five

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.650
