00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.319
 introduced now 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.840

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.980
 vowels 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.459

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.670
 not all dressed in white because the 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.569
 white is synonymous with happiness that's why 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.569

 the priest comes out 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.270
 the same measurement 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.740
