00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
no I thought we needed to pick it up and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.290 
no I thought we needed to pick it up and
that<00:01:41.070> was<00:01:41.190> one<00:01:41.370> thing<00:01:41.400> we<00:01:41.790> talked<00:01:42.180> about

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
afterwards and that's one thing we

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.920 
afterwards and that's one thing we
worked<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.120> day<00:01:45.300> and<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.659> thought<00:01:45.840> we

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
there we've got to get me I continue to

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.170 
there we've got to get me I continue to
play<00:01:48.990> faster<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.740> talking<00:01:50.340> about<00:01:50.400> tempo<00:01:50.940> and

thought on man well I you know I looked
at<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.830> stats<00:02:26.070> but<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.640> was<00:02:26.790> also<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.480> know

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
at the stats but that was also you know

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.360 
at the stats but that was also you know
I<00:02:27.600> look<00:02:27.750> at<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:27.960> as<00:02:28.080> last<00:02:28.320> year<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.800> what<00:02:29.250> we

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
I look at that as last year and what we

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.710 
I look at that as last year and what we
really<00:02:29.610> looked<00:02:29.850> at<00:02:30.000> was<00:02:30.270> how<00:02:30.300> we<00:02:30.510> could

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
really looked at was how we could

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.480 
really looked at was how we could
improve<00:02:30.750> upon<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.650> things<00:02:31.950> we<00:02:32.130> could<00:02:32.310> do

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
improve upon that and things we could do

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.750 
improve upon that and things we could do
scheme<00:02:33.000> wise<00:02:33.800> fundamentally<00:02:34.800> every<00:02:35.400> day<00:02:35.520> and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
scheme wise fundamentally every day and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.460 
scheme wise fundamentally every day and
so<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.630> know<00:02:36.660> i<00:02:36.750> really<00:02:37.020> liked<00:02:37.260> where

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
so you know i really liked where

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.020 
so you know i really liked where
offensive<00:02:37.890> line<00:02:38.070> is<00:02:38.100> playing<00:02:38.430> right<00:02:38.580> now<00:02:38.640> and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
offensive line is playing right now and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.540 
offensive line is playing right now and
they're<00:02:39.840> doing<00:02:39.960> a<00:02:40.050> good<00:02:40.170> job<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.740> I<00:02:41.010> feel<00:02:41.370> that

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
they're doing a good job so I feel that

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.910 
they're doing a good job so I feel that
we<00:02:41.700> won't<00:02:42.390> prove<00:02:42.570> upon<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:42.960> witty<00:02:43.440> this<00:02:43.770> is

a<00:03:19.200> one-on-one<00:03:19.380> situation<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:20.340> we<00:03:20.400> can't

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
a one-on-one situation so we can't

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.100 
a one-on-one situation so we can't
happen<00:03:20.820> anyplace<00:03:21.180> what<00:03:21.750> are<00:03:21.810> your<00:03:21.930> thoughts

become<00:03:32.250> more<00:03:32.430> consistent<00:03:33.060> in<00:03:33.150> his<00:03:33.240> footwork

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
become more consistent in his footwork

the<00:04:39.300> energy<00:04:39.690> I<00:04:40.110> always<00:04:40.590> coached<00:04:41.040> with<00:04:41.370> passion

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
the energy I always coached with passion

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.480 
the energy I always coached with passion
alwayz<00:04:42.150> coach<00:04:42.390> with<00:04:42.600> energy<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.110> so<00:04:43.980> no<00:04:44.460> I

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
alwayz coach with energy and so no I

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.270 
alwayz coach with energy and so no I
don't<00:04:44.700> think<00:04:44.880> so<00:04:45.090> i<00:04:45.270> think<00:04:45.450> that<00:04:46.070> that's<00:04:47.070> just

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
don't think so i think that that's just

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.400 
don't think so i think that that's just
the<00:04:47.370> way<00:04:47.490> I<00:04:47.520> coach<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.240> I've<00:04:48.930> always<00:04:49.110> coached

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
the way I coach and I've always coached

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.930 
the way I coach and I've always coached
that<00:04:49.560> way<00:04:49.740> and<00:04:49.860> always<00:04:49.980> will<00:04:50.280> coach<00:04:50.520> that<00:04:50.760> way

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
that way and always will coach that way

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.400 
that way and always will coach that way
so<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.419> don't<00:04:51.630> feel<00:04:51.690> like<00:04:51.840> it's<00:04:52.020> been<00:04:52.200> really

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
so I don't feel like it's been really

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.090 
so I don't feel like it's been really
any<00:04:52.500> adjustment<00:04:53.190> what<00:04:53.610> did<00:04:53.730> you<00:04:53.760> miss<00:04:54.000> I

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100
