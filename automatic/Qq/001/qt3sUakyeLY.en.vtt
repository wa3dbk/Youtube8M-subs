00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.200 
going to use them to put in the CRX it's
actually<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.010> wrong<00:02:24.220> year<00:02:24.580> you<00:02:24.850> have<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.060> use

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
actually the wrong year you have to use

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.780 
actually the wrong year you have to use
the<00:02:25.360> 1992<00:02:26.170> 1993<00:02:27.160> generation<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.180> chord<00:02:28.710> and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
the 1992 1993 generation of a chord and

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.340 
the 1992 1993 generation of a chord and
somehow<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:30.970> can<00:02:31.240> make<00:02:31.420> them<00:02:31.540> fit<00:02:31.810> when<00:02:32.320> i

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
somehow you can make them fit when i

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.720 
somehow you can make them fit when i
checked<00:02:32.680> out<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.190> at<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.430> junkyard

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
checked out that you at the junkyard

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.550 
checked out that you at the junkyard
they<00:02:34.150> do<00:02:34.210> look<00:02:34.570> like<00:02:34.780> they<00:02:34.990> would<00:02:35.140> physically

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
they do look like they would physically

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.180 
they do look like they would physically
fit<00:02:35.890> i<00:02:36.850> ended<00:02:37.810> up<00:02:37.900> actually<00:02:38.140> just<00:02:38.500> using<00:02:38.770> jb

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
fit i ended up actually just using jb

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.390 
fit i ended up actually just using jb
weld<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.670> super<00:02:40.120> glue<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.720> put<00:02:41.130> mine<00:02:42.130> back

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
weld and super glue to put mine back

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.180 
weld and super glue to put mine back
together<00:02:42.880> so<00:02:43.270> i<00:02:43.540> can<00:02:44.290> actually<00:02:44.440> operate<00:02:44.950> the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
together so i can actually operate the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.440 
together so i can actually operate the
heat<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.490> control<00:02:45.820> now<00:02:46.030> with<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:46.300> whole

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
heat of control now with the whole

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.850 
heat of control now with the whole
without<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:46.900> whole<00:02:47.020> thing<00:02:47.230> breaking<00:02:47.590> apart

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
without the whole thing breaking apart

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.790 
without the whole thing breaking apart
and<00:02:48.220> falling<00:02:48.610> inside<00:02:48.910> of<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.470> dash<00:02:50.470> there

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
and falling inside of the dash there

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.420 
and falling inside of the dash there
which<00:02:50.950> gets<00:02:51.130> pretty<00:02:51.370> annoying<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:52.800> i<00:02:53.800> think

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
which gets pretty annoying and i think

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.330 
which gets pretty annoying and i think
it's<00:02:54.550> about<00:02:54.850> it<00:02:55.060> for<00:02:55.300> now
