00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.210
 enemy subjects and champions 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.460

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.090
 time is charged there will be a greater 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.460
 amount of damage while active 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.100
 stability your movement speed 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.439
 it will be reduced stability allows you 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.959
 do a good amount of damage to a 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.299
 safe distance or you can use it 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.819
 to finish off the rivals that run 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.429
 low life this skill as your 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:52.860
 name says it's great since you'll be a 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.530
 murderer but a murderer of the 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.569
 sensuality if you see a helpless 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.289
 champion alone by the crack of 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:03.420
 invoker you prepare and penetrate it 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.989
 be selfish with this skill a 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:11.459
 hemisphere you the penis after a zone the 

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:13.770
 penetrate a lapine moon after a civil 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:18.020
 undoubtedly penetrates 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:22.740
 táriq although it costs to penetrate what 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:25.350
 better let's continue the w the darn quiver 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.690
 this is a passive skill that is to say no 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.210
 you can activate it to generate a 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.850
 effect but the level goes up to 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.050
 that the passive effect is improved 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.690
 it's a skill that makes 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.270
 basic attacks of varus inflict damage 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.460
 magical extra and apply infection 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.440
 these manifest color marks 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.750
 dark that revolve around a goal 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.880
 the rest of the skills of varus 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.790
 they exploit the infection of these brands 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.160
 which inflicts magic damage 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.370
 additional according to the maximum life of your 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.920
 objective let's continue with the storm of 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.500
 Varus arrows throw arrows to an area 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.170
 determined from the map which they inflict 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.000
 physical damage and they also prepare the 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.190
 land that they touch so it's a 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.770
 enemy flats that ground their speed 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.170
 of movement will be reduced together with 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.390
 the cures and regeneration is passive 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.010
 of life this skill will help you to run away 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.530
 of a rival that wants to finish with your 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.520
 life they throw in their path and you'll be 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.920
 earn seconds 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.500
 such is to get healthy home by 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.690
 last we have his definitive chain of 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.370
 corruption varus launches a chain 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.920
 infectious that immobilizes the first 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.500
 champion impacted then he is moving 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.730
 to the nearby champions 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.800
 immobilizing them also this infection 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.750
 it can spread even through 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.490
 the walls of the summoner's crack 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.470
 this is the skill that makes you a 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.450
 special shooter since it gives you the 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.150
 possibility of starting a battle of 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.710
 equipment without stability pacts 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.140
 you will have a good advantage in the 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.720
 development of the fight or you can also 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.700
 use it defensively as you are the 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.900
 weaker character in terms of 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.940
 resistance of your team 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.730
 you will be easy prey to later produce 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.560
 enemies expect them to launch for you and 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.540
 throwing your chain this will give you 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.020
 vital seconds to be able to destroy 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.730
 the or reposition and thus come out graceful 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.250
 of the play all the skills 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.840
 activables of varus are written this 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.940
 means that they are skills that 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.880
 you must aim so that it can be done 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.560
 damage or some aspect in the rival maybe 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.780
 if you are new tecos to learn to 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.430
 accept these skills but it's just 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.680
 question of practice 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.199
 the quick keyboard option will help you 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.750
 use your kit skills much better 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.419
 you can activate this in the game menu 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.789
 In Barú there is a synergy of 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.250
 skills that range from your passive to your 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.470
 definitive one that gives you very good 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.229
 results in step of lines is to do 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.660
 hits on a subject and look for the 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.940
 basic attack on the opponent by killing the 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.310
 subject you'll have the speed bonus of 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.620
 attack with which I could connect up 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.229
 two basic attacks and the enemy does not 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.150
 I would have response time in this 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.460
 same line if you're going to face the 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.949
 enemy range shooter seeks 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.410
 exploit all its potential burden the 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:10.020
 three infections I had double active 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.849
 the additional damage with your e so you will reduce 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.310
 the healing that the 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.650
 support then load the three infections 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.169
 again and explode with arrow 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.539
 penetrating but be careful if the rival 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.550
 is attacking you load the skill and 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:25.830
 release it immediately since if the 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.750
 charge the opponent for a long time 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.849
 can destroy basic attacks 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.789
 especially if it's built 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.150
 possibility of critic with varus no 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:34.920
 you must 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.080
 forget that although you can have great 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.360
 amounts of damage in order you're a 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.580
 pretty weak character in the sense 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.620
 of resistance try to take advantage of your 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.810
 range to keep the distance safe 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.030
 of the rival in addition to having the teams of 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.190
 invoker of stec and barrier to power 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.200
 get out of dangerous situations 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.730
 good friends, I already start firing 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.070

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.140
 varus as always depends on you 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.880
 option to take it to the fields of 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.580
 justice or missing the option of 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.290
 penetrate the game champions if 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.090
 they liked what they saw, like it and 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.280
