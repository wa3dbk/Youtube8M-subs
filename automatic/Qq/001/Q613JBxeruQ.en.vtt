moment<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.210> named<00:01:42.720> as<00:01:42.960> solid<00:01:43.380> shaft<00:01:43.619> origins

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
moment it's named as solid shaft origins

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.800 
moment it's named as solid shaft origins
which<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.340> what<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> needed<00:01:44.790> Ryan<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.479> change

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
which is what I needed Ryan to change

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.139 
which is what I needed Ryan to change
once<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.950> has<00:01:47.130> changed<00:01:47.159> i<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:47.759> then<00:01:47.850> release

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
once this has changed i can then release

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.800 
once this has changed i can then release

that's done you can click on new

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.170 
that's done you can click on new
instance<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.149> then<00:02:03.149> we'll<00:02:03.270> rename<00:02:03.600> this

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
instance and then we'll rename this

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.530 
instance and then we'll rename this

anywhere if you're watching this in the
future<00:02:17.980> there<00:02:18.310> might<00:02:18.400> be<00:02:18.430> another<00:02:18.730> one<00:02:18.880> but

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
future there might be another one but

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.260 
future there might be another one but
the<00:02:19.950> first<00:02:20.950> version<00:02:21.190> out<00:02:21.490> there<00:02:21.820> will<00:02:22.000> be<00:02:22.120> one

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
the first version out there will be one

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.470 
the first version out there will be one
point<00:02:22.510> they're<00:02:22.690> ours<00:02:22.960> thereupon<00:02:23.230> one<00:02:24.480> install

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
point they're ours thereupon one install

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.930 
point they're ours thereupon one install
now<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.290> will<00:02:26.650> notice<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.040> all<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.370> them<00:02:27.760> are

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
now you will notice that all of them are

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.630 
now you will notice that all of them are
required<00:02:28.840> apart<00:02:29.440> from<00:02:29.500> optifine<00:02:30.040> that<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.520> an

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
required apart from optifine that is an

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.070 
required apart from optifine that is an
optional<00:02:30.970> mod<00:02:31.440> but<00:02:32.440> I've<00:02:32.620> chosen<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:34.080> to

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
optional mod but I've chosen to to

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.600 
optional mod but I've chosen to to
install<00:02:35.440> Optifine<00:02:36.010> because<00:02:36.400> it's<00:02:36.490> much

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
install Optifine because it's much

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.040 
install Optifine because it's much
easier<00:02:36.640> when<00:02:37.060> I'm<00:02:37.180> regarding<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.750> be<00:02:37.840> quite

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
easier when I'm regarding to be quite

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.230 
easier when I'm regarding to be quite
honest<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:39.160> one<00:02:39.490> thing<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.730> people<00:02:40.060> will

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
honest the one thing that people will

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.570 
honest the one thing that people will
notice<00:02:40.630> as<00:02:40.840> well<00:02:41.080> with<00:02:41.290> this<00:02:41.500> there<00:02:42.040> isn't<00:02:42.459> a

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
notice as well with this there isn't a

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.120 
notice as well with this there isn't a

fax texture pack for this yet and there

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.970 
fax texture pack for this yet and there
isn't<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:46.000> shaders<00:02:46.480> mod<00:02:46.680> purely<00:02:47.680> for<00:02:47.950> the

isn't the shaders mod purely for the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.590 
isn't the shaders mod purely for the
fact<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.370> not<00:02:48.640> everybody<00:02:49.060> has<00:02:49.270> could<00:02:49.510> the

fact that not everybody has could the

stuff that the shared is mod abs in I in
the<00:02:55.510> future<00:02:55.870> i<00:02:55.990> will<00:02:56.020> add<00:02:56.380> in<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:56.860> in<00:02:57.070> as<00:02:57.340> an

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
the future i will add in that in as an

the future i will add in that in as an
optional<00:02:57.790> mod<00:02:58.030> but<00:02:58.240> for<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.480> moment<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:59.140> pack

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
optional mod but for the moment the pack

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.530 
optional mod but for the moment the pack
is<00:02:59.560> just<00:02:59.980> as<00:03:00.130> is<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:02.080> let's<00:03:02.340> install<00:03:03.540> now

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
is just as is so let's install now

you you what your computer's like but it

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.010 
you you what your computer's like but it
should<00:05:38.860> take<00:05:39.100> roughly<00:05:39.430> around<00:05:39.630> two<00:05:40.630> to<00:05:40.810> three

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020

like really really old in which case it
might<00:05:48.190> take<00:05:48.430> a<00:05:48.460> little<00:05:48.580> bit<00:05:48.760> longer<00:05:49.260> but<00:05:50.260> all

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
might take a little bit longer but all

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.860 
might take a little bit longer but all
in<00:05:50.590> all<00:05:50.680> it<00:05:51.160> shouldn't<00:05:51.550> take<00:05:51.610> that<00:05:52.419> much<00:05:52.480> time

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870

in all honest and you can see what's
