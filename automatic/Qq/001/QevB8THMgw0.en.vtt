00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
 all the parties that with what this day 

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.200
 the concello is satisfied with its motherboard 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.109
 Suarez 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.109
 and a bra 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.060
 for the outside 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.769
 in this step 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.839
 the only thing that interests us 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.710
 helsinki ficar which the power cable 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.619
 land 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:25.810
 the harness 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.810
 to be able to give solution to the outside 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.539
 a part of the battery 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.510
 we are going to place a current cable that reaches where the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.650
 estuaries that mestalla 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.650
 this time it's the front of the vehicle 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.520
 this cable is the one that will get to feed 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.130
 abroad if we realize 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.470
 the wire 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.200
 be connected 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.500
 to the positive part of the alak battery in another stream 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.610
 that glass cable that comes from the battery 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.150
 apart 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.500
 back of the vehicle which the service 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.500
 we're going to have to connect to the harness 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.380
 to give me 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.380
 energy abroad 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.030
 once inside the motherboard you have to ensure it 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.010
 through 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.190
 these little edges 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.670
 which we are going to see 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.780
 when pushing them inwardly frightening 1 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.570
 and can not leave 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.820
 once the motherboard is secured 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.080
 the next step is 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.290
 introduce on the outside 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.390
 in a vertical way 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.390
 why not have any problem 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.100
 we go outside 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.090
 and from behind we are not going to secure 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.810
 by a plate 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.689
 the outside 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:10.379
 we will win 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.589
 to install the harness 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:16.589
 in this way 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.399
 we separated the three wires that we have started 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:28.799
 at the beginning 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.010
 the red the yellow and the black tight to the volvo red repeat is ground 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.249
 esteva commented any part of the chassis in this case I will not comment 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:38.139
 here 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:41.139
 just where the plate that holds listeria goes 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.319
 the red wire and the yellow wire must be connected 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:53.009
 to be able to 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:55.579
 ravasi stream the outside 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.919
 the next step 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.679
 connect 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:03.699
 what the power cord does 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:05.089
 and what it is 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.939
 the squid and the red wire to see kevin harness from outside 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.079
 connect them to each other 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.209
 to 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.209
 give energy to the outside 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.669
 since we finished with this energy 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.649
 the exclusion of the earth 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:27.169
 we go to Brazil 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.629
 townsend the outside 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.629
 for anything 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.659
 already cataloged or external connected torrent 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.659
 the motorcycle race 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.139
 and that's how we install the exterior 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.509
 already in the next step 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:52.279
 let's wait, explaining how we connect the front speakers
