they're<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.320> stats<00:00:25.619> here<00:00:25.920> are<00:00:26.449> pretty<00:00:27.449> tricky

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
they're the stats here are pretty tricky

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.140 
they're the stats here are pretty tricky
to<00:00:28.260> use<00:00:28.470> now<00:00:28.740> now<00:00:29.220> we<00:00:29.279> can<00:00:29.519> come<00:00:29.699> up<00:00:29.820> with<00:00:29.849> some

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
to use now now we can come up with some

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.550 
to use now now we can come up with some
sets<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.630> just<00:00:30.810> good<00:00:30.929> not<00:00:31.050> going<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.320> be<00:00:31.439> as

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
sets it's just good not going to be as

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.110 
sets it's just good not going to be as
optimized<00:00:32.070> as<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.550> could<00:00:32.700> be<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:32.969> other

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
optimized as it could be on other

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.299 
optimized as it could be on other
Pokemon<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.690> just<00:00:33.870> keep<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.260> mind<00:00:34.440> as<00:00:34.920> we

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
Pokemon so just keep that in mind as we

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.560 
Pokemon so just keep that in mind as we
go<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.670> look<00:00:35.790> at<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> other<00:00:36.180> things<00:00:36.420> like

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
go and look at the other things like

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.690 
go and look at the other things like
it's<00:00:36.719> rock<00:00:36.899> water<00:00:37.140> typing<00:00:37.680> four<00:00:38.219> times<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.610> can

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
it's rock water typing four times we can

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.369 
it's rock water typing four times we can
use<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.910> grass<00:00:39.090> 2<00:00:39.390> times<00:00:39.600> weakness<00:00:39.930> 2<00:00:40.020> electric

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
use to grass 2 times weakness 2 electric

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.900 
use to grass 2 times weakness 2 electric
2<00:00:40.649> times<00:00:40.860> weakness<00:00:41.160> grounding<00:00:41.520> 2<00:00:41.700> times

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
2 times weakness grounding 2 times

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.060 
2 times weakness grounding 2 times
weakness<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> fighting<00:00:42.750> water<00:00:43.620> ground<00:00:43.890> is

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
weakness to fighting water ground is

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.319 
weakness to fighting water ground is
such<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> better<00:00:44.550> typing<00:00:44.940> because<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.180> only

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
such a better typing because you only

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.760 
such a better typing because you only
have<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.629> worry<00:00:45.750> about<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.050> grass<00:00:46.320> weakness

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
have to worry about that grass weakness

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.920 
have to worry about that grass weakness
and<00:00:46.980> then<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.760> know<00:00:47.879> you're<00:00:48.030> still<00:00:48.210> very<00:00:48.690> weak

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
and then you know you're still very weak

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.299 
and then you know you're still very weak
against<00:00:49.230> electric<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.770> ground<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.010> fighting

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
against electric and ground and fighting

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.950 
against electric and ground and fighting
that's<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.670> kind<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.300> very<00:00:51.480> tough<00:00:51.690> with<00:00:51.870> that

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
that's just kind of very tough with that

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.600 
that's just kind of very tough with that
rock<00:00:52.170> water<00:00:52.379> typing<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.010> then<00:00:53.460> your

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
rock water typing and then your

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.250 
rock water typing and then your
resistances<00:00:54.180> at<00:00:54.629> least<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.989> decent

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260

Pokemon<00:01:03.989> showdown<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.470> was<00:01:04.710> thinking<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
Pokemon showdown I was thinking that the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.450 
Pokemon showdown I was thinking that the
first<00:01:05.820> idea<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.330> corsola<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.049> as<00:01:07.380> a

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
first idea for corsola is as a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.679 
first idea for corsola is as a
regenerator<00:01:08.460> physical<00:01:09.090> wall<00:01:09.330> kind<00:01:09.540> of

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
regenerator physical wall kind of

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.210 
regenerator physical wall kind of
Pokemon<00:01:10.049> bring<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.860> in

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
Pokemon bring it in

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.590 
Pokemon bring it in
stealth<00:01:11.640> rocks<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.150> something<00:01:12.479> isn't

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
stealth rocks if something isn't

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.499 
stealth rocks if something isn't
physical<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.799> leave<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.430> if<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.030> can

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
physical just just leave that if you can

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.910 
physical just just leave that if you can
like<00:01:15.630> at<00:01:15.750> least<00:01:15.840> tank<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.259> some<00:01:16.409> physical<00:01:16.740> hits

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
like at least tank up some physical hits

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.469 
like at least tank up some physical hits
with<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.220> take<00:01:17.700> too<00:01:17.820> much<00:01:17.939> damage<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.360> can

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
with this take too much damage you can

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.760 
with this take too much damage you can
switch<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.900> regenerator<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.560> going<00:01:19.710> to
