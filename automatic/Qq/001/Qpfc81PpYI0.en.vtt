tough battle then Bucky they've got a

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.150 
tough battle then Bucky they've got a
bunch<00:00:07.319> of<00:00:07.440> four<00:00:07.680> words<00:00:07.830> that<00:00:07.859> have<00:00:08.010> been

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
bunch of four words that have been

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.310 
bunch of four words that have been
together<00:00:08.280> for<00:00:08.790> four<00:00:09.540> sort<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.870> three<00:00:10.080> seasons

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
together for four sort of three seasons

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.070 
together for four sort of three seasons
now<00:00:10.590> it's<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.070> same<00:00:11.280> old<00:00:11.400> faces<00:00:11.670> but<00:00:12.630> actually

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
now it's the same old faces but actually

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.200 
now it's the same old faces but actually
having<00:00:13.830> studied<00:00:14.009> them<00:00:14.219> on<00:00:14.309> video<00:00:14.460> there<00:00:15.120> are

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
having studied them on video there are

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.580 
having studied them on video there are
lots<00:00:15.269> height<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.870> things<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.230> they<00:00:16.350> do

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
lots height and the things that they do

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.120 
lots height and the things that they do
so<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.279> expected<00:00:17.820> them<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.000> be<00:00:19.100> far<00:00:20.100> more

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
so I expected them to be far more

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.370 
so I expected them to be far more
organized<00:00:20.880> up<00:00:21.119> friend<00:00:21.449> but<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.050> put<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> bit<00:00:22.350> of

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
organized up friend but to put a bit of

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.960 
organized up friend but to put a bit of
whip<00:00:22.619> from<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.980> ball<00:00:23.160> as<00:00:23.340> well<00:00:23.369> they<00:00:23.699> got<00:00:23.820> some

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
whip from the ball as well they got some

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.170 
whip from the ball as well they got some
very<00:00:24.090> dangerous<00:00:24.330> both<00:00:25.699> they<00:00:26.699> didn't<00:00:26.939> use

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
very dangerous both they didn't use

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.089 
very dangerous both they didn't use
their<00:00:27.420> backs<00:00:27.630> as<00:00:27.900> much<00:00:28.170> as<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.410> expected<00:00:28.680> a

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
their backs as much as I expected a

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.980 
their backs as much as I expected a
largely<00:00:29.640> probably<00:00:30.119> due<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> conditions

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
largely probably due to the conditions

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.959 
largely probably due to the conditions
but<00:00:31.470> their<00:00:31.650> forwards<00:00:32.099> certainly<00:00:32.820> we're

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
but their forwards certainly we're

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.340 
but their forwards certainly we're
exactly<00:00:33.210> what<00:00:33.420> he<00:00:33.510> expected<00:00:34.020> they<00:00:34.290> were

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
exactly what he expected they were

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.370 
exactly what he expected they were
disciplined<00:00:35.300> and<00:00:36.300> they<00:00:36.450> were<00:00:36.510> also<00:00:36.930> very<00:00:37.110> very

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
disciplined and they were also very very

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.680 
disciplined and they were also very very
organized<00:00:37.890> at<00:00:38.129> both<00:00:38.280> more<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.270> set-piece

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
organized at both more and a set-piece

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.750 
organized at both more and a set-piece

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
first off and these speed of services

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.310 
first off and these speed of services
that<00:00:58.710> much<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> little<00:00:59.309> bit<00:00:59.460> better<00:01:00.079> mark<00:01:01.079> space

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
that much a little bit better mark space

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.310 
that much a little bit better mark space
out<00:01:01.500> wide<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.829> also<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> big<00:01:02.879> threat<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.510> did

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
out wide is also a big threat so did

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.600 
out wide is also a big threat so did
that<00:01:04.350> position<00:01:04.799> will<00:01:04.890> change<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.220> would<00:01:05.430> it
