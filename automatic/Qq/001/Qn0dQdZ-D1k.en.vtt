00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
things about this guy

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.020 
things about this guy
is<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.709> fact<00:04:19.920> that<00:04:20.010> because<00:04:20.370> Jonathas<00:04:20.850> is<00:04:21.000> a

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
is the fact that because Jonathas is a

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.270 
is the fact that because Jonathas is a
low<00:04:21.269> rated<00:04:21.690> player<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.200> he's<00:04:22.830> therefore

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
low rated player and he's therefore

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.010 
low rated player and he's therefore
incapable<00:04:23.730> of<00:04:24.150> actually<00:04:24.330> dealing<00:04:24.690> with<00:04:24.990> a

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
incapable of actually dealing with a

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.080 
incapable of actually dealing with a
football<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:26.250> I<00:04:26.340> find<00:04:26.550> that<00:04:26.670> really<00:04:26.820> weird

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
football and I find that really weird

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.270 
football and I find that really weird
but<00:04:27.270> in<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.420> 42nd<00:04:28.050> minute<00:04:28.080> this<00:04:28.470> keppi<00:04:29.010> free

but in the 42nd minute this keppi free

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.740 
but in the 42nd minute this keppi free
kick<00:04:29.520> which<00:04:29.730> I<00:04:29.910> would<00:04:30.090> love<00:04:30.240> to<00:04:30.300> hit<00:04:30.540> a<00:04:30.570> free

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
kick which I would love to hit a free

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.090 
kick which I would love to hit a free
cake<00:04:31.020> like<00:04:31.230> that<00:04:31.260> where<00:04:31.590> it<00:04:31.680> comes<00:04:31.830> straight

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
cake like that where it comes straight

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.950 
cake like that where it comes straight
into<00:04:32.340> a<00:04:32.430> guy<00:04:32.580> in<00:04:32.730> a<00:04:32.790> free<00:04:32.970> position<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.930> shoot

championship in England but what I

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.580 
championship in England but what I
thought<00:05:48.450> happened<00:05:48.840> was<00:05:49.050> that<00:05:49.080> one<00:05:49.410> of<00:05:49.500> the

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
thought happened was that one of the

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.350 
thought happened was that one of the
teams<00:05:49.800> in<00:05:50.040> Syria<00:05:50.370> plays<00:05:50.760> against<00:05:51.030> one<00:05:51.180> of<00:05:51.210> the

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
teams in Syria plays against one of the

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.820 
teams in Syria plays against one of the
teams<00:05:51.390> in<00:05:51.690> Syria<00:05:51.960> be<00:05:52.110> in<00:05:52.260> the<00:05:52.350> winner's<00:05:52.530> sort

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
teams in Syria be in the winner's sort

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.250 
teams in Syria be in the winner's sort
of<00:05:52.950> either<00:05:53.550> maintains<00:05:54.150> or<00:05:54.419> earns<00:05:54.630> a<00:05:54.870> position

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
of either maintains or earns a position

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.680 
of either maintains or earns a position
in<00:05:55.380> Syria<00:05:55.680> but<00:05:56.430> I<00:05:56.640> don't<00:05:56.820> know<00:05:57.090> how<00:05:57.330> it<00:05:57.480> works

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
in Syria but I don't know how it works

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.530 
in Syria but I don't know how it works
and<00:05:58.050> in<00:05:58.470> the<00:05:58.770> game<00:05:59.010> the<00:05:59.520> only<00:05:59.880> spots<00:06:00.240> that<00:06:00.419> are

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 
and in the game the only spots that are

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.909 
and in the game the only spots that are
highlighted<00:06:00.840> in<00:06:01.080> the<00:06:01.169> league<00:06:01.350> at<00:06:01.620> the<00:06:01.680> top

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
highlighted in the league at the top

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.470 
highlighted in the league at the top
tree<00:06:02.190> which<00:06:02.370> makes<00:06:02.580> me<00:06:02.730> assume<00:06:03.030> that<00:06:03.210> it<00:06:03.300> must

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
tree which makes me assume that it must

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.240 
tree which makes me assume that it must
be<00:06:03.630> to<00:06:03.810> automatic<00:06:04.320> promotion<00:06:04.470> spots<00:06:05.010> and<00:06:05.190> a

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
be to automatic promotion spots and a

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.100 
be to automatic promotion spots and a
playoff<00:06:05.550> spot<00:06:05.700> but<00:06:06.450> how<00:06:06.570> does<00:06:06.630> the<00:06:06.750> playoff

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
playoff spot but how does the playoff

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.460 
playoff spot but how does the playoff
work<00:06:07.320> is<00:06:07.530> it<00:06:07.710> all<00:06:07.860> the<00:06:08.040> teams<00:06:08.250> is<00:06:08.640> it<00:06:08.910> like<00:06:09.210> the

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
work is it all the teams is it like the

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.960 
work is it all the teams is it like the
four<00:06:10.470> who<00:06:10.740> don't<00:06:11.130> get<00:06:11.490> automatic

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
four who don't get automatic

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.370 
four who don't get automatic
qualification<00:06:12.330> today<00:06:12.810> I'll<00:06:12.930> play<00:06:13.110> against

qualification today I'll play against

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.810

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
each other or what happens what the

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
happens in Syria be as someone leave a

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.200 
happens in Syria be as someone leave a
comment<00:06:17.340> and<00:06:17.490> tell<00:06:17.550> me<00:06:17.700> that<00:06:17.940> would<00:06:18.090> be<00:06:18.120> great

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
comment and tell me that would be great

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.340 
comment and tell me that would be great
because<00:06:18.540> if<00:06:18.750> we're<00:06:18.900> not<00:06:18.990> going<00:06:19.140> to<00:06:19.230> finish

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
because if we're not going to finish

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.470 
because if we're not going to finish
third<00:06:19.650> and<00:06:19.919> then<00:06:20.669> this<00:06:20.880> has<00:06:21.000> been<00:06:21.150> just<00:06:21.330> an

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
third and then this has been just an

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.270 
third and then this has been just an
absolutely<00:06:21.870> disastrous<00:06:22.320> season<00:06:22.800> overall

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
absolutely disastrous season overall

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.880 
absolutely disastrous season overall
really<00:06:23.730> and<00:06:23.970> when<00:06:24.419> this<00:06:24.600> season<00:06:24.990> is<00:06:25.110> over<00:06:25.290> I'll

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
really and when this season is over I'll

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.350 
really and when this season is over I'll
probably<00:06:26.100> do<00:06:26.310> a<00:06:26.340> new<00:06:26.520> career<00:06:26.790> mode<00:06:27.000> with<00:06:27.210> a<00:06:27.240> new

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
probably do a new career mode with a new

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.670 
probably do a new career mode with a new
team<00:06:27.600> because<00:06:27.870> it's<00:06:28.050> not<00:06:28.110> even<00:06:28.380> going<00:06:28.530> to<00:06:28.590> be

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
team because it's not even going to be

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.830 
team because it's not even going to be
that<00:06:28.800> many<00:06:29.010> episodes<00:06:29.310> left<00:06:29.610> and<00:06:29.970> maybe<00:06:30.180> three

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
that many episodes left and maybe three

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.480 
that many episodes left and maybe three
episodes<00:06:31.229> left<00:06:31.470> in<00:06:31.680> this<00:06:31.800> whole<00:06:31.979> series<00:06:32.220> which

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
episodes left in this whole series which

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.230 
episodes left in this whole series which
hopefully<00:06:32.729> I<00:06:32.880> can

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
hopefully I can

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.480 
hopefully I can

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
players who could have enough potential

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.279 
players who could have enough potential
to<00:06:55.319> play<00:06:55.470> in<00:06:55.530> Syria<00:06:55.919> but<00:06:56.580> um<00:06:56.819> yeah<00:06:57.780> that's<00:06:58.020> it

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.289 
to play in Syria but um yeah that's it

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:00.140 
to play in Syria but um yeah that's it
that's<00:06:58.410> been<00:06:58.650> this<00:06:58.800> episode<00:06:59.190> the<00:06:59.759> last<00:06:59.970> one

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.150 
that's been this episode the last one

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.370 
that's been this episode the last one
was<00:07:00.180> called<00:07:00.419> the<00:07:00.569> worst<00:07:00.720> episode<00:07:01.139> ever<00:07:01.169> I

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
was called the worst episode ever I

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.749 
was called the worst episode ever I
think<00:07:01.620> this<00:07:01.740> one<00:07:01.889> might<00:07:02.009> be<00:07:02.069> the<00:07:02.280> second<00:07:02.639> worst

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 
think this one might be the second worst

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:05.420 
think this one might be the second worst
episode<00:07:03.270> ever<00:07:03.300> losing<00:07:03.900> both<00:07:04.080> games<00:07:04.110> and<00:07:04.620> if<00:07:05.220> we

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.430 
episode ever losing both games and if we

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.860 
episode ever losing both games and if we
don't<00:07:05.550> return<00:07:05.729> to<00:07:05.880> winning<00:07:06.150> ways<00:07:06.240> we're<00:07:06.720> just

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:06.870 
don't return to winning ways we're just

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.210 
don't return to winning ways we're just
going<00:07:06.990> to<00:07:07.050> get<00:07:07.139> an<00:07:07.440> embarrassingly<00:07:08.130> bad

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
going to get an embarrassingly bad

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.680 
going to get an embarrassingly bad
league<00:07:08.610> position<00:07:08.819> and<00:07:09.240> there's<00:07:09.360> even<00:07:09.599> a

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.690
