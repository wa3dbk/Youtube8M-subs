bodies<00:04:11.900> still<00:04:12.139> resisting<00:04:12.680> him<00:04:12.829> because<00:04:13.129> the

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
bodies still resisting him because the

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.729 
bodies still resisting him because the
left<00:04:13.579> side<00:04:13.849> doesn't<00:04:14.239> heal<00:04:14.629> as<00:04:14.840> fast<00:04:14.900> as<00:04:15.500> the

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
left side doesn't heal as fast as the

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.909 
left side doesn't heal as fast as the
right<00:04:15.980> side<00:04:16.340> and<00:04:16.579> that's<00:04:17.530> that's<00:04:18.530> going<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:18.859> be

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
right side and that's that's going to be

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.229 
right side and that's that's going to be
his<00:04:18.979> weakness<00:04:19.370> that<00:04:19.519> that<00:04:19.699> really<00:04:20.030> is

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
his weakness that that really is

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.969 
his weakness that that really is
probably<00:04:20.599> going<00:04:20.720> to<00:04:20.810> be<00:04:20.900> dio's<00:04:21.410> weakness<00:04:21.859> at

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
probably going to be dio's weakness at

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.250 
probably going to be dio's weakness at
the<00:04:22.070> end<00:04:22.219> of<00:04:22.490> this<00:04:22.820> season<00:04:23.000> it's<00:04:23.510> very<00:04:23.750> obvious

cos defeat because the left side doesn't
hill<00:04:29.550> as<00:04:29.730> fast<00:04:29.790> and<00:04:30.390> you<00:04:30.510> saw<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:30.780> was

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
hill as fast and you saw it was

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.050 
hill as fast and you saw it was
incredibly<00:04:31.440> slowly<00:04:31.710> man<00:04:32.070> was<00:04:32.190> healing<00:04:32.400> but<00:04:32.940> it

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
incredibly slowly man was healing but it

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.700 
incredibly slowly man was healing but it
was<00:04:33.150> incredibly<00:04:33.510> slow<00:04:33.780> like<00:04:34.200> let's<00:04:34.410> save<00:04:34.590> this

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
was incredibly slow like let's save this

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.800 
was incredibly slow like let's save this
wound<00:04:34.980> I<00:04:35.250> like<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.270> by<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.450> wound<00:04:36.660> on<00:04:36.780> my

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
wound I like it by the wound on my

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.450 
wound I like it by the wound on my
finger<00:04:37.140> okay<00:04:37.320> it<00:04:37.770> would<00:04:37.890> take<00:04:38.070> like<00:04:38.220> five

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
finger okay it would take like five

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.190 
finger okay it would take like five
seconds<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:39.000> hill<00:04:39.150> on<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.390> right<00:04:39.420> side<00:04:39.810> but

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
seconds to hill on the right side but

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.960 
seconds to hill on the right side but
the<00:04:40.290> wound<00:04:40.470> on<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:40.860> left<00:04:41.010> side<00:04:41.400> takes<00:04:41.730> about

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
the wound on the left side takes about

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.270 
the wound on the left side takes about
maybe<00:04:42.240> 20<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.900> 30<00:04:43.140> seconds<00:04:43.590> so<00:04:43.770> yeah<00:04:44.010> there's

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
maybe 20 to 30 seconds so yeah there's

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.710 
maybe 20 to 30 seconds so yeah there's
an<00:04:44.370> incredible<00:04:44.730> time<00:04:44.910> gap<00:04:45.240> difference

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
an incredible time gap difference

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.480 
an incredible time gap difference
between<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.260> healing<00:04:46.530> rates<00:04:46.740> of<00:04:46.950> both<00:04:47.250> sides

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
between the healing rates of both sides

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.180 
between the healing rates of both sides
of<00:04:47.730> Dios<00:04:48.030> body<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:48.990> I<00:04:49.260> wonder<00:04:49.800> if<00:04:49.890> he's<00:04:50.040> going

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
of Dios body so I wonder if he's going

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.070 
of Dios body so I wonder if he's going
to<00:04:50.250> overcome<00:04:50.610> this<00:04:51.090> before<00:04:51.510> we<00:04:51.690> get<00:04:51.780> to<00:04:51.930> see

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
to overcome this before we get to see

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.190 
to overcome this before we get to see
Jotaro<00:04:52.620> go<00:04:52.980> up<00:04:53.220> against<00:04:53.760> him<00:04:53.910> but<00:04:54.540> anyways

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
Jotaro go up against him but anyways

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.810 
Jotaro go up against him but anyways
