00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.868
I make a mistake and the world ends

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.037
The street of constant green lights

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:38.772
It flies, then stops again

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:40.106
then looks like it will fly again

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:42.042
Hearts connect

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:43.643
The fantasy that the ancients fell in love with

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:45.712
Was it correct?

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:47.580
A romance that's like a delusion

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:51.317
Ah, will you dance in the dream?

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:54.721
The light of the moon wraps itself around me

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:58.758
The reverberating sound swallows my body whole

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:02.462
Until I no longer feel afraid of anything

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:06.232
Now inside the radiance, my heart is being aimed at

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:09.836
The spinning, spinning world is--

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:26.553
I try to consider it, then stop thinking

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.621
The red street light is my aim

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:32.058
I want to escape, to slip away, and it looks like I will escape soon

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:34.094
Open it, and next

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.662
is skype with an alien

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:37.730
Select the delusion

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.065
A romance that's like electromagnetic waves

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.036
Ah, do you sleep at night?

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:46.372
The glow of the moon envelopes me

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:50.510
The reverberating sound leads my body astray again

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.314
Until I completely forget the things I struggled against

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:57.951
Right now, my heart is being aimed at

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:01.721
The ever-approaching future is

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.046
Ah, will you dance inside the dream?

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:30.750
The voice of tomorrow beckons to me

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:34.721
And all my hate is painted over

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:38.458
So much that I won't give up the things I've already stopped

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:42.395
Right now, my heart is being aimed at

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:46.199
From this spinning, spinning world

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:49.536
I can see it, I can see it, the future

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:55.375
La la la~!

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.346
La la la~!
