 your information

 and black white 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.930
 more than input and output device 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.720
 has a defendant 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.940
 here below has a micro hdmi access 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.940
 to connect it as it is right now with 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.860
 the television has the audio this is a 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.190
 owner's connector again for 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.950
 the charger and it comes with the machine this 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.600
 cable that is the usb connector for 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.880
 connect the long meters 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.190
 on the side we're going to have the microphone 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.810
 we have the on and off volume 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.750
 by hardware so that you do not have to 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.550
 get into venus or anything to change the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.410
 volume has this other button that is 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.500
 very interesting that is the blocker of 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.200
 the screen what allows me that is that 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.210
 If I turn it over or move it, it's not going to 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.460
 change the address and this is very useful 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.710
 when you are not reading books or watching 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:48.330
 a movie that the screen does not start 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:52.950
 to turn from side to side very well and 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.320
 sorry access to the micro sd for access 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.540
 to have more space later 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.670
 comes the version with 3g we are 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.100
 working on that we want to see if the 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.170
 we can launch yet we do not have dates 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.460

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.460
