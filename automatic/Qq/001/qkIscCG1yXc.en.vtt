00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
right now I think our government knows a

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
reasons they may want to have a

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.090 
reasons they may want to have a
diversion<00:02:18.670> down<00:02:19.360> in<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.810> South<00:02:20.080> Indian<00:02:20.650> Ocean

diversion down in the South Indian Ocean

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.850 
diversion down in the South Indian Ocean

I think there are other things that the
US<00:02:24.130> government<00:02:24.580> is
