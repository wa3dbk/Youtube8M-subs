00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.020
 I bring a pretty short tutorial but 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.970
 it's so very interesting and it's that I'm going 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.400
 to show how to get the 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.670
 vivillo with pokemon motive this video 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.080
 they will be able to achieve it thanks to 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.210
 little bit in fact I think that today 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.270
 a center opened because bolt I say a 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.430
 pokémon center in the US which makes 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.500
 on the occasion of this I brought in an event 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.210
 for all the people of america with 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.470
 this video so all the people 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.449
 that are from america 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.340
 if I'm not mistaken only the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.829
 of america are going to be able to get this 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.480
 billion on the occasion of pokemon and good and 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.280
 I'm going to show you more or less how the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.750
 thing is quite simple but here are the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.340
 I'm bringing you to check it 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.110
 first of all they have to be 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.719
 connected to the internet obviously have 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.940
 have to have your pokemon xo cartridge in 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.590
 its defect the and we are going to enter 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.180
 can directly make me 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.000
 I update the console but it gives me 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.559
 lazy we enter directly here not 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.809
 we have to do not enough 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.489
 things we simply enter our 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.710
 console as if we were to start the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.300
 play normally and then you can see 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.920
 that we are here on the screen 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.450
 home where you give us to continue 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.579
 our adventure 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.439
 mysterious gift or for tournaments in 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:13.110
 direct we will give you in the option that says 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.119
 mysterious gift this option will open us 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.520
 this little tab that says receive 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.710
 gift see album or cards 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.259
 information and going out we will give you where 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.479
 says receive gift says is going to start 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.310
 wireless communication obviously for 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.110
 this has to have wifi 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.509
 we give it to you and we want to receive it 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.280
 on the internet and will ask us if we 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.280
 we want to connect to the internet to which 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.719
 we answer that if he will connect and now 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.630
 we will simply have to wait for a 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:42.060
 momentarily waiting for it to be 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.740
 load and carry us the vivillo that you 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.200
 we are waiting like this is a way 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.729
 pretty simple to receive the trillion with 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.920
 why bolt I think all the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.409
 people who are from america are going to be able 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.689
 get this one trillion that I think that 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.280
 nothing was given to us in France so 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.679
 all the people who do not have it and what 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.869
 want this is a very easy reason to 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.520
 get it to have it and now and 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.099
 that can boast their lived in pokémon 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.319
 and that is not going to be cloned, much less 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:09.569
 is going to be original given by nintendo already 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.800
 will give us here a live on the occasion of 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.310
 Pokemon 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.720
 you've already gathered all the Libyans and you've already 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.880
 gathered all live all the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.160
 reasons to live here you have a special 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.090
 that can not be found in the game 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.150
 so you can add it 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.460
 to your pokédex and complete your collection 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.870
 we will give that if we want to accept it already 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.970
 here you can see that it will be loading 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.820
 that's how you can see that here is already 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.770
 appearing our vivillo a little goal 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.780
 we will give you now you can simply 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.460

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.660
 we will finish now we will leave 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.660
 then we will enter normal to the 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.910
 adventure as if it were voice enters the 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.400
 simple and simple game here we go back to 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.720

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.060

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.610
 once the adventure continues we are going to 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.530
 go here they have to bring a space knew 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.240
 that flew obviously can see that 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.160
 I want you to attract me I saw billion fantasy 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.010
 which we were also given here by 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.720
 event and now what I'm going to do is very 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.850
 simple you can simply see that here 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.340
 is this young woman who usually 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.900
 is not going to talk to her and we 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.319

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.299

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.920
 billions until the next now we are going to 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:27.219
 can see that we already have our 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.099
 billion pokemon and obviously it came out 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:31.930
 that came out, it came out meek good attack 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:35.139

 if they want me to save my perfect video 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:43.380
 the only thing he has to be doing is 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.230
 save at this point 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.880

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.620

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.510
 console several times until it comes out 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.280
