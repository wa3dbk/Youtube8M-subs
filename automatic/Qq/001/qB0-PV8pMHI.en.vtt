00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
miss them every day even then it might

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.270 
miss them every day even then it might
not<00:02:02.039> be<00:02:02.280> humid<00:02:02.520> enough<00:02:03.649> but<00:02:04.649> yeah<00:02:04.770> they<00:02:04.979> come

often see them in hanging glass bowls or
you<00:02:09.329> can<00:02:09.479> glue<00:02:09.630> them<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:10.019> driftwood<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.500> can

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
you can glue them on driftwood you can

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.680 
you can glue them on driftwood you can
do<00:02:10.829> anything<00:02:11.069> with<00:02:11.280> them<00:02:11.450> basically<00:02:12.450> all<00:02:12.630> you

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.250 
have to do is every couple days to every
week<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:15.000> just<00:02:15.209> dunk<00:02:15.630> them<00:02:15.810> in<00:02:15.900> some<00:02:16.079> water

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
week you just dunk them in some water

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.140 
week you just dunk them in some water
preferably<00:02:17.040> fish<00:02:17.370> water<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:17.819> they<00:02:17.910> get<00:02:18.000> their

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
preferably fish water so they get their

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.610 
preferably fish water so they get their
nutrients<00:02:18.510> or<00:02:18.630> fertilizer<00:02:19.049> water<00:02:19.319> if<00:02:19.530> you

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
nutrients or fertilizer water if you

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.130 
nutrients or fertilizer water if you
prefer<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.370> they<00:02:21.329> just<00:02:21.510> grow<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.049> they

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
prefer that and they just grow and they

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.509 
prefer that and they just grow and they
just<00:02:22.319> hang<00:02:22.620> from<00:02:22.980> places<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.670> yeah<00:02:24.630> they<00:02:24.900> have

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
just hang from places and yeah they have

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.069 
just hang from places and yeah they have
basically<00:02:26.519> instead<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:26.970> roots<00:02:27.239> they<00:02:27.480> have<00:02:27.660> see

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
basically instead of roots they have see

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.869 
basically instead of roots they have see
how<00:02:28.170> it's<00:02:28.319> kind<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.560> white<00:02:28.709> here<00:02:28.920> when<00:02:29.579> you<00:02:29.670> wet

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
how it's kind of white here when you wet

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.910 
how it's kind of white here when you wet
them<00:02:30.030> they<00:02:30.209> turn<00:02:30.420> green<00:02:30.690> instantly<00:02:31.379> that's

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
them they turn green instantly that's

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.680 
them they turn green instantly that's
because<00:02:32.190> theses<00:02:32.579> are<00:02:32.760> little<00:02:33.060> hair<00:02:33.299> like

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
because theses are little hair like

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.930 
because theses are little hair like
things<00:02:34.019> on<00:02:34.350> their<00:02:34.590> roots<00:02:34.829> I<00:02:35.160> don't<00:02:35.760> know<00:02:35.819> the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
things on their roots I don't know the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.009 
things on their roots I don't know the
name<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.120> them<00:02:36.359> at<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.569> moment<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.959> think

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
name of them at the moment I think

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.840 
name of them at the moment I think
they're<00:02:37.230> called<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.530> lemon<00:02:37.799> or<00:02:38.579> something

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
they're called the lemon or something

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.599 
they're called the lemon or something
similar<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.359> it<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.470> grabs<00:02:40.889> water<00:02:41.280> and

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
similar and it just grabs water and

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.090 
similar and it just grabs water and
that's<00:02:42.389> how<00:02:42.540> they<00:02:42.780> collect<00:02:43.590> their<00:02:43.739> water<00:02:43.920> is

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
that's how they collect their water is

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.800 
that's how they collect their water is
through<00:02:44.370> their<00:02:44.519> entire<00:02:44.819> although<00:02:45.600> leaf

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
through their entire although leaf

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.740 
through their entire although leaf
structure<00:02:46.170> instead<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.769> just<00:02:46.920> from<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.160> roots

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
structure instead of just from the roots

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.740 
structure instead of just from the roots
so<00:02:48.750> if<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.900> didn't<00:02:49.079> really<00:02:49.260> interesting<00:02:49.709> I

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
so if I didn't really interesting I

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.150 
so if I didn't really interesting I
really<00:02:51.750> love<00:02:52.079> them<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.380> I'm<00:02:52.500> really<00:02:52.799> happy<00:02:53.040> to
