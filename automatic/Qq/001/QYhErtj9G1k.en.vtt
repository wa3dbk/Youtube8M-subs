00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
reason for that is because this guy is

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.960 
reason for that is because this guy is
the<00:01:26.759> only<00:01:27.090> guy<00:01:27.420> known<00:01:28.409> thus<00:01:28.950> far<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.820> have

the only guy known thus far to have
survived<00:01:30.420> on<00:01:30.689> being<00:01:31.350> bitten<00:01:31.680> by<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> zombie

survived on being bitten by a zombie

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.870 
survived on being bitten by a zombie
he's<00:01:32.970> got<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.509> really<00:01:34.259> nerdy<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:35.220> by<00:01:35.549> right

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
he's got this really nerdy on by right

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.450 
he's got this really nerdy on by right
here<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.390> his<00:01:36.540> stomach<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.200> I'm<00:01:38.100> sort<00:01:38.400> of

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
here on his stomach like I'm sort of

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.840 
here on his stomach like I'm sort of
stomach<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:40.259> looks<00:01:40.890> pretty<00:01:41.040> gruesome<00:01:41.400> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
stomach on it looks pretty gruesome and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.749 
stomach on it looks pretty gruesome and
basically<00:01:42.780> survived<00:01:43.259> i<00:01:43.500> guess<00:01:44.280> he<00:01:44.399> survived

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
basically survived i guess he survived

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.380 
basically survived i guess he survived
the<00:01:44.850> bleeding<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.899> infection<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.590> he's

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
the bleeding and the infection and he's

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.749 
the bleeding and the infection and he's
with<00:01:48.390> them<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.869> guess<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.530> basically<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.340> what<00:01:50.729> I

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
with them I guess and basically I what I

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.460 
with them I guess and basically I what I
assume<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.270> once<00:01:51.600> he<00:01:51.689> gets<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> California

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
assume is that once he gets a California

have<00:03:47.930> no<00:03:48.620> maybe<00:03:48.890> got<00:03:49.160> put<00:03:49.340> in<00:03:49.430> hand<00:03:49.850> or

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
have no maybe got put in hand or

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.420 
have no maybe got put in hand or
something<00:03:50.210> you<00:03:50.300> know<00:03:50.330> that<00:03:50.600> would<00:03:50.720> be<00:03:50.810> more

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
something you know that would be more

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.070 
something you know that would be more
never<00:03:52.430> been<00:03:52.670> explained<00:03:53.120> more<00:03:53.450> realistically

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
never been explained more realistically

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.540 
never been explained more realistically
no<00:03:54.290> just<00:03:54.470> cut<00:03:54.650> off<00:03:54.740> the<00:03:54.920> hand<00:03:55.100> or<00:03:55.250> whatever

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
no just cut off the hand or whatever

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.750 
no just cut off the hand or whatever
that<00:03:56.360> would<00:03:56.540> have<00:03:56.630> been<00:03:56.660> no<00:03:57.380> now<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.250> it's<00:03:58.400> not

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
that would have been no now and it's not

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.120 
that would have been no now and it's not
side<00:03:59.030> too<00:03:59.330> small<00:03:59.600> by<00:03:59.810> amoeba<00:04:00.410> were<00:04:00.650> small<00:04:00.950> bite

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
side too small by amoeba were small bite

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.250 
side too small by amoeba were small bite
then<00:04:01.310> I<00:04:01.400> guess<00:04:01.580> I'd<00:04:02.330> understand<00:04:02.870> as<00:04:02.960> to<00:04:02.990> why

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
then I guess I'd understand as to why

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.590 
then I guess I'd understand as to why
he's<00:04:03.560> not<00:04:03.920> dying<00:04:04.340> of<00:04:04.520> blood<00:04:04.760> loss<00:04:04.910> there's

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
he's not dying of blood loss there's

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.800 
he's not dying of blood loss there's
like<00:04:05.720> a<00:04:05.750> huge<00:04:06.050> fight<00:04:06.560> right<00:04:06.800> inside<00:04:07.310> of<00:04:07.340> this

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
like a huge fight right inside of this

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.080 
like a huge fight right inside of this
stomach<00:04:08.810> it's<00:04:09.110> pretty<00:04:09.950> break<00:04:10.190> its<00:04:10.400> principal

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
stomach it's pretty break its principal

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.650 
stomach it's pretty break its principal
is<00:04:11.990> mud<00:04:12.350> size<00:04:12.590> of<00:04:12.740> a<00:04:12.800> cheek<00:04:13.040> um<00:04:13.450> think<00:04:14.450> of<00:04:14.570> it

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
is mud size of a cheek um think of it

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.900 
is mud size of a cheek um think of it
like<00:04:14.870> that<00:04:15.320> just<00:04:15.830> torn<00:04:16.160> off<00:04:16.280> it's<00:04:16.549> basically

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
like that just torn off it's basically

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.000 
like that just torn off it's basically
that<00:04:17.150> big<00:04:17.359> maybe<00:04:18.109> twice<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.470> size<00:04:18.620> weight<00:04:18.919> and

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
that big maybe twice the size weight and

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.160 
that big maybe twice the size weight and
what<00:04:19.190> I<00:04:19.220> mean

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
what I mean

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.040 
what I mean
pretty<00:04:20.530> noticeable<00:04:20.830> sighs<00:04:21.700> bye<00:04:22.420> it's<00:04:22.750> pretty

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
pretty noticeable sighs bye it's pretty

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.590 
pretty noticeable sighs bye it's pretty
big<00:04:23.350> so<00:04:23.980> even<00:04:24.700> if<00:04:24.820> he<00:04:24.910> would<00:04:25.090> have<00:04:25.270> died<00:04:25.480> from

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
big so even if he would have died from

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.890 
big so even if he would have died from
an<00:04:25.720> infection<00:04:26.280> he<00:04:27.280> would<00:04:27.670> still<00:04:27.970> likely<00:04:28.540> died

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
an infection he would still likely died

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.400 
an infection he would still likely died
from<00:04:28.930> blood<00:04:29.290> loss<00:04:29.670> so<00:04:30.670> yeah<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.330> also<00:04:32.110> don't

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
from blood loss so yeah I also don't

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.710 
from blood loss so yeah I also don't
want<00:04:32.530> her<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:33.130> here's<00:04:33.700> also<00:04:34.030> my<00:04:34.180> problem<00:04:34.570> with

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
want her to here's also my problem with

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.870 
want her to here's also my problem with
the<00:04:34.870> series<00:04:35.230> do<00:04:35.890> you<00:04:36.370> have<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.550> pretty

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
the series do you have a pretty

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.820 
the series do you have a pretty
simplistic<00:04:37.090> plot<00:04:37.630> you<00:04:37.780> know<00:04:37.900> don't<00:04:38.560> get<00:04:38.740> the

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
simplistic plot you know don't get the

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.800 
simplistic plot you know don't get the
guy<00:04:38.980> to<00:04:39.040> a<00:04:39.670> certain<00:04:39.970> destination<00:04:40.090> so<00:04:40.570> he<00:04:40.660> could

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
guy to a certain destination so he could

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.800 
guy to a certain destination so he could
be<00:04:40.960> studied<00:04:41.920> on<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:42.400> that's<00:04:42.760> it<00:04:43.030> I<00:04:43.210> mean<00:04:43.750> I'm

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
be studied on and that's it I mean I'm

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.770 
be studied on and that's it I mean I'm
pretty<00:04:43.840> sure<00:04:44.200> that's<00:04:45.120> mean<00:04:46.120> I<00:04:46.450> mean<00:04:46.660> for

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
pretty sure that's mean I mean for

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.030 
pretty sure that's mean I mean for
example<00:04:46.810> that<00:04:47.260> compared<00:04:47.650> to<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.860> walking

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
example that compared to the walking

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.430 
example that compared to the walking
dead<00:04:48.370> where<00:04:48.700> there<00:04:48.910> I<00:04:49.060> mean<00:04:49.360> when<00:04:50.110> you<00:04:50.170> compare

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
dead where there I mean when you compare

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.340 
dead where there I mean when you compare
to<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:51.100> walking<00:04:51.280> dead<00:04:51.580> for<00:04:51.790> example<00:04:52.350> that

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
to the walking dead for example that

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.980 
to the walking dead for example that
that<00:04:53.620> one<00:04:53.740> really<00:04:54.040> has<00:04:54.220> no<00:04:54.610> definitive<00:04:55.150> ending

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
that one really has no definitive ending

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.320 
that one really has no definitive ending
when<00:04:56.200> you<00:04:56.290> think<00:04:56.470> about<00:04:56.530> it<00:04:56.710> about<00:04:57.490> it<00:04:57.700> cuz<00:04:58.090> you

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
when you think about it about it cuz you

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.850 
when you think about it about it cuz you
know<00:04:58.420> unless<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.840> comic<00:04:59.170> book<00:04:59.320> and<00:04:59.530> for

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
know unless the comic book and for

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.820 
know unless the comic book and for
whatever<00:05:00.040> reason<00:05:00.220> um<00:05:01.320> they<00:05:02.320> still<00:05:02.680> wouldn't

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
whatever reason um they still wouldn't

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.950 
whatever reason um they still wouldn't
have<00:05:02.920> that<00:05:03.190> much<00:05:03.370> of<00:05:03.490> a<00:05:03.550> different<00:05:03.960> definitive

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
have that much of a different definitive

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.070 
have that much of a different definitive
ending<00:05:05.500> me<00:05:05.650> think<00:05:05.920> about<00:05:06.010> it<00:05:06.220> but<00:05:07.180> no<00:05:07.810> and

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
ending me think about it but no and

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.470 
ending me think about it but no and
honestly<00:05:09.010> I've<00:05:09.340> many<00:05:09.640> years<00:05:09.790> to<00:05:09.910> go<00:05:10.090> but<00:05:10.300> still

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
honestly I've many years to go but still

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.850 
honestly I've many years to go but still
it<00:05:10.600> doesn't<00:05:10.810> seem<00:05:11.110> like<00:05:11.230> that<00:05:11.260> one<00:05:11.560> would<00:05:11.680> have

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
it doesn't seem like that one would have

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.710 
it doesn't seem like that one would have
a<00:05:11.890> definitive<00:05:12.250> ending<00:05:12.760> you<00:05:12.910> know<00:05:13.030> just<00:05:13.600> really

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
a definitive ending you know just really

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.990 
a definitive ending you know just really
survival<00:05:14.350> story<00:05:14.590> this<00:05:15.100> one<00:05:15.250> again<00:05:15.460> is<00:05:15.670> also

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
survival story this one again is also

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.280 
survival story this one again is also
survival<00:05:16.360> story<00:05:16.570> but<00:05:16.750> it<00:05:16.900> does<00:05:17.080> have<00:05:17.260> a

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
survival story but it does have a

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
survival story but it does have a
definitive<00:05:17.620> any<00:05:18.010> once<00:05:18.580> we<00:05:19.120> get<00:05:19.270> this<00:05:19.390> guy<00:05:19.510> to

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
definitive any once we get this guy to

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.720 
definitive any once we get this guy to
the<00:05:21.310> laboratory<00:05:22.320> he<00:05:23.320> basically<00:05:24.220> that's<00:05:24.490> the

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
the laboratory he basically that's the

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.150 
the laboratory he basically that's the
show's<00:05:24.940> done<00:05:25.360> you<00:05:25.600> know<00:05:25.750> show<00:05:26.440> a<00:05:26.470> bit<00:05:26.800> maybe

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
show's done you know show a bit maybe

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.670 
show's done you know show a bit maybe
one<00:05:27.460> or<00:05:27.580> two<00:05:27.610> episodes<00:05:28.120> or<00:05:28.440> shonsu<00:05:29.440> or

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
one or two episodes or shonsu or

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.870 
one or two episodes or shonsu or
whatever<00:05:29.980> of<00:05:30.280> the<00:05:30.760> aftermath<00:05:31.210> but<00:05:31.800> overall<00:05:32.880> it

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
whatever of the aftermath but overall it

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.150 
whatever of the aftermath but overall it
seems<00:05:33.910> like<00:05:34.330> it<00:05:34.480> has<00:05:34.660> it's<00:05:35.230> got<00:05:35.350> it<00:05:35.650> all<00:05:35.830> pans

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
seems like it has it's got it all pans

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.730 
seems like it has it's got it all pans
out<00:05:36.370> and<00:05:36.700> that's<00:05:37.210> kind<00:05:37.510> of<00:05:37.540> iffy<00:05:38.020> you<00:05:38.560> don't

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
out and that's kind of iffy you don't
