a little trap right resins yellow before
you<00:05:27.750> ran<00:05:28.750> into<00:05:28.780> this<00:05:29.260> this<00:05:30.010> kind<00:05:30.370> of<00:05:31.289> kind<00:05:32.289> of

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
trap though it was it was okay for white

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.260 
trap though it was it was okay for white
I<00:05:35.440> think<00:05:35.800> I<00:05:37.409> mean<00:05:38.409> I<00:05:38.740> don't<00:05:39.430> mind<00:05:39.610> my<00:05:39.789> position

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
I think I mean I don't mind my position

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.120 
I think I mean I don't mind my position
yet<00:05:40.419> it's<00:05:40.659> it's<00:05:41.110> really<00:05:41.380> those<00:05:41.530> are<00:05:41.590> very<00:05:41.889> weak

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
yet it's it's really those are very weak

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.290 
yet it's it's really those are very weak
but<00:05:42.460> um<00:05:43.180> why<00:05:44.050> it<00:05:44.110> is<00:05:44.320> still<00:05:44.909> reasonably<00:05:45.909> okay<00:05:46.270> I

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
but um why it is still reasonably okay I

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.439 
but um why it is still reasonably okay I
believe<00:05:47.009> maybe<00:05:48.009> Bishop<00:05:48.520> here<00:05:48.849> or<00:05:49.000> something

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
believe maybe Bishop here or something

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.550 
believe maybe Bishop here or something
Queen<00:05:50.169> print<00:05:50.710> here<00:05:50.949> it's<00:05:51.159> not<00:05:51.400> really<00:05:52.560> not

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
Queen print here it's not really not

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.770 
Queen print here it's not really not
really<00:05:53.620> anything<00:05:54.190> special<00:05:54.520> he<00:05:55.180> can<00:05:55.419> do<00:05:55.599> that

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
really anything special he can do that

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.760 
really anything special he can do that
but<00:05:56.110> it's<00:05:56.380> not<00:05:56.470> helping<00:05:57.190> him<00:05:57.550> so<00:05:57.820> much<00:05:58.770> maybe

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
but it's not helping him so much maybe

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.279 
but it's not helping him so much maybe
just<00:06:00.099> not<00:06:00.729> sufficient<00:06:01.449> page<00:06:01.599> free<00:06:01.930> could<00:06:02.139> be

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
just not sufficient page free could be

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:06.510 
just not sufficient page free could be
it<00:06:02.409> could<00:06:02.440> be<00:06:02.740> a<00:06:02.770> move<00:06:04.620> maybe<00:06:05.620> also<00:06:05.889> trying<00:06:06.370> to

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
it could be a move maybe also trying to

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.120 
it could be a move maybe also trying to
exchange<00:06:06.789> those<00:06:07.270> it's<00:06:07.870> probably<00:06:08.169> about<00:06:08.500> equal

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
exchange those it's probably about equal

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.969 
exchange those it's probably about equal
I<00:06:09.310> don't<00:06:09.580> think<00:06:09.669> there<00:06:10.210> is<00:06:10.240> anything<00:06:10.979> special

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
I don't think there is anything special

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:13.620 
I don't think there is anything special
going<00:06:12.520> on<00:06:12.669> you<00:06:12.909> should<00:06:13.090> have<00:06:13.300> enough

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
going on you should have enough

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.520 
going on you should have enough
resources<00:06:13.810> to<00:06:14.909> m2<00:06:15.909> to<00:06:16.389> avoid<00:06:16.720> of<00:06:16.900> bed<00:06:17.080> end<00:06:17.289> game

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
resources to m2 to avoid of bed end game

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.670 
resources to m2 to avoid of bed end game
I<00:06:17.740> mean<00:06:18.159> this<00:06:18.340> this<00:06:19.240> can<00:06:19.930> lead<00:06:19.960> to<00:06:20.229> a<00:06:20.409> bad<00:06:20.620> end

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
I mean this this can lead to a bad end

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.490 
I mean this this can lead to a bad end
game<00:06:21.099> rather<00:06:21.370> easily<00:06:21.729> if<00:06:22.150> we<00:06:22.389> trade<00:06:23.259> some

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
game rather easily if we trade some

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.159 
game rather easily if we trade some
pieces<00:06:23.740> and

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
pieces and

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.899 
pieces and
I<00:06:25.229> can<00:06:25.529> very<00:06:25.860> often<00:06:26.039> just<00:06:26.340> get<00:06:26.520> one<00:06:26.699> of<00:06:26.819> the

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:26.909 
I can very often just get one of the

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:28.939 
I can very often just get one of the
pawns<00:06:27.180> back<00:06:27.479> like<00:06:27.960> the<00:06:28.110> a<00:06:28.139> four-point<00:06:28.770> for

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:28.949 
pawns back like the a four-point for

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.640 
pawns back like the a four-point for
example<00:06:29.340> and<00:06:29.460> then<00:06:29.610> he<00:06:30.330> would<00:06:30.479> be<00:06:30.689> left<00:06:31.379> with

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
example and then he would be left with

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.589 
example and then he would be left with
two<00:06:31.889> big<00:06:32.039> horns<00:06:32.490> on<00:06:32.669> on<00:06:33.150> on<00:06:33.870> a<00:06:34.080> 3<00:06:34.469> and<00:06:34.680> C<00:06:35.129> 2<00:06:35.159> but

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 
two big horns on on on a 3 and C 2 but

two big horns on on on a 3 and C 2 but
with<00:06:36.599> good<00:06:36.840> play<00:06:37.139> should<00:06:37.319> probably<00:06:37.860> avoid<00:06:37.979> it

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:38.719 
with good play should probably avoid it

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:43.460 
with good play should probably avoid it
