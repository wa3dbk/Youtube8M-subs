00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
we're sitting here at racers booth and

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.400 
we're sitting here at racers booth and
we're<00:00:13.100> here<00:00:13.220> with<00:00:13.340> Elmo<00:00:13.640> oh<00:00:13.820> hi<00:00:14.510> so<00:00:15.410> what<00:00:15.770> this

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
we're here with Elmo oh hi so what this

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.960 
we're here with Elmo oh hi so what this
I<00:00:16.440> mean<00:00:16.590> it's<00:00:16.740> an<00:00:16.890> Xbox<00:00:17.220> controller<00:00:17.280> right

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
I mean it's an Xbox controller right

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.019 
I mean it's an Xbox controller right
this<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.360> our<00:00:18.690> first<00:00:19.500> console<00:00:20.430> product<00:00:20.880> from

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
this is our first console product from

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.530 
this is our first console product from
Razer<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.540> is<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.840> run<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.289> razor<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
Razer this is the run a razor on the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.240 
Razer this is the run a razor on the
tournament<00:00:24.540> Edition<00:00:24.980> controller<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
tournament Edition controller for the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.800 
tournament Edition controller for the
Xbox<00:00:26.369> 360<00:00:28.220> we<00:00:29.220> did<00:00:29.400> three<00:00:29.759> things<00:00:29.790> to<00:00:30.630> really

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
Xbox 360 we did three things to really

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.960 
Xbox 360 we did three things to really
improve<00:00:31.169> this<00:00:31.380> controller<00:00:31.879> from<00:00:32.879> the

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
improve this controller from the

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.910 
improve this controller from the
Microsoft<00:00:33.600> controller<00:00:33.930> first<00:00:34.530> thing<00:00:34.769> is<00:00:34.890> that

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
Microsoft controller first thing is that

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.460 
Microsoft controller first thing is that
we<00:00:35.129> added<00:00:35.309> adjustable<00:00:36.090> resistance<00:00:36.540> analog

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
we added adjustable resistance analog

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.290 
we added adjustable resistance analog
sticks<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:38.220> means<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.910> turn<00:00:39.059> this

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
sticks that means that you can turn this

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.049 
sticks that means that you can turn this
wheel<00:00:39.540> below<00:00:40.199> the<00:00:40.350> analog<00:00:40.650> stick<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.699> the<00:00:41.820> left

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
wheel below the analog stick to the left

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.660 
wheel below the analog stick to the left
to<00:00:42.960> make<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.620> make<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> analog<00:00:44.220> stick<00:00:44.430> very

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to make it to make the analog stick very

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.030 
to make it to make the analog stick very
very<00:00:44.879> loose<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.650> turn<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.949> the

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
very loose and if you turn it to the

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.119 
very loose and if you turn it to the
right<00:00:47.160> it'll<00:00:47.489> get<00:00:47.970> very<00:00:48.000> very<00:00:48.360> tight<00:00:49.010> so<00:00:50.010> if

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
right it'll get very very tight so if

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.530 
right it'll get very very tight so if
you're<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> first-person<00:00:50.850> shooter<00:00:51.030> game<00:00:51.390> where

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
you're a first-person shooter game where

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.940 
you're a first-person shooter game where
you<00:00:51.629> really<00:00:51.989> want<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.200> have<00:00:52.290> a<00:00:52.320> loose<00:00:52.530> tension

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
you really want to have a loose tension

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.760 
you really want to have a loose tension
on<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> analog<00:00:53.520> stick<00:00:53.820> while<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:55.230> you're<00:00:55.530> for

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
on the analog stick while if you're for

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.190 
on the analog stick while if you're for
example<00:00:55.800> gaming<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.090> racing<00:00:57.510> game<00:00:57.539> you

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
example gaming on a racing game you

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.360 
example gaming on a racing game you
probably<00:00:58.350> want<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.890> very<00:00:59.070> tight

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
probably want to have a very tight

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.270 
probably want to have a very tight
tension<00:01:00.379> we<00:01:01.379> worked<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.920> controller

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
tension we worked on this controller

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.540 
tension we worked on this controller
with<00:01:02.489> pro<00:01:03.090> gamers<00:01:03.449> especially<00:01:04.350> with<00:01:04.860> Colin

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
with pro gamers especially with Colin

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.719 
with pro gamers especially with Colin
Fargo<00:01:05.880> from<00:01:06.690> the<00:01:06.840> US<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.380> he<00:01:08.369> told<00:01:08.580> me

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
Fargo from the US and he told me

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.029 
Fargo from the US and he told me
actually<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.149> programmers<00:01:09.990> give<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
actually that programmers give the

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:13.249 
actually that programmers give the
controller<00:01:11.430> way<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.700> their<00:01:12.030> friends<00:01:12.360> first<00:01:12.630> to

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
controller way to their friends first to

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.139 
controller way to their friends first to
really<00:01:13.619> play<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.550> and<00:01:14.700> loosen<00:01:14.880> this

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
really play with it and loosen this

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.779 
really play with it and loosen this
analog<00:01:15.479> stick<00:01:15.690> up<00:01:16.100> with<00:01:17.100> our<00:01:17.250> controller<00:01:17.670> you

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
analog stick up with our controller you

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.389 
analog stick up with our controller you
can<00:01:17.940> just<00:01:18.479> do<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.020> right<00:01:19.320> away<00:01:19.350> turn<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.280> to

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
can just do that right away turn it to

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.160 
can just do that right away turn it to
the<00:01:20.490> left<00:01:20.520> it'll<00:01:20.849> get<00:01:21.000> loose<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.929> don't

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the left it'll get loose and you don't

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.660 
the left it'll get loose and you don't
miss<00:01:23.069> out<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.729> being<00:01:24.830> harder<00:01:25.830> as<00:01:26.039> well<00:01:26.399> if

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
miss out on it being harder as well if

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.760 
miss out on it being harder as well if
you<00:01:26.789> turn<00:01:26.940> it<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.209> right<00:01:27.450> again<00:01:27.770> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
you turn it to the right again the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.740 
you turn it to the right again the
second<00:01:29.130> thing<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.520> did<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.849> we<00:01:30.330> added<00:01:30.599> two

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
second thing that we did is we added two

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.080 
second thing that we did is we added two
extra<00:01:30.990> buttons<00:01:31.679> on<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> controller<00:01:32.340> which

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
extra buttons on the controller which

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.580 
extra buttons on the controller which
are<00:01:33.240> located<00:01:33.630> here<00:01:33.660> on<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.990> shoulder<00:01:34.319> sides

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
are located here on the shoulder sides

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.589 
are located here on the shoulder sides
of<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> controller<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.310> top<00:01:35.610> these<00:01:36.539> are

00:01:36.589 --> 00:01:36.599 
of the controller on top these are

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:39.260 
of the controller on top these are
called<00:01:36.890> multifunction<00:01:37.890> buttons<00:01:38.190> and<00:01:38.880> they

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
called multifunction buttons and they

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.980 
called multifunction buttons and they
relocate<00:01:39.929> buttons<00:01:40.740> from<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.780> surface<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
relocate buttons from the surface of the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.900 
relocate buttons from the surface of the
controller<00:01:43.289> to<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.740> position<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.789> your

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
controller to this position to your

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.620 
controller to this position to your
fingertips<00:01:45.590> this<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.739> done<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.220> game<00:01:47.550> just<00:01:48.450> by

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
fingertips this is done in game just by

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.169 
fingertips this is done in game just by
pressing<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.860> these<00:01:50.429> two<00:01:50.610> buttons<00:01:50.789> for

that<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:53.940> set<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> button<00:01:54.959> right<00:01:55.170> now

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
that it's set to the a button right now

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.040 
that it's set to the a button right now
you<00:01:57.149> can<00:01:57.360> for<00:01:57.929> example<00:01:58.700> set<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.849> to<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.179> analog

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
you can for example set it to the analog

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.910 
you can for example set it to the analog
stick<00:02:01.289> button<00:02:02.869> which<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.259> good<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.470> FPS

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
stick button which is really good in FPS

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.680

example you have to press down on the

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.180 
example you have to press down on the
analog<00:02:09.479> stick<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.959> then<00:02:10.229> start<00:02:10.619> aiming<00:02:10.800> for

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
analog stick and then start aiming for

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.360 
analog stick and then start aiming for
your<00:02:11.340> target<00:02:12.000> if<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.319> can<00:02:13.470> now<00:02:13.620> use<00:02:13.860> just

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
your target if you you can now use just

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.970 
your target if you you can now use just
this<00:02:14.879> button<00:02:15.209> here<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.569> go<00:02:16.470> into<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.770> scope

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.000 
this button here to go into the scope
mode<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.459> then<00:02:17.970> really<00:02:18.629> just<00:02:18.870> freely<00:02:19.830> aim

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
mode and then really just freely aim

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.400 
mode and then really just freely aim
without<00:02:20.610> cramping<00:02:21.209> down<00:02:21.390> on<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.690> analog

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410

the<00:02:24.960> third<00:02:25.200> thing<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.740> we<00:02:26.130> did<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.460> we

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
the third thing that we did is we

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.270 
the third thing that we did is we
incorporated<00:02:27.690> technology<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.830> we<00:02:28.950> use<00:02:29.100> in

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
incorporated technology that we use in

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.820 
incorporated technology that we use in
our<00:02:29.340> gaming<00:02:29.730> mice<00:02:29.880> for<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.180> PC<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.500> action

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
our gaming mice for the PC in the action

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.910 
our gaming mice for the PC in the action
buttons<00:02:32.070> on<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.280> controller<00:02:33.560> we<00:02:34.560> made<00:02:34.770> them

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
buttons on the controller we made them

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.490 
buttons on the controller we made them
hyper<00:02:35.310> response<00:02:35.820> buttons<00:02:36.210> which<00:02:36.570> means<00:02:36.810> their

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
hyper response buttons which means their

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.360 
hyper response buttons which means their
mechanical<00:02:38.250> key<00:02:38.940> switches<00:02:39.270> in<00:02:39.630> these<00:02:39.810> buttons

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
mechanical key switches in these buttons

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.460 
mechanical key switches in these buttons
that<00:02:41.370> make<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.940> actuation<00:02:42.690> really<00:02:43.260> really

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
that make the actuation really really

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.980 
that make the actuation really really
fast<00:02:43.740> while<00:02:44.730> giving<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.210> click<00:02:45.480> feedback

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
fast while giving you a click feedback

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.580 
fast while giving you a click feedback
and<00:02:46.260> detect<00:02:47.100> our<00:02:47.280> feedback<00:02:47.580> as<00:02:47.850> well<00:02:50.420> yeah<00:02:51.590> the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
and detect our feedback as well yeah the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.310 
and detect our feedback as well yeah the
surface<00:02:52.980> of<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.190> controller<00:02:53.520> is<00:02:53.640> rubberized

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
surface of the controller is rubberized

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.630 
surface of the controller is rubberized
so<00:02:55.320> there<00:02:55.500> will<00:02:55.650> give<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.010> very<00:02:56.280> very<00:02:56.460> nice

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
so there will give you a very very nice

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.700 
so there will give you a very very nice
grip<00:02:56.970> on<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.390> controller<00:02:57.750> during<00:02:58.440> all

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
grip on the controller during all

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.560 
grip on the controller during all
situations<00:02:59.310> if<00:02:59.610> you<00:02:59.730> if<00:03:00.000> you're<00:03:00.270> playing

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
competitively you might get sweaty hands

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.330 
competitively you might get sweaty hands
for<00:03:03.570> example<00:03:03.660> but<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.530> with<00:03:04.890> this<00:03:05.010> rubberized

$49.99 euros and there's going to be a
standard<00:03:16.170> edition<00:03:16.710> as<00:03:16.830> well<00:03:16.860> which<00:03:17.580> doesn't

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
standard edition as well which doesn't

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.010 
standard edition as well which doesn't
feature<00:03:18.720> these<00:03:19.560> resistance<00:03:21.020> adjustable

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
feature these resistance adjustable

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.900 
feature these resistance adjustable
analog<00:03:22.440> sticks<00:03:22.710> and<00:03:22.980> won't<00:03:23.880> be<00:03:24.090> lit<00:03:24.600> that's

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
analog sticks and won't be lit that's

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.080 
analog sticks and won't be lit that's
$39.99

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
$39.99

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.080 
$39.99

so it's $10 cheaper when are you

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.000 
so it's $10 cheaper when are you
planning<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.540> releasing<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:31.020> they're

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
planning to releasing it they're

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.920 
planning to releasing it they're
actually<00:03:32.280> going<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.550> come<00:03:32.670> out<00:03:32.820> at<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.540> end<00:03:33.660> of

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
actually going to come out at the end of

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.550 
actually going to come out at the end of
next<00:03:34.800> month<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.280> think<00:03:35.720> probably<00:03:36.720> in<00:03:36.959> stores<00:03:37.260> by

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
next month I think probably in stores by

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.090 
next month I think probably in stores by
by<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.010> time<00:03:38.280> October<00:03:38.550> comes<00:03:39.000> around<00:03:40.100> which

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
by the time October comes around which

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.920 
by the time October comes around which
