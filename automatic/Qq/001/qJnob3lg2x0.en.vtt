play so um yeah just go to exclusionary
zone<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.410> Mars<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.119> go<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.510> part<00:00:30.900> there's

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
zone on Mars and go to this part there's

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.090 
zone on Mars and go to this part there's
you'll<00:00:32.399> you'll<00:00:32.790> know<00:00:33.030> when<00:00:33.329> you're<00:00:33.480> there<00:00:33.750> um
