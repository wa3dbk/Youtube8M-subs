00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Y 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.970
 for example let's think that here is the 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.150
 music stand and we will be microphone 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.150
 I am 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:29.840
 I am a fan of d 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.800
 of small diaphragm microphones for 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.690
 microphone for example guitars 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.180
 acoustic even knaul guitars and 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.400
 nylon or flamenco guitars I have recorded 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.030
 many a lot of all of all of that 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:46.379
 kind of guitars and for me I always 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.239
 have provided a focus an approach 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.360
 of the fingering direct punch 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.390
 etcetera much bigger and does not have 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.129
 what to sound small or sharp people believe 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.230
 that small diaphragm microphones 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.930
 they do not have serious that's the biggest lie 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.360
 that there are diaphragm microphones 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.570
 small that have a vast amount of 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.630
 serious as much as he or almost 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.790
 the microphone and in a big way that more 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.310
 serious have really yes that's true 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.110
 it is possible to have microphones 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.330
 small diaphragm with great content 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.220
 in serious ok 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.500
 the balance for example a guitar 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.630
 acoustic a starting point if 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.660
 you use a single microphone for me 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.340
 it is always a point close to 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.870
 where the mast meets the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.390
 body more towards the twelfth back 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.270
 close to the twelfth fret a bit 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.540
 little bit more depends depends on the 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.990
 situation and something we play with 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.930
 enormously it is always with the balance 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.180
 between what we have of strumming and of 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.370
 high frequencies and the bass that 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.830
 we want to get the resonance that 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.620
 we want to get 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.770
 if I was playing ripping 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.520
 example with a pick we could in a 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.340
 Given moment 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.439
 do two different things for example 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.810
 if instead of microphones there is 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.860
 directly towards the twelfth fret what 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.360
 move more towards the sanjón 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.269
 we would automatically get two things 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.299
 that will sound more the boom in is the logo in 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.049
 game and that we did not get to have 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.720
 much 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.129
 a lot of the definition of 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.950
 the brake fingers 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:30.260
 you know about the fingering of 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.090
 fingers that is important in those cases 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.489
 when I'm there and I need a little more 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.849
 of bass I do not move the microphone to 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.769
 there he inclined it but we spoke of few 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.989
 degrees sometimes only tilt this 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.620
 it's enough to get then in 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.500
 what do you need 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.569
 well it is super super useful technique 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.370
 that I explain to you of having some 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.400
 headphones there for yourselves 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.500
 as engineers and with the guitarist or 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.200
 sometimes even ask the guitarist 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.930
 can you use your bosses to put you 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.120
 guitarist's heads while he plays and 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.480
 you adjust it returns them and it is already 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.709
 you know where you really see the same 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.500
 with any other instrument or 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:13.330
 instrument even with a piano 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.459
 if you can not put the heads of the 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.360
 pianist asks him to continue playing place 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:22.690
 Veras and adjust the microphones up 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:27.270
 as far as necessary other times 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.920
 He used stereo techniques for guitars 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.450
 and I use them in two very 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.280
 different 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.830
 They are usually technical techniques 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.570
 coincident like what I did in those with 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.170
 these microphones on the battery above 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.170
 more type xy or a combination not so 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.540
 X and more with another different angle 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.150
 where he caught between more the fret and 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.860
 a little over 90 but that kind of 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.140
 techniques they normally use to a 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.810
 greater distance at a very distance 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.800
 close sounds it tends to sound very natural 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.020
 very very very unnatural very 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.830
 normally with type type microphones 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.740
 thought 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.960
 there are many microphones that really hear 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.220
 there are many more there are a variety 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.280
 that never from microphones that work 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.440
 another thing that can be done is also 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.720
 microphone when it 's someone who does 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.760
 much picking much more than more than pulse 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.880
 something more solo over pulse and over 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:29.360
 all with nylon guitars the microphone 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.100
 from the back of this part of the 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.520
 sea ​​towards the bridge 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.520
 how 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.520
 how
