version<00:00:06.120> 2009<00:00:06.870> today<00:00:07.170> but<00:00:07.500> lofting<00:00:07.890> is<00:00:08.010> more

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
version 2009 today but lofting is more

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.220 
version 2009 today but lofting is more
or<00:00:08.280> less<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.550> same<00:00:08.760> in<00:00:08.820> other<00:00:09.480> versions<00:00:10.110> of

max now you might be wondering what is
lofting<00:00:13.440> well<00:00:14.269> it's<00:00:15.269> basically<00:00:15.480> taking<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.289> 2d

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
lofting well it's basically taking a 2d

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.630 
lofting well it's basically taking a 2d
object<00:00:17.240> much<00:00:18.240> like<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.660> star<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.550> having<00:00:20.550> it

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
object much like this star and having it

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.470 
object much like this star and having it
follow<00:00:20.880> along<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.150> path<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:21.810> line

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.160 

and<00:00:26.930> creating<00:00:28.750> brand-new<00:00:29.750> 3d<00:00:30.680> object

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.170 
and creating brand-new 3d object

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.360 
and creating brand-new 3d object
now<00:00:33.170> we're<00:00:33.320> going<00:00:33.440> to<00:00:33.530> be<00:00:33.590> making<00:00:33.770> screwdriver

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
now we're going to be making screwdriver

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.440 
now we're going to be making screwdriver
today<00:00:34.640> which<00:00:34.970> is<00:00:35.000> a<00:00:35.149> bit<00:00:35.390> more<00:00:35.420> complex<00:00:35.930> so

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
today which is a bit more complex so

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.740 
today which is a bit more complex so
I've<00:00:38.450> already<00:00:38.809> created<00:00:39.020> my<00:00:39.320> path<00:00:39.590> and<00:00:40.449> my<00:00:41.449> 2d

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
I've already created my path and my 2d

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.270 
I've already created my path and my 2d
spline<00:00:41.960> objects<00:00:42.470> that<00:00:42.620> I'll<00:00:42.739> use<00:00:42.920> to<00:00:42.949> shape

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
spline objects that I'll use to shape

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.189 
spline objects that I'll use to shape
out<00:00:43.430> my<00:00:43.579> screwdriver<00:00:43.879> once<00:00:44.840> you've<00:00:44.989> created

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
out my screwdriver once you've created

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.700 
out my screwdriver once you've created
us<00:00:45.530> we<00:00:45.739> can<00:00:45.860> get<00:00:45.980> started<00:00:47.440> first<00:00:48.440> thing<00:00:48.620> you

then the drop down where it usually says

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:58.720 
then the drop down where it usually says
standard<00:00:57.320> primitives<00:00:57.800> go<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:58.309> compound

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
standard primitives go to compound

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.649 
standard primitives go to compound
objects<00:00:59.980> click<00:01:00.980> on<00:01:01.100> loft<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:02.149> then<00:01:02.629> a

creation method get shape go over and

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.740 
creation method get shape go over and
select<00:01:07.100> your<00:01:08.350> first<00:01:09.350> object

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.480 

now<00:01:14.290> we're<00:01:14.410> going<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.560> begin<00:01:15.510> by<00:01:16.510> making

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
now we're going to begin by making

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.490 
now we're going to begin by making
the<00:01:18.880> handle<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.810> screwdriver

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
the handle of the screwdriver

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.670 
the handle of the screwdriver
we<00:01:22.100> want<00:01:22.280> this<00:01:22.690> first<00:01:23.690> circle<00:01:23.870> to<00:01:24.230> last<00:01:24.440> for

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
we want this first circle to last for

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.410 
we want this first circle to last for
about<00:01:24.830> 5%<00:01:25.100> of<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.790> total<00:01:26.390> path<00:01:28.180> so<00:01:29.180> I'm<00:01:29.270> going

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
about 5% of the total path so I'm going

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.580 
about 5% of the total path so I'm going
to<00:01:29.480> go<00:01:29.600> over<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.840> path<00:01:30.050> type<00:01:30.590> in<00:01:30.800> 5<00:01:32.080> 5%<00:01:33.080> get

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
to go over the path type in 5 5% get

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.899 
to go over the path type in 5 5% get
shape<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.160> click<00:01:34.370> on<00:01:35.320> circle

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.020 

and<00:01:39.540> we<00:01:39.659> need<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.930> start<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.619> grip<00:01:40.939> for<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and we need to start the grip for the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.499 
and we need to start the grip for the
handle<00:01:42.390> which<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:43.049> object<00:01:43.259> right<00:01:43.619> here

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
handle which is this object right here

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.910 
handle which is this object right here
now<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.539> want<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.719> to<00:01:45.899> start<00:01:46.140> right<00:01:46.380> away<00:01:46.500> so

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
now I want that to start right away so

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.300 
now I want that to start right away so
I'm<00:01:47.070> going<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.250> go<00:01:47.369> 1%<00:01:47.909> more<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.509> 6<00:01:49.039> get<00:01:50.039> shape

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
I'm going to go 1% more to 6 get shape

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.450 
I'm going to go 1% more to 6 get shape
click<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.299> grip<00:01:52.009> I'm<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.220> want<00:01:53.340> this

click on the grip I'm going to want this

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.469 
click on the grip I'm going to want this
to<00:01:53.520> last<00:01:53.850> for<00:01:54.240> about<00:01:54.329> 40%<00:01:55.289> of<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.920> object<00:01:56.479> it's

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
to last for about 40% of the object it's

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.020 
to last for about 40% of the object it's
going<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.720> type<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.020> 40<00:01:58.369> get<00:01:59.369> shape<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.909> click

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
going to type in 40 get shape and click

going to type in 40 get shape and click
on<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.929> gripped<00:02:01.200> object<00:02:01.710> again

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.770 

now<00:02:05.270> I<00:02:05.300> wanted<00:02:05.630> to<00:02:05.690> go<00:02:05.840> back<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.200> this<00:02:06.460> smoother

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
now I wanted to go back to this smoother

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.699 
now I wanted to go back to this smoother
object<00:02:08.780> that<00:02:08.899> we<00:02:09.020> had<00:02:09.140> before<00:02:09.319> so<00:02:10.630> 41%<00:02:11.709> get

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
object that we had before so 41% get

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.490 
object that we had before so 41% get
shape<00:02:13.540> click<00:02:14.540> on<00:02:14.690> our<00:02:14.810> first<00:02:15.020> circle

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
shape click on our first circle

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.940 
shape click on our first circle
now<00:02:17.500> most<00:02:17.890> screwdrivers<00:02:18.490> usually<00:02:19.240> have<00:02:19.510> a

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
now most screwdrivers usually have a

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.890 
now most screwdrivers usually have a
thinner<00:02:20.950> part<00:02:21.280> right<00:02:21.520> before<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.270> tip<00:02:22.510> starts

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
thinner part right before the tip starts

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.670 
thinner part right before the tip starts
so<00:02:23.640> I'm<00:02:24.640> going<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:24.970> go<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.150> 45<00:02:25.540> percent<00:02:26.020> I<00:02:26.410> get

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
so I'm going to go to 45 percent I get

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.970 
so I'm going to go to 45 percent I get
shape<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.160> click<00:02:27.280> on<00:02:27.580> our<00:02:28.770> medium<00:02:29.770> size

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.420 
circle
from<00:02:32.240> there<00:02:32.390> I'm<00:02:32.510> going<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.690> go<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.840> 49%<00:02:33.430> get

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430
