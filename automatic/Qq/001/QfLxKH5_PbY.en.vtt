00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hi to all of you in my new video 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.599
 today I will talk about the haircut of 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:13.799
 brown and brown emma also did 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:17.520
 I don't know if I put them out there 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.130
 similarity but patience 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.369
 it's not like I can do mine 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.369
 possibility 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.990
 then let's talk about this cut of the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:34.790
 hair that gives about a year or so 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:39.140
 carrying is going very fashionable 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:43.739
 more and more because obviously fashions 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.410
 over time they become bigger and 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.840
 they take more and more people also because 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.079
 in this type of cut it is a bit 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:59.000
 hazard because it's almost on the level 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:03.570
 underground so a little level 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.140
 too strong extreme but this is not the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.340
 case 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:12.510
 because she has a regular short from 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.400
 parties did not yell to zero ie it is not 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.340
 who took the machine sele 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.680
 cut to make you see all the skin 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:27.119
 ok let's see what i have to say about this 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:34.590
 assembly that practically to a part 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:43.020
 long than from the right mystery e 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:48.180
 a short part ie left ok then 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.720
 the short part I can tell you that of 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.720
 about 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:03.340
 9 mm and a half ie 9 mm with the 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:09.080
 machine raised but ok if you are 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:14.320
 there are some if there is a machine 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:20.020
 crank someone like that button 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.020
 they make more and those who don't 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.490
 about a few millimeters more mi 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:33.070
 remember from how many maybe half a million 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:40.610
 half an inch more and then it becomes 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:44.390
 nine and a half then happens cécile e 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.580
 made with a machine on 9 and a half cm a 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:53.950
 scissors from another part of the sleeves 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:58.580
 because it is difficult to see how many mm fi 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:02.170
 however it is this cm click on ok and done 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:05.090
 from the left lateral area of ​​the head 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.260
 with a clean cut 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.690
 ok so with long hair 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.170
 there is no short hair 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.880
 neither scaling nor le scaling 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.610
 shades 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.330
 ok the dirty cut because in general 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:34.790
 to women it leaves a little more dirty and 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:41.810
 stadium and goes from the left side up to 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:46.360
 touch the right part of the part, however 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:49.840
 back of the head stopping 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:54.350
 to the ear ok 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.140
 so it is as if he splits his head in two 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.290
 parts just divides the testing part 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.489
 we leave out how 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:11.170
 your clean cut and this hair 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:21.979
 long bleached blondes you know 129 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:26.360
 no but it depends on another in 10 9 10 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:33.889
 barbeque sometimes lighter, sometimes less 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:38.259
 clear and okay between a 9 and 10 here 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:43.340
 what has made a bend rockettaro 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:46.130
 simple sometimes move a lot 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:51.160
 rock style as indeed makes us understand 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.160
 she even if the songs are not rock
