00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.890
 Yes. 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:13.340
 This time is gonna see the right-hand ring Singer 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:19.939
 First, a Minor Seven Code keeps the thumb, the right thumb goes to the sixth 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:22.910
 Let's put the lotto for the Nazi this week. 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:28.880
 I threw my thumb first in this state. 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:30.079
 Geurigu Guns 2 in Hachioji stop order gives you hide in a short time 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.720
 It's important. 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:38.500
 Here, the important thing is the thumb opportunities 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.500
 It is important that the remaining three fingers bounce back in order 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:50.300
 4 Next is my brother Percussion. 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:51.380
 Sepulcher due to the line with a nail straight into a friend named Tak crackling sounds and how progressive LA 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.150
 I will 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.150
 I 'll try the percussive action. 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.760
 5 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:07.310
 This is the next one. 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.930
 The teams both thumb index finger ring finger to stop at once put on line 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:15.400
 Will 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.400
 Only the remaining three fingers, remove the thumb is flipped us the next one 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.770
 U 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.550
 4 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.370
 Finally, I put in another percussive law. 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.370
 I 'll do something. 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:42.050
 Well, let's code the consonants Tina 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:43.310
 In Deep Lying Code, a is the same as the finger number, but one thing 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.630
 There's something else. 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:52.190
 The mall should be changed to line 5 only. 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:55.000
 Then it will be the same as the rhythm you did in a Minor Seven . 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.000
 I'll try. 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:05.210
 Yeah then the code b is minor seven 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:10.660
 Likewise, before moving from t line to b minor seven 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.660
 I think you can go back to line 4 again. 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:24.110
 Likewise, the next thing that comes out is the name and the finger that you did in line d 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.590
 Same as 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.590
 Yes Yes 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.860
 Thank you. 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:45.990
 Do not forget to get wet with the open sheep index in heroic mode as always in the mode. 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.990
 I'll try it from scratch. 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:54.150
 Thank you.
