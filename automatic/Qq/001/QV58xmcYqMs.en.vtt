exercise and the benefits to this
movement<00:00:19.160> I<00:00:19.520> just<00:00:20.150> think<00:00:20.359> it's<00:00:20.510> a<00:00:20.600> very<00:00:20.810> good

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
movement I just think it's a very good

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.640 
movement I just think it's a very good
isolation<00:00:22.130> movement<00:00:22.550> I<00:00:23.240> really<00:00:24.020> feel<00:00:24.290> that<00:00:24.320> it

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
isolation movement I really feel that it

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.800 
isolation movement I really feel that it
really<00:00:24.830> targets<00:00:25.670> the<00:00:25.760> peak<00:00:26.060> of<00:00:26.210> the<00:00:26.360> bicep

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
really targets the peak of the bicep

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.290 
really targets the peak of the bicep
watch<00:00:27.200> i<00:00:27.350> I<00:00:27.560> noticed<00:00:28.220> that<00:00:28.490> just<00:00:28.760> the<00:00:29.000> feel<00:00:29.270> of

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
watch i I noticed that just the feel of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.679 
watch i I noticed that just the feel of
the<00:00:29.539> movement<00:00:30.340> you<00:00:31.340> can't<00:00:31.610> really<00:00:31.880> cheat<00:00:32.270> on

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
the movement you can't really cheat on

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.180 
the movement you can't really cheat on
this<00:00:32.899> movement<00:00:33.230> you<00:00:33.620> can't<00:00:33.829> really<00:00:34.010> use

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
this movement you can't really use

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.750 
this movement you can't really use
momentum<00:00:34.789> so<00:00:35.270> you're<00:00:35.390> forced<00:00:35.780> to<00:00:35.960> use<00:00:36.760> your

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
momentum so you're forced to use your

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.330 
momentum so you're forced to use your
bicep<00:00:38.150> muscle<00:00:38.570> you<00:00:38.750> can<00:00:39.110> I<00:00:39.320> notice<00:00:39.860> that<00:00:40.100> I

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
bicep muscle you can I notice that I

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.610 
bicep muscle you can I notice that I
really<00:00:40.670> feel<00:00:40.970> it<00:00:41.239> in<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:41.540> peak<00:00:41.750> of<00:00:41.870> my<00:00:42.020> bicep<00:00:42.470> I

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
really feel it in the peak of my bicep I

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.870 
really feel it in the peak of my bicep I
think<00:00:42.829> it's<00:00:42.950> a<00:00:43.010> good<00:00:43.160> peaking<00:00:43.550> movement

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
think it's a good peaking movement

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.120 
think it's a good peaking movement
fantastic<00:00:44.660> Carl<00:00:44.930> my<00:00:45.050> man<00:00:45.079> show<00:00:45.560> us<00:00:45.710> how<00:00:45.829> to<00:00:45.890> do

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
fantastic Carl my man show us how to do

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.160 
fantastic Carl my man show us how to do
spotter<00:00:46.430> kills<00:00:46.760> mark<00:00:47.420> our<00:00:47.600> BC<00:00:47.930> stall<00:00:48.140> I

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
spotter kills mark our BC stall I

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.990 
spotter kills mark our BC stall I
noticed<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.739> bench<00:00:48.920> is<00:00:49.100> at<00:00:49.220> a<00:00:49.280> very<00:00:49.309> low<00:00:49.820> angle

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
noticed the bench is at a very low angle

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.500 
noticed the bench is at a very low angle
maybe<00:00:50.720> 25<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.500> 30<00:00:51.710> degrees<00:00:52.070> I<00:00:52.579> think<00:00:52.910> that<00:00:53.210> just

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
maybe 25 to 30 degrees I think that just

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.560 
maybe 25 to 30 degrees I think that just
actually<00:00:54.050> puts<00:00:54.590> more<00:00:54.770> tension<00:00:54.829> on<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:55.489> muscle

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
actually puts more tension on the muscle

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.850 
actually puts more tension on the muscle
because<00:00:56.570> you're<00:00:56.989> pretty<00:00:57.200> much<00:00:57.380> just<00:00:57.620> hanging

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
because you're pretty much just hanging

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.799 
because you're pretty much just hanging
yep<00:00:58.750> beautiful<00:01:00.160> one<00:01:01.160> at<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.340> time<00:01:01.520> again<00:01:01.820> this

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
yep beautiful one at a time again this

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.660 
yep beautiful one at a time again this
time<00:01:03.079> staying<00:01:03.410> supinated<00:01:04.100> from<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.399> bottom

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
time staying supinated from the bottom

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.200 
time staying supinated from the bottom
to<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:04.969> top<00:01:05.000> why<00:01:05.689> I<00:01:06.040> think<00:01:07.040> doing<00:01:07.759> it<00:01:07.939> this<00:01:08.149> way

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
to the top why I think doing it this way

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.969 
to the top why I think doing it this way
because<00:01:08.840> there's<00:01:09.079> nothing<00:01:09.439> that's<00:01:09.740> going<00:01:09.920> to

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
because there's nothing that's going to

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.059 
because there's nothing that's going to
obstruct<00:01:10.369> obstruct<00:01:10.959> me<00:01:11.959> like<00:01:12.139> my<00:01:12.289> arms<00:01:12.649> or<00:01:12.889> my

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:15.429 
obstruct obstruct me like my arms or my
legs<00:01:13.310> yep<00:01:14.090> this<00:01:14.389> actually<00:01:14.689> just<00:01:14.899> keeps<00:01:15.259> that

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
legs yep this actually just keeps that

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.590 
legs yep this actually just keeps that
constant<00:01:15.920> tension<00:01:16.130> on<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:17.299> head<00:01:17.450> of<00:01:17.539> the

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
constant tension on the head of the

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.200 
pretty much focus on doing about four
sets<00:01:56.250> progressively<00:01:57.250> getting<00:01:57.580> covered<00:01:57.909> like

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
sets progressively getting covered like

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.749 
sets progressively getting covered like
a<00:01:58.390> repetitions<00:01:59.140> I<00:01:59.380> like<00:02:00.100> to<00:02:00.250> keep<00:02:00.490> this

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
a repetitions I like to keep this

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.060 
a repetitions I like to keep this
movement<00:02:01.090> around<00:02:01.479> 10<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:01.930> 12<00:02:02.170> reps<00:02:02.259> and<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:02.799> 12

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
movement around 10 to 12 reps and to 12

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.910 
movement around 10 to 12 reps and to 12
again<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:03.790> lot<00:02:04.270> of<00:02:04.390> bodybuilders<00:02:04.840> mark<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.890> a

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
again a lot of bodybuilders mark and a

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.499 
again a lot of bodybuilders mark and a
lot<00:02:06.070> of<00:02:06.100> young<00:02:06.280> guys<00:02:06.490> especially<00:02:06.790> you<00:02:07.149> train

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
lot of young guys especially you train

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.050 
lot of young guys especially you train
very<00:02:07.869> very<00:02:08.229> heavy<00:02:08.530> with<00:02:08.770> low<00:02:08.950> reps<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.729> idea

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
very very heavy with low reps the idea

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.180 
very very heavy with low reps the idea
is<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.270> put<00:02:10.479> size<00:02:10.690> on<00:02:10.959> it<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.650> know<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.980> lower

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
is to put size on it you know the lower

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.740 
is to put size on it you know the lower
the<00:02:12.400> reps<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.819> heavier<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.270> way<00:02:13.420> form<00:02:13.660> or

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
the reps the heavier the way form or

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.290 
the reps the heavier the way form or
size<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.050> get<00:02:14.380> however<00:02:15.060> you're<00:02:16.060> doing<00:02:16.090> a

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
size you get however you're doing a

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.550 
size you get however you're doing a
little<00:02:16.420> bit<00:02:16.540> higher<00:02:16.720> reps<00:02:16.959> than<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.319> so<00:02:17.530> you

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
little bit higher reps than that so you

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.650 
little bit higher reps than that so you
find<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:18.040> get<00:02:18.160> more<00:02:18.280> muscle<00:02:18.489> growth<00:02:18.819> a<00:02:19.150> little

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
find you get more muscle growth a little

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.449 
find you get more muscle growth a little
bit<00:02:19.780> high<00:02:19.900> repetition<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:20.590> go<00:02:20.739> it<00:02:21.069> depends

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
bit high repetition you go it depends

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.059 
bit high repetition you go it depends
and<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.819> varies<00:02:22.209> from<00:02:22.739> training<00:02:23.739> start<00:02:23.980> the

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
and it varies from training start the

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.860 
and it varies from training start the
training<00:02:24.310> style<00:02:24.610> sometimes<00:02:24.910> I'll<00:02:25.360> do<00:02:25.569> a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
training style sometimes I'll do a

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.890 
training style sometimes I'll do a
profile<00:02:26.680> which<00:02:26.890> will<00:02:27.010> be<00:02:27.130> lower<00:02:27.430> reps<00:02:27.900> moving

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
profile which will be lower reps moving

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.620 
profile which will be lower reps moving
maximum<00:02:29.350> weight<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:30.040> then<00:02:30.790> sometimes<00:02:31.269> I<00:02:31.420> do<00:02:31.480> a

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
maximum weight and then sometimes I do a

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.240 
maximum weight and then sometimes I do a
little<00:02:31.840> bit<00:02:32.019> higher<00:02:32.230> reps<00:02:32.620> because<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:33.069> want<00:02:33.220> to

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
little bit higher reps because I want to

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.890 
little bit higher reps because I want to
drive<00:02:33.400> more<00:02:33.640> blood<00:02:33.850> into<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.120> muscle<00:02:34.480> gotcha

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
drive more blood into the muscle gotcha

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.780 
drive more blood into the muscle gotcha
and<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.140> all<00:02:35.260> depends<00:02:35.739> on<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.340> muscle<00:02:36.670> group

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
and it all depends on the muscle group

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.090 
and it all depends on the muscle group
you<00:02:36.819> train<00:02:37.180> as<00:02:37.360> well<00:02:37.540> very<00:02:38.319> very<00:02:38.470> good<00:02:38.920> there's

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
you train as well very very good there's

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.590 
you train as well very very good there's
a<00:02:39.220> lot<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.519> know<00:02:39.550> here<00:02:39.880> ladies<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.209> gentlemen

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
a lot to know here ladies and gentlemen

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.120 
a lot to know here ladies and gentlemen
but<00:02:41.050> we'll<00:02:41.170> keep<00:02:41.350> getting<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.680> secrets<00:02:42.040> out

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
but we'll keep getting the secrets out

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.500 
but we'll keep getting the secrets out
of<00:02:42.310> him<00:02:42.430> let's<00:02:42.730> move<00:02:42.910> on<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.330> third

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
of him let's move on to the third

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.810 
of him let's move on to the third
