00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
once you get to the top it's not nearly

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.340 
once you get to the top it's not nearly
as<00:02:11.849> bad<00:02:12.060> on<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.450> way<00:02:12.569> up<00:02:12.720> there

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
as bad on the way up there

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.690 
as bad on the way up there
it's<00:02:13.530> like<00:02:13.710> it's<00:02:13.920> like<00:02:13.980> riding<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.430> roller

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
it's like it's like riding a roller

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.670 
it's like it's like riding a roller
coaster<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.270> as<00:02:15.360> they<00:02:15.540> slowly<00:02:15.930> take<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.560> to

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
coaster and as they slowly take you to

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.930 
coaster and as they slowly take you to
the<00:02:16.800> top<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.160> entire<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.610> weigh<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.790> up

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
the top the entire to weigh you up

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.060 
the top the entire to weigh you up
you're<00:02:18.120> like<00:02:18.210> oh<00:02:18.360> no<00:02:18.540> oh<00:02:18.780> no<00:02:18.870> oh<00:02:19.290> no<00:02:19.320> but<00:02:19.890> once

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
you're like oh no oh no oh no but once

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.730 
you're like oh no oh no oh no but once
you<00:02:20.160> actually<00:02:20.370> at<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.150> top<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.720> guess<00:02:22.500> that's<00:02:22.680> a

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
you actually at the top I guess that's a

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.170 
you actually at the top I guess that's a
bad<00:02:22.890> example<00:02:23.010> cuz<00:02:23.490> we're<00:02:23.640> at<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.820> top<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.090> a

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
bad example cuz we're at the top of a

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.610 
bad example cuz we're at the top of a
roller<00:02:24.420> coaster<00:02:24.450> can't<00:02:25.020> freak<00:02:25.230> shout<00:02:25.500> but

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
roller coaster can't freak shout but

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.410 
roller coaster can't freak shout but
this<00:02:25.770> is<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.010> opposite<00:02:26.460> right<00:02:26.880> we<00:02:27.000> got<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.270> top

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
this is the opposite right we got to top

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.090 
this is the opposite right we got to top
up<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.600> tower<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:28.080> feels<00:02:28.320> kind<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.650> nice<00:02:28.800> and
