00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.620 

so<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.340> 2d<00:00:44.610> platform<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.300> readable<00:00:45.660> though

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.890 

can<00:00:49.630> also<00:00:49.750> slide<00:00:50.320> under<00:00:50.620> that<00:00:50.770> hang<00:00:51.010> with

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
okay you need to get to the other side

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.120 
okay you need to get to the other side
the<00:01:47.659> rooftop<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:48.260> to<00:01:48.350> do<00:01:48.440> that<00:01:48.650> I<00:01:48.890> need<00:01:48.920> to

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
the rooftop and to do that I need to

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.430 
the rooftop and to do that I need to
jump<00:01:49.729> up<00:01:49.880> off<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.180> wall<00:01:50.360> here<00:01:50.630> actually<00:01:50.840> and

jump up off the wall here actually and

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.880 
jump up off the wall here actually and
then<00:01:52.369> shuffled<00:01:53.330> around<00:01:53.650> Japan

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.429 

don't<00:01:59.580> just<00:01:59.729> wake<00:01:59.970> up<00:02:00.090> where<00:02:00.330> you<00:02:00.360> work

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.639 

jump<00:02:05.439> up<00:02:05.679> and

working that will haunt you up into a

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.580 
working that will haunt you up into a
different<00:02:26.310> result<00:02:26.990> just<00:02:27.990> move<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.470> right

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
different result just move to the right

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.640 
different result just move to the right
say<00:02:28.920> isn't<00:02:29.880> pick<00:02:30.060> up<00:02:30.240> smoking<00:02:30.600> but<00:02:31.020> expiration

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
say isn't pick up smoking but expiration

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.160 
say isn't pick up smoking but expiration
finding<00:02:31.980> these<00:02:32.070> sport<00:02:32.400> pairs<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:34.020> can

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
finding these sport pairs and you can

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.370 
finding these sport pairs and you can
just<00:02:34.350> drop<00:02:34.410> off<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.890> sides<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:37.200> don't

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
just drop off the sides of you don't

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:44.059 
just drop off the sides of you don't
time<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.860> saw<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.850> now<00:02:39.420> jump<00:02:39.720> onto<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.020> wall

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.010 

boys<00:02:44.700> pretty<00:02:45.689> trippy<00:02:45.900> Vicki<00:02:46.590> around

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
boys pretty trippy Vicki around

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.370 
boys pretty trippy Vicki around
basically<00:02:50.850> how<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:51.880> need<00:02:52.240> to<00:02:52.390> get<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:54.640> right

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
basically how you need to get the right

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.850 
basically how you need to get the right
be<00:02:56.380> in<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.560> right<00:02:56.680> orientation

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
be in the right orientation

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.800 
be in the right orientation
it<00:02:59.340> has<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.700> six<00:03:00.510> or<00:03:00.660> eight<00:03:00.720> hours<00:03:00.840> play<00:03:01.470> first

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
it has the six or eight hours play first

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.060 
it has the six or eight hours play first
there's<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.870> whole<00:03:04.260> ton<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.560> replayability

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
there's the whole ton of replayability

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.030 
there's the whole ton of replayability
heaven<00:03:05.700> go<00:03:05.820> back<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.420> go<00:03:07.260> back<00:03:07.440> into<00:03:07.650> levels

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
heaven go back and go back into levels
