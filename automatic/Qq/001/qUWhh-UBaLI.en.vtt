really<00:01:20.709> nicely<00:01:20.920> though<00:01:21.219> so<00:01:21.459> it<00:01:21.700> could<00:01:21.909> be<00:01:21.939> like

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
really nicely though so it could be like

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.239 
really nicely though so it could be like

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.019 
foam layers which is cool but when I put
them<00:01:56.349> on<00:01:56.469> the<00:01:56.679> heel<00:01:57.099> itself<00:01:57.429> was<00:01:57.639> really

00:01:58.019 --> 00:01:58.029 
them on the heel itself was really

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:59.699 
them on the heel itself was really
really<00:01:58.209> comfortable<00:01:58.509> so<00:01:58.929> I<00:01:58.959> was<00:01:59.139> pretty

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
really comfortable so I was pretty

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:01.980 
really comfortable so I was pretty
surprised<00:02:00.099> by<00:02:00.219> that<00:02:00.459> again<00:02:01.389> the<00:02:01.509> forefoot<00:02:01.899> is

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
surprised by that again the forefoot is

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.359 
surprised by that again the forefoot is
fairly<00:02:02.169> minimal<00:02:02.409> so<00:02:02.799> I<00:02:02.829> don't<00:02:03.069> know<00:02:03.130> if<00:02:03.249> it's

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
fairly minimal so I don't know if it's

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.739 
fairly minimal so I don't know if it's
in<00:02:03.490> there<00:02:03.669> I'm<00:02:03.939> gonna<00:02:04.119> have<00:02:04.240> to<00:02:04.389> do<00:02:04.509> some<00:02:04.659> more

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
in there I'm gonna have to do some more

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.800 
in there I'm gonna have to do some more
research<00:02:05.189> plus<00:02:06.189> go<00:02:06.520> off<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.849> what<00:02:06.880> I<00:02:06.999> feel<00:02:07.270> and

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
research plus go off of what I feel and

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.930 
research plus go off of what I feel and
all<00:02:08.229> that<00:02:08.470> kind<00:02:08.649> of<00:02:08.709> stuff<00:02:08.979> you<00:02:09.459> can<00:02:09.580> see<00:02:09.789> the

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
all that kind of stuff you can see the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.550 
all that kind of stuff you can see the
back<00:02:10.119> here<00:02:10.829> the<00:02:11.829> whole<00:02:11.980> Jimmer<00:02:12.370> thing

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
back here the whole Jimmer thing

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.810 
back here the whole Jimmer thing
I<00:02:13.590> think<00:02:14.010> it's<00:02:14.130> kind<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.280> weird<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.670> got

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
I think it's kind of weird that you got

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.570 
I think it's kind of weird that you got
a<00:02:14.850> signature<00:02:15.590> well<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.620> guess<00:02:17.070> it's<00:02:17.220> not<00:02:17.370> weird

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
a signature well I guess it's not weird

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.420 
a signature well I guess it's not weird
since<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.850> his<00:02:18.060> signatures<00:02:18.480> were<00:02:18.600> Spalding

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
since the his signatures were Spalding

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.460 
since the his signatures were Spalding
but<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.850> know<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.810> what<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.170> I'm<00:02:22.320> not

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
but you know it is what it is I'm not

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.700 
but you know it is what it is I'm not
I'm<00:02:22.590> not<00:02:22.740> knocking<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.160> guy<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:25.410> guy

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
I'm not knocking the guy so the guy

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.680 
I'm not knocking the guy so the guy
could<00:02:25.920> shoot<00:02:26.100> pretty<00:02:26.280> well<00:02:26.490> so<00:02:26.880> but<00:02:27.450> here<00:02:27.600> you

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
could shoot pretty well so but here you

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.290 
could shoot pretty well so but here you
got<00:02:27.840> like<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.140> fake<00:02:28.710> carbon-fibre<00:02:29.340> I'm<00:02:30.150> in

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.100 
this is a TPU toe cap it's kind of cool
I<00:02:43.950> do<00:02:44.370> like<00:02:44.610> that<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:45.390> pattern<00:02:45.750> on<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.900> bottom

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
I do like that the pattern on the bottom

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.600 
I do like that the pattern on the bottom
I<00:02:46.410> just<00:02:46.440> don't<00:02:46.740> know<00:02:46.830> about<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.220> section

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.120 
I just don't know about this section
here<00:02:47.900> but<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:48.930> do<00:02:49.020> like<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.710> looks<00:02:49.860> like<00:02:49.980> it

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
here but I do like this it looks like it

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.100 
here but I do like this it looks like it
would<00:02:50.280> be<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.460> good<00:02:50.880> outdoor<00:02:51.270> option<00:02:51.840> as<00:02:51.960> well

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
would be a good outdoor option as well

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.160 
would be a good outdoor option as well
so<00:02:53.180> I'm<00:02:54.180> not<00:02:54.240> going<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.510> put<00:02:54.660> these<00:02:54.750> on<00:02:54.810> feet

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
been treating me since I first saw them

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.930 
been treating me since I first saw them
I<00:03:33.630> just<00:03:34.260> didn't<00:03:34.680> want<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:34.920> pay<00:03:35.070> full<00:03:35.370> price<00:03:35.430> and

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
I just didn't want to pay full price and

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.190 
I just didn't want to pay full price and
I<00:03:36.030> knew<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:36.270> they<00:03:36.390> would<00:03:36.480> go<00:03:36.660> on<00:03:36.690> clearance

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
I knew that they would go on clearance

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.430 
I knew that they would go on clearance
and<00:03:37.650> they<00:03:38.220> finally<00:03:38.580> did<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:39.230> if<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.350> have

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
and they finally did so if you have

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.500 
and they finally did so if you have
coupons<00:03:40.920> or<00:03:41.280> winner's<00:03:41.490> circle<00:03:41.700> coupons<00:03:42.300> and

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
coupons or winner's circle coupons and

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.580 
coupons or winner's circle coupons and
things<00:03:42.690> like<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:43.110> could<00:03:43.230> probably<00:03:43.380> get

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
things like that you could probably get
