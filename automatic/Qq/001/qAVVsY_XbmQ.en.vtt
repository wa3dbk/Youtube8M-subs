of<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:52.190> X<00:02:53.190> layers<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.520> close<00:02:53.700> certain

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
of the X layers of close certain

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.160 
of the X layers of close certain
processes<00:02:54.450> before<00:02:54.570> we<00:02:54.750> can<00:02:54.840> actually<00:02:54.960> remove

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
processes before we can actually remove

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.010 
processes before we can actually remove
it<00:02:55.410> okay<00:02:56.390> all<00:02:57.390> right<00:02:57.570> it's<00:02:57.600> going<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.810> go<00:02:57.930> ahead

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
it okay all right it's going to go ahead

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:18.900 
it okay all right it's going to go ahead
and<00:02:58.170> reboot

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.450 

and<00:03:19.300> this<00:03:19.570> should<00:03:19.720> only<00:03:19.870> take<00:03:20.110> another<00:03:20.460> minute

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
and this should only take another minute

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:43.430 
and this should only take another minute
or<00:03:21.760> so

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:04:01.369 

another<00:03:44.070> country<00:03:44.550> minute<00:03:44.790> or<00:03:44.910> so

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:08.970 

we're<00:04:02.069> almost<00:04:02.249> done

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.130 

all<00:04:09.580> right<00:04:09.700> now<00:04:09.790> this<00:04:09.940> is<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.300> third<00:04:10.750> and

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
all right now this is the third and

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.460 
all right now this is the third and
final<00:04:11.280> stage<00:04:12.280> of<00:04:12.580> the<00:04:12.910> Internet<00:04:13.750> Explorer<00:04:14.080> 11

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
final stage of the Internet Explorer 11

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:37.470 
final stage of the Internet Explorer 11
removal<00:04:15.220> process

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.450 

your<00:04:38.260> system<00:04:38.590> will<00:04:38.680> probably<00:04:38.830> be<00:04:39.010> a<00:04:39.040> little

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
your system will probably be a little

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.860 
your system will probably be a little
bit<00:04:39.580> faster<00:04:39.850> than<00:04:40.150> this<00:04:40.240> one<00:04:40.420> this<00:04:40.510> is<00:04:40.570> just<00:04:40.780> a

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
bit faster than this one this is just a

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.070 
bit faster than this one this is just a
virtual<00:04:41.020> machine<00:04:41.500> so<00:04:41.740> it's<00:04:41.920> a<00:04:42.130> little<00:04:42.280> bit

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
virtual machine so it's a little bit

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.040 
virtual machine so it's a little bit
slower<00:04:44.080> than<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:44.920> average<00:04:44.950> system<00:04:46.050> because

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
slower than the average system because

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.440 
slower than the average system because
I've<00:04:47.170> only<00:04:47.290> allocated<00:04:47.800> it<00:04:47.920> so<00:04:48.100> only<00:04:48.970> allocated

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
I've only allocated it so only allocated

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:58.010 
I've only allocated it so only allocated
it<00:04:49.570> and<00:04:49.660> limited<00:04:49.930> resources

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.589 

okay

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:01.599 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:03.929 

alright<00:05:02.259> once<00:05:02.800> your<00:05:02.949> desktop<00:05:03.309> loads<00:05:03.580> let's

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:03.939 
alright once your desktop loads let's

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:08.159 
alright once your desktop loads let's
just<00:05:04.089> give<00:05:04.210> it<00:05:04.240> another<00:05:06.419> 30<00:05:07.419> seconds<00:05:07.899> here

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
just give it another 30 seconds here

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.409 
just give it another 30 seconds here
because<00:05:09.099> their<00:05:09.249> processes<00:05:10.119> are<00:05:10.209> actually

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
because their processes are actually

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:20.869 
because their processes are actually
still<00:05:10.569> loading

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:20.879 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:23.100 

okay

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
okay

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.770 
okay
well<00:05:23.650> hold<00:05:23.860> on<00:05:24.009> another<00:05:24.580> another<00:05:25.090> 30<00:05:25.389> seconds

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
well hold on another another 30 seconds

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.210 
well hold on another another 30 seconds
here<00:05:25.900> looks<00:05:26.169> like<00:05:28.169> okay<00:05:29.169> alright<00:05:29.560> and<00:05:29.770> just<00:05:29.800> in

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
here looks like okay alright and just in

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.860 
here looks like okay alright and just in
case<00:05:30.400> let's<00:05:30.610> just<00:05:30.669> go<00:05:30.879> ahead<00:05:30.970> and<00:05:31.360> open<00:05:31.629> it

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
case let's just go ahead and open it

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.189 
case let's just go ahead and open it
explore<00:05:32.319> and<00:05:32.879> make<00:05:33.879> sure<00:05:34.090> that<00:05:34.270> we<00:05:34.509> have<00:05:34.780> been

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
explore and make sure that we have been

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:46.480 
explore and make sure that we have been
downgraded<00:05:35.740> to<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.580> previous<00:05:36.970> version

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.250 

okay<00:05:47.330> let's<00:05:47.690> just<00:05:47.780> do<00:05:48.050> them

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
okay let's just do them

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.170 
okay let's just do them
okay<00:05:50.040> all<00:05:50.250> right<00:05:50.400> so<00:05:50.550> it's<00:05:50.670> all<00:05:50.940> right<00:05:51.060> so

okay all right so it's all right so

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.310 
okay all right so it's all right so
we're<00:05:51.300> all<00:05:51.420> the<00:05:51.480> way<00:05:51.540> back<00:05:51.720> down<00:05:51.750> to<00:05:52.110> eight

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
we're all the way back down to eight

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.620 
we're all the way back down to eight
okay<00:05:53.280> so<00:05:53.340> I'm<00:05:53.610> just<00:05:53.670> going<00:05:53.880> to<00:05:53.940> go<00:05:54.120> ahead<00:05:54.240> and

okay so I'm just going to go ahead and

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:01.879 
okay so I'm just going to go ahead and
run<00:05:54.870> through<00:05:55.110> the<00:05:57.650> setup

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.730 

never<00:06:02.889> use<00:06:03.100> Express<00:06:03.490> settings<00:06:04.560> because<00:06:05.560> I

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
never use Express settings because I

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:13.570 
never use Express settings because I
just<00:06:05.889> can't<00:06:06.100> trust<00:06:06.190> Microsoft<00:06:06.790> that<00:06:06.910> way

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.440

okay all right that's it okay now this

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.150 
okay all right that's it okay now this
is<00:06:18.570> an<00:06:18.720> old<00:06:18.930> Evert<00:06:19.260> this<00:06:19.470> is<00:06:19.560> an<00:06:19.650> older<00:06:19.950> browser

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
is an old Evert this is an older browser

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.480 
is an old Evert this is an older browser
I<00:06:20.400> mean<00:06:20.580> in<00:06:20.700> an<00:06:20.790> explorer<00:06:21.120> 8<00:06:21.330> is<00:06:21.570> old<00:06:22.500> alright

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
I mean in an explorer 8 is old alright

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.110 
I mean in an explorer 8 is old alright
so<00:06:23.850> what<00:06:24.150> you'll<00:06:24.300> probably<00:06:24.360> want<00:06:24.720> to<00:06:24.750> do<00:06:24.960> is<00:06:26.120> if

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
so what you'll probably want to do is if

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.970 
so what you'll probably want to do is if
you<00:06:27.300> haven't<00:06:27.480> probably<00:06:27.750> Explorer<00:06:28.440> 8<00:06:28.680> I

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
you haven't probably Explorer 8 I

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.580 
you haven't probably Explorer 8 I
probably<00:06:29.670> would<00:06:29.850> at<00:06:29.940> least<00:06:30.410> upgrade<00:06:31.410> to

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
probably would at least upgrade to

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.980 
probably would at least upgrade to
