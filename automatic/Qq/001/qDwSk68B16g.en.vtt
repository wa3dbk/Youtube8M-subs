00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.740
 Tomorrow should make the peace castle 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.909
 not for a long time back 

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:10.959
 Why 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.959
 to show you my my profile 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.730
 my potential here is a kind of sandbox game novel 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.800
 resource depletion 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.460
 life is 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.730
 and then 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.460
 Building things from it I think my perfume was so pretty much every teacher met 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.460
 do not forward that 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.070
 I want to be mine for a while now that I was recently 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.960
 profiled on the market 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.330
 a column starts to build so pick up a pixel of the WEF 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.400
 and may not be the first finalist I am a woman and as I have seen 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.140
 that I can do it differently at the neighbor of our sites 80 times 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.390
 Topics like that 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.070
 but it did 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.630
 I've got more sausage sausage on states yet 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.060
 have 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.060
 than that you're the first to partner with it 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.730
 then here 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.660
 not mine needs 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.910
 not only is Microsoft quoted as the title 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.300
 Armin Reto even so without Boll local industry 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.260
 I wanted to have technocrats 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.540
 at the Heimturnier in color Wiesmeier Kraft 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.240
 I have Super Mario land here 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.230
 and a line and a matching game against us all in Cooper 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.960
 in the rehearsal room 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.850
 the dull ones 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.399
 and fourth book on the church in Rheine now comes Manuel May 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.050
 he comes out of the game 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.940
 I think it can be quite a lot of people with numbers right but me 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.449
 I believe 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.430
 brown 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.259
 we had the opportunity 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:14.259
 So I'll tell the Wettenberger 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:20.619
 the Rewe Group 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:23.279
 at that time, however 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:26.279
 were Vogue 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.319
 and yes here 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.719
 Eels comander 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.449
 a reader favorite program of the stallion Hersbruck and US consumers 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.599
 Thank you to the semester more parks from the CEO and income 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.900
 I think my world will be right again and put it at the right time 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.409
 next time
