00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
was always built from the beginning for

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.150 
was always built from the beginning for
an<00:01:00.390> app<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:01.020> wanted<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.530> always<00:01:01.680> said<00:01:01.980> how

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
an app that we wanted we always said how

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.490 
an app that we wanted we always said how
would<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:02.690> approach<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.840> calendar<00:01:04.260> app<00:01:04.379> how

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
would we approach a calendar app how

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.170 
would we approach a calendar app how
would<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:04.860> want<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.220> work<00:01:05.309> with<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.670> what<00:01:06.119> are

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
would we want to work with it what are

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.760 
would we want to work with it what are
things<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.659> would<00:01:06.900> do<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.290> would<00:01:07.439> make<00:01:07.470> it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
things we would do that would make it

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.620 
things we would do that would make it
better<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.070> yeah<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.820> definitely<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.540> was

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
better and yeah it's definitely it was

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.420 
better and yeah it's definitely it was
our<00:01:09.810> app<00:01:10.020> first<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.680> designed<00:01:10.979> an<00:01:11.070> app<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.189> we

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
our app first we designed an app that we

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.590 
our app first we designed an app that we
would<00:01:11.580> want<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.820> use<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.180> figured

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
would want to use then we figured

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600 
would want to use then we figured
everyone<00:01:13.140> thank<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.040> for<00:01:14.250> here<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.549> you

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
everyone thank you for here that you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.490 
everyone thank you for here that you
would<00:01:14.640> love<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.330> understand<00:01:16.049> he<00:01:16.320> comes

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
would love it so I understand he comes

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.080 
would love it so I understand he comes
up<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.710> lot<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.950> ideas<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.640> hey<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:17.939> can

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
up with a lot of ideas like hey we can

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.899 
up with a lot of ideas like hey we can
do<00:01:18.210> bi-directional<00:01:18.990> scrolling<00:01:19.640> but<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.759> have

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
do bi-directional scrolling but you have

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.520 
do bi-directional scrolling but you have
to<00:01:21.030> implement<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.509> how<00:01:21.659> how<00:01:22.080> does<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.380> look

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
to implement that how how does that look

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.490 
to implement that how how does that look
how<00:01:22.890> hard<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.460> task<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.119> mean<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
how hard is that a task I mean the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.020 
how hard is that a task I mean the
actual<00:01:25.619> implementation<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.430> stuff<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.820> it's

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
actual implementation of stuff is it's

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.990 
actual implementation of stuff is it's
easy

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
easy

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.100

down something like a normal human and

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.540 
down something like a normal human and
you<00:02:28.020> magically<00:02:28.620> create<00:02:28.980> events<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.460> the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
you magically create events in the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.520 
you magically create events in the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
that maybe this beautiful engine could

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.810 
that maybe this beautiful engine could
find<00:02:34.650> its<00:02:34.830> way<00:02:34.920> into<00:02:34.950> other<00:02:35.250> products<00:02:35.700> that

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
find its way into other products that
