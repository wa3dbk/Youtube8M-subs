00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
some of these shots

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.720 
some of these shots
obviously<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.440> resolution<00:01:02.190> could<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.579> been

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
obviously the resolution could have been

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.119 
obviously the resolution could have been
a<00:01:02.760> lot<00:01:03.090> better<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.530> know<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> lot<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.890> shots

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
a lot better and you know a lot of shots

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.789 
a lot better and you know a lot of shots
are<00:01:05.369> heavily<00:01:05.670> edited<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.900> didn't<00:01:07.229> crop

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
are heavily edited so I didn't crop

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.859 
are heavily edited so I didn't crop
these<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.640> didn't<00:01:08.909> change<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.330> contrast

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
these and I didn't change the contrast

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.010 
these and I didn't change the contrast
or<00:01:10.170> balance<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.860> any<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.460> these<00:01:11.549> shots<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:12.990> I

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
or balance on any of these shots so I

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.899 
or balance on any of these shots so I
just<00:01:13.229> thought<00:01:13.409> I'd<00:01:13.619> leave<00:01:14.070> them<00:01:14.280> as<00:01:14.549> just

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
just thought I'd leave them as just

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.310 
just thought I'd leave them as just
plain<00:01:15.720> conversions<00:01:16.560> only<00:01:17.220> not<00:01:17.580> change<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
plain conversions only not change the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.899 
plain conversions only not change the
contrast<00:01:19.320> or<00:01:19.560> balance<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.159> likewise<00:01:20.580> since

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
contrast or balance and likewise since

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.050 
contrast or balance and likewise since
this<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:22.159> 12.1<00:01:23.159> megapixel<00:01:23.900> Nikon<00:01:24.900> d700

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
this is a 12.1 megapixel Nikon d700

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.520 
this is a 12.1 megapixel Nikon d700
obviously<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.140> get<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> lot<00:01:28.500> more

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
obviously you can get a lot more

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.420 
obviously you can get a lot more
resolution<00:01:29.400> with<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.030> particular<00:01:30.600> lens<00:01:30.900> out

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430

conversions<00:02:20.690> with<00:02:21.010> ad700<00:02:22.040> is<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.520> you're

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
conversions with ad700 is that you're

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.690 
conversions with ad700 is that you're
not<00:02:23.209> dealing<00:02:23.540> with<00:02:23.959> absolutely<00:02:24.800> Titanic

sized<00:02:26.450> RAW<00:02:27.290> files<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.280> makes<00:02:28.880> things

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
sized RAW files so that makes things

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.960 
sized RAW files so that makes things
that<00:02:29.540> kind<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:29.870> easy<00:02:30.500> especially<00:02:30.890> when<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.250> do<00:02:31.459> a

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
that kind of easy especially when I do a

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.170 
that kind of easy especially when I do a
bunch<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.860> conversions<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.190> makes<00:02:35.000> them

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
bunch of conversions and makes them

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.449 
bunch of conversions and makes them
easier<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.660> deal<00:02:35.870> with<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.530> said<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.310> even

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
easier to deal with and I said that even

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.160 
easier to deal with and I said that even
though<00:02:37.640> it's<00:02:37.730> not<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.850> 12<00:02:38.060> megapixel<00:02:38.209> camera

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
though it's not a 12 megapixel camera

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.190 
though it's not a 12 megapixel camera
you<00:02:39.500> can<00:02:39.650> print<00:02:40.220> out<00:02:40.310> gorgeous<00:02:41.000> 20<00:02:41.870> by<00:02:41.989> 30

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
you can print out gorgeous 20 by 30

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.970 
you can print out gorgeous 20 by 30
prints<00:02:43.000> from<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.209> d700<00:02:45.050> so<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.380> megapixel

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
prints from the d700 so the megapixel

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.880 
prints from the d700 so the megapixel
wars<00:02:46.190> really<00:02:46.610> are<00:02:46.790> over<00:02:47.269> so<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:47.840> just<00:02:48.709> thought

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
wars really are over so I just thought

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.650 
wars really are over so I just thought
I'd<00:02:49.070> show<00:02:49.100> you<00:02:49.550> some<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:50.030> these<00:02:50.120> pictures<00:02:50.450> and

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
I'd show you some of these pictures and

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.240 
I'd show you some of these pictures and
also<00:02:51.080> these<00:02:51.380> could<00:02:51.560> have<00:02:51.620> been<00:02:51.680> sharper<00:02:52.100> like

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
also these could have been sharper like

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.640 
also these could have been sharper like
I<00:02:52.280> said<00:02:52.489> I<00:02:52.519> could<00:02:52.760> have<00:02:52.850> done<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.260> 1200<00:02:54.260> dpi

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
I said I could have done a 1200 dpi

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.370 
I said I could have done a 1200 dpi
conversion<00:02:55.580> or<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:55.959> thousand<00:02:56.959> but<00:02:57.080> I<00:02:57.110> chose

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
conversion or a thousand but I chose

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.580 
conversion or a thousand but I chose
just<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.800> make<00:02:58.040> them<00:02:58.190> simple<00:03:00.040> simple<00:03:01.040> 800<00:03:01.670> dpi

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
just to make them simple simple 800 dpi

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.530 
just to make them simple simple 800 dpi
sample<00:03:03.590> conversions<00:03:04.130> I<00:03:04.790> will<00:03:05.150> have<00:03:05.300> like<00:03:05.510> I

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
sample conversions I will have like I

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.800 
sample conversions I will have like I
