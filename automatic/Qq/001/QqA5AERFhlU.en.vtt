orgeous<00:04:55.120> resignation<00:04:56.020> Wow<00:04:56.729> so<00:04:57.729> why<00:04:58.330> did<00:04:58.510> he

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
orgeous resignation Wow so why did he

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.719 
orgeous resignation Wow so why did he
resign<00:04:58.960> that<00:04:59.020> quick<00:04:59.530> I<00:05:00.690> think<00:05:01.690> that<00:05:01.990> was<00:05:02.080> a

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729

premature resignation I think he could

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.210 
premature resignation I think he could
just<00:05:05.560> play<00:05:07.650> actually<00:05:08.650> how<00:05:08.770> do<00:05:08.830> we<00:05:08.949> get<00:05:09.099> an

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
just play actually how do we get an

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.540 
just play actually how do we get an
examine<00:05:09.970> mode<00:05:10.150> here<00:05:10.479> there<00:05:11.470> we<00:05:11.650> go<00:05:11.770> all<00:05:12.490> right

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
examine mode here there we go all right

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.010 
resigned I think he could just take my
queen<00:05:28.940> and<00:05:29.830> now<00:05:30.830> what<00:05:31.720> Bishop<00:05:32.720> takes<00:05:32.900> Queen

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020

takes<00:05:37.150> bishop<00:05:38.150> and<00:05:39.580> he's<00:05:40.580> up<00:05:40.760> upon<00:05:41.090> I<00:05:41.590> could<00:05:42.590> go

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
takes bishop and he's up upon I could go

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.680 
takes bishop and he's up upon I could go
here<00:05:43.160> I<00:05:43.310> have<00:05:43.490> pressure<00:05:43.760> on<00:05:43.910> the<00:05:44.090> seventh<00:05:44.420> rank

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
here I have pressure on the seventh rank

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.750 
here I have pressure on the seventh rank
but<00:05:45.340> that<00:05:46.340> was<00:05:47.800> probably<00:05:48.800> not<00:05:49.130> the<00:05:49.310> point<00:05:49.550> to

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
but that was probably not the point to

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.830 
but that was probably not the point to
be<00:05:49.790> resigning<00:05:50.570> in<00:05:50.690> I<00:05:50.900> guess<00:05:52.450> he<00:05:53.450> simply

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
be resigning in I guess he simply

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.890 
be resigning in I guess he simply
miscalculated<00:05:54.650> and<00:05:55.060> as<00:05:56.060> a<00:05:56.120> result<00:05:56.540> I<00:05:56.660> lucked

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
miscalculated and as a result I lucked

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.550 
miscalculated and as a result I lucked
out<00:05:57.050> again<00:05:58.390> so<00:05:59.390> any<00:05:59.950> questions<00:06:00.950> or<00:06:01.220> comments
