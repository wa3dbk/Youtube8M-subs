00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.160 
move the stop all the way until it
touches<00:02:26.189> the<00:02:26.400> shifter<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.420> then<00:02:27.659> you<00:02:27.959> can

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
touches the shifter and then you can

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.869 
touches the shifter and then you can
wiggle<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.739> shifter<00:02:29.069> a<00:02:29.099> little<00:02:29.310> bit<00:02:29.430> to

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
wiggle the shifter a little bit to

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:40.620 
wiggle the shifter a little bit to
create<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.360> little<00:02:30.810> bit<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.049> gap

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.600 

now<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.720> can<00:02:41.930> go<00:02:42.050> into<00:02:42.320> first<00:02:42.650> but<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:43.490> want

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
now you can go into first but you want

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.340 
now you can go into first but you want
to<00:02:43.670> be<00:02:43.730> careful<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.210> make<00:02:44.270> sure<00:02:44.420> not<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.200> move

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
to be careful and make sure not to move

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.090 
to be careful and make sure not to move
the<00:02:45.650> plastic<00:02:45.950> top<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:46.730> just<00:02:46.760> adjusted

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.530 

then<00:02:52.100> you<00:02:52.310> can<00:02:52.460> go<00:02:52.580> ahead<00:02:52.820> and<00:02:53.030> do<00:02:53.210> the<00:02:53.330> same

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
then you can go ahead and do the same

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.290 
then you can go ahead and do the same
thing<00:02:53.810> with<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.320> pair<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:54.770> shift<00:02:55.010> stop<00:02:55.300> move

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
thing with the pair and shift stop move

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.570 
thing with the pair and shift stop move
it<00:02:56.420> in<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:56.870> it<00:02:57.020> touches<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.440> shifter<00:02:57.830> then

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.210 
it in so it touches the shifter then
wiggle<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:59.030> shifter<00:02:59.390> to<00:03:00.050> make<00:03:00.230> that<00:03:00.650> small

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
wiggle the shifter to make that small

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.340 
wiggle the shifter to make that small
gap<00:03:03.640> once<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:04.760> have<00:03:04.940> those<00:03:05.120> lined<00:03:05.420> up<00:03:05.660> you<00:03:06.320> can
