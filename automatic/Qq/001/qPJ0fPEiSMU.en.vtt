 in fact numerous diners

 that is oaks 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.980
 passion and filtration he found an unknown chemical that 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.980
 it contained many well 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.640
 the processes and scholars 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.620
 I think this is what there is 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.310
 a lot of empty 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.310
 and that's how it was like that 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.070
 It was chemical compound 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.910
 if you get it as 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.150

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.150
 hence, he resigns 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.410

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.919
 It has been possible 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.919
 of vehicles between nucleotides 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.099

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:47.059
 I studied cadivi 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:50.059
 the akp has had 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:04.819
 structure moncloa nucleic acids that make it a double the ice and is 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.819
 so integrated percent are 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.719
 now for example assets 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.029
 a compact group and 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:25.679
