at the new stone foe thread splitter
this<00:00:19.660> is<00:00:19.779> a<00:00:19.810> tool<00:00:20.140> that<00:00:20.170> helps<00:00:20.529> you<00:00:20.830> split<00:00:21.310> your

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
this is a tool that helps you split your

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
thread now this tool is not designed for

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.580 
thread now this tool is not designed for
super<00:00:24.279> small<00:00:24.550> threads<00:00:24.910> like<00:00:25.090> 70<00:00:25.630> knots<00:00:25.840> 60<00:00:26.439> not

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
super small threads like 70 knots 60 not

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.339 
super small threads like 70 knots 60 not
40<00:00:27.040> knot<00:00:27.220> it's<00:00:27.730> really<00:00:28.029> designed<00:00:28.390> for<00:00:28.540> your<00:00:29.110> a

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
40 knot it's really designed for your a

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.429 
40 knot it's really designed for your a
dot<00:00:29.560> or<00:00:29.829> I<00:00:29.919> should<00:00:30.220> say<00:00:30.369> 70<00:00:30.849> denier<00:00:31.210> and<00:00:31.689> above

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
dot or I should say 70 denier and above

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.229 
dot or I should say 70 denier and above
I'm<00:00:32.829> going<00:00:32.950> to<00:00:33.010> be<00:00:33.070> splitting<00:00:33.370> one<00:00:33.640> 40<00:00:34.030> denier

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
I'm going to be splitting one 40 denier

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.510 
I'm going to be splitting one 40 denier
here<00:00:34.690> really<00:00:35.440> that<00:00:35.560> is<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:36.040> type<00:00:36.220> of<00:00:36.250> thread

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
here really that is the type of thread

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.280 
here really that is the type of thread
you<00:00:36.610> want<00:00:36.700> to<00:00:36.820> be<00:00:36.910> splitting<00:00:37.329> anyways<00:00:38.020> because

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
you want to be splitting anyways because

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.080 
you want to be splitting anyways because
there's<00:00:38.560> enough<00:00:38.770> strands<00:00:39.100> in<00:00:39.280> there<00:00:39.460> to<00:00:39.910> kind

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
there's enough strands in there to kind

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.720 
there's enough strands in there to kind
of<00:00:40.150> hold<00:00:40.329> everything<00:00:40.660> together<00:00:41.460> now<00:00:42.460> you<00:00:42.520> do

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
of hold everything together now you do

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.900 
of hold everything together now you do
want<00:00:42.910> to<00:00:42.970> choose<00:00:43.270> a<00:00:43.800> flat<00:00:44.800> or<00:00:45.160> a<00:00:45.190> semi<00:00:45.670> flat

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
want to choose a flat or a semi flat

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.930 
want to choose a flat or a semi flat
thread<00:00:46.270> like<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.540> UTC<00:00:47.350> a<00:00:47.620> good<00:00:48.220> rod<00:00:48.460> something

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
thread like a UTC a good rod something

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.850 
thread like a UTC a good rod something
like<00:00:49.090> that<00:00:49.270> you<00:00:49.420> don't<00:00:49.570> want<00:00:49.810> a<00:00:50.020> uni<00:00:50.560> thread

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
like that you don't want a uni thread

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.710 
like that you don't want a uni thread
like<00:00:51.100> uni<00:00:51.460> where<00:00:51.730> it's<00:00:51.880> completely<00:00:52.150> wound

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
like uni where it's completely wound

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.970 
like uni where it's completely wound
together<00:00:52.900> because<00:00:53.260> you<00:00:53.380> won't<00:00:53.500> be<00:00:53.740> able<00:00:53.890> to

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
together because you won't be able to

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.520 
together because you won't be able to
split<00:00:54.310> it<00:00:54.460> because<00:00:55.030> it's<00:00:55.180> not<00:00:55.360> flat<00:00:55.780> so<00:00:56.110> I'm

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
split it because it's not flat so I'm

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.410 
split it because it's not flat so I'm
using<00:00:56.740> UTC<00:00:57.310> here<00:00:57.550> it's<00:00:57.700> actually<00:00:57.790> easiest<00:00:58.330> if

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
using UTC here it's actually easiest if

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.020 
using UTC here it's actually easiest if
you<00:00:58.510> let<00:00:58.690> your<00:00:58.810> UTC<00:00:59.320> kind<00:00:59.560> of<00:00:59.620> unwind<00:01:00.100> I<00:01:00.490> just

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
you let your UTC kind of unwind I just

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.430 
you let your UTC kind of unwind I just
let<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.240> bobbin<00:01:01.510> hang<00:01:01.690> there<00:01:01.870> for<00:01:01.900> a<00:01:02.110> second

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
let the bobbin hang there for a second

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.740 
let the bobbin hang there for a second
let<00:01:02.620> it<00:01:02.740> unwind<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.340> flat<00:01:03.580> now<00:01:03.790> then<00:01:04.479> you<00:01:04.570> just

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
let it unwind and flat now then you just

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.690 
let it unwind and flat now then you just
take<00:01:04.930> your<00:01:05.110> your<00:01:05.530> threader<00:01:05.890> or<00:01:06.220> your<00:01:06.340> splitter

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
take your your threader or your splitter

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.160 
take your your threader or your splitter
and<00:01:07.299> you<00:01:07.420> see<00:01:07.570> there's<00:01:07.720> a<00:01:07.780> little<00:01:07.900> notch<00:01:08.140> there

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
and you see there's a little notch there

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.539 
and you see there's a little notch there
and<00:01:08.680> I'm<00:01:08.770> just<00:01:08.890> going<00:01:09.040> to<00:01:09.130> take<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.369> thread

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
and I'm just going to take the thread

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:10.649 
and I'm just going to take the thread
I'm<00:01:09.700> just<00:01:09.820> going<00:01:09.939> to<00:01:09.970> put<00:01:10.150> it<00:01:10.240> in<00:01:10.360> that<00:01:10.390> little

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
I'm just going to put it in that little

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.170 
I'm just going to put it in that little
notch<00:01:10.930> now<00:01:11.890> it's<00:01:12.070> easiest<00:01:12.490> if<00:01:12.790> you<00:01:12.850> actually

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
notch now it's easiest if you actually

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.969 
notch now it's easiest if you actually
take<00:01:13.509> this<00:01:13.659> tool<00:01:13.900> hold<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:14.259> straight<00:01:14.560> up<00:01:14.590> and

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
take this tool hold it straight up and

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.010 
take this tool hold it straight up and
you<00:01:15.280> get<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.580> tool<00:01:15.790> above<00:01:16.300> your<00:01:16.510> hook<00:01:16.780> and

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
you get the tool above your hook and

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.930 
you get the tool above your hook and
just<00:01:17.590> let<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.830> bobbin<00:01:18.190> kind<00:01:18.490> of<00:01:18.550> hang<00:01:18.730> there

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
just let the bobbin kind of hang there

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.280 
just let the bobbin kind of hang there
off<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.090> back<00:01:19.360> and<00:01:19.570> that<00:01:19.659> way<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:19.990> thread<00:01:20.170> is

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
off the back and that way the thread is

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.410 
off the back and that way the thread is
making<00:01:20.560> contact<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:21.280> both<00:01:21.820> little<00:01:22.210> notches

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
making contact and both little notches

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.840 
making contact and both little notches
and<00:01:22.870> it's<00:01:23.320> lined<00:01:23.560> up<00:01:23.740> if<00:01:23.980> you're<00:01:24.400> trying<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.670> do

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
and it's lined up if you're trying to do

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.390 
and it's lined up if you're trying to do
it<00:01:24.970> like<00:01:25.150> this<00:01:25.600> it's<00:01:26.530> much<00:01:26.680> harder<00:01:26.979> to<00:01:27.130> do

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
it like this it's much harder to do

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.610 
it like this it's much harder to do
because<00:01:27.940> your<00:01:28.330> thread<00:01:28.630> is<00:01:28.840> not<00:01:29.020> necessarily

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
because your thread is not necessarily

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.350 
because your thread is not necessarily
in<00:01:29.860> your<00:01:29.950> notches<00:01:30.159> it's<00:01:30.610> possible<00:01:31.150> you<00:01:31.300> just

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
in your notches it's possible you just

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.190 
in your notches it's possible you just
kind<00:01:31.600> of<00:01:31.630> have<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.810> hold<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.400> thread<00:01:33.400> tight

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
kind of have to hold the thread tight

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.950 
kind of have to hold the thread tight
and<00:01:35.200> then<00:01:35.860> push<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.580> tool<00:01:37.390> through<00:01:37.659> there<00:01:37.840> and

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
and then push the tool through there and

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.260 
and then push the tool through there and
you<00:01:38.020> can<00:01:38.170> see<00:01:38.409> I<00:01:38.650> went<00:01:39.430> ahead<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:39.790> split<00:01:40.090> the

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
you can see I went ahead and split the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.170 
you can see I went ahead and split the
thread<00:01:41.040> what<00:01:42.040> I<00:01:42.070> found<00:01:42.340> is<00:01:42.549> actually<00:01:42.670> easiest

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
thread what I found is actually easiest

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.490 
thread what I found is actually easiest
if<00:01:43.270> you<00:01:43.299> take<00:01:43.510> the<00:01:43.630> tool<00:01:43.840> hold<00:01:44.110> it<00:01:44.229> straight<00:01:44.470> up

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
if you take the tool hold it straight up

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.770 
if you take the tool hold it straight up
and<00:01:44.680> down<00:01:44.820> split<00:01:45.820> your<00:01:45.970> thread<00:01:46.299> and<00:01:46.600> then<00:01:46.720> you

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
and down split your thread and then you

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.930 
and down split your thread and then you

this<00:02:03.729> tool<00:02:03.970> is<00:02:04.270> not<00:02:04.479> perfect<00:02:05.140> it<00:02:05.320> doesn't<00:02:05.530> do

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
this tool is not perfect it doesn't do

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.990 
this tool is not perfect it doesn't do
it<00:02:05.830> every<00:02:06.010> time<00:02:06.159> if<00:02:06.340> you're<00:02:06.490> just<00:02:06.670> slightly

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
it every time if you're just slightly

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.449 
it every time if you're just slightly
off<00:02:07.240> if<00:02:08.049> you're<00:02:08.289> pulling<00:02:08.649> one<00:02:08.860> way<00:02:09.009> like<00:02:09.280> let's

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
off if you're pulling one way like let's

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:10.619 
off if you're pulling one way like let's
say<00:02:09.610> here<00:02:09.819> I'm<00:02:09.909> kind<00:02:10.090> of<00:02:10.149> pulling<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.539> side

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
say here I'm kind of pulling to the side

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.320 
say here I'm kind of pulling to the side
it's<00:02:11.409> not<00:02:11.650> going<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.040> split<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.459> so<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.209> have

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
it's not going to split it so you have

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.610 
it's not going to split it so you have
to<00:02:13.450> hold<00:02:13.659> it<00:02:13.810> kind<00:02:14.019> of<00:02:14.049> straight<00:02:14.290> up<00:02:14.319> and<00:02:14.560> down

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
to hold it kind of straight up and down

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.949 
to hold it kind of straight up and down
you<00:02:14.709> gotta<00:02:15.040> line<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.370> up<00:02:15.430> perfectly<00:02:15.909> then<00:02:16.750> you

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
you gotta line it up perfectly then you

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.760 
you gotta line it up perfectly then you
can<00:02:17.730> split<00:02:18.730> your<00:02:19.030> thread<00:02:20.020> but<00:02:20.290> like<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.560> said

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.190 
it's not perfect and sometimes you kind
of<00:02:22.810> have<00:02:22.959> to

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
of have to

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.050

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
make sure that it is in that center of

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.400 
make sure that it is in that center of
that<00:02:30.280> split<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.940> if<00:02:31.690> you're<00:02:31.840> trying<00:02:31.990> to<00:02:32.110> split

that split and if you're trying to split

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.600 
that split and if you're trying to split
70<00:02:32.830> knot

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
well good luck I mean it's probably not
