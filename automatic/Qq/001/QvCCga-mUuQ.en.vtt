00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hi all friends and mirrors 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.620
 with and after a few days of vacation 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.660
 I came back today with this new one 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.160
 comment first I translate the 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.599
 background match that is a match 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.460
 made into a crazy nye server on 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.450
 battlefield 3 the six ever crazy are 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.580
 those servers that you can use 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.929
 just the knife and I believe this 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.810
 game modes are particularly 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.680
 funny so I thought I'd propose it 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.390
 but no more talk and let's move on 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.039
 to today's topic as you know ho 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.140
 recently assembled in the first pc of the 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.970
 gaming and when I was looking around for June 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.650
 components on the online shop from which then 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.510
 I bought it often 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.859
 see pre-assembled PCs that came 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.140
 sold with the characteristic of being 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.640
 pc gaming until these PCs were 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.649
 fixed pc I thought it was all normal 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.480
 even if personally I don't like many PCs 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.280
 preassembled but it happened to me several times 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.270
 to also see laptops that 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.399
 they were sold with this 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.200
 feature seeing these computers 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.270
 I started to wonder if i really 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.070
 portable gaming pc would have been in 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.050
 able to offer us a great experience 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.579
 similar or almost equal to that which there is 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.930
 it is offered by a fixed PC 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.250
 now how much all my ideas all 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.629
 my reasoning and I want branches 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.890
 today in this he comments so that later 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.329
 you let me know what it is 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.590
 think about what your ideas are at 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.850
 about 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.350
 first I would like to premise that 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.700
 so I also have a laptop 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.380
 I have experienced firsthand what 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.020
 means playing on a peripheral not 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.850
 fixed the first thing I thought of is the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.200
 comfort factor of a pc gaming 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.360
 portable I will explain to you better what 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.680
 I mean on a laptop we don't 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.119
 we have the ability to move the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.979
 keyboard is the screen to ours 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.509
 liking being attacked and 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.340
 this can be inconvenient for 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.720
 people like me who love playing with it 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.100
 screen very far from the eyes but that 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.619
 they want to have the nearest keyboard 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.479
 also possible on a laptop a lot 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.130
 often for reasons of space there 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.509
 are provided by the large keyboards there 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.740
 those low keyboards are given 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.720
 profile that I personally don't appreciate 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.070
 a lot on a landline instead we can 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.150
 choose us our keyboard and 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.070
 we can buy for example one 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.150
 mechanics like mine that has a great 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.520
 feeling and to really play 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.530
 fantastic and low profile keyboard 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.240
 also according to my opinion they bring us 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.680
 to press the wrong keys in moments 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.210
 in which we will not have to make mistakes because 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.579
 they helped too close to each other that 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.840
 very often they confuse us 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.490
 the second factor I thought of is 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.810
 certainly the visual impact of a PC 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.790
 portable I will explain to you better what 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.320
 I mean simply on a desktop PC 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.700
 we have the possibility to choose us 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.560
 our monitors eg ho 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.570
 bought a 23 asus monitor 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.060
 inches with a resolution of 1900 20 x 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.039
 1080 on a laptop being therefore 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.870
 a small pc created to bring it in 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.980
 around when you go for example on the road 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.480
 we must limit ourselves to the resolution 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.310
 chosen by the manufacturer that very often 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.780
 consists of a screen enough 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.540
 small that does not allow us to play 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.430
 excellently you play as you surely know 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.720
 that big screens help a lot because 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.459
 allow us to see many details 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.810
 that on small screens instead are 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.190
 invisible 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.120
 the third factor I thought of is a 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.590
 most linked factor in the world 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.690
 of hardware in general or the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.400
 cooling of internal components on 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.690
 a laptop pc as the producers yes 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.730
 they are committed to saving space 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.230
 often we are forced to reduce the 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.700
 their number also becomes their size 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.950
 and this leads the PC to be often 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.359
 very hot or to produce a big one 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.250
 noise when it needs to be cooled 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.109
 correctly which greatly reduces the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.160
 life of our computer on a landline 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.629
 instead we have the possibility of 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.310
 install a lot of wind saw that 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.040
 churches are very spacious and the reaction 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.780
 another factor is almost always excellent 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.040
 that varies a lot the pc top but I would like 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.420
 however dealing is the possibility of 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.920
 conveniently install all the 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.620
 external devices we need 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.060
 without having space problems for 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.440
 how many laptops already have one 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.549
 installed keyboard by default than not 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.319
 requires no connection 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.299
 very often these computers do not have 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.370
 many usb ports are usually two or three 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.810
 they are very often occupied 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.310
 completely from external devices 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.260
 which we have to connect for example 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.639
 the mouse and led set 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.139
 this brings us into a situation for 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.579
 which if we need to connect 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.630
 other elements we are forced to 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.950
 unplug something else 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.810
 because obviously we don't have enough 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.579
 space to connect everything without having to 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.230
 unplug anything 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.849
 the last of the negative factors of a pc 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.440
 portable if we so wish to call 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.299
 those I've talked about so far is a 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.910
 my opinion is the general idea from which it was 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.109
 conceived a computer like this like 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.549
 I told you at the beginning of the video also 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.690
 owns a laptop that you can 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.220
 play but I believe in all of these 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.139
 years the only movements it has 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.970
 have been passed by the living room of 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.319
 my house in my room is the only time 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.549
 that came out of home was right in 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.959
 these days this week where 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.389
 I have been away from home and I am 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.769
 brought to play in free time 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.730
 however even in these days when 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.290
 he was on vacation I didn't hear 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.879
 particularly need to have a 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.109
 computer with me since I am 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.730
 practically always been away 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.220
 from the hotel and moments to play in 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.989
 indeed, they had very few 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.340
 I could easily do without 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.900
 of my laptop I would simply have 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.629
 waiting to go home to be able 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.919
 play again on my landline with 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:15.510
 this speech I want to get to tell you 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.130
 that very often we buy PCs 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.299
 laptops thinking that when we will be away 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.410
 from home to travel 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.180
 we will bring them and we will use them 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.620
 this is most often the case 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.880
 sometimes it doesn't happen and we start a 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.440
 ask why we have not saved 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.350
 our money to buy a pc 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.640
 that we use 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.310
 much more often it is certainly more 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.230
 performance as obviously as in any 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.430
 what there are not only negative likes 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.660
 but also positive 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.280
 to me personally snow in mind 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.450
 only one I will talk about now but 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.760
 I'm sure many of you in the 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.140
 comments opens year tell me more 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.430
 the positive side that comes to mind is 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.750
 linked to the world of gaming at the level 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.220
 international when there are such examples 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.870
 great tournaments of great competitions 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.370
 or when we simply want to 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.930
 organize a lampard with ours 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.040
 friends 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.660
 we choose to go to one of these 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.250
 tournaments and we are forced to take the 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.140
 our desktop pc since we don't have a 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.340
 portable and very often to carry 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.750
 these very large computers and 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.980
 bulky quite difficult yes 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.470
 it also risks that they break a lot 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.790
 easily with a laptop the most thing 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.410
 simple because if you can carry it 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.060
 very quietly so we can 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.710
 participate in the tournament without worrying 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.270
 nothing 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.890
 it must be said though that sometimes 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.600
 these tournaments provide the 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.490
 their computer to let those who want to play play 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.170
 participate even if this does not happen 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.480
 that's why a laptop in this 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.400
 case may be convenient 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.750
 in conclusion then summing up a 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.730
 my opinion is a portable gaming pc 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.140
 useful only 6 we often participate 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.820
 from events away from home or from us 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.190
 force to bring our computer 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.660
 if instead we prefer to rest easy in 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.190
 home a pc is definitely a lot 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.990
 better because it allows us to stay longer 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.520
 comfortable and if we have assembled it 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.050
 we also have the possibility to have the 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.310
 check its components in order to 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.020
 always have the services listed 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.490
 we need 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.320
 these guys are just mine 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.000
 personal I am very curious to know
