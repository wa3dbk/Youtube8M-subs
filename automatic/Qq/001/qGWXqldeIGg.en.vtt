first<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.870> all<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:03.989> thought<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.799> looked

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
first of all I thought this looked

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.460 
first of all I thought this looked
terrible<00:01:05.610> but<00:01:05.729> then<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.939> realized<00:01:06.330> that's<00:01:07.320> not

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
terrible but then I realized that's not

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.490 
terrible but then I realized that's not
the<00:01:07.680> cut<00:01:07.860> out<00:01:08.040> it's<00:01:08.250> actually<00:01:08.400> fine<00:01:09.500> that'll

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
the cut out it's actually fine that'll

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.060 
the cut out it's actually fine that'll
that'll<00:01:10.770> work<00:01:11.040> out<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:12.530> look<00:01:13.530> at<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.740> black

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
that'll work out but look at this black

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.310 
that'll work out but look at this black
here<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.700> don't<00:01:15.420> know<00:01:15.509> how<00:01:15.630> that's<00:01:15.840> gonna<00:01:16.020> look

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
here I don't know how that's gonna look

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.910 
here I don't know how that's gonna look
I<00:01:19.670> don't<00:01:20.670> know<00:01:20.850> what<00:01:21.000> happened<00:01:21.360> actually<00:01:21.920> I'm

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
I don't know what happened actually I'm

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.590 
I don't know what happened actually I'm
assuming<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.790> because<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.090> over

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
assuming it's just because it's over

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
if there's meant to be there or if it's

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.100 
if there's meant to be there or if it's
just<00:01:54.450> over<00:01:55.700> expanded<00:01:56.700> when<00:01:57.090> i<00:01:57.119> was<00:01:57.420> creating

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
just over expanded when i was creating

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.910 
just over expanded when i was creating
the<00:01:58.259> skin<00:01:58.579> i'm<00:01:59.579> not<00:01:59.729> sure<00:02:00.000> i<00:02:00.270> would<00:02:00.770> kind<00:02:01.770> of

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the skin i'm not sure i would kind of

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.600 
the skin i'm not sure i would kind of
expect<00:02:02.689> that<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:04.020> flag<00:02:04.500> would<00:02:04.710> go<00:02:04.890> across<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
expect that the flag would go across the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.820 
expect that the flag would go across the
whole<00:02:06.049> macbook<00:02:07.049> pro<00:02:07.290> this<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.799> 15<00:02:08.250> inch

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
whole macbook pro this is the 15 inch

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.670 
whole macbook pro this is the 15 inch
why<00:02:09.670> wouldn't<00:02:10.000> they<00:02:10.090> just<00:02:10.270> make<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.840> image<00:02:11.500> at

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
why wouldn't they just make the image at

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.470 
why wouldn't they just make the image at
a<00:02:11.710> higher<00:02:11.980> resolution<00:02:12.480> I'm<00:02:13.480> not<00:02:13.990> too<00:02:14.260> sure<00:02:14.470> and

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
a higher resolution I'm not too sure and

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.920 
a higher resolution I'm not too sure and
let<00:02:16.480> me<00:02:16.630> show<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.910> only<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.510> thing<00:02:19.720> is

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
let me show you the only the thing is

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.080 
let me show you the only the thing is
with<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.260> skins<00:02:20.620> around<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.460> corners<00:02:21.910> you're

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
with the skins around the corners you're

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.590 
with the skins around the corners you're
not<00:02:22.240> going<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.450> get<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.690> perfect<00:02:22.870> here<00:02:23.560> so

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
not going to get it perfect here so

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.630 
not going to get it perfect here so
maybe<00:02:25.600> I<00:02:25.750> should<00:02:26.110> have<00:02:26.200> stopped<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.370> around

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
maybe I should have stopped it around

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.030 
maybe I should have stopped it around
here<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:28.210> it<00:02:28.330> doesn't<00:02:28.570> have<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.870> go<00:02:29.620> around<00:02:29.740> the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
here so it doesn't have to go around the

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.380 
here so it doesn't have to go around the
edge<00:02:30.190> but<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:31.000> wanted<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.540> full<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:33.270> wanted<00:02:34.270> the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
edge but I wanted the full I wanted the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.500 
edge but I wanted the full I wanted the
skin<00:02:34.750> on<00:02:36.270> fully<00:02:37.270> with<00:02:37.570> no<00:02:37.810> gaps<00:02:39.210> here's<00:02:40.210> with

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
skin on fully with no gaps here's with

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.790 
skin on fully with no gaps here's with
it<00:02:40.720> open<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:42.630> apple<00:02:43.630> logo<00:02:43.770> shining<00:02:44.770> very

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
it open and the apple logo shining very

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.180 
it open and the apple logo shining very
nicely<00:02:45.570> so<00:02:46.570> I'm<00:02:46.990> probably<00:02:47.410> going<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:47.830> use<00:02:48.010> this

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
nicely so I'm probably going to use this

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.290 
nicely so I'm probably going to use this
for<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.490> couple<00:02:48.640> weeks<00:02:48.959> not<00:02:49.959> sure<00:02:50.380> about<00:02:51.300> having

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
for a couple weeks not sure about having

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.570 
for a couple weeks not sure about having
