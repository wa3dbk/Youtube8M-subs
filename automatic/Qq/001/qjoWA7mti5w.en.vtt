00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
will do it really good but I think it's

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.090 
will do it really good but I think it's
because<00:05:14.180> for<00:05:14.870> my<00:05:14.990> hair<00:05:15.200> got<00:05:15.470> bleached<00:05:15.770> more

because for my hair got bleached more

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.740 
because for my hair got bleached more
and<00:05:16.340> got<00:05:16.460> a<00:05:16.520> thinner<00:05:16.790> it's<00:05:17.090> really<00:05:17.419> hard<00:05:17.630> to

and got a thinner it's really hard to

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.720 
and got a thinner it's really hard to
make<00:05:17.930> it<00:05:17.960> look<00:05:18.230> nice<00:05:18.440> and<00:05:18.770> puffy<00:05:19.130> look<00:05:19.580> like

under<00:06:25.729> I<00:06:25.879> don't<00:06:26.059> know<00:06:26.149> I<00:06:26.360> just<00:06:26.389> it's<00:06:26.959> not<00:06:27.139> one

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 
under I don't know I just it's not one

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:28.739 
under I don't know I just it's not one
of<00:06:27.349> those<00:06:27.529> things<00:06:27.709> I<00:06:27.919> like<00:06:28.069> to<00:06:28.099> do<00:06:28.339> it's<00:06:28.610> just

00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:28.749 
of those things I like to do it's just

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:31.869 
of those things I like to do it's just
kind<00:06:29.749> of<00:06:29.809> see<00:06:29.989> as<00:06:30.169> pointless<00:06:30.589> although<00:06:31.459> a<00:06:31.489> lot

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:31.879 
kind of see as pointless although a lot

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:33.699 
kind of see as pointless although a lot
of<00:06:31.909> people<00:06:32.029> like<00:06:32.629> love<00:06:33.019> it<00:06:33.199> and<00:06:33.319> it<00:06:33.469> looks

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:33.709 
of people like love it and it looks

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:34.749 
of people like love it and it looks
really<00:06:33.800> good<00:06:34.099> on<00:06:34.219> them<00:06:34.399> but<00:06:34.639> it's<00:06:34.729> just

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 
really good on them but it's just

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:37.299 
really good on them but it's just
because<00:06:34.999> I<00:06:35.089> can't<00:06:35.360> do<00:06:35.479> it<00:06:35.599> that<00:06:35.809> I'm<00:06:36.800> like<00:06:37.039> a

00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:37.309 
because I can't do it that I'm like a

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:40.749 
because I can't do it that I'm like a
highlighter<00:06:38.330> so<00:06:38.899> I<00:06:39.259> actually<00:06:39.829> cannot<00:06:40.489> think

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759 
highlighter so I actually cannot think

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:43.479 
highlighter so I actually cannot think
of<00:06:40.969> another<00:06:41.059> one<00:06:41.449> which<00:06:41.979> I'm<00:06:42.979> sure<00:06:43.219> there's

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:43.489 
of another one which I'm sure there's

00:06:43.489 --> 00:06:46.209 
of another one which I'm sure there's
loads<00:06:43.999> more<00:06:44.389> about<00:06:44.989> about<00:06:45.499> it's<00:06:45.679> gonna<00:06:45.889> be<00:06:46.039> all

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:46.219 
loads more about about it's gonna be all

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:48.069 
loads more about about it's gonna be all
four<00:06:46.429> and<00:06:46.519> I<00:06:46.579> probably<00:06:47.029> put<00:06:47.360> in<00:06:47.479> way<00:06:47.659> more<00:06:47.869> than

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:48.079 
four and I probably put in way more than

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:50.589
