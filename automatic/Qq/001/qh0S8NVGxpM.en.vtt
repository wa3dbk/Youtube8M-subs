 on polovit on provocateur 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.680
 were the fact that bite 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.180
 Karas unfortunately did not get off decided to try 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.250

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.029
 help now let's see just 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.300
 running I got to leave 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.720
 last fall at the exhibition here 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.440
 so here's a naborchik mix left me 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.440
 I 'll try a few more colors now. 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.440
 to put 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.440
 little green 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.700
 Here in this color Vedado 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.700
 what I will bet on 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:52.210
 conventional classic articulated 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.360
 mounting ie 3 grams jig head 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:00.410
 hooks 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:02.950
 Avner of 59 number 10 I think should 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.950
 work 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.670

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:14.250
 man's put very quickly organization with 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.930
 tail and that is literally no bite 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.090
 the tail of a crucian has very sharp teeth 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.720
 it seems to be like provocateurs 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.550
 tires tough enough well maybe 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.340
 say not rigidly elastic on loyalty 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.950
 and will rule say and I think that not 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.820
 Well, let's try to cut it now. 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.820

 like a circle under the habits of his took 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.400
 small karasik but still important 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:05.060
 that provokers themselves worked 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.060
 that is, I wanted to show it as well 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.950

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.030
 here it is still good in principle 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.200

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.070

 try to bark at this provocateur further 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:57.010
 we are horrified he is worried caught and 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.470
 let go and live let go of the fish 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.590
