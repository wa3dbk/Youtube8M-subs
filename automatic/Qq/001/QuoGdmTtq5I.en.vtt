finalize as you can see I peeled the
moon<00:01:55.920> off<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.850> mass<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.210> was<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.509> moon

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
moon off the mass that was on the moon

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.200 
moon off the mass that was on the moon
and<00:01:58.439> now<00:01:58.710> I'm<00:01:59.009> gonna<00:01:59.219> add<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> little<00:01:59.759> bit<00:02:00.119> of

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
and now I'm gonna add a little bit of

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.359 
and now I'm gonna add a little bit of
color<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.719> stone<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.130> stone

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
color to the stone and and the stone

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.870 
color to the stone and and the stone
pattern<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:04.500> yellow<00:02:04.829> gives<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.219> moon

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
pattern the yellow gives it that moon

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.440 
pattern the yellow gives it that moon
light<00:02:06.590> color<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:08.000> but<00:02:09.000> I'm<00:02:09.090> not<00:02:09.179> gonna<00:02:09.300> leave
