hi guys

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.519
I'm going to make all about my tattoos video this time

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.160
so I'm going to talk about my tattoos and
yeah show you them

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.840
and I don't have that many so hopefully
it will be a short video this time

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.060
Yeah, so i guess i'm just going to start

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.480
The easiest one would be to start with my hands, since it's the smallest

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.960
So my hand tattoos is the last tattoos that i had done

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.400
and the tattoo artist

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.000
his name is Jakob Persson

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.980
And he was an apprentice back then

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.400
This was in 2012

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.060
So it was quite a time since i had my last tattoo done

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.760
yeah I'm going to show you it now

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.140
so it's like that

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.500
I don't know if I hold it correct

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.899
Hopefully you could see that it's a bubble, *bumblebee

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.800
But i think it looks more like a regular bee

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.880
Do you say it like that? I don't know, bee?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.740
Yeah, so that's my hand tattoo and that's the last tattoo that i made or

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.500
had done or whatever you say

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.540
Okay, so the next tattoo is the one on my arm

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.009
and I will show a close-up of course

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.680
This tattoo is the first one

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.500
in like 2006 / 2007, i'm not really sure but i think so

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.660
The tattoo artist of this one is Jack Ankersen

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.600
And he was also an apprentice back then, not anymore of course

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.940
And what it is, is a human heart and i think you say anatomical heart

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.120
I don't know if i'm right about that but i'm pretty sure

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.960
noo

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.420
So a anatomical heart with headphones on and then there's roses underneath

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.360
but i'm going to show you this one too

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.800
so that was the first tattoo that i got

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.660
and i was really happy about it

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.520
Right now, i don't really like that it's

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.140
the same colors all over the tattoo

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.220
like, i wish the headphones was a different color so you can actually see that it's something else

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.160
But yes, that was my first tattoo and yeah, on to the next one i guess

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:21.000
The tattoo i did next after my first one was the tattoos i have on the back of my legs

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.540
I did, in 2007 / 2008, i'm not sure about that either

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.780
but

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.760
yeah i'm just going to show you so here they are

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.560
so that was the second tattoos that i had done

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.240
aand

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.000
as you hopefully, this time as well, it was ribbons

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.700
on the back of my legs and

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.940
the tattoo artist of the ribbons

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.080
is Joel Madberg

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.620
if i remember his name correctly

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.460
but i think i'm pretty sure about that
