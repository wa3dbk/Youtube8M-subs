00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
I'm risky here it was supposed to open

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.960 
I'm risky here it was supposed to open

the chest take that off and if you place

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:38.659 
the chest take that off and if you place
it<00:03:31.000> with<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:33.160> can<00:03:33.459> now<00:03:33.700> see<00:03:34.410> what<00:03:35.410> the

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.140 

room

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
room

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.900 
room
that's<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.109> secret<00:03:41.410> puzzle<00:03:42.370> of<00:03:42.489> a<00:03:42.579> Room<00:03:42.790> of

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
that's the secret puzzle of a Room of

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.659 
that's the secret puzzle of a Room of
Requirement<00:03:43.169> ends<00:03:44.169> up<00:03:44.650> being<00:03:44.889> burnt

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
Requirement ends up being burnt

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.210 
Requirement ends up being burnt
so<00:03:46.000> it's<00:03:46.750> conceived<00:03:47.200> as<00:03:47.410> smoke<00:03:47.859> coming<00:03:48.099> out

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
so it's conceived as smoke coming out

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.490 
so it's conceived as smoke coming out
with<00:03:48.340> chimney<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:49.000> fire<00:03:50.099> so<00:03:51.099> that's<00:03:51.480> kinda

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
with chimney and fire so that's kinda

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.129 
with chimney and fire so that's kinda
what<00:03:53.500> I've<00:03:53.650> done<00:03:53.889> to<00:03:54.099> reset<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:55.090> there's<00:03:55.959> some

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
what I've done to reset and there's some

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.759 
what I've done to reset and there's some
more<00:03:56.349> things<00:03:56.709> I<00:03:57.010> might<00:03:57.359> well<00:03:58.359> it<00:03:59.200> depends<00:03:59.650> how

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
more things I might well it depends how

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.280 
more things I might well it depends how
long<00:03:59.980> it<00:04:00.190> takes<00:04:00.489> I'm<00:04:01.480> gonna<00:04:01.660> make<00:04:01.989> I'm

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
long it takes I'm gonna make I'm

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.890 
long it takes I'm gonna make I'm
thinking<00:04:02.739> of<00:04:02.829> making<00:04:02.950> my<00:04:03.129> own<00:04:03.160> lego<00:04:03.900> custom
