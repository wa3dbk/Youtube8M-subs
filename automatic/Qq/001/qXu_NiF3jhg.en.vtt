to launch the game here in a second and

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.050 
to launch the game here in a second and

hopefully we will see our in-game store

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:25.180 
hopefully we will see our in-game store
working<00:04:19.090> no<00:04:20.650> no<00:04:21.650> shopping<00:04:22.010> cart<00:04:22.310> icon<00:04:24.190> that's

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
working no no shopping cart icon that's

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.780 
working no no shopping cart icon that's
kind<00:04:25.430> of<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.580> bummer<00:04:27.340> you<00:04:28.340> know<00:04:28.460> how<00:04:28.580> I<00:04:28.610> feel

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
kind of a bummer you know how I feel

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.909 
kind of a bummer you know how I feel
about<00:04:28.910> that

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.309 

so<00:04:35.430> let's<00:04:35.939> figure<00:04:36.150> out<00:04:36.270> what<00:04:36.810> went<00:04:36.930> wrong<00:04:37.020> I

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
so let's figure out what went wrong I

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.399 
so let's figure out what went wrong I
think<00:04:37.639> probably<00:04:38.639> the<00:04:39.150> published<00:04:39.539> step<00:04:39.780> since

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:40.409 
think probably the published step since

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.529 
think probably the published step since
it<00:04:40.590> took<00:04:40.710> a<00:04:40.770> suspiciously<00:04:41.370> long<00:04:41.580> time<00:04:41.789> didn't

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
it took a suspiciously long time didn't

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.209 
it took a suspiciously long time didn't
actually<00:04:42.780> publish<00:04:43.139> you<00:04:43.560> can<00:04:43.590> see<00:04:43.860> it<00:04:44.009> says<00:04:44.189> it

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:44.219 
actually publish you can see it says it

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:46.219 
actually publish you can see it says it
was<00:04:44.490> updated<00:04:44.639> seven<00:04:45.120> months<00:04:45.300> ago<00:04:45.389> so<00:04:45.779> yeah<00:04:46.050> the

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
was updated seven months ago so yeah the

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.679 
was updated seven months ago so yeah the
published<00:04:46.590> step<00:04:46.800> no<00:04:47.520> good<00:04:47.699> so<00:04:48.090> go<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.479> file

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:48.689 
published step no good so go to file

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:52.369 
published step no good so go to file
let's<00:04:49.349> publish<00:04:50.090> publish<00:04:51.090> to<00:04:51.360> rule<00:04:51.509> box<00:04:51.659> as<00:04:51.810> and

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 
let's publish publish to rule box as and

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:56.540 
let's publish publish to rule box as and
very<00:04:52.529> explicitly<00:04:54.650> publish<00:04:55.650> on<00:04:55.830> top<00:04:56.009> of<00:04:56.219> so<00:04:56.490> I

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
very explicitly publish on top of so I

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.390 
very explicitly publish on top of so I
find<00:04:56.759> the<00:04:56.849> heights<00:04:57.029> original<00:04:57.979> this<00:04:58.979> time<00:04:59.219> it

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
find the heights original this time it

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.439 
find the heights original this time it
was<00:04:59.639> instant<00:05:00.120> so<00:05:00.719> that's<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.169> much<00:05:01.289> better<00:05:01.409> time

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
was instant so that's a much better time

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.179 
was instant so that's a much better time
I'm<00:05:03.449> going<00:05:03.569> to<00:05:03.659> refresh<00:05:03.900> this<00:05:04.080> page<00:05:04.169> says<00:05:05.069> it

was updated five seconds ago that's a
good<00:05:06.689> sign<00:05:06.870> I<00:05:07.199> have<00:05:07.349> to<00:05:07.529> shut<00:05:07.680> these<00:05:07.830> all<00:05:07.949> down

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.300 
shirts I had sold and I think I sold 20
or<00:06:14.810> 30<00:06:15.050> shirts<00:06:15.319> which<00:06:15.470> kind<00:06:15.680> of<00:06:15.740> surprised<00:06:16.069> me

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:16.310 
or 30 shirts which kind of surprised me

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.439 
or 30 shirts which kind of surprised me
because<00:06:16.340> I<00:06:16.610> don't<00:06:16.789> have<00:06:16.849> that<00:06:16.940> many<00:06:17.270> people

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
because I don't have that many people

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.149 
because I don't have that many people
applying<00:06:17.810> and<00:06:18.080> so<00:06:18.139> I<00:06:18.199> find<00:06:18.409> the<00:06:18.500> height<00:06:18.620> so<00:06:18.919> I

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 
applying and so I find the height so I

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.790 
applying and so I find the height so I
think<00:06:19.490> I've<00:06:19.759> made<00:06:20.000> about<00:06:20.419> 350<00:06:21.259> tickets<00:06:21.620> in<00:06:21.740> the

think I've made about 350 tickets in the

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.840 
think I've made about 350 tickets in the
last<00:06:21.979> half<00:06:22.159> hour<00:06:22.310> with<00:06:23.210> my<00:06:23.330> in-game<00:06:23.539> story
