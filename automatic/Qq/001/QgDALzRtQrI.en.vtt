a<00:00:48.149> different<00:00:48.539> kind<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.749> play<00:00:49.019> mechanic<00:00:49.559> than

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
a different kind of play mechanic than

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.639 
a different kind of play mechanic than
the<00:00:50.159> standard<00:00:50.550> yugioh<00:00:50.940> deck<00:00:51.239> um<00:00:51.589> you<00:00:52.589> know
