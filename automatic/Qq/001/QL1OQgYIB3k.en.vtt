then I have a line that attaches to the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.600 
then I have a line that attaches to the
garbage<00:01:16.880> can<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:17.750> when<00:01:18.380> you<00:01:18.860> want<00:01:19.159> to<00:01:19.220> get<00:01:19.369> into

garbage can so when you want to get into

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.760 
garbage can so when you want to get into
the<00:01:19.729> can<00:01:19.970> you<00:01:20.149> just<00:01:20.330> pull<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.720> pin<00:01:20.930> drop<00:01:21.530> it

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
the can you just pull the pin drop it

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.710 
the can you just pull the pin drop it
open<00:01:22.509> put<00:01:23.509> your<00:01:23.689> garbage<00:01:23.899> in<00:01:24.259> closed<00:01:24.740> it<00:01:25.009> and

reattach the pin in the hole so you have

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.080 
reattach the pin in the hole so you have
the<00:01:28.970> same<00:01:29.210> thing<00:01:29.479> on<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.869> other<00:01:29.899> side<00:01:30.909> so<00:01:31.909> now

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
the same thing on the other side so now

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.480 
the same thing on the other side so now

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
I'm going to show you how to install one

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.719 
I'm going to show you how to install one
of<00:01:34.549> the<00:01:34.729> 6-inch<00:01:35.179> lines<00:01:35.479> what<00:01:36.440> you<00:01:36.590> do<00:01:36.770> is<00:01:37.159> on

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
of the 6-inch lines what you do is on

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.020 
of the 6-inch lines what you do is on
your<00:01:38.210> ecology<00:01:38.869> can<00:01:39.110> take<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.770> look<00:01:40.069> at<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.789> line

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
your ecology can take a look at the line

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.389 
your ecology can take a look at the line
that's<00:01:41.360> on<00:01:41.569> top<00:01:41.840> here<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.289> basically<00:01:42.500> you

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
that's on top here and basically you

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.520 
that's on top here and basically you
drilled<00:01:43.670> a<00:01:43.759> hole<00:01:43.789> right<00:01:44.299> there

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
drilled a hole right there

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.410 
drilled a hole right there
I<00:01:45.560> already<00:01:46.130> drilled<00:01:46.640> this<00:01:46.819> hole<00:01:46.880> but<00:01:47.299> I'll

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
I already drilled this hole but I'll

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.609 
I already drilled this hole but I'll
show<00:01:47.659> you<00:01:47.690> how<00:01:47.959> to<00:01:48.409> do<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.679> again<00:01:48.979> this<00:01:49.220> is<00:01:49.459> the

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
show you how to do it again this is the

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.680 
show you how to do it again this is the
bigger<00:01:51.619> bit<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.220> so<00:01:53.060> here's<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.600> hole

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.580 

what<00:01:57.690> you've<00:01:57.840> been<00:01:57.960> doing<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.440> you're

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
what you've been doing is you're

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.980 
what you've been doing is you're
catching<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.220> hole<00:01:59.430> here<00:01:59.760> to<00:02:00.270> there<00:02:00.480> and<00:02:00.510> this

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
catching the hole here to there and this

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.560 
catching the hole here to there and this
is<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.290> how<00:02:01.410> the<00:02:01.440> pin<00:02:01.800> goes<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.090> taxes

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
is the how the pin goes in and the taxes

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.380 
is the how the pin goes in and the taxes
that<00:02:03.600> keeps<00:02:04.050> a<00:02:04.110> little<00:02:04.290> bit<00:02:04.940> attached<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
that keeps a little bit attached to the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.719 
that keeps a little bit attached to the
garbage<00:02:06.600> can<00:02:06.840> also<00:02:07.800> fill<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.399> hole<00:02:08.580> here

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
garbage can also fill the hole here

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.880 
garbage can also fill the hole here
already<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.509> easy<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:10.500> drill<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.860> next

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
already but it's easy to drill the next

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.980 
already but it's easy to drill the next
hole<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:11.970> line<00:02:12.180> attaches<00:02:12.810> to

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
hole and this is the line attaches to

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.970 
hole and this is the line attaches to
the<00:02:13.110> garbage<00:02:13.350> can

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
the garbage can

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.070 
the garbage can
what<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.430> do<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.910> it's<00:02:15.090> fold<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.480> up<00:02:15.600> here<00:02:15.870> and

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
what you do is it's fold it up here and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.410 
what you do is it's fold it up here and
approximately<00:02:16.650> lay<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:16.980> down<00:02:17.010> here<00:02:17.550> like<00:02:18.180> this

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
approximately lay it down here like this

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.540 
approximately lay it down here like this
and<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:19.350> that's<00:02:19.590> where<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:19.890> drill<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.250> hole

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
and so that's where you drill a hole

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.890 
and so that's where you drill a hole
you'll<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:21.030> go<00:02:21.210> like<00:02:21.420> this

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
you'll just go like this

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.640 
you'll just go like this
and<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:23.190> want<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.460> use<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.110> 5/32<00:02:25.110> bit<00:02:25.380> to

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
and you want to use the 5/32 bit to

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.380 
and you want to use the 5/32 bit to
drill<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.980> hole<00:02:26.160> here<00:02:27.770> for<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.860> screw<00:02:29.390> okay

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
drill the hole here for the screw okay

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.350 
drill the hole here for the screw okay
once<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.810> drill<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.110> hole<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:32.120> attach<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
once you drill the hole to attach the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.380 
once you drill the hole to attach the
line<00:02:33.570> but<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.260> do<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.770> pull<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.430> pin<00:02:35.640> out<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.150> it

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
line but to do is pull the pin out of it

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.890 
line but to do is pull the pin out of it
lids<00:02:36.720> open<00:02:37.470> up<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.340> garbage<00:02:38.760> can<00:02:41.690> now<00:02:42.690> we're

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
to do is put the nut on the other side

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.930 
to do is put the nut on the other side
you<00:02:58.020> can't<00:02:58.290> see<00:02:58.530> this<00:02:58.709> but<00:02:59.010> I'll<00:02:59.310> just<00:02:59.370> attach

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
you can't see this but I'll just attach

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.570 
you can't see this but I'll just attach
the<00:03:00.209> nut<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.810> screw<00:03:03.650> now<00:03:04.650> twist<00:03:04.980> it<00:03:05.190> on<00:03:05.430> the

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
the nut to the screw now twist it on the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.320 
the nut to the screw now twist it on the
inside<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.900> take<00:03:07.140> this<00:03:07.290> for<00:03:07.470> your<00:03:07.620> driver

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
inside you take this for your driver

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.850 
inside you take this for your driver
just<00:03:09.330> tighten<00:03:09.810> up<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.019> screw<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:13.680> it's

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
just tighten up the screw and it's

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.130 
just tighten up the screw and it's
adjustable<00:03:14.580> where<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:15.000> like<00:03:15.209> it<00:03:15.420> just<00:03:15.810> and

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
adjustable where you like it just and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.449 
adjustable where you like it just and
then<00:03:16.320> just<00:03:16.500> really<00:03:16.890> give<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.400> good<00:03:17.430> tight

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.920 

okay<00:03:23.459> now<00:03:23.909> that<00:03:23.969> make<00:03:24.269> sure<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.569> got<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:24.900> right

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
okay now that make sure you got it right

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.709 
okay now that make sure you got it right
close<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.590> lid<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.340> reattach<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.510> pin

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:27.719 
close the lid and reattach the pin

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:31.069 
close the lid and reattach the pin
should<00:03:27.989> go<00:03:28.170> in<00:03:28.349> very<00:03:29.310> easy<00:03:29.519> like<00:03:29.879> that<00:03:29.909> so<00:03:30.900> now

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
should go in very easy like that so now

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:37.149 
should go in very easy like that so now
turn<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.799> garbage<00:03:32.129> can<00:03:32.370> around<00:03:34.340> you<00:03:35.340> have<00:03:35.579> a

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
turn the garbage can around you have a

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.670 
turn the garbage can around you have a
pin<00:03:38.159> on<00:03:38.430> each<00:03:38.489> side<00:03:39.030> so<00:03:39.750> go<00:03:40.290> through<00:03:40.319> it<00:03:40.590> again

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
pin on each side so go through it again

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.679 
pin on each side so go through it again
as<00:03:41.099> far<00:03:41.340> as<00:03:41.400> when<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:41.819> want<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.060> go<00:03:42.239> into<00:03:42.450> the

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:42.689 
as far as when you want to go into the

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.520 
as far as when you want to go into the
camp<00:03:42.989> just<00:03:43.620> pull<00:03:43.859> the<00:03:43.980> pin<00:03:44.189> one<00:03:44.900> two<00:03:45.900> on<00:03:46.319> each

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
camp just pull the pin one two on each

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.539 
camp just pull the pin one two on each
side<00:03:46.700> pick<00:03:47.700> up<00:03:47.939> and<00:03:48.329> there<00:03:48.659> you<00:03:48.780> go<00:03:49.430> when<00:03:50.430> you

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
side pick up and there you go when you

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.270 
side pick up and there you go when you
want<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.790> close<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:51.090> just<00:03:51.599> close<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.139> and<00:03:52.319> put

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
want to close it just close it and put

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.809 
want to close it just close it and put
the<00:03:53.400> pin<00:03:53.609> on<00:03:53.639> each<00:03:53.970> side<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:59.370> well<00:03:59.549> up<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.030> now

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
the pin on each side and well up and now

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:08.830 
the pin on each side and well up and now
yeah<00:04:02.900> raccoon<00:04:03.900> proof<00:04:04.230> garbage<00:04:04.889> can

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.580 

so<00:04:09.350> over<00:04:09.680> time<00:04:09.950> the<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:11.209> hole<00:04:11.480> might<00:04:12.050> get<00:04:12.560> a

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
so over time the the hole might get a

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.620 
so over time the the hole might get a
little<00:04:12.890> bit<00:04:12.980> bigger<00:04:13.160> and<00:04:13.520> the<00:04:13.670> pin<00:04:14.000> might<00:04:14.390> be<00:04:14.600> a

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
little bit bigger and the pin might be a

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.530 
little bit bigger and the pin might be a
little<00:04:14.840> bit<00:04:15.080> loose<00:04:15.350> so<00:04:15.910> what<00:04:16.910> you<00:04:17.030> can<00:04:17.209> do<00:04:17.389> if

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
little bit loose so what you can do if

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.009 
little bit loose so what you can do if
that<00:04:17.660> happens<00:04:18.169> is<00:04:18.980> just<00:04:19.669> put<00:04:19.880> a<00:04:19.910> little<00:04:20.239> duct

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
that happens is just put a little duct

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.620 
that happens is just put a little duct
tape<00:04:21.460> over<00:04:22.460> like<00:04:22.669> this<00:04:23.680> and<00:04:24.850> then<00:04:25.850> just<00:04:25.880> refill

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
tape over like this and then just refill

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.290 
tape over like this and then just refill
the<00:04:26.840> hole<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:30.260> so<00:04:31.220> now<00:04:31.430> when<00:04:31.700> you<00:04:31.790> put<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.090> pin

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
the hole and so now when you put the pin

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.659 
the hole and so now when you put the pin
and<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:33.200> tape<00:04:33.560> will<00:04:33.590> make<00:04:34.040> it<00:04:34.190> a<00:04:34.250> little<00:04:34.400> bit

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
and the tape will make it a little bit

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.470 
and the tape will make it a little bit
more<00:04:34.880> snug<00:04:36.250> okay<00:04:37.250> so<00:04:37.639> you<00:04:37.820> do<00:04:37.970> that<00:04:38.150> on<00:04:38.330> both

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
more snug okay so you do that on both

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.010 
more snug okay so you do that on both
sides<00:04:39.910> again<00:04:40.910> I'll<00:04:41.030> do<00:04:41.240> it<00:04:41.390> I'll<00:04:41.540> put<00:04:41.720> the<00:04:41.840> tape

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
sides again I'll do it I'll put the tape

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:54.690 
sides again I'll do it I'll put the tape
over<00:04:42.320> it<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.430> hole<00:04:46.180> read<00:04:47.180> you<00:04:47.360> a<00:04:47.390> little<00:04:47.570> exam

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.790 

now<00:04:55.700> this<00:04:55.940> makes<00:04:56.180> the<00:04:56.419> depend<00:04:57.290> a<00:04:57.380> little<00:04:57.590> bit

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
now this makes the depend a little bit

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.390 
now this makes the depend a little bit
more<00:04:58.190> snug<00:04:58.430> inside<00:04:59.080> so<00:05:00.080> now<00:05:00.320> I'm<00:05:00.500> going<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:00.770> put

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
more snug inside so now I'm going to put

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.570 
more snug inside so now I'm going to put
the<00:05:01.520> pins<00:05:01.760> in<00:05:02.590> and<00:05:03.590> you'll<00:05:03.740> feel<00:05:04.070> it<00:05:04.310> a<00:05:04.430> little

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
the pins in and you'll feel it a little

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.600 
the pins in and you'll feel it a little
bit<00:05:04.850> more<00:05:05.030> snug<00:05:05.330> going<00:05:05.780> in<00:05:05.960> on<00:05:06.229> each<00:05:06.410> side<00:05:06.710> so

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
bit more snug going in on each side so

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.250 
bit more snug going in on each side so
now<00:05:07.729> I'll<00:05:07.880> show<00:05:07.940> you<00:05:08.120> how<00:05:08.419> the<00:05:08.479> pin<00:05:08.780> system

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
now I'll show you how the pin system

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.129 
now I'll show you how the pin system
works<00:05:09.560> these<00:05:10.400> have<00:05:10.580> both<00:05:10.790> pins<00:05:11.180> inside<00:05:11.900> the

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
works these have both pins inside the

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.610 
works these have both pins inside the
lid<00:05:12.350> like<00:05:12.560> this<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:13.210> prevents<00:05:14.260> again<00:05:15.260> what

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
lid like this and prevents again what

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.500 
lid like this and prevents again what
happens<00:05:15.979> when<00:05:16.160> a<00:05:16.190> record<00:05:16.400> tries<00:05:16.910> to<00:05:17.090> get<00:05:17.270> into

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
happens when a record tries to get into

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.790 
happens when a record tries to get into
the<00:05:17.720> garbage<00:05:18.169> can

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
the garbage can

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.770 
the garbage can
he'll<00:05:19.190> try<00:05:19.430> to<00:05:19.460> tip<00:05:19.760> it<00:05:19.910> over<00:05:22.210> and<00:05:23.210> you<00:05:23.330> see<00:05:23.360> the

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
he'll try to tip it over and you see the

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.400 
he'll try to tip it over and you see the
pins<00:05:24.169> are<00:05:24.440> still<00:05:24.740> inside<00:05:25.340> the<00:05:25.610> lid<00:05:25.820> and<00:05:26.410> the

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
pins are still inside the lid and the

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.409 
pins are still inside the lid and the
raccoon<00:05:27.860> will<00:05:28.100> try<00:05:28.280> to<00:05:28.310> open<00:05:28.760> the<00:05:28.850> can<00:05:29.090> but

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
raccoon will try to open the can but

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.180 
raccoon will try to open the can but
can't<00:05:29.720> and<00:05:30.050> it<00:05:30.140> doesn't<00:05:30.470> know<00:05:30.620> how<00:05:30.860> to<00:05:30.890> open

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
can't and it doesn't know how to open

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.940
