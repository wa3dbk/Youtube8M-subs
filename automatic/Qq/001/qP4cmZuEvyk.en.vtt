00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hey, how are youtube friends today? 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.700
 I will teach to play the local song and 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.370
 sell bruno mars and we also have 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.170
 also the song of one of wasior made 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.550
 wellness to a being totally for 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.710
 acoustic guitar and we're going that 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.480
 doing step by step I know that also 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.109
 We have video demonstration on this side 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.670
 so well let's start perfect to 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.470
 a substantial standard tuning in to 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.490
 jazz guitar at the fast and vital base 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.490
 we are explaining it 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.469
 perfect let's use we're not going to 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.750
 do this way are I'm going to 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.960
 explain let's use two number 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.120
 one in what would be the second string the 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.750
 eighth fret and from here we are going to do 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.750
 a ladder 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.840
 Y 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.980
 here the secret of the song is that the 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.740
 finger number 3 we're never going to take it off 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.730
 of the fourth string in everything that would be 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.730
 the part of the stanza 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:29.090
 check if we already have the gift after 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.010
 let's move on to what would be re 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.100
 i 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.750
 we are going to do this as I told you 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.060
 the number 3 finger is not going to take off 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.670
 never from the fourth and now it's going to be 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.510
 in what would be the twelfth fret with the 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.790
 finger number 1 Let's make a brush 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.790
 in what would be the tenth fret 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.820
 can lean on what would be the finger 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.880
 number two so that it does not cost them 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.659
 work also use the sustained of 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.900
 this way number one finger on what 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.220
 would be the second string the sixth fret 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.500
 and we do the ladder again 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.840
 as I tell them the number 3 finger does not 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.840
 takes off from the fourth rope 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.769
 then we will use more 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:28.819
 number one finger in what would be second 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:30.739
 rope first fret and we do ladder 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.519
 and finally we will use sun 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.519
 sustained minor 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.970
 let's do a simple in what 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.450
 would be the number three fret 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.040
 and the number 3 finger as I told you ever 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.110
 takes off from what would be the fourth 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.450
 rope and this will keep us in what 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.760
 it would be fifth fret 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.970
 Check the notes 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.970
 He said 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.710
 effect we have already armed all the base of 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.830
 the notes now let's put the rhythm 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.750
 the rhythm always goes down and nothing 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.800
 more we are going to mutate in certain 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.800
 chequen parts if 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.340
 ah 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.480
 always be down once 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.640
 catch the rhythm they will see what is bread 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.750
 eaten since the same hand is going 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.750
 guiding all the time 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.610
 to 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:59.150
 then we will get to what would be the 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:07.170
 part of the chorus we are using for the 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:09.180
 the sustained minor sun gone here is equal 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.110
 rationed more is down is born in that 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.110
 give some rhythm 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.160
 yes 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:57.949
 and repeat what would be the choir part 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.899
 check here to make the change 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.499
 fast the number two finger does not 

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:02.499
 take off 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.880
 and again we make the change that goes to 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:13.440
 be this slow part nothing else is towards 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.440
 down down down 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.810
 okay 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.240
 Hello 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.740
 the sharp 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.860
 G minor 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.940
 LOL 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.389
 2k sharp 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.720
 G minor 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.569
 and we ended up being 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:08.710
 and we repeat chorus is a good song 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.270
 intermediate is not very simple anymore 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.460
 that come the changes are a bit 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.590
 fast practice first very very 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.900
 slow and then they'll see what way 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.970
 grasping speed little by little you know 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.070
