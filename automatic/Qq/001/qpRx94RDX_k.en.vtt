okay now we're gonna be looking at the

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.670 
okay now we're gonna be looking at the
openings<00:00:05.899> this<00:00:06.899> would<00:00:07.109> be<00:00:07.290> actually<00:00:07.649> very

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
openings this would be actually very

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.350 
openings this would be actually very
interesting<00:00:08.280> because<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.610> can<00:00:08.820> start<00:00:09.150> to

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
interesting because you can start to

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.879 
interesting because you can start to
create<00:00:10.070> windows<00:00:11.070> for<00:00:11.610> instance<00:00:12.290> okay<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:13.349> now

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
create windows for instance okay so now

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.160 
create windows for instance okay so now
as<00:00:14.309> we<00:00:14.670> pan<00:00:14.940> around<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.389> building<00:00:15.750> we<00:00:15.990> see

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
as we pan around the building we see

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.320 
as we pan around the building we see
that<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.500> building<00:00:16.890> looks<00:00:17.130> pretty<00:00:17.760> straight

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
that the building looks pretty straight

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.500 
that the building looks pretty straight
and<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.230> because<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.910> lens<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.359> I'm

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
and this is because the lens that I'm

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.370 
and this is because the lens that I'm
using<00:00:21.779> at<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> moment<00:00:22.260> are<00:00:23.660> the<00:00:24.660> angle<00:00:25.199> it's

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
using at the moment are the angle it's

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.400 
using at the moment are the angle it's
quite<00:00:25.890> small<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.119> usually<00:00:27.869> like<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.080> work<00:00:28.380> with

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
quite small I usually like to work with

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.179 
quite small I usually like to work with
a<00:00:28.680> 17<00:00:29.369> millimeters<00:00:30.179> camera<00:00:30.710> as<00:00:31.710> soon<00:00:31.949> as<00:00:32.070> you

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
a 17 millimeters camera as soon as you

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.220 
a 17 millimeters camera as soon as you
click<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.850> lens<00:00:33.059> length<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:33.960> find

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
click on the lens length you can find

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.130 
click on the lens length you can find
this<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.969> tools<00:00:37.309> toolbar<00:00:38.309> layout<00:00:38.930> you<00:00:39.930> can

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
this in tools toolbar layout you can

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.549 
this in tools toolbar layout you can
look<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.860> lens<00:00:41.100> length<00:00:42.290> their<00:00:43.290> lives

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
look for the lens length their lives

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.069 
look for the lens length their lives
just<00:00:43.800> click<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.390> will<00:00:45.450> appear<00:00:45.840> yeah

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
just click on it and it will appear yeah

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.950 
just click on it and it will appear yeah
and<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.879> work<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.390> because<00:00:48.750> it

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
and I like to work with this because it

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.520 
and I like to work with this because it
really<00:00:49.230> gives<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.890> sense<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:51.530> perspective

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
really gives you a sense of perspective

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.950 
really gives you a sense of perspective
yeah<00:00:53.780> so<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:55.620> way<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.829> work<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:57.239> openings

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
yeah so one way to work with openings

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.319 
yeah so one way to work with openings
and<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.649> something<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.640> really

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
and this is something that I I really

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.560 
and this is something that I I really
enjoy<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.739> split<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> faces<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.090> to

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
enjoy is to split the faces and to

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.219 
enjoy is to split the faces and to
convert<00:01:03.960> them<00:01:04.229> into<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.519> actual<00:01:06.229> last

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
convert them into the the actual last

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.170 
convert them into the the actual last
layer<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.100> instance<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.939> already

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
layer so for instance here we already

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.109 
layer so for instance here we already
have<00:01:09.600> some<00:01:09.840> glass<00:01:10.170> on<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:11.340> building<00:01:11.729> or<00:01:11.850> you

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
have some glass on the building or you

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.480 
have some glass on the building or you
remove<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.930> remember<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.590> moved<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
remove you remember that I moved the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.780 
remove you remember that I moved the
face<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.840> previous<00:01:16.470> exercise<00:01:16.640> what<00:01:17.640> we're

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
face in the previous exercise what we're

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.990 
face in the previous exercise what we're
gonna<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:18.090> we're<00:01:18.270> just<00:01:18.450> gonna<00:01:18.630> say<00:01:19.409> move<00:01:20.000> face

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
gonna do we're just gonna say move face

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.859 
gonna do we're just gonna say move face
click<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.080> use<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.400> corner<00:01:24.000> as<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.240> reference

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
click it use this corner as a reference

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.490 
click it use this corner as a reference
point<00:01:25.880> tab<00:01:26.880> key<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.600> lock<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.990> into<00:01:28.200> that

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
point tab key to lock it into that

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.560 
point tab key to lock it into that
direction<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.220> then<00:01:29.430> use<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.880> snap<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
direction and then use the snap of the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.490 
direction and then use the snap of the
glass<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.380> get<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.890> back<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.250> place<00:01:32.460> okay<00:01:33.150> so

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
glass to get it back in place okay so

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.140 
glass to get it back in place okay so
here<00:01:34.500> as<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:34.860> see<00:01:35.009> there<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> very<00:01:35.850> bad

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
here as you can see there is a very bad

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.120 
here as you can see there is a very bad
effect<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.020> because<00:01:37.380> these<00:01:37.650> surfaces

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
effect this is because these surfaces

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.679 
effect this is because these surfaces
are<00:01:38.509> overlapping<00:01:39.920> what<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> did<00:01:41.310> here<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.939> used

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
are overlapping what I did here I used

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.139 
are overlapping what I did here I used
these<00:01:43.369> reference<00:01:44.369> lines<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:47.009> know<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:47.970> you

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
these reference lines and know if you

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.810 
these reference lines and know if you
can<00:01:48.299> see<00:01:48.570> them<00:01:48.780> there<00:01:49.590> they<00:01:49.740> are

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
can see them there they are

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.440 
can see them there they are
anyway<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.630> use<00:01:51.869> them<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.200> split<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.740> face<00:01:53.450> I'm

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
anyway I use them to split the face I'm

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.749 
anyway I use them to split the face I'm
gonna<00:01:54.810> show<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.110> how<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.409> did<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.520> for

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
gonna show you how I did it so for

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.209 
gonna show you how I did it so for
instance<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.390> need<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.020> make<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.979> glass

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
instance we just need to make the glass

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.950 
instance we just need to make the glass
layer<00:01:59.579> active<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.570> means<00:02:00.780> that

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
layer active so that means that

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.480 
layer active so that means that
everything<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.500> we're<00:02:01.680> gonna<00:02:01.829> do<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.340> will

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
everything that we're gonna do it will

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.499 
everything that we're gonna do it will
be<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:04.040> layer<00:02:06.049> draw<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.079> line<00:02:08.239> then<00:02:09.239> we'll

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
be on this layer draw a line then we'll

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.660 
be on this layer draw a line then we'll
select<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:10.020> line<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.590> we'll<00:02:11.459> move<00:02:11.640> it

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
select this line and we'll move it

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.280 
select this line and we'll move it
we'll<00:02:13.670> move<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.120> tab<00:02:15.110> key<00:02:16.660> sorry<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:17.870> didn't

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
we'll move it tab key sorry I didn't

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.500 
we'll move it tab key sorry I didn't
take<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.709> right<00:02:18.739> reference<00:02:19.340> there<00:02:20.060> you<00:02:20.150> go

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
take the right reference there you go

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.040 
take the right reference there you go
tab<00:02:20.989> key<00:02:21.319> will<00:02:22.250> move<00:02:22.489> it<00:02:22.610> up<00:02:22.819> to<00:02:22.849> these<00:02:23.810> other

tab key will move it up to these other

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.280 
tab key will move it up to these other
lines<00:02:24.379> so<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.950> windows<00:02:25.340> there<00:02:25.580> will<00:02:25.760> be

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
lines so that the windows there will be

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.759 
lines so that the windows there will be
the<00:02:27.290> same<00:02:27.530> size<00:02:27.860> yeah<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:29.120> for<00:02:30.110> instance<00:02:30.260> here

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
the same size yeah so for instance here

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.699 
the same size yeah so for instance here
you<00:02:30.799> see<00:02:31.160> that<00:02:31.400> we<00:02:31.580> have<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.760> certain<00:02:32.709> distance

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
you see that we have a certain distance

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.860 
you see that we have a certain distance
which<00:02:34.040> is<00:02:35.860> 2<00:02:36.860> meters<00:02:37.250> we<00:02:38.060> could<00:02:38.269> do<00:02:38.450> very

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
which is 2 meters we could do very

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.250 
which is 2 meters we could do very
simple<00:02:39.349> we<00:02:39.950> could<00:02:40.220> grab<00:02:40.730> this<00:02:41.180> oh<00:02:41.660> it's<00:02:41.930> a

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
simple we could grab this oh it's a

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.009 
simple we could grab this oh it's a
group<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:42.680> see<00:02:42.920> okay<00:02:43.549> now<00:02:43.700> what<00:02:44.060> we<00:02:44.660> can<00:02:44.810> do<00:02:44.930> we

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
group I see okay now what we can do we

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.670 
group I see okay now what we can do we
can<00:02:45.049> just<00:02:45.380> grab<00:02:45.829> a<00:02:45.890> line<00:02:46.870> make<00:02:47.870> it<00:02:48.019> snap<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:48.530> the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
can just grab a line make it snap to the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.930 
can just grab a line make it snap to the
near<00:02:48.980> as<00:02:49.579> you<00:02:49.790> can<00:02:49.940> see<00:02:50.150> near<00:02:50.470> 2<00:02:51.470> meters<00:02:51.940> click

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
near as you can see near 2 meters click

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.270 
near as you can see near 2 meters click
and<00:02:53.290> then<00:02:54.290> make<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:54.620> snap<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:55.160> the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
and then make it snap to the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.050 
and then make it snap to the
perpendicular<00:02:55.670> yeah<00:02:56.680> so<00:02:57.680> we<00:02:58.099> can<00:02:58.250> do<00:02:58.430> now<00:02:58.640> we

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
perpendicular yeah so we can do now we

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:06.059 
perpendicular yeah so we can do now we
can<00:02:59.269> just<00:02:59.569> grab<00:03:00.379> another<00:03:00.980> line<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:04.299> say<00:03:05.299> to

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
can just grab another line and say to

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.839 
can just grab another line and say to
make<00:03:07.069> it<00:03:07.220> snap

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
make it snap

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.330 
make it snap
so<00:03:08.480> eventually<00:03:08.720> down<00:03:09.200> there<00:03:09.530> we're<00:03:10.160> gonna

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
so eventually down there we're gonna

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.380 
so eventually down there we're gonna
have<00:03:10.610> a<00:03:10.819> line<00:03:11.329> 2<00:03:11.660> meters<00:03:11.900> long<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:13.340> what<00:03:14.180> we

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
have a line 2 meters long and what we

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.460 
have a line 2 meters long and what we
can<00:03:14.569> do<00:03:14.829> we<00:03:15.829> can<00:03:15.860> just<00:03:16.720> now<00:03:17.720> grab<00:03:18.019> this<00:03:18.200> line

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
can do we can just now grab this line

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.770 
can do we can just now grab this line
say<00:03:18.799> explode<00:03:19.400> because<00:03:19.760> we<00:03:20.060> don't<00:03:20.269> want<00:03:20.600> the

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
say explode because we don't want the

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.590 
say explode because we don't want the
the<00:03:21.139> whole<00:03:21.319> L<00:03:21.680> shape<00:03:22.130> we<00:03:22.910> just<00:03:23.180> want<00:03:23.389> to<00:03:23.480> have

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
the whole L shape we just want to have

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
the whole L shape we just want to have
the<00:03:24.109> curve<00:03:24.350> here<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.519> middle<00:03:26.079> we<00:03:27.079> can<00:03:27.109> just

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
the curve here in the middle we can just

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.789 
the curve here in the middle we can just
copy<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:28.370> let's<00:03:28.849> say<00:03:30.160> 1<00:03:31.160> meter<00:03:32.500> we'll<00:03:33.500> make

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
copy it let's say 1 meter we'll make

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.550 
copy it let's say 1 meter we'll make
from<00:03:34.069> last<00:03:34.430> point<00:03:34.730> use<00:03:35.329> last<00:03:35.630> direction<00:03:36.319> and

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
from last point use last direction and

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.430 
from last point use last direction and
use<00:03:37.250> last<00:03:37.579> distance<00:03:38.239> or<00:03:38.810> make<00:03:39.170> let's<00:03:39.470> say<00:03:41.049> 1<00:03:42.049> 2

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
use last distance or make let's say 1 2

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.479 
use last distance or make let's say 1 2
3<00:03:42.739> 4<00:03:43.250> 5<00:03:43.760> 6<00:03:44.349> 7<00:03:45.349> 8<00:03:45.859> panels<00:03:46.430> yeah<00:03:47.200> so<00:03:48.200> basically

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
3 4 5 6 7 8 panels yeah so basically

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.629 
3 4 5 6 7 8 panels yeah so basically
we're<00:03:49.489> just<00:03:49.519> gonna<00:03:49.880> click<00:03:50.120> select<00:03:50.959> last<00:03:51.950> I'm

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
we're just gonna click select last I'm

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.110 
we're just gonna click select last I'm
gonna<00:03:52.760> type<00:03:53.090> in<00:03:53.269> select<00:03:53.450> last<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.880> what<00:03:55.880> we're

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
gonna type in select last and what we're

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.420 
gonna type in select last and what we're
gonna<00:03:56.209> do<00:03:56.480> we're<00:03:56.690> gonna<00:03:56.810> scale<00:03:57.410> these<00:03:58.040> lines

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
gonna do we're gonna scale these lines

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.390 
gonna do we're gonna scale these lines
in<00:03:58.790> one<00:03:59.090> direction<00:03:59.329> up<00:03:59.959> to<00:04:00.319> these<00:04:00.530> two<00:04:01.010> meters

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
in one direction up to these two meters

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.409 
in one direction up to these two meters
a<00:04:01.639> line<00:04:02.650> what<00:04:03.650> that<00:04:04.069> will<00:04:04.280> do<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:04.730> will<00:04:04.940> divide

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
a line what that will do it will divide

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:11.229 
a line what that will do it will divide
these<00:04:06.370> lines<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:08.090> space<00:04:08.359> in<00:04:08.569> between<00:04:09.970> in<00:04:10.970> the

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
these lines the space in between in the

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:12.640 
these lines the space in between in the
right<00:04:11.419> amount<00:04:11.780> so<00:04:11.930> that<00:04:12.079> we're<00:04:12.230> gonna<00:04:12.349> have

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
right amount so that we're gonna have

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.430 
right amount so that we're gonna have
eight<00:04:13.040> openings<00:04:13.790> of<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.239> same<00:04:14.480> size<00:04:14.780> so<00:04:15.290> we're

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
eight openings of the same size so we're

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.089 
eight openings of the same size so we're
just<00:04:15.470> gonna<00:04:15.739> say<00:04:16.010> scale<00:04:17.289> 1d<00:04:18.289> as<00:04:18.560> you<00:04:18.739> can<00:04:18.889> see

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
just gonna say scale 1d as you can see

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:23.080 
just gonna say scale 1d as you can see
ya<00:04:19.340> up<00:04:19.400> here<00:04:19.840> click<00:04:20.840> here<00:04:20.870> click<00:04:21.610> here<00:04:22.610> and

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
ya up here click here click here and

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.670 
ya up here click here click here and
just

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
just

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.840 
just
go<00:04:25.310> to<00:04:25.910> this<00:04:26.090> end<00:04:26.479> line<00:04:26.919> so<00:04:27.919> eventually<00:04:28.310> we

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
go to this end line so eventually we

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.439 
go to this end line so eventually we
will<00:04:28.970> have<00:04:29.030> eight<00:04:29.720> panels<00:04:30.430> all<00:04:31.430> of<00:04:31.669> them<00:04:31.850> the

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
will have eight panels all of them the

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.110 
will have eight panels all of them the
same<00:04:32.479> size<00:04:32.960> and<00:04:33.350> so<00:04:33.590> as<00:04:33.770> we<00:04:33.979> can<00:04:34.160> see<00:04:34.400> we<00:04:35.000> have

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
same size and so as we can see we have

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.870 
same size and so as we can see we have
four<00:04:35.419> meter<00:04:35.750> and<00:04:35.960> fourteen<00:04:36.550> there<00:04:37.550> should<00:04:37.759> be

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
four meter and fourteen there should be

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.129 
four meter and fourteen there should be
the<00:04:38.000> same<00:04:38.560> yeah<00:04:39.560> perfect<00:04:40.630> so<00:04:41.630> now<00:04:41.780> that<00:04:41.840> we

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
the same yeah perfect so now that we

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.870 
the same yeah perfect so now that we
have<00:04:42.169> this<00:04:42.440> lines<00:04:42.740> I<00:04:43.009> can<00:04:43.190> select<00:04:43.430> this<00:04:43.639> line

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
have this lines I can select this line

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.340 
have this lines I can select this line
as<00:04:44.090> well<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:44.509> this<00:04:45.050> line<00:04:45.350> as<00:04:45.530> well<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:47.050> I<00:04:48.050> can

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
as well and this line as well and I can

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.700 
as well and this line as well and I can
say<00:04:48.530> ctrl<00:04:48.979> G<00:04:49.400> for<00:04:50.060> a<00:04:50.090> group<00:04:50.360> then<00:04:51.199> I<00:04:51.289> can<00:04:51.470> grab

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
say ctrl G for a group then I can grab

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:52.600 
say ctrl G for a group then I can grab
the<00:04:51.889> surface

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
the surface

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.570 
the surface
I'll<00:04:52.970> explore<00:04:53.509> it<00:04:53.720> so<00:04:54.470> I'll<00:04:54.590> just<00:04:54.620> select<00:04:55.039> this

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
I'll explore it so I'll just select this

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.250 
I'll explore it so I'll just select this
face<00:04:55.850> in<00:04:56.090> front<00:04:56.330> of<00:04:56.419> us<00:04:56.539> and<00:04:57.220> input<00:04:58.220> split<00:04:59.260> then

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
face in front of us and input split then

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.200 
face in front of us and input split then
I<00:05:00.380> select<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:00.860> group<00:05:01.070> and<00:05:03.220> click<00:05:04.220> enter<00:05:04.430> at

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
I select the group and click enter at

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.580 
I select the group and click enter at
this<00:05:05.449> point<00:05:05.720> we<00:05:05.960> will<00:05:06.110> have<00:05:06.169> some<00:05:07.070> faces<00:05:08.590> they

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
this point we will have some faces they

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.909 
this point we will have some faces they
will<00:05:09.770> all<00:05:10.039> be<00:05:10.370> independent<00:05:11.470> we<00:05:12.470> can<00:05:12.500> we<00:05:12.800> can

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
will all be independent we can we can

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.740 
will all be independent we can we can
just<00:05:13.130> go<00:05:13.280> to<00:05:13.340> properties<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:14.150> say<00:05:14.889> plus<00:05:16.750> with

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
just go to properties and say plus with

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.129 
just go to properties and say plus with
that<00:05:18.370> what<00:05:19.370> that<00:05:19.849> would<00:05:20.360> this<00:05:20.570> does<00:05:20.840> to

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
that what that would this does to

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.129 
that what that would this does to
basically<00:05:21.620> to<00:05:21.949> our<00:05:22.160> model<00:05:22.610> is<00:05:22.990> create<00:05:23.990> an

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
basically to our model is create an

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.080 
basically to our model is create an
opening<00:05:24.470> that<00:05:24.770> it's<00:05:24.949> made<00:05:25.190> of<00:05:25.340> glass<00:05:25.460> if<00:05:25.820> we<00:05:25.940> go

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
opening that it's made of glass if we go

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.600 
opening that it's made of glass if we go
to<00:05:26.150> rendered<00:05:26.630> view<00:05:26.930> you<00:05:27.470> can<00:05:27.620> see<00:05:27.830> with<00:05:28.009> the<00:05:28.340> we

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
to rendered view you can see with the we

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:35.469 
to rendered view you can see with the we
can<00:05:28.820> look<00:05:29.300> through<00:05:29.570> this<00:05:33.580> let<00:05:34.580> me<00:05:34.699> go<00:05:34.880> back

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
can look through this let me go back

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.629 
can look through this let me go back
here<00:05:35.510> we<00:05:36.380> can<00:05:36.530> do<00:05:36.620> we<00:05:36.740> can<00:05:36.889> do<00:05:37.010> the<00:05:37.099> same<00:05:37.310> here

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
here we can do we can do the same here

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.240 
here we can do we can do the same here
now<00:05:37.820> I<00:05:38.060> can<00:05:38.599> just<00:05:38.810> select<00:05:38.990> this<00:05:39.260> face<00:05:39.590> and<00:05:39.889> say

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
now I can just select this face and say

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.790 
now I can just select this face and say
split<00:05:41.470> select<00:05:42.470> the<00:05:42.620> group<00:05:42.830> and<00:05:44.500> then<00:05:45.500> I<00:05:45.590> can

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
split select the group and then I can

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.899 
split select the group and then I can
hide<00:05:46.130> very<00:05:46.580> quickly<00:05:47.650> the<00:05:48.650> glass<00:05:48.919> and<00:05:49.310> then

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:49.909 
hide very quickly the glass and then

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:53.649 
hide very quickly the glass and then
select<00:05:50.300> these<00:05:50.449> faces<00:05:51.190> delete<00:05:52.190> them<00:05:52.419> and<00:05:53.419> just

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
select these faces delete them and just

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:55.870 
select these faces delete them and just
activate<00:05:54.139> the<00:05:54.260> glass<00:05:54.470> again<00:05:54.650> now<00:05:55.400> if<00:05:55.460> we<00:05:55.729> go

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
activate the glass again now if we go

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.200 
activate the glass again now if we go
back<00:05:55.909> to<00:05:56.120> the<00:05:56.449> render<00:05:56.720> view<00:05:57.280> we<00:05:58.280> have<00:05:58.460> openings

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
back to the render view we have openings

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.180 
back to the render view we have openings
through<00:05:59.630> the<00:05:59.750> building<00:06:02.530> later<00:06:03.530> on<00:06:03.740> I<00:06:03.889> can<00:06:03.949> I

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
through the building later on I can I

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.510 
through the building later on I can I
want<00:06:04.550> to<00:06:04.669> show<00:06:04.849> you<00:06:04.909> also<00:06:05.150> to<00:06:05.449> detail<00:06:06.520> this

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
want to show you also to detail this

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.730 
want to show you also to detail this
elements<00:06:07.970> like<00:06:08.210> for<00:06:08.539> instance<00:06:08.690> how<00:06:09.139> we<00:06:09.500> can

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
elements like for instance how we can

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.310 
elements like for instance how we can
put<00:06:09.949> a<00:06:09.979> mullion<00:06:10.460> in<00:06:10.610> the<00:06:10.699> middle<00:06:11.000> or<00:06:11.180> a<00:06:11.960> door

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
put a mullion in the middle or a door

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.430 
put a mullion in the middle or a door
maybe<00:06:14.650> so<00:06:15.650> for<00:06:15.889> instance<00:06:16.780> you<00:06:17.780> know<00:06:17.870> this<00:06:18.260> is<00:06:18.409> a

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
maybe so for instance you know this is a

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.770 
maybe so for instance you know this is a
way<00:06:18.650> to<00:06:18.710> create<00:06:19.099> openings<00:06:20.000> through<00:06:20.570> the

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
way to create openings through the

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.469 
way to create openings through the
building<00:06:21.169> and<00:06:21.430> later<00:06:22.430> on<00:06:22.669> I'm<00:06:22.820> gonna<00:06:23.120> create

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
building and later on I'm gonna create

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:29.430 
building and later on I'm gonna create
maybe<00:06:24.260> a<00:06:25.090> little<00:06:26.090> canopy<00:06:26.630> for<00:06:27.199> this<00:06:27.610> final

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
maybe a little canopy for this final

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.070 
maybe a little canopy for this final
floor<00:06:30.440> and<00:06:30.760> then<00:06:31.760> we're<00:06:32.000> gonna<00:06:32.210> look<00:06:32.510> at<00:06:32.719> ways

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
floor and then we're gonna look at ways

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.010 
floor and then we're gonna look at ways
to<00:06:33.409> actually<00:06:34.090> detail<00:06:35.090> the<00:06:35.360> building<00:06:35.750> a<00:06:35.870> little

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.020 
to actually detail the building a little

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.110 
to actually detail the building a little
bit<00:06:36.229> more<00:06:36.440> so<00:06:36.740> to<00:06:36.800> make<00:06:37.099> it<00:06:37.130> a<00:06:37.400> little<00:06:37.550> bit

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
bit more so to make it a little bit

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.510 
bit more so to make it a little bit
more<00:06:38.570> interesting<00:06:39.020> so<00:06:39.560> as<00:06:39.800> always<00:06:40.040> you<00:06:40.430> know
