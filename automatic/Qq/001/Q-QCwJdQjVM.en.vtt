00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.569
 the basis of the site in this lesson we will start 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.420
 template layout 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:12.440
 So the plan for our lesson is first determined 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.389
 site layout further customize the header 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.910
 determine the background of the site and customize 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.070
 footer i.e. our bottom area 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:26.279
 site for the lesson we need 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.710
 Photoshop with our template and running 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.040
 the artisteer program so let's get it 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.969
 run and you have a free version 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.410
 then we start the standard version and in 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.620
 any other case also run 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.550
 standard version choose themes for cms 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.550
 Joomla and analyze the interface 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.090
 program interface 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.120
 It is in the form of tabs on each 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.850
 tab has a corresponding name 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.120
 settings we all try them 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.739
 consider as needed 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.830
 now for the browser to fit in 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.729
 I judge the screen a little 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.610
 window and our tab will pour 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.610
 compact view if necessary we will 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.310
 expand them so first thing we need 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.570
 set our site layout and specify 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.610
 width for the site for this we go 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.710
 photoshop 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.860
 width of our site in our case 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.380
 determined by the width of the cap we can 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.110
 just rulers measure the width or 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.820
 we can kill two birds with one stone 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.869
 cap and find out how wide it is as 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.119
 consequence and what height and so for 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.990
 cutting elements we use 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.850
 tool frame we have rulers on 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.880
 the basis of which we can determine 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:02.030
 the width of the caps that we will cut for 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.030
 more accurate cut increase
