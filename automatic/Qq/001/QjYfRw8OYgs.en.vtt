detachable detachable rest right a

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.200 
detachable detachable rest right a
little<00:00:58.850> bit<00:00:59.000> more<00:00:59.269> about<00:00:59.449> this<00:00:59.629> it's<00:01:00.469> um<00:01:01.210> it's

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
little bit more about this it's um it's

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.930 
little bit more about this it's um it's
plastic<00:01:02.780> it's<00:01:03.140> not<00:01:03.289> rubbery<00:01:03.679> I<00:01:04.040> don't<00:01:04.850> think

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
plastic it's not rubbery I don't think

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.850 
plastic it's not rubbery I don't think
it<00:01:05.210> wear<00:01:05.420> off<00:01:05.449> or<00:01:05.720> become<00:01:05.840> sticky<00:01:06.260> if<00:01:06.560> you<00:01:06.650> play

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
it wear off or become sticky if you play

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.840 
it wear off or become sticky if you play
a<00:01:06.890> lot<00:01:07.100> of<00:01:07.190> this<00:01:09.220> so<00:01:10.220> yeah<00:01:10.520> it<00:01:10.640> looks<00:01:10.790> pretty

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
a lot of this so yeah it looks pretty

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.790 
a lot of this so yeah it looks pretty
good<00:01:11.210> stable<00:01:11.870> and<00:01:12.020> you<00:01:12.140> can<00:01:12.290> take<00:01:12.380> it<00:01:12.500> out<00:01:12.590> I

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
good stable and you can take it out I

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.560 
good stable and you can take it out I
think<00:01:13.370> the<00:01:13.430> coating<00:01:13.730> is<00:01:13.820> that<00:01:14.030> if<00:01:14.450> you

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
think the coating is that if you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.750 
think the coating is that if you
transport<00:01:15.050> this<00:01:15.200> in<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:16.100> competition<00:01:16.400> or

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
transport this in a competition or

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.700 
transport this in a competition or
something<00:01:16.820> you<00:01:17.330> won't<00:01:17.840> have<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.140> like<00:01:18.320> have

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
something you won't have to like have

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.670 
something you won't have to like have
the<00:01:18.860> whole<00:01:19.070> big<00:01:19.520> fat<00:01:19.910> keyboard<00:01:20.540> they<00:01:21.500> can't

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
the whole big fat keyboard they can't

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.230 
the whole big fat keyboard they can't
work<00:01:21.770> taking<00:01:22.040> out<00:01:22.220> a<00:01:22.310> lot<00:01:22.430> of<00:01:22.520> space<00:01:22.760> so<00:01:23.120> it

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
work taking out a lot of space so it

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.810 
work taking out a lot of space so it
probably<00:01:23.420> fits<00:01:23.810> a<00:01:23.960> Razorback<00:01:24.580> another<00:01:25.580> cool

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
probably fits a Razorback another cool

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.200 
probably fits a Razorback another cool
thing<00:01:25.850> is<00:01:26.030> um<00:01:26.420> other<00:01:27.050> than<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.590> texture<00:01:28.550> you

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210

actually get the color it just press the
function<00:01:40.580> key<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.990> just<00:01:42.140> move<00:01:42.320> this<00:01:42.470> up

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.969 

and<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:46.000> lights<00:01:46.180> come<00:01:46.330> on<00:01:46.450> you<00:01:47.350> can<00:01:47.530> adjust<00:01:47.590> it

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
and the lights come on you can adjust it

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.830 
and the lights come on you can adjust it
the<00:01:48.280> intensity<00:01:48.700> right<00:01:49.060> this<00:01:49.450> is<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.630> highest

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
the intensity right this is the highest

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.640 
the intensity right this is the highest
and<00:01:50.260> it<00:01:50.650> looks<00:01:50.830> pretty<00:01:51.040> cool<00:01:52.440> it's<00:01:53.440> really

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
and it looks pretty cool it's really

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.859 
and it looks pretty cool it's really
backlight<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.280> I<00:01:54.759> think<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.479> coating<00:01:55.810> is

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
backlight and I think the coating is

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.149 
backlight and I think the coating is
that<00:01:56.020> you<00:01:56.170> can<00:01:56.290> actually<00:01:56.350> remove<00:01:56.740> every<00:01:56.979> key

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
that you can actually remove every key

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.480 
that you can actually remove every key
there's<00:01:57.549> a<00:01:57.670> key<00:01:58.180> removal<00:01:58.420> thing<00:01:59.220> one<00:02:00.220> feature

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
there's a key removal thing one feature

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.990 
there's a key removal thing one feature
