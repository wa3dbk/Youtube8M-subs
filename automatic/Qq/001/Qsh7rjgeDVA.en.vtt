00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:24.820
 set of loops with perry whales first 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:29.550
 make an air loop and put this 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.550
 loop on one knitting needle 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:43.500
 then call with your thumb 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.500
 work thread and upward movement 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.010
 pull the loop 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:54.090
 hold the index finger and 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:59.370
 tighten the loop 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.920
 after that we take a knitting needle in the right hand 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.990
 top down 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:14.380
 dress inside the first eyelet and 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:19.420
 we pass the second loop through 1 1 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:28.200
 the loop is ready to dial again 2 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:31.590
 thumb loops 1 2 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.390
 hold the index finger 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.620
 loops we take a needle in the left hand 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.340
 we see 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.430
 under the previous loop and throw 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.610
 her 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:53.680
 will be so pull the last 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:56.140
 loop and we got two already 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.540
 loops which are located on 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.939
 some distance from each other and 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.950
 further repeat on logical 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:10.049
 we collect from the thumb 2 loops 1 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.049
 and 2 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:24.120
 and then with the help of the spokes throw 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:28.540
 loop pulling out the last loop and 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:33.760
 so we type loops 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:36.880
 on like this will look like 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.660
 dialed loops they are located each 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:45.130
 from a friend at some distance and 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.710
 This method is used very rarely with 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.980
