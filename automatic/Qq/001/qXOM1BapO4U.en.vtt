 gap Finally the form of professional Takeuchi knowledge 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.410
 Thank you Thank you for download for those of Mr. Park 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.779
 Was 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.750
 If you haven't downloaded it yet, you can download it from the url below. 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.430
 Please download 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:37.440
 So to today 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:40.440
 I think that I want to solve many troubles sent to Takeuchi pros 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.440
 uh 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.980
 Then it is today's question 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:54.610
 This is a question from Mr. k I look forward to information that will always be helpful 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:59.960
 Recently I have tried line shots 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:05.690
 As for directionality, more than 80% of ha is as aim 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:09.920
 However, it seems that the flight distance will drop by about 1 from the control shots so far 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:13.040
 Because there are few spins, it does not stop at green 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.150
 Mast would say full in the back 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.900
 The direction is good, so if you stay green you will still score 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:26.540
 When it might shrink near it in 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.690
 I understand that, please guide the spin-conditioned Uchikata in line shot 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.530
 That's it pro 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.250
 Thanking you in advance 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:37.659
 Hi So I hope to solve my trouble today as well 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.980
 line shot ball on line shot 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.790
 I would go to the back without stopping 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:46.540
 I think that I would like to demonstrate such worries that it is a line nurse by all means 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:51.670
 That it does not the low ze Shon of the face 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.960
 The scale of the soul is getting lower a little, of course I think it's hard to stop Bora 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.020
 But 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:02.409
 In We will certainly very becoming, for example, follow-up to that use both the scene 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:06.070
 At a position such as a pin in front of a bunker crossing 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:09.789
 I think it's a little difficult to say that it's a line 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.680
 Just stop the ball a little bit of it 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.120
 If it hits say 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.370
 Continue to press and lessons that or going over to your tofu say with the rotation of the ball 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.990
 Please see 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:26.520
 When it comes to stopping the ball by all means 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:29.620
 A ball that is slightly faded from the left with a slight weak ball 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:34.870
 Is more likely to stop on the green 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.950
 For example, a ball with a strong hook will roll as much as possible 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.239
 A little school here 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:45.599
 The ball is hit by hitting the ball like falling like a slippery right 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:49.370
 The ball becomes easier to stop on the green as it becomes weaker 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.370
 One will introduce its out how 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.950
 First you will be asked to address usually in 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.870
 Since there is no line, I will try to hold the face a little fast 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.340
 Don't change his name 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:11.190
 Going to the Mamatan this state back swing c 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:14.560
 I think but I will add one ingenuity here 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.319
 Stance orientation is more open than goal orientation 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.840
 Yes we will 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.840
 Face face is fine in target target direction 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:30.760
 Back swing as swing path is raised a little more out-of-filed 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.620
 Because yo hit in full or it wrist from here 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.620
 Firmly rotate the ball 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.790
 We will shake in the direction of oxygen 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.830
 By doing so 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:53.030
 In us a little bit out to the left 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:04:00.700
 The ball is in I think that is the kind of ball come back to the target direction strike once this 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:00.700
 3 transgressions Please try waving in to say the direction of the orientation and movement of the swing path face 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.629
 part 2 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.680
 It is a system 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.000
 Yes It is now launched in the Stars Daihiro 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:39.740
 In the middle of the street, just as you go 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:45.140
 Ball Tamasuji has gone out the stance direction a little to open, such as 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:50.180
 Target the face in the direction of Mogi Backswing that stance later there 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:52.110
 In this kind of rotation by going down swing from the star warehouse to 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.529
 The ball will fly 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.989
 All 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:05:01.439
 Check the stop condition of the goal while now the real lesson above please try this exercise 

00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:01.439
 End
