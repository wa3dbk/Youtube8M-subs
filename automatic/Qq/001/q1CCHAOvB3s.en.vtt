00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
Clipper we're gonna cut our fade line

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.950 
Clipper we're gonna cut our fade line
around<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.880> head<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.150> our<00:01:21.270> Clipper<00:01:21.600> then

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
around the head with our Clipper then

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.539 
around the head with our Clipper then
we're<00:01:22.080> gonna<00:01:22.200> cut<00:01:22.500> out<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.680> bottom<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.280> layer

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
we're gonna cut out the bottom and layer

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.250 
we're gonna cut out the bottom and layer
out<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.940> top<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.479> fades<00:01:24.780> gonna<00:01:25.110> be

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
finished and we're gonna see it on his

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.640 
finished and we're gonna see it on his
head<00:01:27.150> that's<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:27.930> premise<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.380> what<00:01:28.530> we're

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
head that's the premise for what we're

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.800 
head that's the premise for what we're
gonna<00:01:28.740> do<00:01:28.979> let's<00:01:29.520> watch<00:01:29.760> it<00:01:29.970> there<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:30.540> four

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
gonna do let's watch it there are four

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.539 
gonna do let's watch it there are four
steps<00:01:31.260> to<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.500> feeding<00:01:31.799> process<00:01:32.070> we're<00:01:32.460> gonna

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
steps to the feeding process we're gonna

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.550 
steps to the feeding process we're gonna
look<00:01:32.700> at<00:01:32.880> today<00:01:33.030> step<00:01:33.690> number<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.320> pick

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
look at today step number one is pick

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.680 
look at today step number one is pick
your<00:01:34.710> fade<00:01:34.950> point<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.430> step<00:01:35.700> takes<00:01:35.970> no<00:01:36.390> time

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
your fade point this step takes no time

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.780 
your fade point this step takes no time

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
remaining here through the bottom to

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.570 
remaining here through the bottom to
finish<00:05:06.200> our<00:05:06.380> fame<00:05:06.620> of<00:05:06.830> course<00:05:07.220> we<00:05:07.370> still<00:05:07.520> have

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
to go into the line and edge him up but

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.020 
to go into the line and edge him up but
that<00:05:09.410> takes<00:05:09.650> just<00:05:09.770> a<00:05:09.979> couple<00:05:10.160> seconds<00:05:10.639> so

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030
