 welcome to this first episode of 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.470
 this series on stranded deep is a game 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.589
 it is still an alpha of this we say 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.310
 survival in the first person the ocean is 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:26.490
 really fantastic and streets of 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:33.410
 literally it would mean then what 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:41.040
 will mean that fucking streets back then 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:42.480
 stranded of ok great ok come on 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.250
 who cares about the name began 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.570
 our adventure 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.910
 yes I had already done a few hours of 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.900
 game to understand for us to bring you 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.270
 practically nothing 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.130
 however really very very nice guys 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.030
 your home is awakened because it hears noises 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.980
 bru 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.510
 we have a private jet apparently 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.030
 we have a private jet that means 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:07.170
 that we are the steve jobs or or 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.829
 steve jobs ok see there was all the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.829
 pillow that's why we woke up 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:15.570
 then we had there we are we have a jet 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:19.859
 private but we don't have a serious meter goes 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.829
 well, let's see if we're going 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:24.840
 this is very interesting because it makes us 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.149
 understand where we are going 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.690
 we are giving japan to japan sta 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.060
 speaking 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.010
 excellent excellent we now know where 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.330
 we are therefore in the ocean not 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.000
 I know his name and I don't 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.830
 ask if the two are working there 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.710

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.810

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.870

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.210
 the ipad that and you're sleeping ok not 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.390

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.030
 turbulence we can make us martinic see 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.580
 other of the food packaged the coca cola 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.390
 gear that they give us on the plane to us 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.680
 he sees the martini and that martini e 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.000
 is 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.500
 ok let's take this martini and the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.899
 health to the salvation of our journey 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.240
 therefore we have toasted for excellence 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.280
 you have to come back 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.400
 I hope it will be a long journey 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:23.850
 I toasted on purpose you know it's a bit if yes 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.800
 see ok let's sit these paccheri 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.680
 damn turbulence and you didn't have to 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.680
 I said it and I repeated the pair of 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.900
 sometimes you don't have to play with the iPad 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.760
 while driving a plane can be 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.270
 obviously dangerous then who is that there 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.800
 remits it's me no oh well 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.800
 we are all safe at the end 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:52.030
 the pact ok ok I hope you are not 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.560
 removed closes because indeed 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.410
 there will be a bit of everything I can save 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.330
 something on the computer maybe not ok 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.610
 here we go 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.480
 we are always in the midst of their japan 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.880
 died 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.010
 they are gone, now they are gone 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.140
 I never garage for I had ever noticed 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:15.060
 I've never even noticed why the other one 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:18.870
 second time I do liter start 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.870
 we go up on this beautiful 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.879
 but she 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.740
 ok guys we arrived on the island with 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.040
 this oar is a fun thing I have 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:40.580
 noticed that suggests that it is an alpha but 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:43.790
 we can really enjoy ourselves 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.470
 tremble on the beach like gods 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.490
 idiots 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:52.670
 look it's funny ok the threat of 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.530
 this game as soon as we will understand only or 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.430
 kaki just the threat of this game 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.290
 are the 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.910
 that is, we are full of never seen sharks 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.760
 so many sharks in a game are 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.710
 they see these cute tortellini 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.570
 that they are getting too close I take 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:12.620
 very bad and you are really so bad 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.750
 hi ok which is a pretty thing that 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.040
 scares the hundred of luck because I have 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.020
 seen before there are wrecks 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.989
 near our island that allows us 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.890
 to find great stuff you see with leo 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.270
 wreck 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.950
 apart from the sharks that maybe there are 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.410
 too many but oh well 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:31.300
 ok to start telling you to pick up 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:35.300
 at least let's take this knife 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:38.930
 and we start to cut something like 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.380
 this is the first thing we will do 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.810
 be it an ax or a hammer that I am however 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.220
 very important or you quit it ok 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.770
 watch that there is another wreck 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.750
 boogie woogie no joke 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.140
 I have to stop making bear grylls 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.030
 of the situation ok 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.140
 we cut what to feel when he has us 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:03.200
 practice of hunting a lot when 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:07.430
 near them and take these here 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:10.580
 ok great great we talk this in now 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.890
 look for stones and pebbles there is one 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.250
 shark that wreck will hide something 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:18.140
 that we can certainly use this is 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.040
 a stone because we need it for the 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.870
 hammer another stylic and boys 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.190
 I wanted to ask you to let me know if 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.320
 you want the face cam of the next episode 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:33.690
 and I will be happy to bring it to you 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:35.790
 while while while I'm trying to 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.090
 collect these endless stones 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.940
 amount of stones is really big like 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.770
 fantastic island waxed by ass of 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.480
 great luxury recoil 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.060
 if you let yourself pass the term ass 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.970
 however they also prefer luxury value 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.160
 he is following us we have no team 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.890
 because there is this music 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.060
 I see another wreck that comes out though 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.340
 obviously we have to prepare well 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.460
 before returning to the ocean as gods 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:07.560
 we can craft 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.940
 an ax I would say with one of these 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.770
 the beauty of this game is created 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:18.540
 throwing to the ground the ground stuff 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:22.770
 I would like a bit like cuckoo ok not 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:25.650
 we make sticks I think one goes 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:34.290
 well and I 'm not a hammer an ax 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:36.510
 and do and try to even them 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:43.110
 we take all this stuff 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:47.010
 my name is aqua il passo ok 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:50.090
 a scene ok guys 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.620
 our first tool of destruction 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.000
 was created let me say that 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.910
 we can close here the first episode 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.220

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.080
 quite long pretty enough 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.020

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.010
