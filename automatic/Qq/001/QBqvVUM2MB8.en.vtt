copy<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.369> we're<00:01:23.460> copying<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.939> layer<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.780> this

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
copy so we're copying the layer on this

bit<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.790> filter<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.720> got<00:01:27.810> two<00:01:27.930> filters

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
bit of a filter so you got two filters

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.160
