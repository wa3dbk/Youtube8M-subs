480 pixel display it is a resistive

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.450 
480 pixel display it is a resistive
display<00:05:29.140> so<00:05:29.200> it<00:05:29.440> works<00:05:29.620> with<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:29.890> stylus<00:05:30.100> as

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460

well<00:05:31.380> it's<00:05:32.380> got<00:05:32.590> a<00:05:32.620> GPS<00:05:33.160> and<00:05:34.890> it<00:05:35.890> looks<00:05:36.070> like<00:05:36.190> a

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
well it's got a GPS and it looks like a

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.650 
well it's got a GPS and it looks like a
look<00:05:36.400> at<00:05:36.490> that<00:05:36.580> nap<00:05:38.700> comes<00:05:39.700> with<00:05:39.820> VZ<00:05:40.030> navigator

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
look at that nap comes with VZ navigator

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.480 
look at that nap comes with VZ navigator
and<00:05:40.840> guess<00:05:41.110> what<00:05:41.320> Verizon<00:05:41.800> is<00:05:41.890> not<00:05:42.190> locking

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
and guess what Verizon is not locking

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.640 
and guess what Verizon is not locking
