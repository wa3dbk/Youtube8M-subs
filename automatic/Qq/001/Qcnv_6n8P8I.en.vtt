a good player but who doesn't have

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.509 
a good player but who doesn't have
necessarily<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:39.080> giant<00:02:39.560> chip<00:02:39.769> stack<00:02:40.160> you're

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
necessarily a giant chip stack you're

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.250 
necessarily a giant chip stack you're
both<00:02:40.700> relatively<00:02:41.150> even<00:02:41.510> whatever<00:02:41.750> what<00:02:42.049> kind

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
both relatively even whatever what kind

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.080 
both relatively even whatever what kind
of<00:02:42.290> things<00:02:42.530> are<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:43.190> thinking<00:02:43.310> about<00:02:43.850> when

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
of things are you thinking about when

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.809 
of things are you thinking about when
they<00:02:44.480> set<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:45.019> solid<00:02:45.500> player<00:02:45.830> on<00:02:46.040> your<00:02:46.160> left<00:02:46.370> um

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
they set a solid player on your left um

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.580 
they set a solid player on your left um
I<00:02:46.970> mean<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.480> guess<00:02:47.750> it<00:02:47.870> really<00:02:47.959> depends<00:02:48.290> what<00:02:48.470> my

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
I mean I guess it really depends what my

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.559 
I mean I guess it really depends what my
stack<00:02:48.860> size<00:02:49.040> is<00:02:49.190> -<00:02:49.370> like<00:02:49.610> if<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.239> have<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.390> lot<00:02:50.540> of

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
stack size is - like if I have a lot of

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.539 
stack size is - like if I have a lot of
chips<00:02:50.810> especially<00:02:51.650> closer<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.100> bubble<00:02:52.250> I

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
chips especially closer to a bubble I

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.130 
chips especially closer to a bubble I
know<00:02:52.940> he's<00:02:53.209> going<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.390> perceive<00:02:53.690> my<00:02:53.840> opening

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
know he's going to perceive my opening

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.770 
know he's going to perceive my opening
ranges<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> lot<00:02:54.680> wider<00:02:54.860> than<00:02:55.120> than<00:02:56.120> sort<00:02:56.630> of<00:02:56.660> the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
ranges a lot wider than than sort of the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.140 
ranges a lot wider than than sort of the
average<00:02:57.140> average<00:02:57.799> player<00:02:58.069> so<00:02:58.670> I<00:02:58.700> have<00:02:58.850> to<00:02:58.970> kind

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
average average player so I have to kind

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.940 
average average player so I have to kind
of<00:02:59.209> like<00:02:59.390> gauge<00:02:59.690> what<00:03:00.049> his<00:03:00.200> shoving<00:03:00.799> range

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
of like gauge what his shoving range

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.140 
of like gauge what his shoving range
would<00:03:01.040> be<00:03:01.100> on<00:03:01.250> me<00:03:01.370> assuming<00:03:01.730> he<00:03:01.790> has<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:01.910> shove

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
would be on me assuming he has a shove

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.910 
would be on me assuming he has a shove
stack<00:03:02.390> how<00:03:02.989> frequently<00:03:03.440> he's<00:03:03.620> gonna<00:03:03.739> be

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
stack how frequently he's gonna be

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.690 
stack how frequently he's gonna be
3betting<00:03:04.340> me<00:03:04.660> so<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:06.019> mean<00:03:06.530> unfortunately<00:03:07.310> I

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
3betting me so I mean unfortunately I

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.740 
3betting me so I mean unfortunately I
don't<00:03:07.790> really<00:03:08.120> have<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.359> think<00:03:08.480> about<00:03:08.600> all

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
don't really have to think about all

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.699 
don't really have to think about all
these<00:03:08.840> things<00:03:08.900> right<00:03:09.140> now<00:03:09.200> cuz<00:03:09.500> I've<00:03:09.590> been

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
these things right now cuz I've been

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
I've been short stack essentially all

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.259

day<00:03:11.950> so<00:03:12.950> yeah<00:03:13.609> I<00:03:13.640> was<00:03:13.760> just<00:03:13.910> having<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.120> lot<00:03:14.209> of

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
day so yeah I was just having a lot of

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:15.729 
day so yeah I was just having a lot of
fun<00:03:14.450> at<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.660> bubble<00:03:14.930> and<00:03:15.170> I<00:03:15.320> haven't<00:03:15.560> really

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
fun at the bubble and I haven't really

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:16.420 
fun at the bubble and I haven't really
been<00:03:15.769> think<00:03:15.950> about<00:03:16.100> those<00:03:16.190> kind<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.370> things

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
been think about those kind of things

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.759 
been think about those kind of things
but<00:03:16.640> hopefully<00:03:17.299> if<00:03:17.390> I<00:03:17.450> double<00:03:17.720> up<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.079> get<00:03:18.680> it

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
but hopefully if I double up and get it

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.530 
but hopefully if I double up and get it
up<00:03:18.859> a<00:03:18.950> bit<00:03:19.100> here<00:03:19.310> then<00:03:19.489> then<00:03:20.299> I'll<00:03:20.420> be<00:03:20.510> more

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
up a bit here then then I'll be more

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.240 
up a bit here then then I'll be more
more<00:03:20.959> focused<00:03:21.290> on<00:03:21.380> that<00:03:21.530> kind<00:03:21.709> of<00:03:21.769> that<00:03:22.130> kind

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
more focused on that kind of that kind

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.920 
more focused on that kind of that kind
of<00:03:22.340> stuff<00:03:22.519> well<00:03:23.060> speaking<00:03:23.510> of<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.630> really

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
of stuff well speaking of the really

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.930 
of stuff well speaking of the really
long<00:03:24.079> bubble<00:03:24.380> another<00:03:25.130> thing<00:03:25.370> I<00:03:25.459> noticed<00:03:25.760> at

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
long bubble another thing I noticed at

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.849 
long bubble another thing I noticed at
your<00:03:26.359> table<00:03:26.780> specifically<00:03:27.380> there<00:03:27.530> was<00:03:27.560> one

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
your table specifically there was one

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.280 
your table specifically there was one
hand<00:03:28.130> that<00:03:28.250> seemed<00:03:28.640> to<00:03:28.790> be<00:03:28.880> going<00:03:29.060> for<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.750> mean

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
hand that seemed to be going for I mean

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.110 
hand that seemed to be going for I mean
15<00:03:30.739> minutes<00:03:31.040> easily<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.670> when<00:03:31.819> you're<00:03:31.940> in<00:03:32.090> a

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
15 minutes easily and when you're in a

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.150 
15 minutes easily and when you're in a
bubble<00:03:32.359> type<00:03:32.630> situation<00:03:33.109> obviously<00:03:33.260> things

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
bubble type situation obviously things

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.280 
bubble type situation obviously things
are<00:03:34.310> different<00:03:34.489> than<00:03:34.819> say<00:03:35.329> maybe<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.049> desire

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
are different than say maybe the desire

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.390 
are different than say maybe the desire
to<00:03:36.319> have<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.560> 30-second<00:03:37.190> shot<00:03:37.220> clock

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
to have a 30-second shot clock

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.250 
to have a 30-second shot clock
everyone's<00:03:37.970> just<00:03:38.120> kicking<00:03:38.420> back<00:03:38.450> what<00:03:39.109> was

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
everyone's just kicking back what was

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.229 
everyone's just kicking back what was
going<00:03:39.530> on<00:03:39.620> there<00:03:39.859> the<00:03:40.040> irony<00:03:40.760> in<00:03:40.880> that<00:03:40.910> hand

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
going on there the irony in that hand

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.210 
going on there the irony in that hand
actually<00:03:41.480> was<00:03:41.870> that<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.530> three<00:03:42.859> people<00:03:43.069> that

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
actually was that the three people that

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.740 
actually was that the three people that
were<00:03:43.280> involved<00:03:43.549> in<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.819> hand<00:03:44.000> were<00:03:44.269> pretty

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
were involved in the hand were pretty

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.309 
were involved in the hand were pretty
much<00:03:44.840> not<00:03:45.200> even<00:03:45.650> close<00:03:45.829> to<00:03:45.980> at<00:03:46.100> risk<00:03:46.130> to<00:03:46.940> bust

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
much not even close to at risk to bust

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.840 
much not even close to at risk to bust
so<00:03:48.319> I<00:03:48.650> think<00:03:48.739> it's<00:03:49.010> one<00:03:49.130> of<00:03:49.220> those<00:03:49.280> hands<00:03:49.609> that

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
so I think it's one of those hands that

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.699 
so I think it's one of those hands that
based<00:03:50.420> on<00:03:50.569> the<00:03:50.690> action<00:03:51.019> that<00:03:51.109> was<00:03:51.200> raised<00:03:51.440> and

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
based on the action that was raised and

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.140 
based on the action that was raised and
a-three<00:03:51.950> better<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:52.370> over<00:03:52.579> call<00:03:52.760> and<00:03:53.030> then

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
a-three better and over call and then

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.819 
a-three better and over call and then
two<00:03:53.450> streets<00:03:53.660> of<00:03:53.810> betting<00:03:54.049> I<00:03:54.200> think<00:03:54.709> that

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
two streets of betting I think that

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.800 
two streets of betting I think that
based<00:03:55.010> on<00:03:55.220> all<00:03:55.549> that<00:03:55.910> action<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.480> hand<00:03:56.690> will

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
based on all that action the hand will

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.840 
based on all that action the hand will
probably<00:03:57.170> take<00:03:57.410> anywhere<00:03:58.310> between<00:03:58.370> five<00:03:58.819> and

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
probably take anywhere between five and

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.309 
probably take anywhere between five and
eight<00:03:59.030> minutes<00:03:59.359> but<00:03:59.540> because<00:03:59.900> of<00:03:59.930> the

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
eight minutes but because of the

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.740 
eight minutes but because of the
combined

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
combined

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.210 
combined
tanks<00:04:01.110> of<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.380> other<00:04:01.620> short<00:04:01.890> acts<00:04:02.070> at<00:04:02.190> the

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
tanks of the other short acts at the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.800 
tanks of the other short acts at the
table<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:03.030> seemed<00:04:03.210> like<00:04:03.330> it<00:04:03.450> lasted<00:04:03.480> a

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
table it seemed like it lasted a

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.190 
table it seemed like it lasted a
lifetime<00:04:04.220> so<00:04:05.220> in<00:04:05.550> that<00:04:05.700> so<00:04:05.940> yeah<00:04:06.120> I<00:04:06.150> mean<00:04:06.450> it's

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
lifetime so in that so yeah I mean it's

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.750 
lifetime so in that so yeah I mean it's
interesting<00:04:07.380> you<00:04:07.680> know<00:04:07.770> a<00:04:07.800> lot<00:04:08.160> of<00:04:08.250> people<00:04:08.490> at

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
interesting you know a lot of people at

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.170 
interesting you know a lot of people at
a<00:04:09.300> big<00:04:09.540> bubble<00:04:09.810> like<00:04:09.960> this<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.410> think<00:04:11.190> it's<00:04:11.460> you

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
a big bubble like this I think it's you

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.940 
a big bubble like this I think it's you
know<00:04:12.210> there's<00:04:12.810> no<00:04:12.930> point<00:04:13.170> in<00:04:13.230> pretending<00:04:13.380> that

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
know there's no point in pretending that

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.140 
know there's no point in pretending that
like<00:04:14.130> you<00:04:14.220> have<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.370> decision<00:04:14.490> every<00:04:14.850> hand<00:04:15.090> I

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
like you have a decision every hand I

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.729 
like you have a decision every hand I
think<00:04:15.210> what's<00:04:15.510> really<00:04:15.570> important<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:16.620> know

if<00:04:16.950> you're<00:04:17.250> gonna<00:04:17.370> tank<00:04:17.700> every<00:04:17.940> hand<00:04:18.180> make<00:04:18.900> a

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
if you're gonna tank every hand make a

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.300 
if you're gonna tank every hand make a
big<00:04:19.170> joke<00:04:19.350> about<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.709> you<00:04:19.799> know<00:04:19.920> like<00:04:20.160> it's
