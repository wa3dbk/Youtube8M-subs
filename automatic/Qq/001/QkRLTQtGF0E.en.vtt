00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.050
 hello friends I bring you a video a bit 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.750
 different from what 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.830
 I usually do but this is for 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.190
 comment 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.560
 one thing that surely more than one of 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.240
 you have happened to them and it is that 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.770
 the problem with the batteries of 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.250
 lithium 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:38.720
 I do not know if you can see it but you can 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.340
 swelling over time is almost not 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.760
 I know if you can see the video well for 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.620
 be very compared to the original 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.379
 and you have to be very careful with this 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.930
 type of batteries because because if 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.990
 continues to swell at any given time can 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.060
 get to burst 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.120
 get warm enough to learn 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.310
 in fire and caused much damage to 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.810
 equipment on which they are installed and 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.870
 especially to the person who is using 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.900
 that equipment can be a telephone or in 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.480
 the case of a laptop a phone 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.910
 Portable this has happened to me twice 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.280
 but it is for example from samsung with two 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.320
 batteries is not because samsung 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.760
 be better or worse doing batteries neither 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.860
 much less because normally these are 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:27.060
 they buy them from third-party companies but 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.520
 yes it is true that 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.830
 coincidences of life basically in 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.920
 the only laptop are the only phone 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.890
 samsung who had where this happened 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.570
 but there are also ways to 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.120
 try to avoid this although not always 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.790
 it is possible since usually 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.970
 They have integrated circuits within 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.860
 the batteries that's why they have more than two 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.620
 Positive and negative terminals are usually 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.720
 have a temperature sensor and 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.210
 they control the current that is 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.750
 installing to avoid 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.880
 just this ok but not always 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.479
 work and some of the causes that 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.450
 can cause this one of the reasons that 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.900
 cause this type of swelling can not 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.730
 be a manufacturing defect can be 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.590
 also for example by heat that is 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.770
 if we are a phone that 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.410
 has a quad core 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.140
 2 millimeters thick because it is 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.730
 It's obvious that it's going to heat up when 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.730
 It is heated matter hurts 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.810
 it can also be that the charger 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.220
 was wrong or the phone itself the 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.830
 charging circuit was not 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.510
 working properly can also 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.160
 be for example in the case of my 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.860
 laptop most likely there is 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.390
 been because we say do not exercise the 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.100
 enough battery that means 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.290
 this that is always bad always reduces 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.680
 abadina battery life 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.049
 The cycle of loading and unloading is 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.909
 say load it or download it charge it 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.980
 downloading that produces the life of the 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.900
 battery however failure to do so 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.159
 also in the case of important 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.590
 probably that what occurred 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.569
 I do not use the laptop with battery 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.970
 almost never used it once 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.769
 per week maybe times go by weeks 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.310
 I do not use it with batteries and it's not 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.709
 always connected to the current this 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.019
 can make this happen that I'm 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.180
 showing now what is most important 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.250
 is that once it happens, you have to 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.900
 change the battery unless you want 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.480
 risk losing your hands' and we're 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.819
 giving it is important to even turn on 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.030
 fire to your house that you for example can 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.190
 leave the pc connected running I do not know 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.930
 what 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.760
 I'm doing the food and suddenly it 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.750
 catch fire and you can burn in your house 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.040
 which is important above all 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.900
 remove the battery and look for a substitute 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.030
 if necessary and if it is not necessary 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.730
 we can use important for example without 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.930
 matter usually there are no problems 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.850
 and some that have some 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.590
 limitations but usually use a 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.730
 Portable stand without material is not 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.070
 no problem as long as it's 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.810
 connected to the current since with the 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.430
 limitations that this entails as well 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.050
 I'm updating and the 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.870
 electricity or the cable is disconnected 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.760
 so that it goes out 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.980
 and be able to affect the update and 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.989
 give us problems however use it 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.789
 like a fish is normal 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.280
 now well once we have the 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.289
 battery out is important also not 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.630
 let her throw it in the trash not much 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:28.430
 less because this can cause damage not 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.930
 only to people 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.330
 we see that they take care of 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.820
 to collect the garbage and so on but that 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.590
 it can also pollute the environment a lot 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.600
 environment with which it is always 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.910
 interesting is always 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.370
 obligatory, I would say I get rid of 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.860
 batteries in a suitable place for it 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.800
 they exist normally in practically 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.569
 all countries 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.719
 it's more us less that's true 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:59.029
 clean points or points where 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:01.360
 recycle or let's say the 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:03.469
 batteries as they should be treated because they are 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.020
 can really be dangerous 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:07.520
 battery of this size and see if this already 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.589
 can be dangerous there are people who have 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.899
 killed by explosions of this kind of 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:13.520
 batteries of this size because they are 

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:16.939
 ignites the fire in the pants and 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.219
 burn x imagine what you can do 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:23.249
 a battery of this size that is 15 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:26.309
 volts and they are 91 volts 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:29.999
 watts 6000 hours look lost hours 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:32.699
 basically a lot more than this with 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:33.029
 which is important then get rid of 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.939
 they 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:39.479
 in the right place and while not 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:42.350
 Sometimes we do not get rid of it 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:45.740
 what we can do is save them 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.360
 in a container that is fresh from 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.770
 World'm not heat up as much 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.150
 important because it heats up can 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.660
 happen what I have told you 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:58.500
 40 I do not mean 20 degrees 30 degrees 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:01.050
 40 50 60 onwards it says it does not 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.580
 overcome do not expose to more than 140 degrees 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.180
 well in any case avoid it 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.340
 hot and also avoid puncturing 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.690
 this after clicking with any 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.690
 thing can also cause 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.430
 that things happen for example can 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.720
 cause the components to come out 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.630
 chemicals that are also quite 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.900
 pollutants so nothing good is 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.970
 just comment that 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.210
 although batteries can be expensive 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.639
 I recommend much change are worth more 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:33.710
 your arms or your life than what you can 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:36.110
 cost a battery and if not then not 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.630
 use it though the phone or the laptop 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.610
 keep working please do not use 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:44.919
 batteries when they are swollen not the 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.919
 use good but what 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.640
 let this video serve as advice 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.740
 upstairs if you like please and 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.080
 share those that may be 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.730
 useful because the truth is that it is 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.060
 important to keep this in mind 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.060
 greeting
