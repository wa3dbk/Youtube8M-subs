00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.359
 serene in my report card 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:10.650
 daniele this responds bardella 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.840
 on we see Italian 2 mathematics one 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.670
 english hari bari was difficult in a 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.990
 difficult field away is not one 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.550
 science and question mark not 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.390
 therefore classified that means 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.619
 6 euro economy conducted okay least 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.619
 it is the sufficiency of the conduct 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:32.090
 desperate but then an economy like hours 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.090
 needs recovered that set sunsets 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.430
 enter the far it's not you the 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.810
 world thinks that there is always something 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.340
 worse for example 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.950
 who knows what direct or mother when the 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.310
 will see but above all will notice that 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.310
 fake 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.160
 even if at this moment it seems a lot 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.500
 difficult to recover a debt is 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.080
 possible there are different strategies for 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.400
 do it for example always go volunteers 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.500
 in fact, to questions 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.300
 allows you to always be prepared and 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.070
 above all not to be caught precisely 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.510
 unprepared by the professor perhaps from 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.860
 a query that he decides a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.240
 another suggestion I can give is 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.220
 that of going to take repetitions 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.470
 where indeed it is a large one 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.150
 gap in a subject in which it is not 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.200
 necessary to study but must 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.880
 also make your own concepts 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.369
 fundamental for example for how much 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.550
 it concerns mathematics and Latin or others 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.810
 subjects of this type 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.940
 finally what advice is from 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.500
 study in groups if there are friends who 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.840
 they are better than you who succeed 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.149
 however to better understand the subject a 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.649
 equal in fact to sought professors 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.540
 precisely to find moments of study 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.790
 with them because they are surely gods 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.930
 your peers will then be able to explain 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.930
 well what they learned 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.010
 guys the advice we give you is 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.630
 to tell your parents right away 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.700
 how things are if you have 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.170
 insufficiencies don't wait for it 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.490
 teachers say on the day of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.470
 delivery of your report cards 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.640
 but you are the first to tell him me 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.620
 ask with them in a perspective of 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.120
 dialogue explained for what reasons not 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.560
 you managed to get the 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.810
 sufficiencies of subjects and promises to 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.800
 them to engage above all started 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.800
 right now to do so 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.770
 raise the average with the religion vote 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.050
 it is clearly an urban legend 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.870
 in fact religion like all the others 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.819
 other matters do not give a choice 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.280
 numerical judgment but express 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.410
 a judgment of quality substantially 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.819
 on the work done by the student 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.360
 therefore for this reason they cannot 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.880
 do media 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.640
 however the vote of the prof of religion o 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.380
 that of the alternative matter counts 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.940
 in files in the polls for what 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.800
 concerns the choice of promotion or 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.959
 of the rejection and the interesting thing 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.640
 is that it matters as much as that maybe 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.470
 of the Italian professor of mathematics 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.180
 so the council earn the 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.840
 the sympathies of your prof 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.840
 alternative teachings 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.350
 yes the conduct is average so we will 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.670
 we absolutely recommend having one 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.500
 good conduct during the hours 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.210
 school because this then sold to 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.310
 raise the vote of the report card to 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.080
 otherwise we remind you of the 5 in conduct 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.080
 you are automatically rejected
