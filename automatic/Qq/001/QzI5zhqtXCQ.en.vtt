00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
what people would normally see is just

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.539 
what people would normally see is just
well<00:01:04.390> it's<00:01:04.629> a<00:01:04.720> tower<00:01:04.930> defense<00:01:05.320> game<00:01:05.590> yeah<00:01:06.189> it's

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
well it's a tower defense game yeah it's

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:07.859 
well it's a tower defense game yeah it's
pretty<00:01:06.790> different<00:01:07.119> actually<00:01:07.570> it's<00:01:07.720> get

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
pretty different actually it's get

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.420 
pretty different actually it's get
components<00:01:08.380> of<00:01:08.439> it<00:01:08.530> a<00:01:08.650> tower<00:01:08.950> defense<00:01:09.220> game<00:01:09.400> I

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
components of it a tower defense game I

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.590 
components of it a tower defense game I
think<00:01:09.520> when<00:01:09.759> you<00:01:09.850> think<00:01:09.880> about<00:01:10.090> things<00:01:10.330> like

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
think when you think about things like

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.899 
think when you think about things like
an<00:01:10.780> enemy<00:01:11.680> trying<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.070> get<00:01:12.189> from<00:01:12.340> one<00:01:12.369> spot<00:01:12.759> of

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
an enemy trying to get from one spot of

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.669 
an enemy trying to get from one spot of
the<00:01:13.030> world<00:01:13.179> to<00:01:13.299> another<00:01:13.450> that's<00:01:14.079> important

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
the world to another that's important

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:16.200 
the world to another that's important
aspect<00:01:15.159> of<00:01:15.189> the<00:01:15.280> game<00:01:15.310> but<00:01:15.850> what's<00:01:16.060> different

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
aspect of the game but what's different

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.060 
aspect of the game but what's different
about<00:01:16.420> it<00:01:16.570> for<00:01:16.749> us<00:01:16.869> is<00:01:17.049> you<00:01:17.740> are<00:01:17.829> literally

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
about it for us is you are literally

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.219 
about it for us is you are literally
down<00:01:18.340> on<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.520> ground<00:01:18.700> with<00:01:19.299> with<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:20.079> enemy

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
down on the ground with with the enemy

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.889 
down on the ground with with the enemy
so<00:01:20.649> it's<00:01:21.429> just<00:01:21.759> as<00:01:21.939> much<00:01:21.969> of<00:01:22.149> an<00:01:22.359> action<00:01:22.749> game

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
so it's just as much of an action game

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.630 
so it's just as much of an action game
where<00:01:23.439> you're<00:01:23.649> using<00:01:23.829> your<00:01:24.100> sword<00:01:24.310> you're

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
where you're using your sword you're

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.760 
where you're using your sword you're
using<00:01:24.759> crossbows<00:01:25.119> you're<00:01:25.840> using<00:01:26.020> spells<00:01:26.469> to

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
using crossbows you're using spells to

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.230 
using crossbows you're using spells to
mix<00:01:26.979> it<00:01:27.100> up<00:01:27.159> with<00:01:27.219> them<00:01:27.429> as<00:01:27.670> it<00:01:27.819> is<00:01:27.939> about

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
mix it up with them as it is about

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.919 
mix it up with them as it is about
laying<00:01:28.749> traps<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.850> you've<00:01:31.149> got<00:01:31.179> a<00:01:31.390> really<00:01:31.689> cool

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929

laying traps so you've got a really cool
strategy<00:01:32.409> aspect<00:01:32.560> of<00:01:32.950> it<00:01:33.039> with<00:01:33.159> that<00:01:33.369> with<00:01:33.789> the

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
strategy aspect of it with that with the

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.209 
strategy aspect of it with that with the

obviously<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.510> guys<00:03:40.720> was<00:03:41.440> a<00:03:41.470> different<00:03:41.859> route

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
obviously you guys was a different route

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.270 
obviously you guys was a different route
of<00:03:42.130> backing<00:03:42.519> off<00:03:42.780> going<00:03:43.780> from<00:03:43.900> Triple<00:03:44.410> A<00:03:44.530> game

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
of backing off going from Triple A game

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.180 
of backing off going from Triple A game
to<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:46.299> damn<00:03:46.900> loadable<00:03:47.230> game<00:03:47.470> can<00:03:47.890> you<00:03:47.980> talk<00:03:48.160> a

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
to a damn loadable game can you talk a

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.160 
to a damn loadable game can you talk a
little<00:03:48.280> bit<00:03:48.489> about<00:03:48.700> what<00:03:49.030> that's<00:03:49.239> like<00:03:49.420> yeah

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
little bit about what that's like yeah

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.449 
little bit about what that's like yeah
well<00:03:50.440> you<00:03:50.680> know<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.889> really<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.130> only<00:03:51.220> way

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
well you know the really the only way

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.160 
well you know the really the only way
that<00:03:51.819> I<00:03:51.850> think<00:03:51.910> it's<00:03:52.180> different<00:03:52.959> as<00:03:53.049> the

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
that I think it's different as the

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.140 
that I think it's different as the
amount<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.590> overall<00:03:54.400> time<00:03:54.670> we're<00:03:54.790> spending<00:03:54.880> on

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
amount of overall time we're spending on

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.170 
amount of overall time we're spending on
something<00:03:55.420> so<00:03:56.609> we've<00:03:57.609> made<00:03:57.639> a<00:03:57.850> lot<00:03:57.940> of

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
something so we've made a lot of

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.240 
something so we've made a lot of
conscious<00:03:58.660> decisions<00:03:59.139> just<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.709> focus<00:03:59.889> on

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
conscious decisions just to focus on

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.789 
conscious decisions just to focus on
what's<00:04:00.670> important<00:04:01.389> about<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:02.200> game<00:04:02.410> so

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
what's important about the game so

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.099 
what's important about the game so
there's<00:04:03.310> not<00:04:03.519> a<00:04:03.579> lot<00:04:03.880> of<00:04:03.910> outside<00:04:04.569> fluff

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
there's not a lot of outside fluff

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:06.509 
there's not a lot of outside fluff
that's<00:04:05.350> not<00:04:05.530> getting<00:04:05.829> a<00:04:05.889> lot<00:04:06.010> of<00:04:06.040> attention<00:04:06.459> or

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
that's not getting a lot of attention or

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.640 
that's not getting a lot of attention or
game<00:04:06.639> we<00:04:06.730> just<00:04:06.880> we<00:04:07.030> just<00:04:07.060> don't<00:04:07.329> put<00:04:07.750> it<00:04:07.870> in<00:04:08.019> so

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
game we just we just don't put it in so

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.539 
game we just we just don't put it in so
our<00:04:09.040> plan<00:04:10.000> is<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.540> have<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:11.049> nice<00:04:11.500> concise<00:04:12.400> rich

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
our plan is to have a nice concise rich

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.819 
our plan is to have a nice concise rich
replayable<00:04:15.549> experience<00:04:16.299> that<00:04:17.169> we<00:04:17.320> put<00:04:17.530> a<00:04:17.560> ton

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
replayable experience that we put a ton

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.529 
replayable experience that we put a ton
of<00:04:17.859> triple-a<00:04:18.459> quality<00:04:19.060> I<00:04:19.090> mean<00:04:19.269> that's<00:04:19.419> really

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
of triple-a quality I mean that's really

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.120 
of triple-a quality I mean that's really
all<00:04:19.720> we<00:04:19.750> know<00:04:19.900> how<00:04:19.989> to<00:04:20.079> make<00:04:20.200> is<00:04:20.350> what<00:04:21.039> we

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
all we know how to make is what we

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.920 
all we know how to make is what we
consider<00:04:21.400> triple-a<00:04:21.760> quality<00:04:22.120> highly

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
consider triple-a quality highly

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.810 
consider triple-a quality highly
polished<00:04:23.139> games<00:04:23.530> and<00:04:23.770> so<00:04:24.100> what<00:04:24.340> we<00:04:24.460> have<00:04:24.639> it

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
polished games and so what we have it

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.000 
polished games and so what we have it
may<00:04:25.090> is<00:04:25.389> a<00:04:25.450> downloadable<00:04:25.750> game<00:04:26.139> but<00:04:26.410> inside<00:04:26.919> of

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
may is a downloadable game but inside of

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.770 
may is a downloadable game but inside of
that<00:04:27.070> downloadable<00:04:27.550> game

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
that downloadable game

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.220 
that downloadable game
it's<00:04:28.050> a<00:04:28.200> it's<00:04:28.230> you<00:04:29.010> know<00:04:29.100> it's<00:04:29.130> great<00:04:30.170> now<00:04:31.170> we

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
it's a it's you know it's great now we

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.680 
it's a it's you know it's great now we
played<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.860> pc<00:04:32.370> build<00:04:32.550> of<00:04:32.730> the<00:04:32.790> game<00:04:32.820> so<00:04:33.360> it

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
played the pc build of the game so it

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.240 
played the pc build of the game so it
seems<00:04:34.050> reasonable<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.590> assume<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:34.980> there

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
seems reasonable to assume that there

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.580 
seems reasonable to assume that there
will<00:04:35.400> be<00:04:35.430> a<00:04:35.580> pc<00:04:36.360> version<00:04:36.750> but<00:04:37.380> you<00:04:37.500> guys

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
will be a pc version but you guys
