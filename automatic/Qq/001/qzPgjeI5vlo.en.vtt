00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
push the reason why this push failed was

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.430 
push the reason why this push failed was
because<00:02:50.519> people<00:02:51.269> kept<00:02:51.480> on<00:02:51.630> spotting<00:02:52.079> in<00:02:52.170> level

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
because people kept on spotting in level

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.069 
because people kept on spotting in level
twos<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.920> level<00:02:53.190> threes<00:02:53.549> and<00:02:54.019> honestly<00:02:55.019> you

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
twos and level threes and honestly you

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.780 
twos and level threes and honestly you
can't<00:02:55.380> push<00:02:55.620> with<00:02:55.769> level<00:02:56.040> twos<00:02:56.190> or<00:02:56.340> threes<00:02:56.400> you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
can't push with level twos or threes you

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.910 
can't push with level twos or threes you
actually<00:02:57.030> need<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.180> bow<00:02:57.390> level<00:02:57.750> sixes<00:02:58.230> because

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
actually need to bow level sixes because

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.380 
actually need to bow level sixes because
then<00:02:59.069> you<00:02:59.160> can<00:02:59.310> get<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.610> guild<00:02:59.819> reward<00:03:00.209> and

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
then you can get the guild reward and

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.890 
then you can get the guild reward and
push<00:03:00.599> your<00:03:00.750> guild<00:03:00.930> up<00:03:01.079> in<00:03:01.459> you<00:03:02.459> know<00:03:02.489> rank<00:03:02.970> so

think it's better than the plus version

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.770 
think it's better than the plus version
of<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.700> let's<00:03:47.700> combine<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.150> with<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.389> Kirin

some fusion boosts yeah cuz I'm really

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.060 
some fusion boosts yeah cuz I'm really
poor<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.270> can't<00:04:27.510> just<00:04:27.720> afford<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.290> do<00:04:28.950> all

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
I need these fusion boosts to enhance it

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.300 
I need these fusion boosts to enhance it
yeah<00:04:34.410> it's<00:04:34.560> getting<00:04:34.740> pretty<00:04:34.800> high<00:04:34.980> but<00:04:35.040> as<00:04:35.190> you
