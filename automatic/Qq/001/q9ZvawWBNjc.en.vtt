00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
chopped version of it that worked really

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.130 
chopped version of it that worked really
well<00:00:59.550> but<00:01:00.000> still<00:01:00.239> allowed<00:01:00.570> quite<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> bit<00:01:01.020> of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
well but still allowed quite a bit of

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.880 
well but still allowed quite a bit of
wind<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.680> noise<00:01:02.510> into<00:01:03.510> your<00:01:03.629> head<00:01:03.840> area<00:01:04.199> and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
over a long distance you know that gets

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.090 
over a long distance you know that gets
a<00:01:08.010> little<00:01:08.130> bit<00:01:08.280> tiring<00:01:09.049> so<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.080> did<00:01:10.770> take<00:01:10.950> this

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100

designing this one here so I was a
little<00:02:03.149> bit<00:02:03.299> kind<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:04.009> sweet<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.159> sour<00:02:05.579> bitter

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
little bit kind of sweet and sour bitter

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.760 
little bit kind of sweet and sour bitter
sweet<00:02:06.420> about<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.840> windshield<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.380> did<00:02:07.530> block

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
sweet about the windshield it did block

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.460 
sweet about the windshield it did block
a<00:02:07.799> lot<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.280> air<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.599> did<00:02:09.899> make<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.259> ride<00:02:10.440> a

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
a lot of air and it did make the ride a

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.620 
a lot of air and it did make the ride a
lot<00:02:10.940> quieter

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
lot quieter

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.480 
lot quieter
but<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.290> was<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.530> little<00:02:13.710> disappointed<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.310> I

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
but I was a little disappointed that I

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.070 
but I was a little disappointed that I
still<00:02:14.760> have<00:02:14.880> got<00:02:15.060> some<00:02:15.270> buffeting<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:15.870> what<00:02:16.050> I

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
still have got some buffeting but what I

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.900 
still have got some buffeting but what I
found<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:17.010> not<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.310> helmet<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.730> I

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
found is this is not the helmet that I

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.350 
found is this is not the helmet that I
was<00:02:18.150> wearing<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:18.660> is<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:19.460> icon<00:02:20.460> airframe<00:02:21.060> but

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
was wearing this is a icon airframe but

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.450 
was wearing this is a icon airframe but
it's<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.600> full<00:02:21.780> face<00:02:21.990> helmet<00:02:22.070> Rick<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.310> dirty

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
it's a full face helmet Rick is it dirty

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.120 
it's a full face helmet Rick is it dirty
look<00:02:23.760> at<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.910> bugs<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.380> did<00:02:25.380> find<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.800> if<00:02:26.010> I

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
look at the bugs I did find that if I

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.240 
look at the bugs I did find that if I
lifted<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.670> visor<00:02:26.880> up<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.420> little<00:02:27.690> bit<00:02:27.870> on<00:02:28.250> my

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
lifted the visor up a little bit on my

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.200 
lifted the visor up a little bit on my
HJ<00:02:29.760> see<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:30.390> Wow<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:32.130> lot<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:32.880> buffeting

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
HJ see that Wow a lot of the buffeting

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.420 
HJ see that Wow a lot of the buffeting
went<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:34.290> if<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.590> let's<00:02:34.890> rolled<00:02:35.220> with<00:02:35.400> the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
went and if I let's rolled with the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.090 
went and if I let's rolled with the
visor<00:02:35.670> totally<00:02:36.420> up<00:02:36.570> so<00:02:37.560> did<00:02:37.740> all<00:02:37.920> the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
visor totally up so did all the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.430 
visor totally up so did all the
buffeting<00:02:38.520> go<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:39.090> with<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.960> bike<00:02:40.200> like<00:02:40.410> this

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
buffeting go in with a bike like this

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.290 
buffeting go in with a bike like this
you<00:02:40.920> don't<00:02:41.100> really<00:02:41.220> need<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.610> have<00:02:41.940> your<00:02:42.090> visor

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
you don't really need to have your visor

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.550 
you don't really need to have your visor
down<00:02:42.660> because<00:02:43.080> this<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.320> gonna<00:02:43.500> block<00:02:43.740> most

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
down because this is gonna block most

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.020 
down because this is gonna block most
you<00:02:46.560> know<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.830> if<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.980> rock<00:02:47.220> flies<00:02:47.550> up<00:02:47.880> it

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
you know and if a rock flies up it

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.180 
you know and if a rock flies up it
blocks<00:02:48.240> all<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.480> wind<00:02:48.810> but<00:02:49.140> any<00:02:49.920> kind<00:02:50.070> of

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
blocks all the wind but any kind of

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.860 
blocks all the wind but any kind of
rocks<00:02:50.430> or<00:02:50.640> bugs<00:02:50.910> aren't<00:02:51.150> gonna<00:02:51.270> hit<00:02:51.450> your<00:02:51.630> face

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
rocks or bugs aren't gonna hit your face

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.140 
rocks or bugs aren't gonna hit your face
with<00:02:52.140> this<00:02:52.260> thing<00:02:52.530> in<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.770> way<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.700> ear

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
with this thing in the way and the ear

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.930 
with this thing in the way and the ear
does<00:02:54.420> deflect<00:02:54.840> over<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> thought<00:02:56.760> well

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
does deflect over so I thought well

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.350 
does deflect over so I thought well
that's<00:02:57.060> pretty<00:02:57.270> good<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.540> can<00:02:57.720> actually<00:02:57.930> ride

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
that's pretty good I can actually ride

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.700 
that's pretty good I can actually ride
with<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.390> so<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.780> wrote<00:03:00.960> most<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.380> day<00:03:01.560> with

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
with it so I wrote most of the day with

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.290 
with it so I wrote most of the day with
the<00:03:01.830> visor<00:03:01.980> like<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.760> was<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.880> warm<00:03:03.150> day

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
the visor like that it was a warm day

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.710 
the visor like that it was a warm day
anyway<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:05.340> occasionally<00:03:06.030> if<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.210> wanted<00:03:06.540> I

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
anyway and occasionally if I wanted I

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.830 
anyway and occasionally if I wanted I
lifted<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.350> right<00:03:07.590> up<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.940> there<00:03:09.540> was<00:03:09.690> no

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
lifted it right up and there was no

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.110 
lifted it right up and there was no
buffeting<00:03:10.410> pretty<00:03:11.370> much<00:03:11.520> at<00:03:11.670> all

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
buffeting pretty much at all

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.190 
buffeting pretty much at all
so<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:12.930> has<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.320> do<00:03:13.500> with<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.970> air<00:03:15.150> around<00:03:15.780> a

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
so it has to do with the air around a

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.230 
so it has to do with the air around a
full<00:03:16.770> face<00:03:16.980> helmet<00:03:17.370> like<00:03:17.490> this<00:03:17.520> I<00:03:17.820> think<00:03:18.060> then

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
full face helmet like this I think then

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.700 
full face helmet like this I think then
I<00:03:18.270> remember<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:18.930> know<00:03:19.050> what<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.440> have<00:03:19.770> a<00:03:19.800> cheapo

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
I remember you know what I have a cheapo

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.020 
I remember you know what I have a cheapo
open-face<00:03:22.710> helmet<00:03:22.740> here<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.580> I<00:03:23.610> bought<00:03:23.850> for

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
open-face helmet here that I bought for

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.050 
open-face helmet here that I bought for
my<00:03:24.180> wife<00:03:24.420> last<00:03:25.020> year<00:03:25.500> because<00:03:26.340> she<00:03:26.400> will<00:03:26.850> not

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
my wife last year because she will not

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.430 
my wife last year because she will not
wear<00:03:27.270> a<00:03:27.300> full-face<00:03:27.690> helmet<00:03:28.290> for

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
wear a full-face helmet for

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.040 
wear a full-face helmet for
claustrophobic<00:03:29.160> reasons<00:03:29.550> I<00:03:29.760> bought<00:03:30.600> this<00:03:30.810> one

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
claustrophobic reasons I bought this one

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.730 
claustrophobic reasons I bought this one
for<00:03:31.350> her<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.830> it's<00:03:32.100> a<00:03:32.250> real<00:03:32.460> GP<00:03:32.880> but<00:03:33.740> I've

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
for her and it's a real GP but I've

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.400 
for her and it's a real GP but I've
never<00:03:34.890> actually<00:03:35.420> she's<00:03:36.420> never<00:03:36.660> used<00:03:36.960> it<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.230> use

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
never actually she's never used it I use

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.840 
never actually she's never used it I use
it<00:03:37.440> on<00:03:37.620> my<00:03:37.680> sport<00:03:38.100> bike<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.460> I<00:03:38.490> didn't<00:03:38.700> like<00:03:38.820> it

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
it on my sport bike and I didn't like it

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.430 
it on my sport bike and I didn't like it
at<00:03:39.030> all<00:03:39.120> way<00:03:39.600> too<00:03:39.660> noisy

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
at all way too noisy

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.850 
at all way too noisy
not<00:03:41.040> very<00:03:41.190> aerodynamic<00:03:41.580> at<00:03:42.209> all<00:03:42.470> but<00:03:43.470> I

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
not very aerodynamic at all but I

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.699 
not very aerodynamic at all but I
thought<00:03:44.190> what<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.580> hell<00:03:44.790> I'll<00:03:45.780> try<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.350> with

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
thought what the hell I'll try it with

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.730 
thought what the hell I'll try it with
this<00:03:47.420> windshield<00:03:48.420> which<00:03:48.930> blocks<00:03:49.260> most<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.680> the

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
this windshield which blocks most of the

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.440 
this windshield which blocks most of the
win<00:03:49.920> anyway<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:51.330> I<00:03:51.480> think<00:03:53.120> polymer<00:03:54.120> nary

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
win anyway and I think polymer nary

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.720 
win anyway and I think polymer nary
results<00:03:54.900> are<00:03:55.050> really<00:03:55.410> good<00:03:55.650> I<00:03:55.950> mean<00:03:56.490> I<00:03:56.550> could

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
results are really good I mean I could

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.790 
results are really good I mean I could
even<00:03:56.820> ride<00:03:57.209> with<00:03:57.540> this<00:03:57.720> visor<00:03:57.959> straight<00:03:58.500> up<00:03:58.650> I

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
even ride with this visor straight up I

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.430 
even ride with this visor straight up I
took<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:59.100> right<00:03:59.220> off<00:03:59.480> for<00:04:00.480> one<00:04:00.630> short<00:04:00.959> ride<00:04:01.200> but

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
took it right off for one short ride but

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.310 
took it right off for one short ride but
I'll<00:04:01.560> leave<00:04:01.709> it<00:04:01.860> on<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:03.230> there's<00:04:04.230> no

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
I'll leave it on and there's no

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
I'll leave it on and there's no
buffeting<00:04:05.420> with<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.570> windscreen<00:04:07.200> that's<00:04:07.530> in

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
buffeting with the windscreen that's in

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.420 
buffeting with the windscreen that's in
position<00:04:08.910> there<00:04:09.270> with<00:04:10.140> this<00:04:10.380> helmet<00:04:10.830> so<00:04:11.400> I

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
position there with this helmet so I

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.100 
position there with this helmet so I
think<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:11.940> main<00:04:12.120> thing<00:04:12.360> with<00:04:12.510> this<00:04:12.630> buffeting

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
think the main thing with this buffeting

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.960 
think the main thing with this buffeting
situation<00:04:13.709> is<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:14.070> type<00:04:14.280> of<00:04:14.430> helmet<00:04:14.670> you're

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
situation is the type of helmet you're

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.190 
situation is the type of helmet you're
using<00:04:17.270> so<00:04:18.270> this<00:04:18.480> is<00:04:18.660> what<00:04:18.870> I'm<00:04:18.959> gonna<00:04:19.109> be

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
using so this is what I'm gonna be

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.320 
using so this is what I'm gonna be
wearing<00:04:19.799> when<00:04:19.980> I<00:04:20.040> ride<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.520> v-strom<00:04:20.850> now<00:04:21.120> with

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
wearing when I ride the v-strom now with

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.020 
wearing when I ride the v-strom now with
this<00:04:21.479> windscreen<00:04:22.169> is<00:04:23.130> this<00:04:23.430> open-faced

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
this windscreen is this open-faced

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.490 
this windscreen is this open-faced
helmet<00:04:24.060> it's<00:04:24.540> a<00:04:24.600> little<00:04:24.810> cooler<00:04:24.990> for<00:04:25.290> summer

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
helmet it's a little cooler for summer

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.540 
helmet it's a little cooler for summer
too

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550

and you don't seem to get the kind of

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.240 
and you don't seem to get the kind of
buffeting<00:04:30.750> you<00:04:30.840> get<00:04:31.050> with<00:04:31.169> a<00:04:31.199> full<00:04:31.530> I<00:04:31.919> mean<00:04:32.190> you

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
buffeting you get with a full I mean you

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.710 
buffeting you get with a full I mean you
don't<00:04:32.340> need<00:04:32.520> a<00:04:32.550> helmet<00:04:32.699> like<00:04:32.910> this<00:04:33.060> on<00:04:33.479> a<00:04:33.509> bike

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.330 
don't need a helmet like this on a bike
like<00:04:33.750> this<00:04:34.190> with<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.690> kind<00:04:36.690> of<00:04:36.960> wind<00:04:37.740> blockage

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
like this with the kind of wind blockage

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.339 
like this with the kind of wind blockage
and<00:04:38.610> debris<00:04:39.000> blockage<00:04:39.449> that<00:04:39.479> that<00:04:40.020> windshield

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
and debris blockage that that windshield

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:43.010 
and debris blockage that that windshield
provides<00:04:40.800> it's<00:04:41.340> just<00:04:41.490> not<00:04:41.639> necessary<00:04:42.240> unless

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
provides it's just not necessary unless

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.540 
provides it's just not necessary unless
you're<00:04:43.229> concerned<00:04:43.560> about<00:04:43.680> a<00:04:43.830> crash<00:04:44.129> you<00:04:44.310> want

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
I ride this bike I mean I think that's

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.610

gonna<00:04:49.770> happen

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
gonna happen

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.260 
gonna happen
so<00:04:52.620> yeah<00:04:52.830> this<00:04:53.069> is<00:04:53.129> the<00:04:53.370> helmet<00:04:53.580> I'm<00:04:53.940> going<00:04:54.210> to

so yeah this is the helmet I'm going to

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.189 
so yeah this is the helmet I'm going to
be<00:04:54.360> using<00:04:54.810> with<00:04:56.210> with<00:04:57.210> this<00:04:57.449> bike<00:04:57.810> here<00:04:58.169> and

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
be using with with this bike here and

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.480 
be using with with this bike here and
the<00:04:58.470> nice<00:04:58.620> thing<00:04:58.770> about<00:04:58.800> this<00:04:59.069> I<00:04:59.220> don't<00:04:59.340> take

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
the nice thing about this I don't take

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.029 
the nice thing about this I don't take
my<00:04:59.610> glasses<00:04:59.849> off<00:05:00.210> to<00:05:00.539> put<00:05:01.169> it<00:05:01.259> on<00:05:01.409> and<00:05:01.620> off<00:05:01.710> and

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
my glasses off to put it on and off and

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:03.170 
my glasses off to put it on and off and
I<00:05:02.130> don't<00:05:02.190> have<00:05:02.370> to<00:05:02.460> take<00:05:02.580> it<00:05:02.699> off<00:05:02.819> to<00:05:02.970> take<00:05:03.120> a

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
I don't have to take it off to take a

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.230 
I don't have to take it off to take a
drink<00:05:03.389> or<00:05:03.990> it's<00:05:04.949> a<00:05:05.009> little<00:05:05.220> cooler<00:05:05.460> it's<00:05:06.120> a

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
drink or it's a little cooler it's a

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.550 
drink or it's a little cooler it's a
little<00:05:06.449> weird<00:05:06.900> because<00:05:07.169> it's<00:05:07.349> kind<00:05:07.530> of

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
little weird because it's kind of

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.580 
little weird because it's kind of
top-heavy<00:05:08.270> but<00:05:09.270> that<00:05:09.870> seems<00:05:10.110> to<00:05:10.199> solve<00:05:10.470> the

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
top-heavy but that seems to solve the

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.969 
top-heavy but that seems to solve the
problem<00:05:11.069> with<00:05:11.250> this<00:05:11.430> bike<00:05:11.759> here<00:05:12.830> the<00:05:13.830> only

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
problem with this bike here the only

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.379 
problem with this bike here the only
other<00:05:14.220> thing<00:05:14.460> in<00:05:14.580> maybe<00:05:14.759> I<00:05:14.909> don't<00:05:14.970> like<00:05:15.240> about

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
other thing in maybe I don't like about

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.540 
other thing in maybe I don't like about
this<00:05:15.659> bike<00:05:16.020> this<00:05:16.409> windshield<00:05:17.039> it<00:05:17.190> makes<00:05:17.400> the

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
this bike this windshield it makes the

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.209 
this bike this windshield it makes the
bike<00:05:17.699> a<00:05:17.729> really<00:05:18.150> old<00:05:18.389> man's<00:05:18.659> bike<00:05:18.990> but<00:05:19.860> I<00:05:19.889> guess

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:20.219 
bike a really old man's bike but I guess

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.469 
bike a really old man's bike but I guess
considering<00:05:20.610> I'm<00:05:20.789> an<00:05:20.909> old<00:05:21.060> man<00:05:21.180> that's

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
considering I'm an old man that's

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.469 
considering I'm an old man that's
appropriate<00:05:22.169> it<00:05:22.979> takes<00:05:23.310> out<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.550> real<00:05:23.849> when<00:05:24.449> I

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
appropriate it takes out the real when I

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.350 
appropriate it takes out the real when I
had<00:05:24.659> that<00:05:24.690> little<00:05:25.050> stubby<00:05:25.409> windscreen<00:05:26.360> maybe

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
had that little stubby windscreen maybe

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.180 
had that little stubby windscreen maybe
all<00:05:27.569> psychological<00:05:28.080> but<00:05:28.620> it<00:05:28.800> was<00:05:28.949> like<00:05:29.159> a

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
all psychological but it was like a

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.089 
all psychological but it was like a
sporty-er<00:05:29.879> bike<00:05:30.210> the<00:05:31.169> other<00:05:31.319> thing<00:05:31.650> I<00:05:31.949> did

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
sporty-er bike the other thing I did

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.140 
sporty-er bike the other thing I did
only<00:05:32.520> do<00:05:32.699> one<00:05:33.030> mileage<00:05:33.960> test<00:05:34.319> I<00:05:34.710> did<00:05:35.669> get<00:05:35.880> less

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
only do one mileage test I did get less

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.200 
only do one mileage test I did get less
mileage<00:05:36.539> with<00:05:36.930> this<00:05:37.139> windscreen<00:05:37.530> it's

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
mileage with this windscreen it's

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.399 
mileage with this windscreen it's
probably<00:05:39.210> because<00:05:39.539> the<00:05:39.690> amount<00:05:39.930> of<00:05:40.080> wind

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
probably because the amount of wind

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.120 
probably because the amount of wind
resistance<00:05:41.840> the<00:05:42.840> previous<00:05:43.349> mileage<00:05:43.800> test<00:05:44.039> I

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
resistance the previous mileage test I

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.370 
resistance the previous mileage test I
did<00:05:44.310> on<00:05:44.460> this<00:05:44.580> one<00:05:44.789> on<00:05:44.909> the<00:05:45.029> highway<00:05:45.419> was<00:05:45.599> after

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
did on this one on the highway was after

00:06:58.369 --> 00:06:58.379 
screen now I still haven't fooled around

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:00.290 
screen now I still haven't fooled around
with<00:06:58.680> all<00:06:58.979> the<00:06:59.189> settings<00:06:59.610> on<00:06:59.759> it<00:06:59.879> as<00:07:00.029> far<00:07:00.240> as

think that's the way to go
just<00:07:06.539> get<00:07:06.749> an<00:07:06.870> open-face<00:07:07.439> helmet<00:07:07.909> with<00:07:08.909> a

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:08.939 
just get an open-face helmet with a

just get an open-face helmet with a
visor<00:07:09.059> like<00:07:09.569> this<00:07:09.809> and<00:07:10.139> that's<00:07:11.039> all<00:07:11.249> you
