we have Cyclops aside and Wolverine side

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.590 
we have Cyclops aside and Wolverine side
maybe<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.009> future<00:01:53.130> there's<00:01:53.549> horns<00:01:54.299> side

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
maybe in the future there's horns side

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.590 
maybe in the future there's horns side
and<00:01:55.219> this<00:01:56.219> new<00:01:56.430> team<00:01:56.700> why<00:01:57.270> don't<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:57.450> take<00:01:57.540> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
and this new team why don't we take a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.749 
and this new team why don't we take a
look<00:01:57.810> at<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.079> new<00:01:58.229> team<00:01:58.409> burst<00:01:58.770> immediately

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
look at this new team burst immediately

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.039 
look at this new team burst immediately
some<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.119> people<00:02:00.329> who<00:02:00.420> stand<00:02:00.630> out<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.020> me

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
some of the people who stand out to me

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.620 
some of the people who stand out to me
are<00:02:01.320> Colossus<00:02:02.040> obviously<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.479> actually

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
are Colossus obviously and it actually

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.090 
are Colossus obviously and it actually
looks<00:02:03.899> like<00:02:04.049> he<00:02:04.290> has<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> soultaker<00:02:04.920> sword

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
looks like he has the soultaker sword

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.359 
looks like he has the soultaker sword
which<00:02:05.729> magic<00:02:06.659> normally<00:02:07.110> wields<00:02:07.560> quentin

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
which magic normally wields quentin

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.160 
which magic normally wields quentin
choir<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.789> clearly<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.360> Phoenix<00:02:09.750> as<00:02:09.929> well

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
choir is clearly the Phoenix as well

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.690 
choir is clearly the Phoenix as well
it'll<00:02:10.679> be<00:02:10.830> interesting<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.310> see<00:02:11.400> how<00:02:11.640> that

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
it'll be interesting to see how that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.630 
it'll be interesting to see how that
came<00:02:12.030> about

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
came about

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.490 
came about
since<00:02:13.060> Jean<00:02:13.569> Grey<00:02:13.810> would<00:02:13.960> be<00:02:14.080> in<00:02:14.140> this<00:02:14.230> future

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
since Jean Grey would be in this future

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.290 
since Jean Grey would be in this future
as<00:02:14.680> well<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.130> this<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.400> Phoenix<00:02:15.670> not<00:02:15.850> true<00:02:16.090> sir

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
as well so this the Phoenix not true sir

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.449 
as well so this the Phoenix not true sir
in<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.540> future<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:17.020> would<00:02:17.800> also<00:02:17.920> be<00:02:18.160> pretty

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
in the future I would also be pretty

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.750 
in the future I would also be pretty
confident<00:02:19.030> guessing<00:02:19.630> that<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.530> ice<00:02:20.890> mage<00:02:21.310> is

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
confident guessing that the ice mage is

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.790 
confident guessing that the ice mage is
Bobby<00:02:22.209> Drake<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.230> think<00:02:23.440> it'd<00:02:23.500> be<00:02:23.530> kind<00:02:23.740> of

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
Bobby Drake and I think it'd be kind of

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.800 
Bobby Drake and I think it'd be kind of
cool<00:02:23.860> if<00:02:24.220> maybe<00:02:24.520> in<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:24.940> future<00:02:25.240> he<00:02:25.450> split

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
cool if maybe in the future he split

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.410 
cool if maybe in the future he split
into<00:02:25.959> two<00:02:26.290> different<00:02:26.620> beings<00:02:27.250> because<00:02:28.150> the

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
into two different beings because the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.690 
into two different beings because the
Iceman<00:02:28.870> we<00:02:29.050> saw<00:02:29.320> who<00:02:29.980> went<00:02:30.220> back<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.610> the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
Iceman we saw who went back to the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.280 
Iceman we saw who went back to the
present<00:02:31.209> was<00:02:31.540> almost<00:02:31.810> like<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:31.959> mindless

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
present was almost like a mindless

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.460 
present was almost like a mindless
hulking<00:02:32.800> beast<00:02:33.160> whereas<00:02:34.120> maybe<00:02:34.470> the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
hulking beast whereas maybe the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.530 
hulking beast whereas maybe the
intelligent<00:02:36.070> side<00:02:36.250> of<00:02:36.400> Bobby<00:02:36.610> is<00:02:36.970> in<00:02:37.150> this<00:02:37.300> ice

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
intelligent side of Bobby is in this ice

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.050 
intelligent side of Bobby is in this ice
mage<00:02:38.010> but<00:02:39.010> some<00:02:39.190> of<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.340> other<00:02:39.489> characters

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
mage but some of the other characters

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.770 
mage but some of the other characters
are<00:02:40.360> obviously<00:02:40.959> we<00:02:41.440> see<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.650> sorcerer<00:02:42.130> supreme

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
are obviously we see a sorcerer supreme

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.720 
are obviously we see a sorcerer supreme
it's<00:02:43.780> hard<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:44.050> tell<00:02:44.170> exactly<00:02:44.230> who<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.100> it

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
it's hard to tell exactly who it is it

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.160 
it's hard to tell exactly who it is it
looks<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.030> little<00:02:46.090> too<00:02:46.390> young<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.780> be<00:02:46.810> Stephen

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
looks a little too young to be Stephen

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.770 
looks a little too young to be Stephen
strange<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:47.830> maybe<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.160> isn't<00:02:48.459> him<00:02:48.730> we<00:02:49.630> also

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
strange so maybe it isn't him we also

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.390 
strange so maybe it isn't him we also

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
wild guess that could be completely

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.640 
wild guess that could be completely
wrong<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.540> say<00:03:13.660> maybe<00:03:13.870> it's<00:03:14.080> like<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.350> child

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
wrong and say maybe it's like the child

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.310 
wrong and say maybe it's like the child

the ends Psylocke and Wolverine kind of
look<00:03:29.890> across<00:03:30.130> at<00:03:30.459> each<00:03:30.579> other<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.060> I<00:03:31.660> thought

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
look across at each other and I thought

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.690 
look across at each other and I thought
that<00:03:31.989> was<00:03:32.110> kind<00:03:32.350> of<00:03:32.380> strange<00:03:32.650> so<00:03:33.040> maybe<00:03:33.579> it

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
that was kind of strange so maybe it

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.300 
that was kind of strange so maybe it
could<00:03:33.850> be<00:03:33.940> telling<00:03:34.120> maybe<00:03:34.480> not<00:03:34.980> we<00:03:35.980> also<00:03:36.130> see

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
could be telling maybe not we also see

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.610 
could be telling maybe not we also see
this<00:03:36.459> girl<00:03:36.730> riding<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.180> panther<00:03:37.750> I'm<00:03:38.470> gonna

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
this girl riding a panther I'm gonna

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.020 
this girl riding a panther I'm gonna
take<00:03:38.739> another<00:03:38.950> wild<00:03:39.280> guess<00:03:39.489> here<00:03:39.519> and<00:03:39.880> say

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
take another wild guess here and say

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.880 
take another wild guess here and say
this<00:03:40.239> is<00:03:40.560> storm<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:41.950> Black<00:03:42.790> Panthers<00:03:43.329> child

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
this is storm and Black Panthers child

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.009 
this is storm and Black Panthers child
maybe<00:03:44.890> she<00:03:45.130> kind<00:03:45.340> of<00:03:45.430> got<00:03:45.610> you<00:03:46.239> know<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.510> x-men

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
maybe she kind of got you know the x-men

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.650 
maybe she kind of got you know the x-men
and<00:03:47.440> whether<00:03:47.950> powers<00:03:48.370> from<00:03:48.459> storm<00:03:48.910> but<00:03:49.510> also

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
and whether powers from storm but also

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.600 
and whether powers from storm but also
has<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:49.840> keep<00:03:50.110> her<00:03:50.350> Wakanda<00:03:50.980> in<00:03:51.040> roots<00:03:51.310> so

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
has to keep her Wakanda in roots so

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.330 
has to keep her Wakanda in roots so
she's<00:03:51.790> got<00:03:51.970> like<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.150> tiger<00:03:52.600> to<00:03:53.410> aid<00:03:53.980> her<00:03:54.310> I

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
she's got like a tiger to aid her I

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.610 
she's got like a tiger to aid her I
guess<00:03:54.810> really<00:03:55.810> at<00:03:55.870> this<00:03:55.989> point<00:03:56.230> it's<00:03:56.350> all<00:03:56.440> just

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
guess really at this point it's all just

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.069 
guess really at this point it's all just
speculation<00:03:56.920> as<00:03:57.549> to<00:03:57.579> who<00:03:57.790> these<00:03:58.060> future<00:03:58.630> x-men

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
speculation as to who these future x-men

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.710 
speculation as to who these future x-men
are<00:03:59.200> but<00:03:59.950> since<00:04:00.340> we<00:04:00.459> know<00:04:00.670> they<00:04:00.850> exist<00:04:00.970> does

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
are but since we know they exist does

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.240 
are but since we know they exist does
that<00:04:01.870> mean<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.230> future<00:04:02.380> x-men<00:04:02.920> in<00:04:03.100> our

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
that mean the future x-men in our

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.900 
that mean the future x-men in our
present<00:04:03.790> are<00:04:03.880> actually<00:04:04.840> evil<00:04:05.549> I'm<00:04:06.549> actually

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
present are actually evil I'm actually

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.580 
present are actually evil I'm actually
starting<00:04:07.239> to<00:04:07.360> think<00:04:07.510> they<00:04:07.840> are<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:08.230> actually

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
starting to think they are I actually

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.750 
starting to think they are I actually
kind<00:04:09.190> of<00:04:09.250> thought<00:04:09.400> there<00:04:09.519> was<00:04:09.609> something

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
kind of thought there was something

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.039 
kind of thought there was something
suspicious<00:04:10.120> about<00:04:10.420> them<00:04:10.720> right<00:04:10.900> from<00:04:10.959> the

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
suspicious about them right from the

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.680 
suspicious about them right from the
get-go<00:04:11.370> but<00:04:12.370> Deadpool<00:04:13.209> also<00:04:13.510> had<00:04:13.600> an

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
get-go but Deadpool also had an

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.479 
get-go but Deadpool also had an
interesting<00:04:14.049> line<00:04:14.500> in<00:04:14.709> this<00:04:14.829> issue<00:04:15.070> where<00:04:15.459> he

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
interesting line in this issue where he

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.060 
interesting line in this issue where he
says<00:04:15.970> everything<00:04:16.690> they've<00:04:16.840> said<00:04:17.079> is<00:04:17.200> a<00:04:17.229> lie<00:04:17.500> he

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
says everything they've said is a lie he

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.370 
says everything they've said is a lie he
mutters<00:04:18.370> that<00:04:18.489> under<00:04:18.729> his<00:04:18.789> breath<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.380> then

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
mutters that under his breath and then

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.570 
mutters that under his breath and then
the<00:04:21.220> young<00:04:21.400> gene<00:04:21.700> also<00:04:22.000> defeats<00:04:22.950> Zorn<00:04:23.950> gene

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
the young gene also defeats Zorn gene

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.290 
the young gene also defeats Zorn gene

of mystery left in battle the atom I do

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:34.980 
of mystery left in battle the atom I do

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
want to go for some other really cool

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.320 
want to go for some other really cool
moments<00:04:35.530> in<00:04:35.590> this<00:04:35.710> issue<00:04:35.889> though<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:37.090> first

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
moments in this issue though the first

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.670 
moments in this issue though the first
would<00:04:37.539> probably<00:04:37.810> have<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:37.960> be<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.169> telepathic

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
would probably have to be the telepathic

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.129 
would probably have to be the telepathic
fight<00:04:39.039> it<00:04:39.789> was<00:04:39.879> just<00:04:40.060> done<00:04:40.240> so<00:04:40.629> well<00:04:40.870> in<00:04:41.020> my

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
fight it was just done so well in my

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.990 
fight it was just done so well in my
opinion<00:04:41.229> I<00:04:41.650> really<00:04:41.889> like<00:04:41.979> how<00:04:42.099> it's<00:04:42.250> like<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.430> 5v

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
opinion I really like how it's like a 5v

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.270 
opinion I really like how it's like a 5v
one<00:04:43.330> this<00:04:43.870> one<00:04:44.110> just<00:04:44.259> slowly<00:04:44.590> took<00:04:44.860> them<00:04:45.039> down

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
one this one just slowly took them down

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.850 
one this one just slowly took them down
which<00:04:45.610> was<00:04:45.759> really<00:04:46.120> cool<00:04:46.479> and<00:04:47.379> obviously<00:04:47.530> they

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
which was really cool and obviously they

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.260 
which was really cool and obviously they
had<00:04:47.949> to<00:04:48.009> have<00:04:48.129> the<00:04:48.250> black<00:04:48.460> queen<00:04:48.759> white<00:04:49.030> queen

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
had to have the black queen white queen

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.850 
had to have the black queen white queen
motif<00:04:49.690> going<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:50.409> there's<00:04:50.530> just<00:04:50.740> some

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
motif going and there's just some

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.980 
motif going and there's just some
awesome<00:04:51.190> lines<00:04:51.370> between<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.849> two<00:04:52.060> she<00:04:52.720> just

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
awesome lines between the two she just

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.480 
awesome lines between the two she just
had<00:04:53.110> some<00:04:53.259> really<00:04:53.500> great<00:04:53.710> trash<00:04:54.129> talk

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
had some really great trash talk

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.309 
had some really great trash talk
bringing<00:04:55.270> up<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.479> fact<00:04:55.659> that<00:04:55.780> Scott<00:04:56.169> will

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319 
bringing up the fact that Scott will

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.439 
bringing up the fact that Scott will
never<00:04:56.530> be<00:04:56.710> hers<00:04:57.220> as<00:04:57.490> long<00:04:57.669> as<00:04:57.879> there's<00:04:58.150> a<00:04:58.240> gene

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
never be hers as long as there's a gene

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.809 
never be hers as long as there's a gene
around<00:04:58.750> and<00:04:59.110> she<00:04:59.740> also<00:04:59.860> goes<00:05:00.280> a<00:05:00.310> step<00:05:00.430> further

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:00.819 
around and she also goes a step further

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.119 
around and she also goes a step further
and<00:05:01.000> says<00:05:01.389> white<00:05:02.259> Queens<00:05:02.590> don't<00:05:02.889> age

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:03.129 
and says white Queens don't age

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:05.159 
and says white Queens don't age
gracefully<00:05:03.520> which<00:05:04.180> I<00:05:04.479> could<00:05:04.659> just<00:05:04.840> imagine

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
gracefully which I could just imagine

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.969 
gracefully which I could just imagine
what<00:05:05.620> completely<00:05:06.310> upset<00:05:06.879> Emma<00:05:07.569> Frost<00:05:07.979> another

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
what completely upset Emma Frost another

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.010
