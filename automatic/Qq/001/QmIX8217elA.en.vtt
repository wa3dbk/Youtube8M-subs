00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.690 
the Giants are involved because we think
it's<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.530> great<00:04:32.740> program<00:04:32.920> and<00:04:33.160> it's<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.490> great

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
it's a great program and it's a great

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.950 
it's a great program and it's a great
idea<00:04:33.760> that<00:04:34.180> they've<00:04:34.300> been<00:04:34.330> doing<00:04:34.630> in<00:04:34.750> canada

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
idea that they've been doing in canada

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.200 
idea that they've been doing in canada
for<00:04:35.380> years<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:35.920> we<00:04:36.520> wanted<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:36.820> bring<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.120> to

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
for years and we wanted to bring it to

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.410 
for years and we wanted to bring it to
belfast<00:04:37.630> so<00:04:38.310> norm<00:04:39.310> Flynn<00:04:39.670> and<00:04:39.850> Louise<00:04:40.090> little

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
belfast so norm Flynn and Louise little

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.820 
belfast so norm Flynn and Louise little
of<00:04:40.480> me<00:04:40.600> got<00:04:40.780> together<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.290> we<00:04:41.380> figured<00:04:41.680> that

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
of me got together and we figured that

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.860 
of me got together and we figured that
we<00:04:42.460> wanted<00:04:42.730> to<00:04:42.820> run<00:04:43.000> this<00:04:43.090> as<00:04:43.270> a<00:04:43.300> program<00:04:43.720> so

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
we wanted to run this as a program so

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.600 
we wanted to run this as a program so
that's<00:04:44.020> how<00:04:44.140> we<00:04:44.170> got<00:04:44.350> involved<00:04:44.620> I<00:04:44.920> think<00:04:45.520> the

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
that's how we got involved I think the

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.940 
that's how we got involved I think the
value<00:04:45.910> of<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.030> program<00:04:46.390> is<00:04:46.620> it's<00:04:47.620> probably

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
value of the program is it's probably

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.580 
value of the program is it's probably
for<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.280> kids<00:04:48.490> for<00:04:49.300> us<00:04:49.390> it's<00:04:49.630> we<00:04:50.020> just<00:04:50.200> want<00:04:50.440> we

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
for the kids for us it's we just want we

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.960 
for the kids for us it's we just want we
