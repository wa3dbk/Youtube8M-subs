00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.959 
could show you our feature trees while
they<00:00:11.639> were<00:00:11.700> flowering<00:00:12.799> so<00:00:13.799> here<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.430> am<00:00:14.549> at<00:00:14.910> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
them and the pollen that's on the flower

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.530

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the stigma of the other flower and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.560 
the stigma of the other flower and
pollinate<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.030> will<00:01:18.150> turn<00:01:18.300> into<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
pollinate it so it will turn into a

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.150 
pollinate it so it will turn into a
fruit<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.410> the<00:01:19.560> bird<00:01:19.710> moves<00:01:19.920> around

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
fruit so as the bird moves around

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.220 
fruit so as the bird moves around
between<00:01:20.430> flower<00:01:20.910> to<00:01:21.060> flower<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.930> will<00:01:21.990> just

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
between flower to flower it will just

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.890 
between flower to flower it will just
spread<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.560> pollen<00:01:23.040> around<00:01:23.370> to<00:01:24.270> all<00:01:24.690> of<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
spread that pollen around to all of the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.620 
spread that pollen around to all of the
flowers<00:01:25.290> making<00:01:25.710> them<00:01:25.950> under<00:01:26.160> fruit<00:01:26.630> although

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
flowers making them under fruit although

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.570 
flowers making them under fruit although
birds<00:01:27.990> aren't<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.470> primary<00:01:28.950> pollinator

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
birds aren't in the primary pollinator

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.390 
birds aren't in the primary pollinator
of<00:01:29.670> female<00:01:30.600> flowers<00:01:30.990> insects<00:01:31.770> also<00:01:32.100> play<00:01:32.370> a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
of female flowers insects also play a

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.120 
of female flowers insects also play a
huge<00:01:32.760> part<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.470> but<00:01:34.470> yeah<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:34.740> quite<00:01:34.950> cool

but just to remind me I'm going to give
it<00:01:52.440> another<00:01:52.650> try<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.250> let<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.000> know<00:01:54.180> what<00:01:54.360> I

think so I might just grab this little

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.240 
think so I might just grab this little
pillow<00:02:00.270> here<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:02.750> that's<00:02:03.750> what<00:02:03.900> I<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:04.250> and

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
pillow here so that's what I have and

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.390 
pillow here so that's what I have and
I'm<00:02:05.460> gonna<00:02:05.640> give<00:02:05.790> there<00:02:05.970> try

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.400 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.520 

let<00:02:10.400> me<00:02:10.490> just<00:02:10.640> take<00:02:10.820> another<00:02:11.060> one<00:02:11.240> here<00:02:14.530> when

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
let me just take another one here when

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.110 
let me just take another one here when
you<00:02:15.650> do<00:02:15.800> bite<00:02:15.980> into<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.490> can<00:02:16.700> taste<00:02:16.970> it

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
you do bite into it you can taste it

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.300 
you do bite into it you can taste it
it's<00:02:17.300> quite<00:02:17.570> fleshy<00:02:18.230> it's<00:02:18.680> like<00:02:19.070> how<00:02:19.280> you

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
it's quite fleshy it's like how you

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.700 
it's quite fleshy it's like how you
would<00:02:19.520> imagine<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.970> taste<00:02:20.270> of<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.990> flowers

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
would imagine the taste of of flowers

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.980 
would imagine the taste of of flowers
like<00:02:22.370> eating<00:02:22.730> perfume<00:02:23.240> or<00:02:23.360> something<00:02:23.390> I<00:02:23.810> don't

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
like eating perfume or something I don't

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.210 
like eating perfume or something I don't
know

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
know

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.640 
know
it<00:02:25.940> certainly<00:02:26.270> doesn't<00:02:26.570> taste<00:02:26.900> much<00:02:27.590> like

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
it certainly doesn't taste much like

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.430 
it certainly doesn't taste much like
features<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.730> guess<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.690> could<00:02:29.930> say<00:02:30.110> there<00:02:30.320> is

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
features I guess you could say there is

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.120 
features I guess you could say there is
a<00:02:30.470> hint<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:31.250> taste<00:02:31.550> of<00:02:31.670> feature<00:02:32.060> maybe<00:02:33.130> right

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
a hint of a taste of feature maybe right

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.330 
a hint of a taste of feature maybe right
as<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.460> first<00:02:34.700> bite<00:02:34.940> into<00:02:34.970> it<00:02:35.860> but<00:02:36.860> no<00:02:37.130> it's

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
as you first bite into it but no it's

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.250 
as you first bite into it but no it's
not<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.520> good<00:02:37.700> representation<00:02:38.140> if<00:02:39.140> you've

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
not a good representation if you've

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.900 
not a good representation if you've
never<00:02:39.440> tasted<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.860> feature<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.520> taste<00:02:40.730> a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
never tasted a feature and you taste a

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.350 
never tasted a feature and you taste a
feature<00:02:41.270> flower<00:02:41.600> petal<00:02:42.940> it's<00:02:43.940> not<00:02:44.150> really

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
feature flower petal it's not really

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.130 
feature flower petal it's not really
gonna<00:02:44.590> give<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.800> any<00:02:46.570> idea<00:02:47.570> on<00:02:47.630> what<00:02:47.750> a<00:02:47.930> feed

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
gonna give you any idea on what a feed

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.070 
gonna give you any idea on what a feed
UI<00:02:48.290> tastes<00:02:48.560> like<00:02:49.150> but<00:02:50.150> anyway<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.690> guess<00:02:50.960> you

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
UI tastes like but anyway I guess you

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.320 
UI tastes like but anyway I guess you
could<00:02:51.320> take<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.590> couple<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.670> petals<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.150> throw

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
could take a couple of petals and throw

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.540 
could take a couple of petals and throw
it<00:02:53.420> through<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.600> salad<00:02:54.020> but<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.260> mean<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.740> don't

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
it through a salad but I mean I don't

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.870 
it through a salad but I mean I don't
think<00:02:55.730> it's<00:02:55.970> worth<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.390> be<00:02:56.570> honest

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
think it's worth it to be honest

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.880 
think it's worth it to be honest
anyways<00:02:58.880> yeah<00:02:59.780> that's<00:03:00.020> that's<00:03:00.410> what<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.710> looks

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
anyways yeah that's that's what it looks

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.000 
anyways yeah that's that's what it looks
like<00:03:01.070> it's<00:03:01.370> pretty<00:03:01.610> cool<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:03.470> this<00:03:03.650> flower<00:03:03.890> you

like it's pretty cool so this flower you

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.100 
like it's pretty cool so this flower you
can<00:03:04.160> see<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.940> pedal<00:03:05.360> on<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.600> side<00:03:05.810> there<00:03:06.020> has

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
can see the pedal on the side there has

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.040 
can see the pedal on the side there has
been<00:03:06.320> eaten<00:03:06.890> by<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:07.070> bird<00:03:07.660> so<00:03:08.660> yeah<00:03:08.840> they<00:03:08.990> do

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
been eaten by a bird so yeah they do

been eaten by a bird so yeah they do
come<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.470> land<00:03:09.680> on<00:03:09.830> it<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.220> pick<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:11.080> the

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
come and land on it and pick the the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.410 
come and land on it and pick the the
tips<00:03:12.320> of<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.830> pedals<00:03:13.190> off<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:13.670> right<00:03:14.239> there

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
tips of the pedals off and right there

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.440 
tips of the pedals off and right there
as<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:14.630> can<00:03:14.720> see<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:16.040> one<00:03:16.250> has<00:03:16.550> been<00:03:16.850> munched

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
as you can see that one has been munched

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.140 
as you can see that one has been munched
and<00:03:18.050> once<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.650> flower<00:03:18.890> is<00:03:19.070> pollinated<00:03:19.280> then

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
and once the flower is pollinated then

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.140 
and once the flower is pollinated then
they<00:03:20.450> will<00:03:20.600> drop<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:21.110> petals<00:03:21.500> drop<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:22.160> all

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
they will drop the petals drop the all

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.240 
they will drop the petals drop the all
the<00:03:23.360> parts<00:03:23.660> of<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.900> flower<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.440> stigma<00:03:25.220> and

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
the parts of the flower the stigma and

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.050 
the parts of the flower the stigma and
the<00:03:25.459> stamens<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:27.040> at<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:28.250> base<00:03:28.400> there<00:03:28.790> the

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
the stamens and at the base there the

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.380 
the stamens and at the base there the
swollen<00:03:29.330> stem<00:03:29.840> is<00:03:30.110> what<00:03:30.440> becomes<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.390> feature

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
swollen stem is what becomes the feature

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.710 
swollen stem is what becomes the feature
root<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.590> this<00:03:34.010> part<00:03:34.340> just<00:03:34.489> here<00:03:34.820> at<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.540> base

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
root so this part just here at the base

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.400 
root so this part just here at the base
of<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.020> flower

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
of the flower

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.130 
of the flower
there's<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.400> ovary<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:38.420> flower<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:39.050> that

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
there's the ovary of the flower and that

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.820 
there's the ovary of the flower and that
is<00:03:39.290> what<00:03:39.470> will<00:03:39.620> expand<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:40.850> become<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:41.390> feature

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
is what will expand and become a feature

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.470 
is what will expand and become a feature
so<00:03:42.830> we've<00:03:43.130> got<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.340> lot<00:03:43.640> of<00:03:43.670> these<00:03:43.880> on<00:03:44.090> here<00:03:44.330> as

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
so we've got a lot of these on here as

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.970 
so we've got a lot of these on here as
usual<00:03:44.750> so<00:03:45.230> it<00:03:45.320> looks<00:03:45.470> like<00:03:45.560> we're<00:03:45.769> gonna<00:03:45.890> have

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
usual so it looks like we're gonna have

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.670 
usual so it looks like we're gonna have
a<00:03:46.340> bumper<00:03:47.180> crop<00:03:47.330> of<00:03:47.630> features<00:03:48.140> next<00:03:48.500> year

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
a bumper crop of features next year

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.250 
a bumper crop of features next year
which<00:03:48.830> I<00:03:48.950> can't<00:03:49.160> wait<00:03:49.340> for<00:03:49.840> over<00:03:50.840> here<00:03:50.989> in<00:03:51.110> New

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
which I can't wait for over here in New

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.790 
which I can't wait for over here in New

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
Zealand these feature trees fruit from
