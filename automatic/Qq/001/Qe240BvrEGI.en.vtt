00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.120
 Hello saunas today's video I 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:09.269
 they want to tell you about electric drive 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:14.429
 on usual 4 cassette 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:19.429
 honey extractor so I have the usual food hill 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:22.740
 it was grandfather's still old 4 cassette 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:27.480
 Here coup GOVERNMENTAL cassettes that's it 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:30.300
 all 4 tape is written here so they did 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.520
 such an electric drive to say here 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:39.150
 stood so instant yet old pen 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:43.110
 gearbox that unscrew before 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:49.260
 twisted rocked all the principle like but 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:51.750
 Now that the age of electronics for slaughter 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.080
 to upgrade now I have this 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.960
 option that is it could be a block 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.400
 control and drive unit here i have 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:08.430
 there is a scheme here control remote stands and 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:09.320
 here its general here instead of regular 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.480
 gearbox 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.950
 it is normal for both but two 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.140
 bearings to 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.120
 credit and fight two bearings are put 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.640
 so that there is no swing 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:30.990
 You see how she sits rigidly regular skiff 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.050
 I took the washing machines with squirrels with 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.570
 protein machine targets are also called possible 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:42.150
 use the skiff with the car Lada 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:46.200
 scamp and there the same diameter of the creek goes 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.290
 and the same diameter is about 15 it's 14 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.310
 centimeters also on the little engine I pulled 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.090
 Scythian diameter of 4 centimeters is the same 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.600
 it is better 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.040
 here it is a metal ski 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.890
 so small will be small 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.660
 I took the electric motor from an ordinary car 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.990
 audi 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:14.310
 he stands the usual fan on the radiator 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:19.090
 cooling, that is, we are bones 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:22.360
 saudi with ordinary machines here have such 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.880
 three mounting here such a view myself 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.900
 engine 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:32.080
 approach can be bought at any store 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.710
 food on any disassembly that's cool with me 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.110
 the radiator is melting then there is a transistor 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.520
 common transistor soviet 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.510
 a transistor called kt 827 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:49.120
 which supports top about 20 amps 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.970
 there are also 5 transistors attached to it 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.000
 volt hard in the circuit which i 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.550
 I will give further for the video can be 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.080
 see can make a remote 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.770
 management is such a menu 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.660
 This start button, that is, you need to quickly 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.470
 catch up with me race push start and 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.050
 accelerates this we have tumbled which in 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.500
 one side I get a brake in 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.500
 this side 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.090
 it is our speed regulator here is 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.590
 ordinary resistor half kilo mind 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.590
 which governs our turnover 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.670
 engine 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.920
 Now I can show you the hour of this 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.520
 this control scheme here we turn on 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.850
 toggle the motor starts to turn 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.200
 vs 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.200
 and engine 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.450
 here it feeds 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.260
 this whole circuit from the usual machine 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.540
 Battery 50 m2 which he me 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.240
 worth my my car in general so 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.480
 Enough of this battery pumping 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.370
 about 27 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.810
 Well, of course if this music is more powerful 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:22.200
 you can pump and 45 engine 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.360
 absolutely not warm well that's not enough 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:29.840
 now let's see the truth is 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.840
 the scheme works tightly strap 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:40.260
 from wearing a strap 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:42.139
 all doctors and do we get push 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.580
 cats button 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.340
 snooping 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.190
 catching up 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.030
 his defense keeps believing us 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:55.590
 need a broker perfectly set 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.750
 go we have a neutral she you 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.400
 completely 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.340
 we like it picks up less 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.910
 rolled out enough power can be bypassing 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.040
 schemes all over just run a strong smell 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.880
 choose the necessary momentum and omit here 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:16.320
 on a by exhibited she kept the same 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:19.290
 neutral you also brake and we 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:23.430
 We look at the brake which is not to please and 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:28.500
 motor brake works so we know 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:30.330
 DC with magnets this 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.550
 the engine can also work 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.370
 distinguish themselves also produce them then 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.540
 there is like a generator so we just 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.890
 through the switch itself carotene 2 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.590
 so we just use the load 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.990
 ordinary render closure two 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.170
 poles and us motor turns out running 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:54.290
 on closure and thereby it just 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:59.220
 brakes that is to say this generator set and 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:02.510
 moonshine forgives ready and when then 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:06.000
 the motor is already running on battery 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:08.600
 here and fix the resistor here it is 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.400
 Guthrie is there as you can see 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:17.010
 married transistor right here for me 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.670
 there is a scheme in general so small 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.890
 shred 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:26.150
 which is mounted on the usual staff 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:26.150
 fixing the handle on 2 bolts and 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:35.190
 beautiful worked two seasons already and 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:37.110
 works great who gets interested 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.690
 to whom something will be incomprehensible or who 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:42.450
 wants and invent such a system 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.370
 Of course, all sorts of options for the metacone 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:47.400
 appear now on the Internet and 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:50.520
 everywhere but only there bulky 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.419
 motors put large pulley some 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.930
 discs 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.800
 Turns are regulated of course too it is possible 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.960
 it's so tiny here 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.770
 with whom points who literally yourself 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.360
 Includes 2 parts even three transistors 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:08.490
 5 volt roll 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:15.650
 and ordinary variable resistor 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:30.650
 photo of the crayfish shaft of the engine were there moments 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:39.139
 spiral can be planted 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:42.569
 our old gear here for today 

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:45.000
 dear beekeepers all for today whom 

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:47.180
 how much will be incomprehensible write to personal 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.180
