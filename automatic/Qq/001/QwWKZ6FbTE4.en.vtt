00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.900
 you only need a sympathetic person 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.759
 piece of paper and a bit of decor in it 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.800

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.570

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.910
 foil and this with made by me 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.840

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.060
 stick to it or your windows logitech all the way 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.320

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.570
 different variants after so here

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.579
 I also have his stamp of the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.879
 Woman is still here and a few more 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.890
 others with cake on it now I show 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.289
 folded first as the whole 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.600
 the whole thing is super easy as I said 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.059
 you take the square sheet of paper 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.780
 and halved is the first time 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.780
 diagonal 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:07.130
 then put it that way that the 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.980
 right angle pointing upwards 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:15.050
 and take the sharp corners and kinks 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.050
 to the right angle 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.430
 and this page from 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:33.410
 then you open the whole thing again 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:36.240
 and fold one side from the right 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:41.880
 angle down 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.880
 right here on the could 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.880
 the whole thing looks like this 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.860
 then you can open it all here 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.900
 and you have a page you already before 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:09.570
 folded have to beat and fall the 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:11.580
 protruding part inside and that 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.210
 same with the second page too after 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.710
 inside the mud so to fold again and 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.710
 the outstanding part 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.940
 We like to pull it just to fold bag 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:35.180
 the part is now on one 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.900
 pack book page or here accordingly 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.250
 of course, for a sticker and that 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.780
 all you can now, I still see a 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.760
 Persian decorating could be too 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.920
 grave paint faces or animal faces 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.480
 the whole cut in shape for example 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.349
 still nice or pattern in there 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:59.360
 are you very flexible 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:03:03.170

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:07.180
 take a star 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.180
 my real heart is like that 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:19.769
 but then there is a stamp 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.680
 The whole thing looks like this now 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.240

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.500
