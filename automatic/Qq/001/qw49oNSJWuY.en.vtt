from the front so once that's done you

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.960 
from the front so once that's done you
just<00:01:06.940> want<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:07.509> kind<00:01:07.929> of<00:01:08.050> read<00:01:08.890> do<00:01:09.280> that<00:01:09.490> step

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
just want to kind of read do that step

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.779 
just want to kind of read do that step
um<00:01:10.330> so<00:01:10.720> it's<00:01:10.899> like<00:01:11.140> a<00:01:11.170> heavier<00:01:11.530> glue<00:01:11.950> glitter

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789

um so it's like a heavier glue glitter
sorry<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:13.479> then<00:01:13.899> take<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:14.259> bit<00:01:14.470> of<00:01:14.500> glue<00:01:14.830> once

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
sorry and then take a bit of glue once

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.249 
sorry and then take a bit of glue once
two<00:01:15.460> layers<00:01:15.700> are<00:01:15.970> dry<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.479> just<00:01:16.780> coat<00:01:16.990> it<00:01:17.020> on

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
two layers are dry and just coat it on

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.090 
two layers are dry and just coat it on
the<00:01:17.440> back<00:01:17.649> so<00:01:18.460> that<00:01:18.539> your<00:01:19.649> glitter<00:01:20.649> doesn't

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
the back so that your glitter doesn't

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.460 
the back so that your glitter doesn't
fall<00:01:21.310> off<00:01:21.340> or<00:01:21.759> anything<00:01:21.940> it<00:01:22.360> kind<00:01:22.869> of<00:01:22.929> stays<00:01:23.200> in

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
fall off or anything it kind of stays in

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.529 
fall off or anything it kind of stays in
place<00:01:23.649> and<00:01:23.860> it<00:01:23.920> like<00:01:24.069> seals<00:01:24.369> it<00:01:24.640> in<00:01:24.759> you<00:01:25.420> can

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
place and it like seals it in you can

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.419 
place and it like seals it in you can
use<00:01:25.690> Mod<00:01:25.959> Podge<00:01:25.989> for<00:01:26.560> this<00:01:26.679> even<00:01:27.039> if<00:01:27.160> you<00:01:27.280> had

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
use Mod Podge for this even if you had

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.580 
use Mod Podge for this even if you had
you<00:01:28.090> know<00:01:28.119> that<00:01:28.450> stuff<00:01:28.750> I<00:01:28.989> know<00:01:29.140> is<00:01:29.259> you<00:01:29.289> should

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
you know that stuff I know is you should

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.440

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
probably look these completely dry so

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.969 
probably look these completely dry so
all<00:01:31.660> the<00:01:31.840> fogginess<00:01:32.229> is<00:01:32.530> one<00:01:32.709> hundred<00:01:32.770> percent

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
all the fogginess is one hundred percent

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.499 
all the fogginess is one hundred percent

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
actually just attached to the magnets on

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.270 
actually just attached to the magnets on
right<00:01:37.030> away<00:01:37.060> it<00:01:37.390> puts<00:01:37.569> more<00:01:37.750> that<00:01:37.929> glue<00:01:38.280> set

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280

the magnets on the back and then I just

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.380 
the magnets on the back and then I just
let<00:01:41.619> them<00:01:41.649> dry<00:01:42.069> for<00:01:42.099> 24<00:01:42.580> hours<00:01:42.729> and<00:01:43.030> they<00:01:43.330> were

let them dry for 24 hours and they were

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.749 
let them dry for 24 hours and they were
perfectly<00:01:44.080> fine<00:01:44.229> so<00:01:45.039> this<00:01:45.399> is<00:01:45.610> how<00:01:45.729> the

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
perfectly fine so this is how the

glitter ones turned out like I said mine
are<00:01:47.920> my<00:01:48.069> fridge<00:01:48.369> but<00:01:48.610> they'd<00:01:48.759> be<00:01:48.819> really<00:01:49.090> good

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.839 
are my fridge but they'd be really good
for<00:01:49.539> a<00:01:49.629> locker<00:01:49.869> now<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.560> other<00:01:50.860> option<00:01:51.429> is<00:01:51.610> the

especially cool and awesome but again
that's<00:03:21.420> just<00:03:21.600> my<00:03:21.840> personal<00:03:22.350> opinion<00:03:22.470> now<00:03:23.340> the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
that's just my personal opinion now the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.100 
that's just my personal opinion now the
one<00:03:23.700> thing<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:24.030> do<00:03:24.239> want<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.540> make<00:03:24.660> sure<00:03:24.720> of

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
one thing you do want to make sure of

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.570 
one thing you do want to make sure of
when<00:03:25.470> you're<00:03:25.650> doing<00:03:25.950> any<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.340> these

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
when you're doing any of these

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.699 
when you're doing any of these
regardless<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.390> which<00:03:27.600> method<00:03:28.020> you<00:03:28.050> choose<00:03:28.410> is

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
regardless of which method you choose is

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.860 
regardless of which method you choose is
that<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.370> actually<00:03:29.610> let<00:03:30.030> them<00:03:30.180> dry<00:03:30.480> pretty

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
that you actually let them dry pretty

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.540 
that you actually let them dry pretty
far<00:03:31.170> apart<00:03:31.320> and<00:03:31.770> that's<00:03:31.950> because<00:03:32.130> otherwise

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
far apart and that's because otherwise

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.430 
far apart and that's because otherwise
the<00:03:32.880> magnets<00:03:33.330> can<00:03:33.540> be<00:03:33.690> strong<00:03:33.989> enough<00:03:34.230> to

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
the magnets can be strong enough to

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.440 
the magnets can be strong enough to
actually<00:03:34.800> force<00:03:35.549> an<00:03:35.730> attraction<00:03:36.150> between

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
actually force an attraction between

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.660 
actually force an attraction between
them<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:36.959> pull<00:03:37.200> them<00:03:37.230> together<00:03:37.560> so<00:03:37.980> this<00:03:38.489> is

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
them and pull them together so this is

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.580 
them and pull them together so this is
how<00:03:38.820> all<00:03:38.850> of<00:03:39.060> mine<00:03:39.420> turned<00:03:39.750> out<00:03:39.900> like<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.260> said

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590
