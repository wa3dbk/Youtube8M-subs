00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
here's a another challenge level here

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.680 
here's a another challenge level here
where<00:03:56.400> you've<00:03:56.550> got<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.880> kill<00:03:57.030> as<00:03:57.150> many<00:03:57.270> enemies

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
where you've got to kill as many enemies

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.160 
where you've got to kill as many enemies
as<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:57.960> can<00:03:58.170> with<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.350> sniper<00:03:58.620> rifle<00:03:59.570> in<00:04:00.570> a<00:04:00.750> set

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
as it can with a sniper rifle in a set

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.210 
as it can with a sniper rifle in a set
time<00:04:01.410> limit<00:04:03.050> it<00:04:04.050> seems<00:04:04.230> relatively<00:04:04.890> easy<00:04:05.010> to

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
time limit it seems relatively easy to

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.740 
time limit it seems relatively easy to
kill<00:04:05.430> them<00:04:05.580> oh<00:04:05.700> just<00:04:06.090> take<00:04:06.240> a<00:04:06.270> couple<00:04:06.450> of<00:04:06.630> hits

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
kill them oh just take a couple of hits

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.240 
kill them oh just take a couple of hits
yes<00:04:07.710> the<00:04:07.950> problem<00:04:08.160> comes<00:04:08.610> when<00:04:09.090> later<00:04:09.960> on<00:04:10.320> base

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
yes the problem comes when later on base

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.170 
yes the problem comes when later on base
all<00:04:11.610> spawn<00:04:12.060> around<00:04:12.240> you<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:12.750> surround<00:04:13.170> you

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
all spawn around you and surround you

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.550 
all spawn around you and surround you
and<00:04:15.180> then<00:04:15.390> you<00:04:15.480> have<00:04:15.630> sniper<00:04:15.930> rifle<00:04:16.380> yeah

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
and then you have sniper rifle yeah

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.200 
and then you have sniper rifle yeah
exactly<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:17.040> it's<00:04:17.160> quite<00:04:17.430> cumbersome<00:04:17.910> too<00:04:18.060> so

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.210 
exactly and it's quite cumbersome too so

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.210 
exactly and it's quite cumbersome too so
how<00:04:18.420> are<00:04:18.630> these<00:04:18.780> is<00:04:19.140> it<00:04:19.350> just<00:04:19.530> massive<00:04:19.920> damage

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
how are these is it just massive damage

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.229 
how are these is it just massive damage
or<00:04:20.370> are<00:04:20.430> you<00:04:20.520> hearing<00:04:20.760> them<00:04:20.880> in<00:04:20.940> specific

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
or are you hearing them in specific

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.450 
or are you hearing them in specific
places<00:04:21.690> now<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.410> can<00:04:22.530> kill<00:04:22.710> them<00:04:22.830> in<00:04:22.950> one<00:04:23.250> hit

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
places now you can kill them in one hit

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.010 
places now you can kill them in one hit
if<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.669> shoot<00:04:23.850> them<00:04:23.940> in<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.150> head<00:04:24.330> but<00:04:24.900> it

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
if you shoot them in the head but it

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.309 
if you shoot them in the head but it
does<00:04:25.050> deal<00:04:25.380> massive<00:04:25.590> damage

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:27.319 
does deal massive damage
