does<00:01:44.110> that<00:01:44.320> San<00:01:44.710> Antonio<00:01:45.160> will<00:01:45.430> be<00:01:45.550> tough<00:01:45.790> to

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
does that San Antonio will be tough to

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.950 
does that San Antonio will be tough to
be<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:47.140> defense<00:01:47.470> Lee<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:49.180> a<00:01:49.360> 3-point<00:01:49.900> game

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
be on defense Lee it's a 3-point game

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.410 
be on defense Lee it's a 3-point game
the<00:01:50.800> last<00:01:51.010> game<00:01:51.190> a<00:01:51.400> win<00:01:51.850> against<00:01:52.150> San<00:01:52.390> Antonio

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
the last game a win against San Antonio

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.290 
the last game a win against San Antonio
looking<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.320> carry<00:01:53.530> that<00:01:53.830> into<00:01:54.280> this<00:01:54.430> one<00:01:54.670> and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
looking to carry that into this one and

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.180 
looking to carry that into this one and
it<00:01:55.479> seems<00:01:55.750> odd<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.020> say<00:01:56.440> given<00:01:56.860> that<00:01:57.010> they

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
it seems odd to say given that they

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.980 
it seems odd to say given that they
wanted<00:01:57.550> pretty<00:01:57.850> easily<00:01:58.090> but<00:01:58.479> they<00:01:58.750> didn't

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
wanted pretty easily but they didn't

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.260 
wanted pretty easily but they didn't
look<00:01:59.140> especially<00:01:59.440> strong<00:02:00.100> that<00:02:00.369> Tim<00:02:00.580> yeah<00:02:01.090> and

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
look especially strong that Tim yeah and

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.609 
look especially strong that Tim yeah and
if<00:02:01.360> we<00:02:01.479> were<00:02:01.570> watching<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.020> game<00:02:02.050> without<00:02:02.500> the

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
if we were watching the game without the

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.650 
if we were watching the game without the
benefit<00:02:03.040> of<00:02:03.070> a<00:02:03.220> scoreboard<00:02:03.520> you<00:02:04.300> have<00:02:04.450> thought

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
benefit of a scoreboard you have thought

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.109 
benefit of a scoreboard you have thought
it<00:02:04.690> was<00:02:04.900> a<00:02:04.960> lot<00:02:05.200> closer<00:02:05.470> than<00:02:05.680> it<00:02:05.920> was<00:02:06.119> and

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
it was a lot closer than it was and

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.330 
it was a lot closer than it was and
going<00:02:07.300> back<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.869> Tim<00:02:08.410> Duncan<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.890> San<00:02:09.190> Antonio

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
going back to Tim Duncan and San Antonio

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.910 
going back to Tim Duncan and San Antonio
Clark<00:02:10.270> even<00:02:10.660> if<00:02:10.780> he<00:02:10.929> isn't<00:02:11.050> putting<00:02:11.380> up<00:02:11.590> great

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
Clark even if he isn't putting up great

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.790 
Clark even if he isn't putting up great
numbers<00:02:11.950> he<00:02:12.520> really<00:02:12.850> does<00:02:13.030> seem<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:13.570> drive<00:02:14.470> the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
numbers he really does seem to drive the

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.530 
numbers he really does seem to drive the
two<00:02:15.010> just<00:02:15.280> through<00:02:15.459> his<00:02:15.580> power<00:02:15.850> in<00:02:16.120> his<00:02:16.239> will

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
two just through his power in his will

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.150 
two just through his power in his will
well<00:02:16.930> there's<00:02:17.140> something<00:02:17.320> about<00:02:17.620> presence

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
well there's something about presence

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.590 
well there's something about presence
and<00:02:18.340> that's<00:02:18.550> really<00:02:18.790> what<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.060> superstar

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
and that's really what a superstar

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.240 
and that's really what a superstar
player<00:02:19.840> like<00:02:20.050> Duncan<00:02:20.410> can<00:02:20.590> do<00:02:20.709> for<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.040> Kevin

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
player like Duncan can do for you Kevin

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.640 
player like Duncan can do for you Kevin

I<00:02:56.090> think<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.690> question<00:02:57.050> going<00:02:57.290> forward<00:02:57.710> with

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
I think the question going forward with

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.000 
I think the question going forward with
the<00:02:58.010> new<00:02:58.190> CBA<00:02:58.730> really<00:02:59.720> penalizing<00:03:00.320> teams<00:03:00.770> for

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
the new CBA really penalizing teams for

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.160 
the new CBA really penalizing teams for
going<00:03:01.190> deep<00:03:01.370> into<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.730> luxury<00:03:02.030> tax<00:03:02.270> to<00:03:03.020> be

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
going deep into the luxury tax to be

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.050 
going deep into the luxury tax to be
interesting<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.560> see<00:03:03.650> how<00:03:03.980> Miami<00:03:04.580> handles

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
interesting to see how Miami handles

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.060 
interesting to see how Miami handles
that<00:03:05.180> going<00:03:05.480> forward<00:03:05.930> because<00:03:06.470> those<00:03:06.830> three

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
that going forward because those three

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.190 
that going forward because those three
