what's getting to today's class setup

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.479 
what's getting to today's class setup
today<00:00:33.960> we're<00:00:34.199> looking<00:00:34.440> at<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> submachine<00:00:35.309> gun

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
today we're looking at a submachine gun

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.920 
today we're looking at a submachine gun
which<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.670> pretty<00:00:36.150> good<00:00:36.360> we<00:00:36.540> don't<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.780> too

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
which is pretty good we don't have too

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.170 
which is pretty good we don't have too
many<00:00:37.020> SMG<00:00:37.620> class<00:00:37.770> setup<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.220> I<00:00:38.280> think<00:00:38.730> only<00:00:38.820> two

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
many SMG class setup so I think only two

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.490 
many SMG class setup so I think only two
on<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.540> carnage<00:00:39.840> cleaning<00:00:40.080> channel<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.379> of

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
on the carnage cleaning channel as of

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.040 
on the carnage cleaning channel as of
now<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.280> now<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.430> got<00:00:41.699> a<00:00:41.730> third<00:00:42.060> and<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.989> is

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
now so now you got a third and that is

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.880 
now so now you got a third and that is
the<00:00:43.620> Vepr<00:00:44.220> which<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> very<00:00:45.000> good<00:00:45.210> gun<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:46.290> was

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the Vepr which is a very good gun it was

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.080 
the Vepr which is a very good gun it was
in<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.100> beginning<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.550> college<00:00:47.700> did<00:00:47.880> you<00:00:47.910> guys

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
in the beginning of college did you guys

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.060 
in the beginning of college did you guys
consider<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.630> best<00:00:48.809> gun<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.110> game<00:00:49.200> right

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
consider the best gun in the game right

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.430 
consider the best gun in the game right
now<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.520> probably<00:00:50.790> in<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.660> top<00:00:51.840> ten<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.290> not

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
now it's probably in the top ten but not

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.810 
now it's probably in the top ten but not
the<00:00:52.530> best<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:53.160> very<00:00:53.309> good<00:00:53.460> though<00:00:53.640> and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
the best it's very good though and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.360 
the best it's very good though and
there's<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> lot<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.570> different<00:00:55.010> class<00:00:56.010> ups<00:00:56.280> you

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
there's a lot of different class ups you

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.610 
there's a lot of different class ups you
could<00:00:56.489> use<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:56.880> this<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.989> first<00:00:58.230> off<00:00:58.410> I

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
could use for this really so first off I

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.440 
could use for this really so first off I
have<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.040> recommend<00:00:59.309> using<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.910> foregrip<00:01:00.270> as

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
have to recommend using the foregrip as

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.020 
have to recommend using the foregrip as
a<00:01:00.809> must<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.100> have<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.460> for<00:01:02.700> grip<00:01:02.910> on

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
a must you have to have that for grip on

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.999 
a must you have to have that for grip on
there<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.540> does<00:01:03.750> recoil<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.410> you<00:01:04.770> want<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.949> be

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
there it does recoil and you want to be

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.230 
there it does recoil and you want to be
able<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.220> pick<00:01:05.369> off<00:01:05.489> people<00:01:05.820> from<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> little

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
able to pick off people from a little

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.609 
able to pick off people from a little
bit<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.479> further<00:01:06.690> distance<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.380> make<00:01:07.590> sure

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
bit of a further distance so make sure

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.889 
bit of a further distance so make sure
you<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.130> four<00:01:08.369> grip<00:01:08.550> on<00:01:08.700> there<00:01:08.910> second

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
you have that four grip on there second

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.840 
you have that four grip on there second
is<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.710> actually<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.250> lot<00:01:11.399> of<00:01:11.430> different<00:01:11.700> things

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
is is actually a lot of different things

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.040 
is is actually a lot of different things
that<00:01:11.910> could<00:01:12.149> work<00:01:12.270> out<00:01:12.509> and<00:01:12.720> that's<00:01:12.930> what

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
that could work out and that's what

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.170 
that could work out and that's what
we're<00:01:13.140> gonna<00:01:13.259> talk<00:01:13.380> about<00:01:13.410> so<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.940> first

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
we're gonna talk about so the first

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.640 
we're gonna talk about so the first
thing<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> muzzle<00:01:15.930> brake<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.560> is

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
thing is the muzzle brake so this is

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.960 
thing is the muzzle brake so this is
gonna<00:01:16.799> increase<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.310> damage<00:01:17.520> at<00:01:17.790> longer

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
gonna increase the damage at longer

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.399 
gonna increase the damage at longer
distances<00:01:18.479> obviously<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.110> could<00:01:19.290> always

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
distances obviously so you could always

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.660 
distances obviously so you could always
throw<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:19.799> there<00:01:20.010> it's<00:01:20.190> a<00:01:20.220> submachine

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
throw that on there it's a submachine

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.830 
throw that on there it's a submachine
gun<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.119> pick<00:01:21.270> off<00:01:21.390> people<00:01:21.659> from<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
gun you can pick off people from a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.060 
gun you can pick off people from a
little<00:01:22.020> bit<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.170> further<00:01:22.409> distance<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.950> can

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
little bit of further distance you can

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.440 
little bit of further distance you can
get<00:01:23.220> killed<00:01:23.400> kill<00:01:23.700> us<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> little<00:01:23.909> bit<00:01:24.060> faster

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
get killed kill us a little bit faster

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.660 
get killed kill us a little bit faster
it's<00:01:24.570> always<00:01:24.810> good<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.189> course<00:01:26.460> it's

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
it's always good but of course it's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.280 
it's always good but of course it's
going<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.939> put<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.420> radar<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.200> you

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
going to put you on the radar and if you

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.750 
going to put you on the radar and if you
don't<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.650> putting<00:01:28.860> put<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> radar<00:01:29.549> then

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
don't like putting put on the radar then

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.980 
don't like putting put on the radar then
you've<00:01:29.880> got<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.240> throw<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.450> silencer<00:01:30.869> on

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
you've got to throw that silencer on

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.450 
you've got to throw that silencer on
that's<00:01:31.200> literally<00:01:31.470> all<00:01:31.560> silenced<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
that's literally all silenced the

few other really things that you could

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.719 
few other really things that you could
do<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.409> haven't<00:01:52.979> tried<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.280> myself

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
do I haven't tried it myself

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.429 
do I haven't tried it myself
but<00:01:54.150> I've<00:01:54.270> done<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.600> private<00:01:54.810> matches<00:01:55.110> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
but I've done it in private matches and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.840 
but I've done it in private matches and
it<00:01:55.500> worked<00:01:55.650> very<00:01:55.740> good<00:01:56.100> against<00:01:56.310> bots<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.820> I

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
it worked very good against bots so I

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.120 
it worked very good against bots so I
don't<00:01:57.060> know<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.299> would<00:01:57.390> be<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.659> same<00:01:57.869> in

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
don't know if it would be the same in

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.280 
don't know if it would be the same in
real<00:01:59.130> matches<00:01:59.640> but<00:01:59.909> rapid<00:02:00.780> fire<00:02:00.930> makes<00:02:01.170> this

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
real matches but rapid fire makes this

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.929 
real matches but rapid fire makes this
gun<00:02:01.439> very<00:02:01.710> very<00:02:01.920> effective<00:02:02.460> obviously<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
gun very very effective obviously the

fire<00:02:03.119> rate<00:02:03.299> goes<00:02:03.450> up<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.780> course<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.259> can

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
fire rate goes up of course and you can

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.600 
fire rate goes up of course and you can
kill<00:02:04.560> enemies<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> little<00:02:04.979> bit<00:02:05.070> faster
