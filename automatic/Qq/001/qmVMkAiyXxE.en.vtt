TRX to help me enhance those qualities

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.300 
TRX to help me enhance those qualities
with<00:01:01.780> the<00:01:01.930> riders<00:01:02.200> that<00:01:02.350> I<00:01:02.440> train<00:01:02.710> so<00:01:02.980> the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
with the riders that I train so the

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.799 
with the riders that I train so the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
first exercise that I want to show you

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.410 
first exercise that I want to show you
is<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.500> balanced<00:01:06.009> one<00:01:06.280> and<00:01:06.579> a<00:01:06.880> little<00:01:07.090> twist

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
is the balanced one and a little twist

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.940 
is the balanced one and a little twist
that<00:01:07.570> I<00:01:07.659> like<00:01:07.840> to<00:01:07.929> put<00:01:08.140> on<00:01:08.200> it<00:01:08.499> to<00:01:08.619> kind<00:01:08.799> of

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
that I like to put on it to kind of

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.649 
that I like to put on it to kind of
mimic<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.369> pedal<00:01:09.759> stroke<00:01:09.999> a<00:01:10.119> little<00:01:10.329> bit<00:01:10.450> more

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
mimic the pedal stroke a little bit more

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.270 
mimic the pedal stroke a little bit more
so<00:01:10.810> while<00:01:10.929> we're<00:01:11.049> working<00:01:11.200> on<00:01:11.469> this<00:01:11.740> exercise

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
so while we're working on this exercise

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.279 
so while we're working on this exercise
and<00:01:12.609> standing<00:01:13.090> pedaling<00:01:13.479> stroke<00:01:13.810> what<00:01:14.229> I'm

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
and standing pedaling stroke what I'm

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:16.230 
and standing pedaling stroke what I'm
going<00:01:14.409> to<00:01:14.439> do<00:01:14.590> is<00:01:14.710> concentrate<00:01:15.100> on<00:01:15.369> balancing

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
going to do is concentrate on balancing

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.929 
going to do is concentrate on balancing
and<00:01:16.420> driving<00:01:17.170> with<00:01:17.649> the<00:01:17.799> lead<00:01:18.039> leg<00:01:18.399> and

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
and driving with the lead leg and

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:20.999 
and driving with the lead leg and
minimizing<00:01:19.719> our<00:01:19.840> reliance<00:01:20.170> on<00:01:20.380> that<00:01:20.439> trail

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
minimizing our reliance on that trail

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.800 
minimizing our reliance on that trail
leg<00:01:21.280> for<00:01:21.549> balance<00:01:21.969> so<00:01:22.149> that<00:01:22.179> we're<00:01:22.479> standing

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
leg for balance so that we're standing

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.690 
leg for balance so that we're standing
up<00:01:22.929> and<00:01:23.079> pedaling<00:01:23.590> that's<00:01:24.009> what<00:01:24.249> we're<00:01:24.399> doing

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
up and pedaling that's what we're doing

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.789 
up and pedaling that's what we're doing
that<00:01:24.880> we're<00:01:25.090> driving<00:01:25.359> with<00:01:25.719> the<00:01:25.840> lead<00:01:26.049> leg<00:01:26.319> not

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
that we're driving with the lead leg not

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.410 
that we're driving with the lead leg not
balancing<00:01:27.429> with<00:01:27.549> the<00:01:27.640> trail<00:01:27.939> leg<00:01:28.210> which

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
balancing with the trail leg which

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.209 
balancing with the trail leg which
interferes<00:01:29.020> with<00:01:29.259> that<00:01:29.289> with<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.859> power<00:01:30.100> of

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
interferes with that with the power of

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.580 
interferes with that with the power of
the<00:01:30.429> lead<00:01:30.609> leg<00:01:30.850> there<00:01:31.060> so<00:01:31.359> for<00:01:31.899> this<00:01:32.079> our<00:01:32.259> slice

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
the lead leg there so for this our slice

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.709 
the lead leg there so for this our slice
here<00:01:32.859> I<00:01:33.069> like<00:01:33.249> to<00:01:33.399> get<00:01:33.549> set<00:01:33.819> up<00:01:33.999> make<00:01:34.479> sure<00:01:34.509> you

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
here I like to get set up make sure you

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.719

up a little mini circuit of these three

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.340 
up a little mini circuit of these three
exercises<00:04:34.490> you<00:04:35.180> can<00:04:35.390> either<00:04:35.600> do<00:04:35.780> you<00:04:36.230> know

three sets of you know eight to twelve

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.450 
three sets of you know eight to twelve
reps<00:04:38.810> or<00:04:39.260> another<00:04:39.590> thing<00:04:39.800> that<00:04:39.920> I<00:04:39.980> like<00:04:40.190> to<00:04:40.340> do

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
reps or another thing that I like to do

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.280 
reps or another thing that I like to do
is<00:04:40.580> set<00:04:40.790> up<00:04:40.820> a<00:04:40.970> timer<00:04:41.240> for<00:04:41.390> ten<00:04:41.720> minutes<00:04:41.960> and

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
is set up a timer for ten minutes and

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.500 
is set up a timer for ten minutes and
just<00:04:42.530> go<00:04:42.860> through<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.220> circuit<00:04:43.730> and<00:04:43.940> see<00:04:44.300> how

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
just go through the circuit and see how

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.360 
just go through the circuit and see how
many<00:04:44.690> rounds<00:04:44.900> I<00:04:45.170> can<00:04:45.350> get<00:04:45.530> through<00:04:45.770> again

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
many rounds I can get through again

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.070 
many rounds I can get through again
doing<00:04:46.700> eight<00:04:46.880> to<00:04:47.000> twelve<00:04:47.270> reps<00:04:47.570> of<00:04:47.780> each<00:04:47.900> of
