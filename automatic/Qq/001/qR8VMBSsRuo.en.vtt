00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.560 
very difficult for us to humanely get
rid<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.649> them<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.220> our<00:01:53.610> landlords<00:01:54.360> are

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
rid of them and our landlords are

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.899 
rid of them and our landlords are
probably<00:01:54.810> going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.049> try<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.460> put<00:01:56.460> poison

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
probably going to try and put poison

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.389 
probably going to try and put poison
down<00:01:57.119> or<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:58.049> they<00:01:58.170> try<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.380> put<00:01:58.649> traps<00:01:58.860> down<00:01:59.100> i

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
down or if they try to put traps down i

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.100 
down or if they try to put traps down i
will<00:01:59.610> put<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.090> traps<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.540> their<00:02:00.689> fucking

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
will put the traps on their fucking

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.660 
will put the traps on their fucking
faces<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.829> see<00:02:01.920> how<00:02:02.009> much<00:02:02.130> they<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.490> that

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
faces and see how much they like that

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.639 
faces and see how much they like that
there<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.909> no<00:02:03.149> way<00:02:03.329> anyone<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.840> putting<00:02:04.079> rat

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.969 
trap to this house I don't know why I
think<00:02:06.420> poison<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.869> better<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.469> mean<00:02:07.680> I'll<00:02:07.740> try

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
think poison is better I mean I'll try

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.029 
think poison is better I mean I'll try
and<00:02:08.009> do<00:02:08.670> some<00:02:08.849> research<00:02:09.030> into<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:10.530> feel<00:02:10.950> like

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
and do some research into it I feel like

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.600 
and do some research into it I feel like
poison<00:02:11.430> would<00:02:11.610> be<00:02:11.730> quicker

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
poison would be quicker

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.949 
poison would be quicker
