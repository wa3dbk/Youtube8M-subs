00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.009
 Hey, people, beauty. 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.290
 Today I 'm here to talk about the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.000
 risks of a photo about the dangers of 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.250
 a tattoo may have 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.960
 I want to talk about some diseases that 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.730
 you can contract if you do not 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.320
 have a make a good choice 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.119
 if you do not have a 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.880
 quality being placed in you being 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.199
 used to do everything is one thing 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.570
 that I realize a lot and when people 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.090
 they are in the mood to make an actor 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.490
 This turns out an anxiety stays that saga 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.470
 to make a contact and people want 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.380
 know where I'm closest to or 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.059
 anyone cheaper and not 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.399
 worry more 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.680
 to have grown so much this area to have 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.390
 so many studies out there not always they 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.129
 they worry about your studio they are there 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.289
 does not have quality sterilization 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.809
 of the material to be used in it and 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.250
 disposable or not, I do not remember 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.020
 When I opened my studio, it's very 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.199
 people are more likely to care 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.149
 this question and ask many questions right 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.500
 if the material was discarded as it was 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.750
 made the discard 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.039
 there are a number of recommendations 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.439
 health surveillance and the 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.970
 prefecture for a studio if open and 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.770
 here's the tip look for studios 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.049
 professionals but I want to talk today 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.670
 for you about the dangers that the danger 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.740
 are you against hepatitis 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.770
 There are several types of hepatitis 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.159
 more serious and hepatitis c is a disease 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.100
 very worrying because it is a 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.869
 asymptomatic disease, it is the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.930
 contagion from contact with blood 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.270
 contaminated by sharing the needle is 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.210
 you can contract in the manicure and 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.170
 pedicure you can contract for the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.380
 can be a form of Christmas 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.950
 which is when the woman is pregnant she 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.240
 can pass on to the child, or doing 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.040
 a tattoo too 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.570
 All this if you do not have a material 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.810
 sterilized quality 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.509
 Okay, so I want to let you stay here. 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.149
 when you go to do your class and 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.759
 hepatitis causes inflammation in the liver 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.579
 and the danger of this disease is asymptomatic 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.950
 that this would be a disease that is not 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.020
 you realize 1 105 thomas hers 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.910
 if you have hepatitis you have a life 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.009
 normal, you do not realize that 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.420
 so it's important to do exams 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:18.330
 newspapers 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:21.650
 everything is fine and hepatitis a is a tip 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:26.099
 curious and a lot of information 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:29.040
 scary until in Brazil today 500 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.230
 forgiveness in the world in the world today 500 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.480
 million people have hepatitis C in 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.260
 Brazil is estimated one million 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.170
 medium 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.530
 now the information that left me 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:43.380
 impact is that the estimation of people 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.830
 who know he has hepatitis is 5% 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.230
 only then with that amount all 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.150
 people who have this virus only 5% 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.459
 are aware of this 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.459
 is a very serious disease that if it does not 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.739
 is cared for and spent a lot of time 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.250
 can become very dangerous 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.140
 hepatitis c if it is if it reaches 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.430
 very serious levels for them 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.560
 can develop into cirrhosis or even 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.400
 a lung cancer then take too much 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.470
 caution 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.840
 it is no joke the choices that 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.910
 We did to get a tattoo for the 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.440
 Do you have your nails to have to take? 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.070
 very careful look for a studio 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.470
 there is contagion from hiv is a 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.120
 little more difficult is a virus that has 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.459
 of the body it only lasts a few minutes is a 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.420
 virus it does not have much resistance 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.320
 out of body 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.570
 so it 's a little more difficult to orient 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.790
 your tattoo artist if you have any 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.260
 skin problem guide him already 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.670
 I explained to them that you have ease 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.250
 technological 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.150
 I do not hide this information one thing 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.709
 important is that sometimes I see 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.320
 people wanting to look for a tattoo artist 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.079
 to cover stains and if you do not have a 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.840
 medical diagnosis and an allowance 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.150
 to cover a stain does not cover 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.040
 because if it's something to be dealt with later 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.470
 who is tattooed on top will stay 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.790
 much harder for your doctor to do 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.910
 diagnosis or him has 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.060
 diagnosis understand what you have 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.730
 so be careful about it there not 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.370
 do not get tattoos to cover blemishes 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.690
