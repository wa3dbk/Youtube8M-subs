00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
the library was in silhouette and if

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.510 
the library was in silhouette and if
you're<00:00:55.530> gonna<00:00:55.649> tell<00:00:55.949> me<00:00:55.980> it's<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.309> color

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
you're gonna tell me it's in color

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.920 
you're gonna tell me it's in color
because<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.000> bigger<00:00:57.239> then<00:00:57.510> why<00:00:57.690> are<00:00:57.780> they

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
because it's bigger then why are they

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.510 
because it's bigger then why are they
roughly<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.410> same<00:00:58.559> size<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> background

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
roughly the same size in the background

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.250 
roughly the same size in the background
if<00:00:59.730> they<00:00:59.940> appear<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> same<00:01:00.600> size<00:01:00.870> then<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
if they appear the same size then the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.080 
if they appear the same size then the
castle<00:01:01.680> would<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.070> be<00:01:02.160> further<00:01:02.399> away<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
castle would have to be further away and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.109 
castle would have to be further away and
would<00:01:03.210> definitely<00:01:03.660> be<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.899> silhouette<00:01:04.290> then

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
would definitely be in silhouette then

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.399 
would definitely be in silhouette then
now<00:01:06.119> for<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> plot<00:01:06.540> holes<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.960> brings<00:01:07.200> out

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
now for the plot holes this brings out

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.410 
now for the plot holes this brings out
are<00:01:08.130> these<00:01:08.310> Colts<00:01:08.700> they<00:01:08.880> were<00:01:08.939> reading<00:01:09.180> for
