00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.879
 greetings to all here johnjo perfidious 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:09.090
 commenting and in today's match we're going 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.200
 to see how they face some acro 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.499
 200 and a cello of 200 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.349
 let's see first the cello seems 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:23.000
 which is agility because it has 57 of 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:27.470
 very good tackle resist the cello 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 you have precise to fire the fire of 20 a 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:35.390
 27 to water and 24 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.510
 air all these percentages 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.879
 Clear 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.289
 you do not have that land should have at 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.429
 at least neutral for punishment but 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:48.210
 well try to take away the sacred and 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:49.880
 it has removed a total of about 3 p da 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.980
 just 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:57.630
 we will see that as does start 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:00.600
 get 400 strong enough sticking with 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.380
 with the toma'i sword and the lord 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.120
 strike back 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.120
 with the left root united- 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.979
 it's a weapon, it's not a bad weapon, but 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.820
 at this level it is not that it could be 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:20.510
 chosen another thing I say 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.510
 let's see to see try to take pieces 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:28.200
 and he's taking about three each turn 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:34.360
 500 400 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:38.070
 the sacrum is very strong very strong 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.070
 many times a lot 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.450
 let's see what I eat as he counterattacks 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.870
 the cello 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.570
 l aquila removed a p now takes away 2 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.960
 My mother is is I think war is 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.960
 giving 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.920
 what war is the sacrum giving 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.710
 come on now he's going to do abstractions not 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.900
 have another option 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.900
 and 250 takes away 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:17.260
 sanz throws a crazy driver 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.260
 let's see what it is going to do 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.269
 to see what the cello does 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.540
 I could opt for a cloudy one I would not be 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:31.750
 nothing wrong theft of time slowing down 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.210
 they go 4 ph but of course if the cello 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.010
 even though 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.970
 a pedal just removed letting the 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.970
 leave with 7 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.100
 and if I'm not wrong to catch him for 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.960
 catch him 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.550
 because you can make changes with the driver 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.480
 crazy to get 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:55.150
 yes no if I'm not wrong 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.980
 he approaches and 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.819
 I think it's time for him 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:05.170
 start running, get the worst and start 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:09.750
 I can take it away 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.750
 is corralling the full-fledged sky 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.160
 is getting on all sides 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.030
 and trying the heat for all 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.720
 media will release the sacrum but it's very 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.870
 hard 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.320
 This sacrum costs a lot to take away 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.320
 pedals 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.930
 and teleport attention the cello has been 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.930
 remote enough 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.320
 but the sacrum put back in its 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.320
 site 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.590
 I do not think that you please do not think he 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.460
 fancy being behind a cello is 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.420
 quite annoying 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.190
 between that between the needles and all that 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.520
 you can bore until you 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.520
 you ask 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.390
 going through the sacrum continues attacking 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.530
 I add that the sacral doctor is very very 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.600
 Useful 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.970
 It is very good but after these 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.970
 updates has been pretty good 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.070
 and attacks the cello with the blow of the cello 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.720
 and he uses his last pieces 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.340
 try to take pieces 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.340
 and here are four pieces 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:38.819
 the sacrum approaches him 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.819
 and an absorption of 400 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.000
 the sky the state that has almost lost 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.000
 here 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.330
 little by little you can do this 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.620
 sorry 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.620
 let's see what he's going to do 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.440
 and this time it is taking away 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.440
 takes away 3 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.819
 4 p as should try at least 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.370
 take away 5p ace so he could only 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:12.840
 attack once with soul and attention 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:16.249
 because elche is about to die 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.729
 150 and the worst will end 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:22.900
 ending pawn and yes 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.700
 ends the worst 2 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.720
 very good combat 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.470
 the cello I do not know the truth should have 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.969
 had more 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.790
 if you are going to remove ph 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:37.969
 and more against a sacrum 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.919
 but good 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.110
 he will see how the crash is made from 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:45.049
 then that would put much more much more to 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.469
 remove ph at least to leave it with 7 

00:05:45.049 --> 00:05:50.209
 try to leave it with 7 p each 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.670
 turn to the sacrum so that for not 

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:53.020
 I can attack 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.060
 so he can not attack with weapons 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.420
 so many times so that it concretes that a 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.420
 it's okay 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:01.399
 another strategy could have been expanded 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.379
 but well there were not many 

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:05.009
 possibilities I hope you like in the 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:07.879
