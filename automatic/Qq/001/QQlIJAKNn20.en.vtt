00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.150 
references just asked us a question
about<00:00:19.970> chondromalacia<00:00:20.420> patella<00:00:21.140> and<00:00:21.440> I

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
about chondromalacia patella and I

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.650

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
to get sort of ready is it almost starts

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.079 
to get sort of ready is it almost starts
to<00:00:50.780> crumble<00:00:51.080> just<00:00:51.470> a<00:00:51.589> bit<00:00:51.739> so<00:00:51.979> sort<00:00:52.909> of<00:00:52.940> your

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
to crumble just a bit so sort of your

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.119 
to crumble just a bit so sort of your
honeycomb<00:00:53.300> type<00:00:53.780> of<00:00:53.960> situation<00:00:54.589> so<00:00:54.769> that<00:00:54.949> is<00:00:55.100> a

Korea so usually want to get onto it
early<00:01:00.170> if<00:01:00.379> it's<00:01:00.530> being<00:01:00.739> diagnosed<00:01:01.339> and<00:01:01.850> start

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
early if it's being diagnosed and start

early if it's being diagnosed and start
to<00:01:02.300> manage<00:01:02.629> it<00:01:02.809> so<00:01:03.260> first<00:01:03.769> thing<00:01:04.040> that<00:01:04.400> you

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
to manage it so first thing that you

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.830 
understand is how you use your knee from
a<00:01:06.920> mechanics<00:01:07.430> perspective<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.180> a<00:01:08.540> lot<00:01:08.570> of

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
a mechanics perspective and a lot of

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.649 
a mechanics perspective and a lot of
runners<00:01:09.229> get<00:01:09.710> out<00:01:09.950> in<00:01:10.130> front<00:01:10.430> and<00:01:10.760> a<00:01:11.420> quite

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
runners get out in front and a quite

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.899 
runners get out in front and a quite
heavy<00:01:11.810> so<00:01:12.170> if<00:01:12.229> you're<00:01:12.440> your<00:01:13.070> landing<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:13.729> in

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
heavy so if you're your landing and in

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.090 
heavy so if you're your landing and in
front<00:01:14.150> and<00:01:14.390> your<00:01:14.540> heel<00:01:14.930> striking<00:01:15.320> very

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
front and your heel striking very

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.999 
front and your heel striking very
commonly<00:01:16.670> that<00:01:17.060> that<00:01:17.479> angle<00:01:18.469> through<00:01:18.920> the

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
commonly that that angle through the

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.380 
commonly that that angle through the
knee<00:01:19.130> is<00:01:19.310> quite<00:01:19.549> straight<00:01:19.939> so<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:20.270> almost

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
knee is quite straight so you almost

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.870 
knee is quite straight so you almost
gonna<00:01:20.630> lock<00:01:20.990> me<00:01:21.259> so<00:01:21.829> that<00:01:22.219> the<00:01:22.369> forces<00:01:22.729> are

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
gonna lock me so that the forces are

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.330 
gonna lock me so that the forces are
quite<00:01:23.210> maybe<00:01:23.600> going<00:01:23.990> through<00:01:24.350> then<00:01:25.070> what

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
quite maybe going through then what

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.819 
quite maybe going through then what
happens<00:01:25.789> is<00:01:26.090> that<00:01:26.450> oftentimes<00:01:27.289> you're<00:01:27.619> weak

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
happens is that oftentimes you're weak

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.700 
happens is that oftentimes you're weak
in<00:01:28.009> this<00:01:28.219> inner<00:01:28.430> age<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:29.149> and<00:01:29.479> you'll<00:01:29.659> sink<00:01:30.020> so

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
in this inner age and and you'll sink so

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.249 
in this inner age and and you'll sink so
can<00:01:31.490> we<00:01:31.729> see<00:01:32.030> people<00:01:32.329> that<00:01:32.719> have<00:01:32.899> them

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
can we see people that have them

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.289 
can we see people that have them

cool so I'll just show you how to start
tackling<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.680> basically<00:02:18.180> before<00:02:19.180> you

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
tackling that and basically before you

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.690 
tackling that and basically before you
run<00:02:19.569> guys<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:20.290> can<00:02:20.739> start<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.160> use<00:02:21.190> trigger

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
run guys you can start to use trigger

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.789 
run guys you can start to use trigger
pointing<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.269> actually<00:02:22.720> get<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.200> muscle<00:02:23.620> to

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
pointing to actually get a muscle to

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.470 
pointing to actually get a muscle to
start<00:02:24.250> activating<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.790> little<00:02:24.970> bit<00:02:25.090> better<00:02:25.239> and

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
start activating a little bit better and

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.839 
start activating a little bit better and
and<00:02:26.079> particularly<00:02:26.680> yet<00:02:27.069> with<00:02:27.190> your<00:02:27.640> knees

you'll have pain from degeneration and

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.390 
you'll have pain from degeneration and
here<00:02:51.819> but<00:02:52.410> degeneration<00:02:53.410> will<00:02:53.560> always<00:02:54.010> stir

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
here but degeneration will always stir

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.330 
here but degeneration will always stir
up<00:02:54.730> myofascial<00:02:55.690> pain<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.739> you<00:02:56.769> always<00:02:57.160> have

up myofascial pain so you always have

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.800 
up myofascial pain so you always have
two<00:02:57.519> components<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.120> your<00:02:58.209> pain<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.569> you<00:02:58.660> can

you can back off that let my official

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.819 
you can back off that let my official
component<00:03:01.209> within<00:03:01.359> trigger<00:03:01.630> points<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.350> so

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
component within trigger points so so

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.849 
component within trigger points so so
remember<00:03:03.730> our<00:03:03.760> trail<00:03:04.209> goes<00:03:04.480> so<00:03:04.720> kneecap<00:03:05.319> up<00:03:05.650> on

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
remember our trail goes so kneecap up on

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.140 
remember our trail goes so kneecap up on
a<00:03:05.889> 45<00:03:06.489> and<00:03:07.450> he's<00:03:07.540> just<00:03:07.720> in<00:03:07.840> there<00:03:07.989> yeah<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:10.090> you

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
a 45 and he's just in there yeah so you

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.599 
a 45 and he's just in there yeah so you
can<00:03:10.269> treat<00:03:10.450> want<00:03:10.690> that<00:03:10.930> kneecap<00:03:11.560> out<00:03:11.829> on<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.069> 45

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
can treat want that kneecap out on a 45

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.160 
can treat want that kneecap out on a 45
and<00:03:12.910> get<00:03:13.030> that<00:03:13.209> little<00:03:13.480> going<00:03:13.690> there<00:03:13.959> how<00:03:14.109> to

I love doing your little little quarter

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.080 
I love doing your little little quarter
squats<00:03:44.440> and<00:03:44.620> most<00:03:45.280> people<00:03:45.579> will<00:03:45.669> do<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:45.819> full

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
squats and most people will do a full

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.509 
squats and most people will do a full
squat<00:03:46.569> so<00:03:46.900> so<00:03:47.169> most<00:03:47.410> people<00:03:47.560> will<00:03:47.799> go<00:03:47.950> right

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
squat so so most people will go right

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.759 
squat so so most people will go right
down<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.239> I<00:03:49.599> always<00:03:49.840> think<00:03:50.200> like<00:03:50.290> if<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.650> go

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
down and I always think like if you go

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.220 
down and I always think like if you go
right<00:03:51.069> down<00:03:51.130> engine<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:51.880> that<00:03:52.030> sort<00:03:52.269> of<00:03:52.329> so

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
right down engine to that sort of so

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.289 
right down engine to that sort of so
most<00:03:53.410> will<00:03:53.680> go<00:03:53.829> to<00:03:53.889> that<00:03:54.549> level<00:03:54.759> of<00:03:54.910> a<00:03:54.970> squat<00:03:55.150> or

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
most will go to that level of a squat or

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.749 
most will go to that level of a squat or
even<00:03:55.540> even<00:03:56.109> more<00:03:56.259> and<00:03:56.530> there's<00:03:57.340> nothing<00:03:57.669> wrong

00:03:57.749 --> 00:03:57.759 
even even more and there's nothing wrong

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:59.850 
even even more and there's nothing wrong
with<00:03:57.820> having<00:03:58.000> strength<00:03:58.329> in<00:03:58.479> that<00:03:58.509> range<00:03:58.840> but

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
with having strength in that range but

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.380 
with having strength in that range but
it's<00:03:59.980> not<00:04:00.160> really<00:04:00.640> that<00:04:00.670> functional<00:04:01.240> for

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
it's not really that functional for

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.780 
it's not really that functional for
running<00:04:01.600> running<00:04:02.140> should<00:04:02.650> be<00:04:02.950> around<00:04:03.580> that

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
running running should be around that

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.910 
running running should be around that
sort<00:04:04.000> of<00:04:04.030> 35<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:06.060> 240<00:04:07.060> degrees<00:04:07.410> of<00:04:08.410> reflection

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
sort of 35 to 240 degrees of reflection

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.400 
sort of 35 to 240 degrees of reflection
not<00:04:09.370> not<00:04:09.610> too<00:04:09.730> much<00:04:09.880> more<00:04:10.150> than<00:04:10.300> that<00:04:10.410> and

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
not not too much more than that and

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.490 
not not too much more than that and
almost<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:11.980> less<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.550> better<00:04:12.700> so<00:04:13.300> so<00:04:13.750> what

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
almost the less the better so so what

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.440 
almost the less the better so so what
can<00:04:14.710> happen<00:04:14.770> is<00:04:15.190> as<00:04:15.430> you<00:04:15.460> as<00:04:15.880> you<00:04:16.090> drop<00:04:16.269> down

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
can happen is as you as you drop down

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.319 
can happen is as you as you drop down
inch<00:04:17.310> CC<00:04:18.310> can<00:04:18.519> miss<00:04:18.700> that<00:04:18.880> first<00:04:19.090> part<00:04:19.269> of

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
inch CC can miss that first part of

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.880 
inch CC can miss that first part of
range<00:04:19.540> and<00:04:19.780> then<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:20.350> you<00:04:20.440> can<00:04:20.560> miss<00:04:20.739> the

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
range and then and you can miss the

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.260 
range and then and you can miss the
second<00:04:21.190> part<00:04:21.370> as<00:04:21.430> well<00:04:21.579> so<00:04:21.700> you'll<00:04:21.880> push<00:04:22.120> from

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
second part as well so you'll push from

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.580 
second part as well so you'll push from
there<00:04:22.420> way<00:04:22.600> where<00:04:22.900> most<00:04:23.170> people<00:04:23.290> are<00:04:23.560> very

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
there way where most people are very

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.520 
there way where most people are very
strong<00:04:23.950> and<00:04:24.130> then<00:04:24.610> lock<00:04:25.000> through<00:04:25.270> so<00:04:26.020> this

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
strong and then lock through so this

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.430 
strong and then lock through so this
sort<00:04:26.770> of<00:04:26.860> 30<00:04:27.370> degrees<00:04:27.910> in<00:04:28.450> here<00:04:28.750> it<00:04:28.900> just<00:04:29.140> just

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
sort of 30 degrees in here it just just

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.590 
sort of 30 degrees in here it just just
literally<00:04:30.010> gets<00:04:30.220> gets<00:04:30.580> missed<00:04:30.820> so<00:04:31.330> we've<00:04:31.450> got

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
literally gets gets missed so we've got

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.640 
literally gets gets missed so we've got
Bill<00:04:32.020> it<00:04:32.140> guys

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
Bill it guys

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.540 
Bill it guys
so<00:04:32.890> I'm<00:04:33.280> VMAs<00:04:34.060> so<00:04:34.419> squeezing<00:04:35.020> this<00:04:35.110> ball

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
so I'm VMAs so squeezing this ball

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.890 
so I'm VMAs so squeezing this ball
activating<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:36.669> and<00:04:37.000> we're<00:04:37.570> just<00:04:37.660> going<00:04:37.810> to

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
activating and and we're just going to

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.170 
activating and and we're just going to
go<00:04:38.020> down<00:04:38.230> to<00:04:38.380> 35<00:04:38.800> degrees<00:04:39.130> so<00:04:41.220> it's<00:04:42.220> good<00:04:42.520> so

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
go down to 35 degrees so it's good so

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.000 
go down to 35 degrees so it's good so
squeeze<00:04:43.480> squeeze<00:04:43.600> squeeze<00:04:43.750> and<00:04:44.169> then<00:04:44.650> slowly

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
squeeze squeeze squeeze and then slowly

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.220 
squeeze squeeze squeeze and then slowly
back<00:04:45.990> so<00:04:46.990> keep<00:04:47.440> squeezing<00:04:48.720> it's<00:04:49.720> really<00:04:50.020> good

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
back so keep squeezing it's really good

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.140 
back so keep squeezing it's really good
and<00:04:50.380> sometimes<00:04:51.040> I'll<00:04:51.190> get<00:04:51.310> you<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.610> even<00:04:51.760> put

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
and sometimes I'll get you to even put

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.880 
and sometimes I'll get you to even put
your<00:04:52.270> finger<00:04:52.600> there<00:04:52.780> so<00:04:53.020> at<00:04:53.290> home<00:04:53.470> you<00:04:53.650> can<00:04:53.800> do

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
your finger there so at home you can do

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.710 
your finger there so at home you can do
that<00:04:54.040> so<00:04:54.400> this<00:04:54.669> is<00:04:54.820> the<00:04:54.910> hard<00:04:55.120> bit<00:04:55.180> guys<00:04:55.510> so

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
that so this is the hard bit guys so

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.140 
that so this is the hard bit guys so
squeeze<00:04:56.080> here<00:04:56.380> and<00:04:56.620> keep<00:04:56.950> working<00:04:57.280> there<00:04:57.880> and

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
squeeze here and keep working there and

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.909 
squeeze here and keep working there and
that's<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:58.840> functional<00:04:59.260> bit<00:04:59.410> for<00:04:59.560> running<00:04:59.800> as

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
that's the functional bit for running as

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.700 
that's the functional bit for running as
you<00:05:00.160> land<00:05:00.580> and<00:05:01.090> and<00:05:01.870> then<00:05:02.050> you<00:05:02.200> will<00:05:02.410> attenuate

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
you land and and then you will attenuate

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.260 
you land and and then you will attenuate
force<00:05:03.160> you<00:05:03.280> will<00:05:03.370> sink<00:05:03.640> just<00:05:03.820> a<00:05:03.940> little<00:05:04.180> bit

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
force you will sink just a little bit

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.850 
force you will sink just a little bit
you<00:05:04.360> don't<00:05:04.390> want<00:05:04.570> to<00:05:04.720> sink<00:05:04.870> too<00:05:05.020> much<00:05:05.229> and<00:05:05.470> then

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
you don't want to sink too much and then

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.370 
you don't want to sink too much and then
keep<00:05:06.220> it<00:05:06.400> working<00:05:06.760> on<00:05:06.940> the<00:05:07.060> way<00:05:07.180> back<00:05:07.479> so<00:05:08.080> three

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
keep it working on the way back so three

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.409 
keep it working on the way back so three
lots<00:05:08.590> of<00:05:08.710> ten<00:05:08.950> of<00:05:08.979> those<00:05:09.280> and<00:05:09.850> think<00:05:10.210> about

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
lots of ten of those and think about

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.090 
lots of ten of those and think about
filling<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:11.050> gap<00:05:11.229> filling<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.740> gap<00:05:11.890> it's

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
filling the gap filling the gap it's

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.590 
filling the gap filling the gap it's
that<00:05:12.280> first<00:05:12.550> thirty<00:05:12.880> degrees<00:05:13.210> that's<00:05:13.450> the

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
that first thirty degrees that's the

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.510 
that first thirty degrees that's the
most<00:05:13.840> important<00:05:14.470> and<00:05:14.800> most<00:05:14.919> runners<00:05:15.220> like

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
most important and most runners like

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.320 
most important and most runners like
then<00:05:16.229> you<00:05:17.229> can<00:05:17.380> progress<00:05:17.740> from<00:05:18.280> there<00:05:18.520> to

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
then you can progress from there to

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.670 
then you can progress from there to
starting<00:05:19.660> to<00:05:19.810> look<00:05:19.990> at<00:05:20.140> your<00:05:20.290> single<00:05:20.590> leg

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
starting to look at your single leg

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.990 
starting to look at your single leg
stuff<00:05:21.540> and<00:05:22.540> and<00:05:23.169> very<00:05:23.500> commonly<00:05:24.160> will<00:05:24.460> get<00:05:24.640> you

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
stuff and and very commonly will get you

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.659 
stuff and and very commonly will get you
to<00:05:25.210> do<00:05:25.479> this<00:05:25.750> type<00:05:26.020> of<00:05:26.050> thing<00:05:26.200> as<00:05:26.590> as<00:05:27.340> like<00:05:27.610> a

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
to do this type of thing as as like a

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.700 
to do this type of thing as as like a
warm-up<00:05:28.330> so<00:05:28.690> so<00:05:29.110> again<00:05:30.300> getting<00:05:31.350> vmi<00:05:32.350> active

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
warm-up so so again getting vmi active

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.800 
warm-up so so again getting vmi active
so<00:05:32.860> tightening<00:05:33.430> tighten<00:05:34.210> and<00:05:34.300> glute<00:05:34.479> as<00:05:34.630> well

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
so tightening tighten and glute as well

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.469 
so tightening tighten and glute as well
and<00:05:35.250> then<00:05:36.250> away<00:05:36.580> we<00:05:36.729> go<00:05:36.910> we're<00:05:37.150> just<00:05:37.300> going<00:05:37.419> to

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
and then away we go we're just going to

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.010 
and then away we go we're just going to
be<00:05:37.540> 30<00:05:37.930> degrees<00:05:38.410> 35<00:05:38.950> degrees<00:05:39.280> and<00:05:40.020> then

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
be 30 degrees 35 degrees and then

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.260 
be 30 degrees 35 degrees and then
control<00:05:41.410> back<00:05:41.590> so<00:05:41.770> this<00:05:41.890> is<00:05:41.950> is<00:05:42.310> a<00:05:42.669> really<00:05:42.910> good

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
control back so this is is a really good

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.610 
control back so this is is a really good
one<00:05:43.390> because<00:05:43.660> you<00:05:43.780> can<00:05:43.900> actually<00:05:44.020> see<00:05:44.410> what

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
one because you can actually see what

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.620 
one because you can actually see what
your<00:05:44.740> balance<00:05:44.890> is<00:05:45.160> like<00:05:45.430> and<00:05:45.700> very<00:05:46.150> commonly

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
your balance is like and very commonly

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.600 
your balance is like and very commonly
if<00:05:46.780> you<00:05:46.900> core<00:05:47.140> strength<00:05:47.470> is<00:05:47.590> down<00:05:47.830> it<00:05:48.010> quad

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
if you core strength is down it quad

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.219 
if you core strength is down it quad
strength<00:05:48.880> is<00:05:49.000> down<00:05:49.210> your<00:05:49.660> balance<00:05:49.960> won't<00:05:50.110> be

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
strength is down your balance won't be

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.490 
strength is down your balance won't be
so<00:05:50.380> crash<00:05:50.590> hot<00:05:51.150> and<00:05:52.150> then<00:05:52.510> so<00:05:52.750> tighten<00:05:53.260> from

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
so crash hot and then so tighten from

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.340 
so crash hot and then so tighten from
here<00:05:53.710> and<00:05:54.010> then<00:05:54.700> keep<00:05:55.210> it<00:05:55.419> tight<00:05:55.690> as<00:05:55.930> you<00:05:56.140> lower

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
here and then keep it tight as you lower

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.990 
here and then keep it tight as you lower
down<00:05:56.410> that<00:05:56.890> is<00:05:57.160> the<00:05:57.190> hardest<00:05:57.580> bit<00:05:57.760> that

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
down that is the hardest bit that

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.420 
down that is the hardest bit that
eccentric<00:05:58.919> contraction<00:05:59.919> through<00:06:00.040> the<00:06:00.190> quads

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
eccentric contraction through the quads

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.659 
eccentric contraction through the quads
and<00:06:00.669> then<00:06:01.270> slowly<00:06:01.660> back<00:06:02.050> up<00:06:02.220> working<00:06:03.220> working

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
and then slowly back up working working

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.120
