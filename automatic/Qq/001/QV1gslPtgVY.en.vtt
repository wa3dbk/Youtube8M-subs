00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.160
 and we find ourselves then what is 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.780
 has been around for about 24 hours 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.250
 about 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.859
 so I lost the last three 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.020
 bits of video 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.609
 clearly they have not been registered 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.810
 audio side so I preferred them 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.730
 wanted rather than was 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.500
 so it needs to move forward I am 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.750
 when it is not badly sorted I have a lot of 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.309
 beautiful pictures of a bee rather 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.380
 interesting about the most interesting 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.989
 now I have to wait for her 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.120
 produce me 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.640
 some systems we will see next year 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.870
 episode 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.960
 so that's just to show you 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.950
 before the next episode at pizza 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.379
 which is going to attack extra bet we will 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.539
 get rid of all our drones because 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:03.090
 clearly changed day day 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:08.010
 day there but there is the teuf and I 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.060
 have there finally these big bazaar people and in 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.869
 each of his chests 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.549
 and if not the shaga bees that will celebrate 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.479
 its 24 years old agen 4 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.830
 a little bit and sensors but who 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:27.130
 did not reach 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:39.760
 at night strongly in Paris if they are not 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:42.400
 set the stravinsky bees with here 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.530
 a very good one with on board 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.560
 weapons too I'm starting to better 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.340
 organize when I make crosses 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.729
 specific 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:56.110
 no I think it gave me that and 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.440
 then that's all when you have 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.220
 may have seen it at my house I have not 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:07.780
 little speed but the ch is mounted a 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:11.040
 con it's also know you do not eat 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.420
 very far from the champion I will look at cash 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.740
 it'll make myself down during 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.330
 kind the shape of a little game can 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:27.880
 load much further without problem 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:29.290
 it's not bad but not too much so 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.410
 in the next episode 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.140
 we are attacked as extra but 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:41.230
 so maybe we'll do a little bit 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:44.050
 graft so maybe that's why I 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.160
 begins to close a little helpless and 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.600
 carrots 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.290
 finally 40 in the quieter forms 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.519
 add 26 specific colors 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.709
 here it is finished bistuÃ© not have fun 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.209
 finally in the carrots by hand I get 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.050
 am doing a little program that goes into 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:03.100
 self 47 of potatoes plus carrots 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.310
 that's ten times the carrots 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.200
 will form ten times the carrots this is 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:14.440
 program all that 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:19.900
 next time yeah finally here's what 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:22.000
 so I put my video at once 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.769
 an honor says I should have split it into 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.630
 two ways it would arrange me 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.959
 did not necessarily tell very things 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.989
 interesting distance of eight special 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.230
 the same happens to see where I had 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:42.040
 is that I had done my tutorial on a 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.420
 game the delay of this is the case if I 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.620
 do not have earlier on the same hat map 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.250
 that I saw that I can not charge of 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:53.110
 new maps my creative nickname that does not 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:56.560
 not walk so tutoring on a change 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.970
 automatic and that's it so I hope 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.880
 you spent this episode 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.290
 from the next then I would be 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.849
 stayed tight many comments 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.040
 as it goes I try to take in 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.740
 count the comments here that I know 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.020
 that there is 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:14.130
 a lot of my subscribers who follow me 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:17.390
 for the cadence the videos and precisely 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:21.060
 see the case in this game 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.100
 I would like to continue to a video 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.550
 by day one episode a day it suits me 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.190
 very well 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.110
 an episode where a tutorial never both in 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.760
 same time videos a day it would 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.240
 well annoyed I put videos 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.530
 two 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.259
 I have an episode one hour and his mom 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.539
 and also as a bit too long 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:42.169
 so that's trying to reduce the time 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.909
 videos that 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.189
 the world can follow because it's 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:49.159
 not necessarily obvious to follow but I 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:50.710
 will try at the same time to put 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.360
 as much content of their mount to 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:58.039
 passage who are going to be four 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.960
 twenty little bit like it was worth kraft 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.180
 and where his kraft preparation and all that I 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.099
 will really get access to organize myself and to 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.430
 it would be really nice to get to 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:11.210
 something more the more effective 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.439
 and more compact is a little bit the 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.740
 word whore 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:20.300
 so here I am going to try a new 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:23.509
 method a little bit next episode 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.909
 we will see well and my faith of a hunt 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:28.370
 know very well that my name tell me we 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:30.830
 know they think it is thus seen 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.990
 that's all I hope you have 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.770
 appreciated and I tell you next time 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.770
 Hi
