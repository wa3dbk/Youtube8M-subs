00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 hi everyone I'm about 969 and I bring you my second creepy pasta invented 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.219
 for me I know it did not work out very well but what are we going to do xd 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:11.559
 before starting 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.619
 I'm going to get an assistant to read the creepy pastas xd 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.329
 well now, let's start 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.539
 the damn playstation 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.220
 When I was little I always wanted a play station but they never bought it for me 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.019
 since my family did not have the money since we were very poor but now 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.820
 I am 20 years old I live alone and I had the money to buy it but no longer 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.770
 they sold it 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.090
 when I went in search of one against a garage store that was in a 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.990
 very abandoned place but I did not care because I just wanted a play station 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.940
 When I arrived I was attended by an old man of about 56 years old. 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.280
 I asked if he had a play station he said yes with a smile on the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.540
 Cara told me to wait in the same place of state 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.100
 it took like 30 minutes and I was already bored to wait and I was going to go 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.660
 When I was about to leave, the old man appeared 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.270
 I sold it at a lower price than what I had in my possession 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.840
 without hesitation even a second 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.000
 since now I would have a benefit after so many years 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.930
 but when I arrived at my house he forgot to buy some game 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.250
 but I decided to investigate the console 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.960
 I had a CD inside 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.230
 it did not have a name it was just a white CD 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.380
 I decided to see what kind of game was 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.730
 when I saw it was a game that the weight without any instrumented was just a 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.860
 black background and option said white crime 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.130
 the curiosity of watching movies I put the option 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.040
 but I got a message saying you're risking your life 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.290
 I was already scared because I only had the option to risk in my 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.090
 lifetime 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.200
 I turned off the console but I remembered that a friend called genial 4 on 'youtube' 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.230
 I had a very old benefit I was running like crazy I took a bus 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.620
 he broadcasts to his house there he was making his next video 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.500
 I told him I had a playstation game and if I could try on his 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.609
 Play Station 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.139
 he told me yes 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.420
 when we put it on I was surprised it was the solid metal gear 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:19.869
 I stayed silent 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:24.149
 he told me that it happened to me I told him that when I put it on my playstation I 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:26.529
 I said I was risking my life 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:28.289
 he was surprised 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:29.749
 we went to my house 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:34.019
 and my console was on but it said that we insert a CD 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.179
 when we put it on I got the metal gear solid 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:38.979
 he got angry and left 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:44.519
 I kinda strange rebooted the console there I appeared said the bank 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.269
 I put and I came out you're risking your life 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.290
 and it would be the option arbitrate in my life the curiosity absorbed me more and more 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.299
 and the ejido was a game that was in a language that I never saw but only had 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.119
 an option to choose the one chosen and the screen turned black 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:07.249
 after how 40 seconds the screen started to show the scenario 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:12.849
 I was there tied up in a chair I had my hair clothes everything I had 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.329
 at that moment 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.449
 then the character tried to get out but could not 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.019
 I could not resist it anymore and I wanted to turn off the console 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:24.179
 I could not move 

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:27.499
 it's like I was tied to that same chair I could not move 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.419
 then on the screen I started listening to steps 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.659
 I tried everything possible to move but there was no case 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.189
 the steps were getting closer and closer 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.469
 I already desperate tried to move the control analog but the character 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:45.709
 he was not moving I was like fainting 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.599
 Then a man appeared with his face disfigured and with a drill after 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.869
 my house I lived the same man with a rancher the alive thing was something that no longer 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:59.649
 I could stand the drill close to my head 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:03.869
 when I saw on my screen that I was already approaching the drill, I woke up 

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:07.529
 work and with a lot of fright it was already 1:30 in the afternoon 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.609
 and all over my house if I had any loan money I went to the house of great 4 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:18.169
 to see what happened he told me hello as if the anger was gone 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.550
 I told him if he had any other station he told me yes but he sold it ago 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.789
 a year ago 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.219
 me with listening to that mecalux 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:31.759
 I was at home to remove all those memories of that nightmare and 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.590
 I was afraid to sleep alone in my house 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.680
 jajajajajaja xdd 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.319
