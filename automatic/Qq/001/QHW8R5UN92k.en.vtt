00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:29.260
 in the primary stage is recognition 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.330
 of the master where after weaning they are 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.590
 in a house they know the noises the house and 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.020
 to the members of the family 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.850
 from there they pass to this stage that is between 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.830
 three and six months where they come to 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.670
 Here socialize dogs must 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.839
 learn to live with other dogs 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.179
 their main sense is smell 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.859
 we who are visual have to 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:54.159
 accustom a little dog 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:56.460
 develop more your sense of sight 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:01:00.719
 towards us so that communication 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.719
 primordial among us be visual 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.000
 after that we went to the social circle 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.430
 where the family goes by family 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.470
 they get used to being touched by another 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.650
 kind of people with another tone of voice 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.450
 other ages and so on until 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.720
 they reach their master and again with much 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.910
 Honey, congratulations again, we went to 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.830
 what is the recognition to the master where 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.990
 we divided two groups the coaches 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.030
 they stop the dogs the masters come 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.010
 on the other side of the field and each of 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.960
 they start calling their puppies and 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.220
 the puppies learn to go recognizing 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.590
 the voice and the smell of each one of their masters 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.960
 after this the circuit of 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.150
 agility where in this stage is where 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.550
 its character is in formation then 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.890
 the fact that they go through a tunnel or 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.800
 go up a seesaw or a catwalk 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.450
 gives them the security that must have 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.400
 within the formation of your character 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.230
 for when they are great can you 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.060
 accompany you anywhere 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.490
 have confidence and if you tell me that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.260
 subo psuv or if you tell me that over here 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.920
 around here and that way the dog will 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.920
 unwinds perfectly 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.350
 to
