00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
pattern is concerned and the reason i

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.550 
pattern is concerned and the reason i
went<00:03:36.840> with<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.049> XL<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:37.799> because<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:39.560> next

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
went with the XL is because of the next

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.140 
went with the XL is because of the next
hour<00:03:40.680> heavy<00:03:41.010> whatever<00:03:41.310> they<00:03:41.459> want<00:03:41.670> refer<00:03:41.970> to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
it as is because of the thickness and

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.850

me a while to get used to this mouse pad

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.460 
me a while to get used to this mouse pad
because<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.419> know<00:04:24.539> it's<00:04:24.690> more<00:04:25.080> of<00:04:25.169> a<00:04:25.229> coffee

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
because you know it's more of a coffee

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.909 
because you know it's more of a coffee
material<00:04:26.130> and<00:04:26.250> shit<00:04:26.430> but<00:04:26.990> uh<00:04:27.990> be<00:04:28.470> quite<00:04:28.680> honest

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
material and shit but uh be quite honest

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.439 
material and shit but uh be quite honest
actually<00:04:29.190> got<00:04:29.310> used<00:04:29.490> to<00:04:29.610> it<00:04:29.639> pretty<00:04:29.910> quickly

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
actually got used to it pretty quickly

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.790 
actually got used to it pretty quickly
and<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:33.870> know<00:04:33.990> actually<00:04:34.139> went<00:04:34.470> back<00:04:34.650> to

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
and you know actually went back to

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.060 
and you know actually went back to
playing<00:04:34.919> with<00:04:35.160> this<00:04:35.460> one<00:04:36.380> to<00:04:37.380> see<00:04:37.590> which<00:04:37.800> one<00:04:37.979> I

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
playing with this one to see which one I

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.240 
playing with this one to see which one I
prefer<00:04:38.250> and<00:04:39.060> why<00:04:39.960> I<00:04:39.990> like<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.500> smoothness<00:04:41.039> of

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
prefer and why I like the smoothness of

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.120 
prefer and why I like the smoothness of
this<00:04:41.699> one<00:04:41.970> I<00:04:42.770> actually<00:04:43.770> have<00:04:44.130> better<00:04:44.550> control

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
this one I actually have better control

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.420 
this one I actually have better control
movement<00:04:47.130> wise<00:04:47.360> with<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.570> cloth<00:04:48.900> one<00:04:49.430> which

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
movement wise with the cloth one which

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.439 
movement wise with the cloth one which
is<00:04:50.460> kind<00:04:50.759> of<00:04:50.820> weird<00:04:51.000> if<00:04:51.180> you<00:04:51.210> would<00:04:51.360> actually

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
is kind of weird if you would actually

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.379 
is kind of weird if you would actually
think<00:04:51.750> it'd<00:04:51.840> be<00:04:51.990> more<00:04:52.199> with<00:04:52.410> the<00:04:52.560> one<00:04:52.770> that's

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
think it'd be more with the one that's

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.010 
think it'd be more with the one that's
more<00:04:54.389> of<00:04:54.509> a<00:04:54.630> slicker<00:04:55.110> ice<00:04:55.229> surface<00:04:56.870> so<00:04:57.870> yeah

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
more of a slicker ice surface so yeah

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.230 
more of a slicker ice surface so yeah
that's<00:04:58.259> pretty<00:04:58.590> much<00:04:59.280> it<00:04:59.340> in<00:04:59.550> a<00:04:59.729> nutshell<00:04:59.910> I

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
that's pretty much it in a nutshell I

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.270 
that's pretty much it in a nutshell I
mean<00:05:00.479> that's<00:05:00.570> you<00:05:01.080> know<00:05:01.199> kind<00:05:01.560> of<00:05:01.620> my<00:05:01.770> look<00:05:02.070> my

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280

like<00:05:09.900> on<00:05:10.050> that<00:05:10.199> literally<00:05:10.860> on<00:05:11.099> the<00:05:11.190> end<00:05:11.370> of<00:05:11.490> the

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
like on that literally on the end of the

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.360 
like on that literally on the end of the
day<00:05:11.789> I'm<00:05:11.849> desk<00:05:12.180> so<00:05:13.139> that's<00:05:13.800> why<00:05:13.979> I<00:05:14.039> want<00:05:14.250> to

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
day I'm desk so that's why I want to

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.969 
day I'm desk so that's why I want to
thick<00:05:14.639> one<00:05:14.880> and<00:05:15.060> not<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.330> thin<00:05:15.750> one<00:05:15.979> even

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
thick one and not the thin one even

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:18.469 
thick one and not the thin one even
though<00:05:17.070> the<00:05:17.160> thin<00:05:17.400> one<00:05:17.580> circumference<00:05:18.180> wise

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
though the thin one circumference wise

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.589 
though the thin one circumference wise
would<00:05:19.110> have<00:05:19.229> been<00:05:19.380> fine<00:05:19.740> because<00:05:20.509> you<00:05:21.509> know

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
would have been fine because you know

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.149 
would have been fine because you know
the<00:05:21.720> spacing<00:05:22.139> that<00:05:22.169> this<00:05:22.470> uses<00:05:22.919> it's

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
the spacing that this uses it's

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.960 
the spacing that this uses it's
perfectly<00:05:23.610> fine<00:05:23.909> for<00:05:23.970> me<00:05:24.389> as<00:05:24.510> well<00:05:25.610> but<00:05:26.610> you

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970
