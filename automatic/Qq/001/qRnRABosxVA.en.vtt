is in Whiterun very good to go to

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.879

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889

five and actually this is a I don't know
I'm<00:03:28.290> saying<00:03:28.500> anyway<00:03:28.889> the<00:03:29.010> Imperial<00:03:29.400> guilt<00:03:29.579> is

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
I'm saying anyway the Imperial guilt is

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.759 
I'm saying anyway the Imperial guilt is
also<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.180> good<00:03:30.359> one<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.840> also<00:03:31.260> Stormcloak

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
which i'm going to show you here in a

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.129 
which i'm going to show you here in a
second<00:03:32.970> but<00:03:33.150> they're<00:03:33.299> pretty<00:03:33.510> much<00:03:33.540> both<00:03:33.810> part

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
second but they're pretty much both part

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.620 
second but they're pretty much both part
of<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.260> main<00:03:34.440> questline<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:36.000> you'll<00:03:36.269> find

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
of the main questline so you'll find

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.750 
of the main questline so you'll find
them<00:03:36.870> eventually<00:03:37.019> on<00:03:37.650> your<00:03:37.799> way<00:03:37.950> but<00:03:38.579> you<00:03:38.639> can

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
them eventually on your way but you can

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.340 
them eventually on your way but you can
only<00:03:38.819> choose<00:03:38.970> one<00:03:39.120> which<00:03:39.720> sucks<00:03:39.989> but<00:03:40.200> they're

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
only choose one which sucks but they're

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.580 
only choose one which sucks but they're
both<00:03:40.440> really<00:03:40.709> good<00:03:40.799> for<00:03:41.280> fighting<00:03:41.970> and

both really good for fighting and

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.199 
both really good for fighting and
another<00:03:43.590> tip<00:03:43.829> is<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.100> use<00:03:44.639> heavy<00:03:44.850> armor

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
another tip is to use heavy armor

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.210 
another tip is to use heavy armor

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
good to damage their health at first and

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.420 
good to damage their health at first and
use<00:03:50.819> power<00:03:51.000> tax<00:03:51.359> a<00:03:51.540> lot<00:03:52.160> anyway<00:03:53.160> that's<00:03:53.340> it
