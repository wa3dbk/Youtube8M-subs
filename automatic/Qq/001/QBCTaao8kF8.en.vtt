00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.220
 good guys I'm here to give you a tip 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.860
 is how to remove the original sound from the 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.219
 agile is maybe all most 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:17.359
 chevrolet cars is this sound 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:20.630
 the tip is 14 holes here you can 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:23.300
 to notice the mental holes 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.320
 these holes are what give access to this 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.539
 comes here so the idea is if you do not 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.699
 You have the key to take that sound off. 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.640
 put a bell key like this 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.900
 every year fabiano fininho and push 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.210
 this guy here 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.200
 be careful not to knead home but 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.120
 no problem 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.500
 Then just call me back, but 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.170
 I think it's going to come in here. 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:51.309
 You'll have to work it loose. 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:53.570
 this lock in this direction here do this 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.280
 if you do not have the four cars and 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.489
 This can do one at a time. 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.410
 then no mercy on the saints I make 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:07.039
 this exercise can add water that 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.939
 the tendency is to drop and pull a 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:13.909
 bit the sound of the team car 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:17.119
 the connector but low light here but gives 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.189
 to see a connector behind it 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.479
 because the other part it is docked 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.490
 in there 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.829
 If you need to take out the drawer you have a 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.549
 screw on the bottom is just drop it and 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:30.319
 pull does not have is not how there is as you see 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.420
 this conventional stereo system to 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:34.490
 single person the mass to benito does not have 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.549
 It is nothing but still only loosening the screw and 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.349
 pull drawer 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.170
 personnel after connecting the radio to the 

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:44.779
 Come back, it's good, I've only come to stay. 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.939
 A little apprehensive but he does not care 

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:50.569
 after just fit or take 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.639
 It will happen 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:56.930
 turn on the ignition 

00:01:52.639 --> 00:02:00.290
 Can you turn on the radio? 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.920
 good after powered up you will put the 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:09.289
 your code and there it is with the keys 1 2 3 and 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:12.920
 4 is varying here is and after 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.140
 put the code you will tighten the 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.520
 keys looking station 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.520
 I'll put it in the code here 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.110
 I'll show you why, if you do not come later. 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:34.560
 snake in shock it will sell work 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:40.650
 and after the code is already working 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:43.670
 and after your show works even without 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.670
 the ignition is on
