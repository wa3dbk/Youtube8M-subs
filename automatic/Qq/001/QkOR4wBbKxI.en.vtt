down<00:00:56.640> words<00:00:58.550> for<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.609> node<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.879> can<00:00:59.910> do

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
down words for the node you can do

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.760 
down words for the node you can do
different<00:01:00.210> styles<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.660> nose<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:01.559> for<00:01:01.710> the

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
ear like this inside the yeah do a cave

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.030 
ear like this inside the yeah do a cave
line<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:17.090> they'll<00:02:17.750> line<00:02:17.990> down<00:02:18.290> was<00:02:18.500> following

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
line and they'll line down was following

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.770 
line and they'll line down was following
the<00:02:19.190> curve<00:02:19.340> or<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.610> outside<00:02:19.760> line<00:02:20.090> it's<00:02:20.600> kind

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
the curve or the outside line it's kind

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.440 
the curve or the outside line it's kind
of<00:02:20.900> like<00:02:20.960> a<00:02:21.320> sort<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.710> tea<00:02:21.980> after<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.060> hairline

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
of like a sort of tea after the hairline

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.390 
of like a sort of tea after the hairline
so<00:02:24.020> people<00:02:24.320> do<00:02:24.440> this<00:02:24.560> look<00:02:24.800> differently<00:02:25.100> but

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
so people do this look differently but

if you want to do this we can start
drawing<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:29.180> few<00:02:30.080> like<00:02:30.290> spikes<00:02:31.100> in<00:02:31.370> words<00:02:32.140> until

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
drawing a few like spikes in words until
