going<00:02:22.500> through<00:02:22.590> high<00:02:22.890> school<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.810> started

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
going through high school I started

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.780 
going through high school I started
learning<00:02:24.900> about<00:02:25.140> intonation<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:26.370> actually

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
learning about intonation and actually

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.340 
learning about intonation and actually
maybe<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.120> middle<00:02:27.360> school<00:02:27.600> but<00:02:27.810> high<00:02:27.990> school<00:02:28.290> I

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.100 
maybe in middle school but high school I
started<00:02:28.380> really<00:02:28.950> getting<00:02:28.980> into<00:02:29.459> it

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
started really getting into it

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.840 
started really getting into it
intonation<00:02:31.110> flat<00:02:31.830> sharp<00:02:32.220> you're<00:02:32.610> playing

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
intonation flat sharp you're playing

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.460 
intonation flat sharp you're playing
with<00:02:33.000> other<00:02:33.150> people<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.780> have<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:34.110> kind<00:02:34.320> of<00:02:34.350> be

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
with other people you have to kind of be

with other people you have to kind of be
aware<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.770> I<00:02:35.280> could<00:02:36.090> not<00:02:36.270> I<00:02:36.450> couldn't<00:02:36.780> hear

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
aware that I could not I couldn't hear

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:37.820 
aware that I could not I couldn't hear
it<00:02:37.020> at<00:02:37.260> times

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
it at times

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.830 
it at times

you know I couldn't I could a lot of
times<00:02:46.950> by<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.400> point<00:02:47.640> he<00:02:48.030> or<00:02:48.090> something<00:02:48.630> was

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
times by that point he or something was

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.259 
times by that point he or something was
wrong<00:02:49.019> it<00:02:49.290> doesn't<00:02:49.470> sound<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:49.890> great<00:02:50.190> but<00:02:51.060> I

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
wrong it doesn't sound that great but I

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.620 
wrong it doesn't sound that great but I
didn't<00:02:51.630> know<00:02:51.720> if<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:51.930> was<00:02:52.110> me<00:02:52.440> or<00:02:52.860> them<00:02:53.850> or<00:02:54.239> if<00:02:54.480> I

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
didn't know if it was me or them or if I

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.930 
didn't know if it was me or them or if I
was<00:02:54.870> lower<00:02:55.140> or<00:02:55.650> they<00:02:55.860> were<00:02:56.070> lower<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.610> just<00:02:56.820> knew

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
was lower or they were lower I just knew

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.420 
was lower or they were lower I just knew
there<00:02:57.090> was<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.269> problem<00:02:57.420> so<00:02:57.900> if<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.650> can't<00:02:59.070> tell

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
there was a problem so if you can't tell

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.090 
there was a problem so if you can't tell
where<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.239> problem<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.780> what<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.500> suggest<00:03:02.010> you

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
where the problem is what I suggest you

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.350 
where the problem is what I suggest you
do<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.340> this<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:02.519> what<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:02.670> did<00:03:02.850> in<00:03:02.940> high<00:03:03.090> school

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
do and this is what I did in high school

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.400 
do and this is what I did in high school
is<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.260> would<00:03:04.410> adjust<00:03:04.709> my<00:03:04.920> embouchure<00:03:05.930> okay<00:03:06.930> so

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
is I would adjust my embouchure okay so

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.780 
is I would adjust my embouchure okay so
I<00:03:07.620> would<00:03:07.890> get<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.070> little<00:03:08.340> bit<00:03:08.700> looser<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:10.790> and

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
I would get a little bit looser and and

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.180 
I would get a little bit looser and and
then<00:03:12.060> think<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:13.079> problem<00:03:13.350> getting<00:03:13.890> worse

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
then think is the problem getting worse

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.080 
then think is the problem getting worse
or<00:03:14.760> better<00:03:15.560> okay<00:03:16.560> if<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.489> get<00:03:17.549> a<00:03:17.730> little<00:03:17.880> bit

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
or better okay if I get a little bit

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.970 
or better okay if I get a little bit
looser<00:03:18.390> with<00:03:18.540> my<00:03:18.690> embouchure<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.530> the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
looser with my embouchure and the

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.310 
looser with my embouchure and the
problem<00:03:20.489> gets<00:03:20.900> sounds<00:03:21.900> like<00:03:22.019> it's<00:03:22.170> getting

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
problem gets sounds like it's getting

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.860 
problem gets sounds like it's getting
better<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:22.950> means<00:03:23.160> I'm<00:03:23.400> sharp<00:03:23.760> compared<00:03:24.720> to

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
better that means I'm sharp compared to

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.350 
better that means I'm sharp compared to
the<00:03:24.959> other<00:03:25.140> person<00:03:25.769> I'm<00:03:26.370> not<00:03:26.640> sharp<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.180> Jeff

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
the other person I'm not sharp and Jeff

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.850 
the other person I'm not sharp and Jeff
I<00:03:27.480> might<00:03:27.660> be<00:03:27.780> perfect<00:03:28.290> but<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.530> other<00:03:28.680> person

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
I might be perfect but the other person

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.190 
I might be perfect but the other person
might<00:03:29.130> be<00:03:29.310> flat<00:03:29.640> but<00:03:32.660> through<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:33.720> adjust

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
might be flat but through that adjust

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.430 
might be flat but through that adjust
sometimes<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.739> would<00:03:34.890> tight<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.310> know
