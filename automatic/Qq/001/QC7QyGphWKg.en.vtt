00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.099
 And in October, it's the talk of God. 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.330
 bringing you the video of 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.420
 friday 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.830
 the gcs né video of friday 11 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.840
 now they clap their hands so much and 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.210
 video of today and now I'll tell you the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.510
 subject as the Brazilian in general 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.660
 enough to say agrinho is all name 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.719
 gringo is trash gringo does not know nor 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.149
 to play gringo on cbot 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.980
 trainee combat 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.649
 If I'm there you get the triple 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.460
 nuclear by gringo the rule 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.320
 lingus catches too stupid people that I 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.480
 I went there and played as you should. 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.250
 know how to read in the xbox that background match 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.050
 in a match against the team 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.480
 I was with a friend that I made in 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.309
 gringa and I'll have a few moments of them 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.190
 shalom who just spent the afternoon a 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.750
 I do not know what his name is but even 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.909
 so the chair of 3 70 fpm of r 650 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.380
 it has about 40 nuclear and 1 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.260
 100 brutal 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.259
 It's more or less so if I'm not mistaken. 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.210
 and and it was something like that he plays 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.740
 he asks in quiet clear he's just 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.770
 merge by asking themselves which 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.170
 is the majority of Greeks play this way in 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.490
 Overall they really do not literally 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.500
 They call the single chain for these things. 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.299
 if they take one with scores with the art 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.570
 With my god I lost but it's not that 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.600
 neither I the ninja example is a motherfucker 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.340
 Your shit was champion. 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.659
 fuck the fuck will take in your 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.350
 ridge once but gained so now 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.470
 has its exceptions also known as 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.479
 jay fashion because in this it is the face that 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.360
 I know I'll never go straight to the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.890
 worst film is already possible if it is 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.250
 possible to give preference if not 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.219
 but this is from there it was a match 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.310
 that I did and also through the title I 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.320
 I stayed here 2827 kills 0 bar and lost 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.280
 clear for a simple reason 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.710
 everyone had leaked from the room and there 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.990
 enter the question, everything, just do not 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.980
 rule gringo picks up and not the gringo rule 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.530
 the watering 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.610
 Yes, nobody likes to die a game at 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.290
 The only difference is that most of the 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.730
 gringos not fucking pre-school 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.550
 these things why he does not leave 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.270
 because there is such a price a lot more 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.010
 cheap 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.540
 people have a much easier time of 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.910
 buy the games and buy those 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.530
 little children and their children so that 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.110
 roll parents 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.550
 but who those people who buy 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.050
 to play with body mind that not even here 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.880
 In Brazil, only in Brazil, people. 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.590
 who are in a position to buy a video game 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.910
 generally or only able to buy 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.350
 the type code only the codices annually 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.180
 or end up buying other games but 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.280
 usually those who play code bought a 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.950
 sound code will really focus on what 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.040
 they will only play that and if you only make one 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.110
 You have to be good at something. 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.390
 because if you are good at something if you had 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.090
 training and experience no one knows 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.470
 of everything then a person playing code 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.960
 three years ago and if it's better than one 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.550
 person who is already playing a month 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.440
 explained joão in the month she started to play 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.110
 for longer without playing for three years 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.970
 she's going to be better than she was 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.020
 Formerly because if you stay 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.150
 since a long time you will 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.280
 improve that and the gringos they will 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:33.240
 practically do not want to improve 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:34.020
 they casually play and would not 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.500
 speak 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.000
 The then I'll take arrived at a nuclear 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.260
 They can have with your art and I think 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.570
 never again a nuclear issue with luck 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.530
 because I'm just clear that I've lost 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.120
 with his art 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.740
 I do not know if I'll bet another 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.650
 clearfield luck on the channel 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.590
 I have to have I lost 20 and 70 or 28 or 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:04:00.020
 29 bruno scope type was half naked 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:03.030
 a father killed but said literally 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.010
 gringo uses practically random weapon 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.480
 only one thing is that the guys you 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.590
 speak Greek does not know how to play 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.940
 the gringo does not annoy the gremista freak 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.380
 so damn 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.240
 when I started playing there is a pineapple 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.280
 where's the shorty us because 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.830
 legal process of sharing the gringo 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.430
 Descend to use radar in ballistic naify 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:25.260
 they would use it radar there on the gringa is worse 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.530
 than in Brazil but the bottom is that the 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.250
 Who the hell is that radar thing? 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.680
 It's not because I use it because I'll appeal there 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.180
 in the United States they use a type 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.860
 casually normally hungry delmira 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:41.169
 Cool little dog makes a little noise when I 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:45.550
 I throw Millennium earring cool guy - 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:47.470
 so are they going to save 1972 on pwc the 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.530
 Give it all because it's because it 's for him. 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.580
 It's just cool it's already radar 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:58.030
 simply that EEA is not they do not 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.730
 consider this kind of nuisance 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.880
 they only talk about dying to send 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:07.060
 champion in the yard where the daughter of 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.430
 hell bitch never the message read 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.919
 on-site morning communication 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:19.450
 and this gringo was playing and with me 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:20.979
 he dies to give fame or to give good in the 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.500
 front also 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:26.880
 Just this guy and try to kill the guy does not 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:33.150
 he did not want a retard because he 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.150
 and that's what he wants to be able to 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:44.110
 It may not seem like it, but it's true. 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:47.229
 the pr is thus pre-arranged 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:50.169
 Serve negative, I'm serious. I'm vengeful. 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:52.600
 you're vengeful all of us one reason is 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.880
 one thing that can not flow is 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.280
 we all Brazilians have something 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.450
 inside we like each other 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.479
 that person who just killed people 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.950
 There's a lot of players that I see that 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:16.870
 better than them but have it in goose 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:19.229
 Why do you know and now the galley? 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.669
 I wanted to talk to you about the routine. 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:24.760
 finally will start the channel here I 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:27.820
 I was intending to do on one of the agenda 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.160
 I'll do this routine starting already 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.380
 today then tomorrow there's the state video 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.510
 of the cake did not have the same channel time 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.310
 And why this because I was doing 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.849
 so do not run not by voting too much 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.889
 time to record 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:42.139
 I justify postcards that are three videos 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:46.550
 this week I bet it will be 4 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:48.139
 First, but this is it, what time? 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.779
 If you do not know Carol, 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.279
 subscribe is a favorite wiki 

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:53.599
 I hope you understood what 

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:57.020
 I talked about the gringos if they did not 

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:59.869
 I understand, I'm sorry but it gives a quick 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.029
 summed up if you understood Greek has money 

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:05.689
 gringo buy gringo console is not even 

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:08.830
 there is dying is not the one the gringo 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:11.119
 What I wanted to tell you is the gringos. 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:14.419
 fuck the middle gringos who play 

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:18.169
 Median, the middle gringos here are 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:21.679
 the strangers there the middle Brazilians 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:26.149
 here are just from there the greeks know how to play 

00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:30.769
 hence the top players there then it's k 

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:34.429
 from ten thousand p.m. 

00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:36.439

00:07:34.429 --> 00:07:39.740
 I'm going to stay here, thanks. 

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:42.619
 until the next I asked in the clergy 2070 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:45.189
 my gringo friend lost nuclear 2050 and 

00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:45.189
 went
