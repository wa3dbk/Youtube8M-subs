00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 and 7 I have on it pretty already 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.730
 pumped crew 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.000
 I will do it with the help of premium you tanchik 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.570
 fifth level of Churchill's 3 dash third or 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.440
 actively use for pumping 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.480
 crew 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.430
 how to find the fourth so on others 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.750
 heavy tank up principle with medium 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.060
 you can put anything in the tank 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.849
 terrible here recently I realized that in addition to 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.460
 standard set ie fan 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.120
 get or information mixing changed 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.579
 on stabilizer turned out to be ears here nache 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.820
 deflate the stabilization of the crew in 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.710
 principle play yes it got better 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.610
 repairing a tank is surely any tank 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:48.960
 it does not hurt this intuition that is 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.329
 penetration of a small West 7 250 250 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.910
 information is weak and not long ago 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.010
 would shoot high-explosive when 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.399
 caliber 130 it gives out memory 200 from 150 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.830
 up to 300 damage on the tower that is what 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.299
 pretty good so i drive 8 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.700
 high-explosive shells 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.670
 18 armor-piercing is quite enough 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.300
 little bit reddish 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.300
 so just in case 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.049
 so trace all the situation we are active 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.900
 We attack the base in the mode of this is an assault on us 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.290
 here we beat off the enemy from it for now 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.070
 an account in our favor I understand that in 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.119
 square on line 1 2 lines in square to 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.790
 and jay no enemy potter and starts 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:48.600
 smoothly these go ahead here are towers off i-7 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.270
 pretty impenetrable and not 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.369
 only in the forehead but in the side it's pretty 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.380
 it's hard to do 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.619
 so I played through the turret here 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.020
 waiting to catch up our 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.460
 here and begin to quietly leave 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.750
 forward forward and forward 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.000
 I'm waiting, well, what will the enemy do? 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.610
 pride opponent is not going to run on 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.050
 this hillock for which I am going and now I 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.050
 I will play through the turret 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:29.050
 Unfortunately I do not break through 7 after all 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:33.190
 breaking through my order of 250 angle was 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.740
 big reload here i see that 100 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.340
 awkwardly left and served at a normal angle 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.340
 getting him 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.860
 not see from 8 leaves but I do not have time 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.510
 of course the turret come down 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.510
 I did not even try to shoot 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.290
 This fight I also can not react 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.230
 not enough information, I just 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.000
 previous battle just ran out 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.480
 so they are pretty careful here 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.480
 expense 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.520
 but 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.520
 here begins to leave t110 there are four 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:23.260
 here the mix is okay I shoot 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.260
 the turret and here he goes to me 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.980
 that's the point I start wagging left and right 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.880
 not giving aim to him at your 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.890
 lower armor sheet 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:39.460
 and it turns out he does not punch me 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.460
 I'm taking him 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.250
 the strength in the further fight is just my 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.250
 surrounded 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.420
 and here I am making an obvious mistake 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.570
 which i think i do a lot i mean i 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:02.290
 staying alone in the front 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.640
 see me actively shoot times not 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.710
 struck t-62 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.580
 top bronelist again top 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.620
 bronelist not punch me st-1 46 by 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.600
 you do not break through deuce not break through 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.190
 all four break through 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.430
 Now I hit it was not in the lower broneliste 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:22.950
 breaking through sfotkay leave me a day not 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:27.010
 punches me until punches me 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:30.750
 that is, of all the breakthroughs I received only 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.750
 top bronelist only 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.840
 again in this episode, I told the left 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.840
 right left right 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:50.449
 on this map, I think the party on the right 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.109
 flank because go left 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:56.419
 just plain boring therefore of course 

00:04:54.109 --> 00:05:01.909
 we will act through the right side 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:05.329
 cards here a little knock forcibly 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:08.229
 all as usual dispelled as usual 

00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:08.229
 we are leaving 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.729
 on the left I see the battats and we get into the tracks 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.150
 but where else to shoot batchu only in 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.150
 caterpillar 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:30.020
 again he is lucky he leaves and leaves 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.200
 from me at least try a little 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.080
 shoot again before her again 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.390
 useless need to go ahead the more 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.890
 there are not enough serious forces for 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:46.070
 me and that 54 because it Ferdinand is already 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.450
 ready yet, he will not go down and 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.720
 here in the rut zone 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.490
 there is a small lowland in 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.940
 where can i hide play through 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.690
 her tower tower is impenetrable that is 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.720
 in 200 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.190
 unless bachatu amuse him 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.180
 will even pierce the side of the tower 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:07.880
 Well, if only in the most domestic I see 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.800
 that the e50 here is trying to play through 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.680
 the tower on it the tower is very thin and 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.470
 it's easy to punch even the shaft 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.650
 that in general, what is happening to me is not 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.080
 breaks my career on the contrary we we 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.160
 I will not read it, but it should not have been me 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.080
 waiting for the punch here Score batchatu 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.420
 that in the beam of course I can and very 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.220
 very much I throw that saw 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.400
 he was quietly shot and that was him 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:40.390
 finish it our 54 here and here you can 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.390
 Yes, you can not push the turret 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.600
 recharge 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:52.510
 At E50, you can throw attention not warmed up 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.510
 it's charging 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:07:01.449
 and in the side of the tower mom is ready here 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.939
 to p set he makes a mistake he drives down to 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:06.580
 village eight now he is less scary not 

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:09.209
 how there can not reach I can finish 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:13.199
 go to finish off the E50 here I made a mistake 

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:15.459
 too much back there of the yard which is right and 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:17.469
 my gun just does not fall on it 

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:18.159
 no more mistakes are made 

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:21.099
 going to 

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:22.169
 Here going to the E50 get the bottom 

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:25.209
 bronelist 

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:28.199
 ready and now I'm going just stupidly ahead 

00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:30.849
 just on the road do n't even think about anything 

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:32.919
 Now I will be turning 

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:35.080
 from the turntables like jean-claude van damme 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:37.830
 get this english tanchik 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.830
 gotovchenko 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.150
 so that there is a seventh to look for 

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.320
 some lowlands play through them in 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.560
 Tanchik principle pretty 

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:51.020
 cheerful in the country with out of 4 

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:54.020
 damn he play it harder but 

00:07:51.020 --> 00:08:00.350
 fun after all the tarry too 

00:07:54.020 --> 00:08:02.000
 dreary all here is one but only trace 

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:05.660
 all fast especially liked me not 

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.470
 knew that so maybe now I 

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:12.850
 even slowed 368 and unless such ron 

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.850
 can fly off to the signal
