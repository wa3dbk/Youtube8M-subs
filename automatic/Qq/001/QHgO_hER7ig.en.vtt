00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.650 

we<00:03:40.830> got<00:03:41.010> three<00:03:41.820> rollers<00:03:42.090> here<00:03:42.420> they're

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
we got three rollers here they're

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.630 
we got three rollers here they're
spinning<00:03:42.900> just<00:03:43.230> fine<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:44.070> problem<00:03:44.430> is<00:03:44.520> the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
spinning just fine the problem is the

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.610 
spinning just fine the problem is the
idler<00:03:45.000> pulley

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
idler pulley

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.380 
idler pulley
you<00:03:46.620> can<00:03:46.740> see<00:03:46.920> how<00:03:47.040> could<00:03:47.250> put<00:03:47.400> flopping

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
you can see how could put flopping

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.760 
you can see how could put flopping
around<00:03:48.450> really<00:03:48.900> freely<00:03:51.230> that's<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.470> way<00:03:52.590> it's

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
around really freely that's the way it's

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.910 
around really freely that's the way it's
rolling<00:03:55.310> actually<00:03:56.310> is

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
rolling actually is

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.949 
rolling actually is
more<00:03:58.430> down<00:03:58.730> into<00:03:59.270> the<00:03:59.480> shaft<00:04:00.050> itself<00:04:00.700> also

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
more down into the shaft itself also

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.320 
more down into the shaft itself also
sitting<00:04:02.959> either<00:04:03.200> pulley<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.760> arm<00:04:05.000> would

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
sitting either pulley and the arm would

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.199 
sitting either pulley and the arm would
have<00:04:05.480> to<00:04:05.660> be<00:04:05.780> replaced<00:04:06.230> on<00:04:06.500> here<00:04:07.180> thank<00:04:08.180> you

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
have to be replaced on here thank you
