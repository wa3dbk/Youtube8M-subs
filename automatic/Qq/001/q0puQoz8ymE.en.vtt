to<00:00:00.810> show<00:00:01.280> printing<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.370> block<00:00:02.550> of<00:00:02.700> wood<00:00:02.730> I've

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
to show printing the block of wood I've

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.660 
to show printing the block of wood I've
taken<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.990> block<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:04.770> wood<00:00:04.799> that<00:00:05.009> I've<00:00:05.100> already

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
taken a block of wood that I've already

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.730 
taken a block of wood that I've already
carved<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.359> one<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.290> reasons<00:00:07.589> why<00:00:07.710> I

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
carved and one of the reasons why I

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.230 
carved and one of the reasons why I
chose<00:00:07.830> this<00:00:08.280> one<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.550> because<00:00:08.730> there<00:00:09.210> are

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
chose this one is because there are

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.150 
chose this one is because there are
large<00:00:09.570> areas<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.200> have<00:00:10.320> carved<00:00:10.620> away<00:00:10.740> and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
large areas that have carved away and

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.290 
large areas that have carved away and
then<00:00:11.250> there's<00:00:11.400> also<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.700> large<00:00:11.940> amount<00:00:12.210> of

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
then there's also a large amount of

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.209 
then there's also a large amount of
areas<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.929> solid<00:00:13.650> wood<00:00:13.769> that's<00:00:14.009> still

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
areas of solid wood that's still

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.099 
areas of solid wood that's still
remaining<00:00:14.519> on<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.880> block<00:00:15.089> gives<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.780> an<00:00:15.870> idea

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
remaining on the block gives you an idea

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.570 
remaining on the block gives you an idea
of<00:00:16.440> how<00:00:16.560> those<00:00:16.770> different<00:00:17.100> areas<00:00:17.190> are<00:00:17.490> going

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
of how those different areas are going

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.939 
of how those different areas are going
to<00:00:17.640> be<00:00:17.699> affected<00:00:18.180> when<00:00:18.300> printing<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.710> now<00:00:19.890> that

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
to be affected when printing so now that

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.179 
to be affected when printing so now that
I<00:00:20.130> have<00:00:20.160> mixed<00:00:20.520> my<00:00:20.670> ink<00:00:21.439> on<00:00:22.439> my<00:00:22.650> palette<00:00:23.039> I'm

I have mixed my ink on my palette I'm
gonna<00:00:23.430> use<00:00:23.640> my<00:00:23.820> brayer<00:00:24.060> again<00:00:24.830> to<00:00:25.830> get<00:00:25.980> that

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
gonna use my brayer again to get that

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.700 
gonna use my brayer again to get that
nice<00:00:26.400> sheet<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.910> ink<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:29.840> roll<00:00:30.840> onto<00:00:31.199> my<00:00:31.470> block

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.180 
nice sheet of ink to roll onto my block
of<00:00:31.859> wood<00:00:32.989> now<00:00:33.989> giving<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.559> hang<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:35.010> the

of wood now giving the hang of the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.889 
of wood now giving the hang of the
brayer<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:38.120> getting<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.239> nice<00:00:39.510> layer<00:00:39.870> of

brayer and getting that nice layer of

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.000 
brayer and getting that nice layer of
ink<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.530> there<00:00:40.770> does<00:00:41.010> take<00:00:41.280> some<00:00:41.430> time<00:00:43.010> so

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
ink on there does take some time so

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
now as I'm inking the block of wood you

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.540 
now as I'm inking the block of wood you
can<00:00:53.489> see<00:00:53.850> here<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.739> areas<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.250> between

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
can see here that the areas in between

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.439 
can see here that the areas in between
the<00:00:57.360> raised<00:00:57.600> part<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.620> carve<00:00:59.219> marks<00:00:59.520> they<00:01:00.210> are

each time is difficult we're not I'm not
going<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.979> worry<00:01:17.159> about<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.640> right<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:18.210> I'm

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
going to worry about that right now I'm

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.510 
going to worry about that right now I'm
just<00:01:19.110> going<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.619> worry<00:01:19.770> about<00:01:19.890> getting<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.310> nice

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
just going to worry about getting a nice

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.580 
just going to worry about getting a nice
clean<00:01:21.060> layer<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.750> ink<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.619> my<00:01:22.799> block<00:01:24.560> one<00:01:25.560> of

clean layer of ink on my block one of

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.230 
clean layer of ink on my block one of
the<00:01:25.740> things<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.100> was<00:01:26.310> talking<00:01:26.580> about<00:01:26.850> was<00:01:27.210> a

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
the things I was talking about was a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.020 
the things I was talking about was a
carving<00:01:27.780> shelf<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.640> reason<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.979> my

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
carving shelf and the reason is that my

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.990 
carving shelf and the reason is that my
brayer<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.780> seek<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.710> tallest<00:01:35.700> part

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
brayer is going to seek the tallest part

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.429 
brayer is going to seek the tallest part
of<00:01:36.240> any<00:01:36.930> area<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.130> am<00:01:38.430> rolling<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.299> onto<00:01:39.780> so

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
of any area that I am rolling it onto so

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.560 
of any area that I am rolling it onto so
right<00:01:41.130> here<00:01:41.430> even<00:01:41.640> though<00:01:41.850> all<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.360> is

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
right here even though all of this is

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.139 
right here even though all of this is
carved<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.890> was<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.159> put<00:01:44.310> my<00:01:44.430> brayer<00:01:44.729> right

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
carved if I was to put my brayer right

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.120 
carved if I was to put my brayer right
there<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.810> gonna<00:01:46.200> pick<00:01:46.500> up<00:01:46.680> all<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.979> those

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
there it's gonna pick up all of those

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.850 
there it's gonna pick up all of those
carve<00:01:47.520> marks<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.810> want<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.110> minimize<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
carve marks so if I want to minimize the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.469 
carve marks so if I want to minimize the
number<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.189> carve<00:01:50.520> marks<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.060> are<00:01:51.210> being

picked up with my brayer I'm going to

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.469 
picked up with my brayer I'm going to
want<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.939> keep<00:01:54.149> my<00:01:54.360> brayer<00:01:54.720> as<00:01:55.369> much<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
want to keep my brayer as much on the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.899 
want to keep my brayer as much on the
surface<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.350> block<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.860> wood<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.880> I

surface of the block of wood that I

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.810 
surface of the block of wood that I
haven't<00:02:00.299> carved<00:02:00.810> away<00:02:00.960> as<00:02:01.290> possible<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.670> that

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
haven't carved away as possible so that

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.940 
haven't carved away as possible so that
I<00:02:02.939> can<00:02:03.149> make<00:02:03.329> sure<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.290> brayer<00:02:04.619> is

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
I can make sure that this brayer is
