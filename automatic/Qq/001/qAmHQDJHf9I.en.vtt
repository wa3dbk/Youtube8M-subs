some shoulder exercises and show how you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.690 
some shoulder exercises and show how you
can<00:01:05.330> tweak<00:01:05.750> them<00:01:06.020> with<00:01:06.500> just<00:01:06.770> a<00:01:06.890> small<00:01:07.340> small

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700

change<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:09.110> make<00:01:09.350> them<00:01:09.560> much<00:01:09.830> more<00:01:09.860> than<00:01:10.340> just

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
change to make them much more than just

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.840 
change to make them much more than just
a<00:01:10.970> shoulder<00:01:11.510> movement<00:01:12.050> so<00:01:12.500> if<00:01:13.130> we<00:01:13.369> started

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
a shoulder movement so if we started

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.420 
a shoulder movement so if we started
with<00:01:13.880> a<00:01:14.210> front<00:01:14.600> dumbbell<00:01:15.170> lateral<00:01:15.740> or<00:01:16.009> a<00:01:16.220> front

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
with a front dumbbell lateral or a front

with a front dumbbell lateral or a front
dumbbell<00:01:16.790> raise<00:01:17.000> right<00:01:17.509> we<00:01:17.960> could<00:01:18.080> be<00:01:18.229> right

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
dumbbell raise right we could be right

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.999

trying to work just through the front of
our<00:01:21.830> shoulders<00:01:22.070> but<00:01:22.550> why<00:01:23.330> do<00:01:23.420> that<00:01:23.720> when<00:01:24.410> we

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
our shoulders but why do that when we

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.749 
our shoulders but why do that when we
can<00:01:25.509> easily<00:01:26.509> add<00:01:27.080> some<00:01:27.860> core<00:01:28.160> training<00:01:28.460> that's

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
can easily add some core training that's

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.730 
can easily add some core training that's
what<00:01:29.000> we're<00:01:29.180> doing<00:01:29.450> just<00:01:30.020> with<00:01:30.170> where<00:01:30.380> we<00:01:30.500> put

alright so from here with that preload I

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.480 
alright so from here with that preload I
can<00:02:00.920> come<00:02:01.130> up<00:02:01.340> towards<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.240> top<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.810> now<00:02:03.709> work

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
can come up towards the top and now work

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.529 
can come up towards the top and now work
the<00:02:04.789> front<00:02:05.360> of<00:02:05.569> my<00:02:05.899> shoulders<00:02:06.410> here<00:02:07.450> but<00:02:08.450> at

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
the front of my shoulders here but at

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.660 
the front of my shoulders here but at
the<00:02:08.630> same<00:02:08.869> time<00:02:09.229> have<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.860> control<00:02:10.340> and

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
the same time have to control and

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.530 
the same time have to control and
decelerate<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:11.900> down<00:02:12.590> through<00:02:13.190> my<00:02:14.030> core<00:02:14.330> my

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
decelerate that down through my core my

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.839 
decelerate that down through my core my
obliques<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.170> actually<00:02:15.830> enter<00:02:16.220> my<00:02:16.640> low<00:02:16.819> back

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
obliques and actually enter my low back

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.800 
obliques and actually enter my low back
at<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.690> same<00:02:17.900> time<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:19.150> we<00:02:20.150> can<00:02:20.360> make<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.690> a

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
at the same time so we can make it a

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.780 
at the same time so we can make it a
really<00:02:21.490> explosive<00:02:22.490> movement<00:02:22.910> too<00:02:23.150> by

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
really explosive movement too by

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.890 
really explosive movement too by
accelerating<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:26.000> up<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.390> then<00:02:26.510> having<00:02:26.720> to

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
accelerating it up and then having to

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.980 
accelerating it up and then having to
end<00:02:27.610> decelerate<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:28.670> on<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.880> way<00:02:29.000> down<00:02:29.209> so<00:02:31.990> we

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
end decelerate it on the way down so we

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.020 
end decelerate it on the way down so we
can<00:02:33.170> tie<00:02:33.470> our<00:02:33.940> core<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.470> everything<00:02:36.470> we<00:02:36.590> do

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
can tie our core and everything we do

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
here you can see we can get that medial

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.630 
here you can see we can get that medial
head<00:03:40.020> of<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.830> deltoid<00:03:41.280> involve<00:03:42.230> okay<00:03:43.430> but<00:03:44.430> now

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
head of the deltoid involve okay but now

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.910 
head of the deltoid involve okay but now
why<00:03:45.600> don't<00:03:45.660> we<00:03:45.780> take<00:03:46.050> that<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.500> step<00:03:46.740> further

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
why don't we take that a step further

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.600 
why don't we take that a step further
and<00:03:47.660> change<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:49.110> position<00:03:49.440> of<00:03:49.800> our<00:03:49.890> body<00:03:50.130> in

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
and change the position of our body in

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.370 
and change the position of our body in
relation<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.600> weight<00:03:51.780> or<00:03:52.020> the<00:03:52.050> resistance

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
relation to the weight or the resistance

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.740 
relation to the weight or the resistance
we<00:03:53.310> take<00:03:53.490> a<00:03:53.520> little<00:03:53.760> bit<00:03:53.910> of<00:03:53.970> an<00:03:54.060> open<00:03:54.450> stance

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
we take a little bit of an open stance

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.080 
we take a little bit of an open stance
so<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.710> again<00:03:56.390> preload<00:03:57.390> I'm<00:03:57.780> in<00:03:58.140> through

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
so that again preload I'm in through

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.290 
so that again preload I'm in through
here<00:04:00.090> but<00:04:00.870> just<00:04:01.530> by<00:04:01.680> doing<00:04:01.740> this<00:04:02.300> reaching

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
here but just by doing this reaching

here but just by doing this reaching
across<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:04.200> can<00:04:04.290> see<00:04:04.680> how<00:04:05.220> I<00:04:05.280> activate<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.760> lot

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
across you can see how I activate a lot

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.620 
across you can see how I activate a lot
more<00:04:06.240> muscles<00:04:07.110> in<00:04:07.230> my<00:04:07.260> core<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:08.070> I'm<00:04:08.400> here<00:04:09.000> open
