 hiroshi yamauchi president of nintendo

 in the years when donkey kong was created 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.140
 he thought it would be a good idea to put him 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.780
 a title in English to get closer 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.360
 to the western market to shigeru miyamoto 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.309
 creator of the game he came up with the 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.110
 name of donkey kong believing that 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.160
 Donkey was a synonym for fool or 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.360
 stupid resulting in stupid sign 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.489
 everyone laughed at him when he heard such 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.430
 proposal but in the end the 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.530
 name stayed nintendo was sued 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.780
 for universal studios when donkey kong 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.880
 the studies became popular 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.039
 they alleged that donkey kong was a theft 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.009
 copyright of king kong the 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.690
 nintendo john kelvin lawyer demonstrated 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.000
 that the studies did not have the rights 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.580
 of the name king kong and therefore 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.619
 they lost the nintendo case rewarded 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.330
 here I saw with a boat called donkey kong 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.280
 and the rights to be the owner 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.740
 absolute name on all boats 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.780
 it is said that they also appreciated it 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.210
 by choosing his surname as the name of 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.590
 Another popular character from Nintendo 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.360
 nintendo was impressed with the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.890
 graphic work that the studies network 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.920
 they had gotten with their computers 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.790
 silicon graphics yielded the license 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.100
 from donkey kong 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.810
 develop a new game by being a 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.210
 title that in those years looked very 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.770
 Realistically Roger decided that they should 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.810
 be the animations of the movements 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.520
 from donkey kong and visited a zoo 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.410
 to observe the behavior of 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.330
 Apes were quite disappointed 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.700
 to see that the movements of the apes 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.110
 they were not very fast or not enough 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.630
 like to go with an action game 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.240
 platform in the intro of donkey kong 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.570
 country tranqui is on top of the beams 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.730

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.560
 they play turntables with the theme 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.720

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:25.880
 92 instead of including a bar 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.740
 energy or something similar king decided 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.540
 include a second playable character in 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.700

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.010
 plans was donkey kong junior the chosen 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.860
 but with a new more youthful design 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.170
 less childish to nintendo did not like the 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.700
 idea and let sweep with a choice or 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.310
 they left doc and with juniors like it was 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.170
 before or made this new design a 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.790
 new character who re-elected to stay 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.790

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.650
 pizzi with ping kong until finally 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.330
 he stayed diddy kong los kremlin gsw 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.550
 sworn enemies of donkey kong that in 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.110
 the country trilogy were originally 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.820
 characters designed for another game of 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.260
 network but in the end the studies 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.450
 they decided to use them as villains

 processing power of nintendo 64 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.420
 it was believed that because of the graphic power and 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.690
 the immensity of the worlds and characters 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.160
 of the game its use was mandatory but in 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.960
 reality for the only thing that served the 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.730
 expansion so that in this game it was 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.960
 to prevent an error occurring that 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.950
