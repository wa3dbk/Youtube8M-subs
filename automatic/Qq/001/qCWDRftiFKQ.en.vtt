00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.970
 youtubers in the previous episode speak 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.280

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.330

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.940

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.289
 5 so vote if you want to nexus hd or 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.550

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.449
 just vote for the comment that I 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.490
 I put the one you want the most and that's how 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.310
 that we go there 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.740
 so he does not know who is not serious in 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.170
 reality is called david if I do not remember 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.720
 wrong and started his channel there by the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.690
 beginning of 2012 thanks to his cousin and 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.489
 that's good, that pulled out its 14-inch lines 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.080
 of 15 and his cousin told him today because he 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.970
 Upload the videos to YouTube you want 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.640
 get good streaks and try to see 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.680
 style like willy rex stacks and stuff like that 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.470
 so then good Greg started 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.360
 upload videos but of course we 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.610
 you will ask about the grefa habitat as 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.949
 it happened to him is a serious good man and he 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.769
 I hit a keyboard host and magically 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.570
 came out a kind of a man called 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.040
 stoneware more or less the I think that modified 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.930
 some lyrics but more or less stayed 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.610
 in serious and if it's a weird way 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.380
 to look for a name but nowadays it is 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.610
 a very original name and the truth is 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.010
 that from my point of view is 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.340
 pretty cool good back in 2013 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.740
 March or February good may better said 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.480
 May June after Greece and at a year 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.930
 I was trying to reach 10,000 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.030
 subscribers and uploaded a video nicknamed me 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.190
 because he had altered 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.890
 when I started when I uploaded videos in 2012 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.330
 He had a voice so to speak well of 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.730
 some form of radilla not the typical 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.260
 children rats and with the little voice we 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.770
 we apologize some have a voice like that 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.990
 ok and in 2013 he changed his voice a 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.750
 little very serious to say it of some 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.820
 way we plan everything serious not 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.710
 then people asked for his face because 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.040
 people did not know that by then 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.390
 he was 16 years old now he is 17 if 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.820
 I 'm not wrong but back then 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.710
 I was 16 and the voice suddenly had 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.220
 hit a change and it looked like it had 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.320
 like 20 years serious has a veneer of 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.570
 child had a child's face and made a 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.790
 video pruned my face on which 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.959
 a video very much happened where I asked 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.300
 to some friends of yours who has a 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.970
 sort of dubbing and they said I'm 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.920
 serious in which good himself doubled 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.709
 the voice and at the end of the video said that 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.819
 they guessed who is who he was that 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.069
 video had a lot 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.870
 because people did not expect that I expected 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.249
 directly see his face and our 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.849
 sort of adam trolley or just 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:30.889
 crepe so he did not have much work 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.650
 because it was very difficult to do and up to date 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:35.749
 next he made a video saying everything 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.159
 not of all but saying here that he has 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:39.379
 past and I just wanted to do it 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.969
 fun and showing itself as such and as 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:44.540
 it was the people were very surprised at 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:46.010
 see him since he believes he had not had 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.019
 the veneer to say it in some way 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.120
 of the voice that appeared because his voice 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.609
 It was very serious and his face was very young 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.340
 16 years old and he was very young that too 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.140
 I passed the truth 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.680
 and well after that the video had 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.379
 much support he followed and then he was 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.840
 growing little by little with his tricks with 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.700
 their houses with their white clichés 2 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.989
 because that was what made him hit the most 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.000
 the boom and suddenly zombies came out 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.330
 the zombies came out in buried or bourget 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.670
 and that he does not know poker he is a player 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.140
 of zombies the one that uploaded all the tricks 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.730
 just when it came out that's tom bissell 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.890
 I was on vacation and let's say 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.110
 greece took advantage of that pull started to 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.000
 upload all the sisters ex all the 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.410
 weapons started to climb everything started to 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.420
 go up when they will be double points in 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.579
 whites 2 when the glitches when 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.110
 this when the other and its channel made a 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:39.879
 boom be what is an awesome boom 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.200
 began to say barbarities fast 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.549
 maybe the day maybe there were days 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.040
 that grew a thousand subscribers arrive 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.260
 an authentic barbarity and good 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.879
 suddenly the boom was not so big anymore and 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.190
 the zombies finished and he was still 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.980
 growing at your pace but clear then 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.500
 I then got gta 5 and he started to 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.540
 upload clichés the broken tricks 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.090
 playing the fun games things 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.620
 entertaining that 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.239
 he liked it a lot because the channel was 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.150
 arriving at a fairly pretty pace 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.790
 cool but what happened was that the 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.480
 captive was approaching and clear 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.250
 how to stop producing ice cream being a 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.889
 channel that has come up based on tricks of 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.079
 call of duty and based on cliches based 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.570
 de esther xxi based on his good 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.330
 items and their aids as I have left 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.889
 side then decided to replace 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.300
 captives by gta 5 the biggest mistake of his 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.850
 life because if not right now he would have 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.650
 a million sub but can finally 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.979
 say that the channel is doing well now 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.539
 is comfortable and well within the bad 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.310
 It was not a bad decision either because 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.979
 good you have 10,000 subscribers not 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.710
 inside the bad but after a 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.690
 time finally finally after 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.009
 heal videos of heal news 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.160
 of healing everything came to 100,000 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:52.110
 subscribers to a dream that he wanted 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.419
 meet your goal since you started in 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.849
 youtube were the 10,000 subscribers already 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.050
 today he deserves it that is the good thing 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.539
 what is the good thing about greece is that 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.009
 although people seem to think that now 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.660
 same videos are not cured is a lie 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.190
 because the videos that have the 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.020
 editions and only the thumbnails already 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.250
 they carry an impressive work the ideas 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.810
 that go through his head are 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.520
 incredible and although many people are 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.720
 thinks that raising call of duty is something 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.580
 that goes up in half an hour is not like that 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.569
 because it is not the truth so that 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.879
 you want me 'personally 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:19.259
 I liked what I've always seen 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.210
 since special comes 10,000 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.499
 I signed and I started to follow 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.389
 I swallowed all the videos so I 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:26.129
 I consider fan boy I'm lucky 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:27.449
 know it not in real life but yes of 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:28.439
 talk to him about is there's enough of 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.899
 play lol 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:32.550
 so nothing here ends the video 

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:34.709
 talking about greve I hope that I have 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.270
 liked this way of not putting a video 

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:38.669
 of background but put more or less the 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.959
 story of the two with videos and nothing in 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.939
 the comments you will have to the next 

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:45.679
 youtubers greetings give me a liking 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:45.679
 because I would appreciate it and goodbye
