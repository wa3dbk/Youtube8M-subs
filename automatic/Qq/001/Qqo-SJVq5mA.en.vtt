00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
my original intention was to simply load

my original intention was to simply load

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
up windows from the original hard drive

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.300 
up windows from the original hard drive
system<00:02:37.189> image<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:37.819> and<00:02:38.409> do<00:02:39.409> the<00:02:39.530> system<00:02:39.950> repair

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
system image it and do the system repair

disk and move it over to the solid state
drive<00:02:42.890> however<00:02:43.129> I<00:02:43.640> thought<00:02:44.420> what<00:02:44.599> this<00:02:44.750> was

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
drive however I thought what this was

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.369 
drive however I thought what this was
much<00:02:45.140> smarter<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.920> was<00:02:46.040> able<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:47.109> detect<00:02:48.109> new

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
much smarter and was able to detect new

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.920 
much smarter and was able to detect new
hardware<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.340> saw<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.790> correct<00:02:50.180> drivers<00:02:50.659> and

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
hardware and saw the correct drivers and

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.140 
hardware and saw the correct drivers and
boot<00:02:51.230> up<00:02:51.349> normally<00:02:51.920> but<00:02:52.459> obviously<00:02:52.879> it's<00:02:53.090> not

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
boot up normally but obviously it's not

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.809 
boot up normally but obviously it's not
and<00:02:53.599> every<00:02:54.109> time<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.319> would<00:02:54.620> boot<00:02:54.799> from<00:02:55.069> this

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
and every time I would boot from this

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.970 
and every time I would boot from this
original<00:02:56.329> CD<00:02:56.599> drive<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:57.200> would<00:02:57.409> give<00:02:57.829> me<00:02:57.859> a

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
original CD drive it would give me a

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.580 
original CD drive it would give me a
boost<00:02:58.159> rina<00:02:58.489> death<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:58.939> restart<00:02:59.390> the<00:03:00.200> repair

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
boost rina death and restart the repair

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.920 
boost rina death and restart the repair
option<00:03:01.069> doesn't<00:03:01.340> work<00:03:01.730> so<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.569> had<00:03:02.810> it

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
option doesn't work so I had it

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.160 
option doesn't work so I had it
basically<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.709> clean<00:03:04.099> install<00:03:05.079> to<00:03:06.079> the

basically to a clean install to the
solid<00:03:06.470> state<00:03:06.650> drive<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.310> open<00:03:08.379> up<00:03:09.379> the

solid state drive and open up the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.170 
solid state drive and open up the

original seat driving at the standard
standard<00:03:11.780> drive<00:03:12.230> I<00:03:12.859> also<00:03:13.220> head<00:03:13.459> into<00:03:13.639> a<00:03:13.670> few

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:13.939 
standard drive I also head into a few

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.580 
standard drive I also head into a few
little<00:03:14.060> bit<00:03:14.299> tinkering<00:03:14.720> first<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.409> all<00:03:15.439> the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
little bit tinkering first of all the

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.220 
little bit tinkering first of all the
main<00:03:15.739> problem<00:03:16.159> was<00:03:16.359> you<00:03:17.359> can't<00:03:17.629> plug<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:18.109> in

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
main problem was you can't plug it in

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.960 
main problem was you can't plug it in
during<00:03:18.409> startup<00:03:18.859> or<00:03:19.129> it'll<00:03:19.340> try<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.549> boot<00:03:19.760> that

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
during startup or it'll try to boot that

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.420 
during startup or it'll try to boot that
drive<00:03:20.329> you<00:03:20.569> know<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:20.900> installed<00:03:21.560> windows<00:03:22.280> on

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
drive you know you installed windows on

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.339 
drive you know you installed windows on
the<00:03:22.700> other<00:03:22.970> drive<00:03:23.269> they'll<00:03:23.780> try<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.049> boot<00:03:24.230> it

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
the other drive they'll try to boot it

the other drive they'll try to boot it
blue<00:03:24.650> screen<00:03:24.889> so<00:03:25.099> you<00:03:25.189> have<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.489> actually<00:03:25.639> plug

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
blue screen so you have to actually plug

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.390 
blue screen so you have to actually plug
it<00:03:26.209> in<00:03:26.379> after<00:03:27.379> what<00:03:27.560> does<00:03:27.739> it<00:03:27.859> started<00:03:28.250> and

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
it in after what does it started and

also<00:04:00.949> basically<00:04:01.549> makes<00:04:01.909> you<00:04:02.060> harder<00:04:02.329> to<00:04:02.389> write

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629
