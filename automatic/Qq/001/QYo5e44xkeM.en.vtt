00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:05.409 

I<00:04:59.780> guess<00:05:00.780> we<00:05:00.990> can<00:05:03.020> get<00:05:04.020> rid<00:05:04.080> of<00:05:04.260> all<00:05:04.560> this

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
I guess we can get rid of all this

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:12.200 
I guess we can get rid of all this
is<00:05:09.500> we<00:05:10.500> used<00:05:10.680> a<00:05:10.830> lot<00:05:11.010> less<00:05:11.310> than<00:05:11.340> I<00:05:11.699> thought<00:05:11.970> we

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
is we used a lot less than I thought we

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.320 
is we used a lot less than I thought we
would<00:05:12.389> use<00:05:12.630> at<00:05:12.870> least<00:05:13.110> I<00:05:13.790> guess<00:05:14.790> that's<00:05:15.060> a<00:05:15.210> good

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
would use at least I guess that's a good

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.609 
would use at least I guess that's a good
thing
