kill Sherman m4a3e8 this is what I've
got<00:00:07.200> completed<00:00:07.919> this<00:00:08.069> month

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.230 

since<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.900> got<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.139> new<00:00:14.070> milling<00:00:14.429> machine<00:00:14.759> it's

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
since I got a new milling machine it's

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.580 
since I got a new milling machine it's
over<00:00:15.540> not<00:00:15.660> back<00:00:15.900> corner<00:00:16.230> there

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
over not back corner there

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:27.400 
over not back corner there
I<00:00:17.270> cut<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.390> key<00:00:18.570> ways<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.350> transmission

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.089 

the<00:00:28.410> right<00:00:29.359> right<00:00:30.359> output<00:00:30.990> shaft<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.590> already

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
the right right output shaft it already

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.060 
the right right output shaft it already
had<00:00:32.399> external<00:00:33.149> key<00:00:33.510> way<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.950> except<00:00:34.950> I

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
had external key way in it except I

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.860 
had external key way in it except I
never<00:00:35.340> put<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> key<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.420> don't<00:00:36.690> remember

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
never put a key in it I don't remember

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.530 
never put a key in it I don't remember
why<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.590> kind<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.520> stupid<00:00:38.790> idea<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.270> it

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
why it's kind of a stupid idea that it

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.950 
why it's kind of a stupid idea that it
didn't<00:00:39.899> put<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:41.120> but<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.360> had<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.629> put<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:42.809> in

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
didn't put it in but I had to put one in

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.319 
didn't put it in but I had to put one in
the<00:00:43.290> reverse<00:00:44.040> drive<00:00:44.340> sprocket<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.059> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the reverse drive sprocket on the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.920 
the reverse drive sprocket on the
forward<00:00:45.629> drive<00:00:45.809> sprocket<00:00:46.850> one<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.059> disc<00:00:48.629> brake

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
forward drive sprocket one in disc brake

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.830 
forward drive sprocket one in disc brake
and<00:00:49.230> one<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.460> track<00:00:51.149> drive<00:00:51.390> sprocket

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and one in the track drive sprocket

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.889 
and one in the track drive sprocket
plate<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:55.010> I<00:00:56.010> also<00:00:56.699> needed<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.270> put<00:00:57.480> key<00:00:57.690> ways

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
plate and I also needed to put key ways

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.650 
plate and I also needed to put key ways
in<00:00:58.609> the<00:00:59.609> left<00:00:59.850> output<00:01:00.449> shaft<00:01:02.510> because<00:01:03.510> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
in the left output shaft because it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.329 
in the left output shaft because it
never<00:01:03.809> had<00:01:04.110> anything<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.769> had<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.979> cut<00:01:05.129> them<00:01:05.250> in

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
never had anything I had to cut them in

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.039 
never had anything I had to cut them in
it<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.570> cut<00:01:06.869> one<00:01:07.140> for<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.100> reverse<00:01:09.090> drive

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
it so I cut one for the reverse drive

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.679 
it so I cut one for the reverse drive
sprocket<00:01:10.610> one<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> forward<00:01:12.270> sprocket

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
sprocket one for the forward sprocket

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.520 
sprocket one for the forward sprocket
and<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.640> had<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.030> mill<00:01:18.540> out<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.780> slot<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.409> it

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and so I had to mill out a slot in it

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.039 
and so I had to mill out a slot in it
and<00:01:19.799> then<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.430> put<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> key<00:01:20.909> way<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.210> there<00:01:21.420> same

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
and then I put a key way in there same

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.570 
and then I put a key way in there same
on<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.259> other<00:01:22.320> side<00:01:22.619> mule<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.100> slot<00:01:23.369> but

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
on the other side mule out a slot but

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.460 
on the other side mule out a slot but
key<00:01:23.759> way<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.119> also<00:01:24.840> had<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.229> do<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.409> same

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
key way in it also had to do the same

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.319 
key way in it also had to do the same
thing<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:28.200> disc<00:01:28.500> brake<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.100> same<00:01:30.090> with

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
thing with the disc brake and same with

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.420 
thing with the disc brake and same with
the<00:01:30.659> track<00:01:30.990> drive<00:01:31.259> sprocket<00:01:31.710> fleet<00:01:34.430> because

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
the track drive sprocket fleet because

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.700 
the track drive sprocket fleet because
those<00:01:35.610> all<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.850> grow<00:01:36.180> up<00:01:36.210> screws<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.780> same

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
those all I grow up screws in it same

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.039 
those all I grow up screws in it same
with<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.100> sprocket<00:01:38.820> here<00:01:39.030> that's<00:01:39.299> what's<00:01:39.869> on

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
with this sprocket here that's what's on

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.859 
with this sprocket here that's what's on
the<00:01:40.079> primary<00:01:40.470> shaft<00:01:41.390> that<00:01:42.390> had<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> grub

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the primary shaft that had the grub

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.450 
the primary shaft that had the grub
screws<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.320> there<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.590> those<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:44.340> was

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
screws in there and those that was

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.240 
screws in there and those that was
what's<00:01:44.670> making<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.119> clicking<00:01:45.270> noise<00:01:46.250> this

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
what's making that clicking noise this

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.090 
what's making that clicking noise this
sprocket<00:01:47.579> here<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.750> press<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.680> sprocket

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
sprocket here so I press the sprocket

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.480 
sprocket here so I press the sprocket
off<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.430> put<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.670> key<00:01:51.600> way<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.780> there<00:01:52.490> so

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
off I put a key way in there so

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.160 
off I put a key way in there so
hopefully<00:01:53.700> now<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.450> won't<00:01:54.720> have<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.990> worry

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
hopefully now I won't have to worry

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.929 
hopefully now I won't have to worry
about<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.590> transmission<00:01:56.219> making<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.759> clicking

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
about the transmission making a clicking

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.330 
about the transmission making a clicking
noise<00:01:57.149> when<00:01:57.659> I'm<00:01:57.780> driving<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.290> will<00:01:59.009> take<00:01:59.189> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
noise when I'm driving it will take the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.120 
noise when I'm driving it will take the
next<00:01:59.670> test<00:01:59.909> drive<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:01.619> also<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.219> painted<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
next test drive and also I painted the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.609 
next test drive and also I painted the
dry<00:02:05.130> sprockets<00:02:05.729> that's<00:02:06.079> painted<00:02:07.079> them<00:02:07.229> all<00:02:07.409> of

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
dry sprockets that's painted them all of

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.760 
dry sprockets that's painted them all of
green<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.190> comes<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.700> spray<00:02:09.239> can

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
green it comes in a spray can

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.380 
green it comes in a spray can
that's<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:11.009> for<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
that's it for the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.000 
that's it for the
the<00:02:12.480> transmission<00:02:14.000> here's<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:16.740> lower
