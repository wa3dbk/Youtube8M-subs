up<00:00:18.330> on<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.570> boat<00:00:18.720> lift<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.619> has

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
up on the boat lift so this has

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.220 
up on the boat lift so this has
phenomenal<00:00:20.279> benefits<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.390> not<00:00:21.960> only<00:00:22.109> in

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
phenomenal benefits to it not only in

phenomenal benefits to it not only in
the<00:00:22.289> fact<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.740> just<00:00:22.920> makes<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.340> easy<00:00:23.670> and

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880

a whole lot easier and more importantly
even<00:00:31.650> bringing<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.759> back<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.270> getting<00:00:33.450> it

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
even bringing it back in and getting it

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.410

kind of wheel so no matter what your

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.459 
kind of wheel so no matter what your
manufacturer<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.660> your<00:00:51.809> boat<00:00:52.020> lift<00:00:52.260> as

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
manufacturer is of your boat lift as

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.650 
manufacturer is of your boat lift as
long<00:00:52.739> as<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.550> wheel<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:53.940> looks<00:00:54.360> you

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
long as you have a wheel that looks you

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.260 
long as you have a wheel that looks you
know<00:00:54.690> somewhat<00:00:55.350> similar<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.149> that

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
know somewhat similar to the one that

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.970 
know somewhat similar to the one that
you're<00:00:57.420> seeing<00:00:57.719> meaning<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> round

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
you're seeing meaning that it is a round

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.490 
you're seeing meaning that it is a round
wheel<00:00:59.280> it's<00:01:00.180> going<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.480> work<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:00.719> fine<00:01:01.199> it

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
wheel it's going to work just fine it

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.850 
wheel it's going to work just fine it
works<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:02.070> friction<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
works on friction and so the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.920 
works on friction and so the
installation<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.150> incredibly<00:01:06.150> easy<00:01:06.420> you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
installation is incredibly easy you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.990 
installation is incredibly easy you
don't<00:01:07.140> need<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.409> take<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.799> wheel<00:01:07.979> off<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.850> can

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
don't need to take the wheel off you can

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.850 
don't need to take the wheel off you can
just<00:01:09.150> leave<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.689> place<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.650> is

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
just leave it in place and that is

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.289 
just leave it in place and that is
actually<00:01:11.250> one<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> benefits<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.150> I

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
actually one of the benefits that I

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.630 
actually one of the benefits that I
believe<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.900> really<00:01:13.710> nice<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.549> know

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
believe is really nice is that you know

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.460 
believe is really nice is that you know
for<00:01:14.970> some<00:01:15.180> reason<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.659> find<00:01:15.900> yourself<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
for some reason you find yourself in a

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.370 
for some reason you find yourself in a
position<00:01:16.650> where<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.159> don't<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.430> power

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
position where you don't have power

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.780 
position where you don't have power
you're<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.560> wheel<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.950> still<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.340> there<00:01:20.520> so

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
you're the wheel is still on there so

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.670 
you're the wheel is still on there so
you<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.180> do<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.450> manually<00:01:21.780> I'm<00:01:22.049> not<00:01:22.229> sure<00:01:22.290> why

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
you can do it manually I'm not sure why

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.550 
you can do it manually I'm not sure why
you<00:01:22.710> would<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.450> do<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:25.110> way<00:01:25.350> now

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
you would but you can do it that way now

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.850 
you would but you can do it that way now
and<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.790> set<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.150> up<00:01:27.240> using<00:01:27.810> battery<00:01:28.500> you

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
and you can set it up using battery you

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.280 
and you can set it up using battery you
know<00:01:28.979> your<00:01:29.250> boat<00:01:29.430> battery<00:01:29.670> or<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.930> set<00:01:31.170> it

know your boat battery or you can set it

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.069 
know your boat battery or you can set it
up<00:01:31.380> with<00:01:31.740> shore<00:01:32.490> power<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:33.060> my<00:01:33.810> particular

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.080 
case I didn't want to buy a new battery
I<00:01:36.329> didn't<00:01:36.600> want<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.840> install<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.920> power<00:01:38.790> down

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
I didn't want to install the power down

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.560 
I didn't want to install the power down
to<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> shoreline<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.130> so<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.520> easily<00:01:42.150> set

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
to the shoreline and so it's easily set

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.380 
to the shoreline and so it's easily set
up<00:01:42.600> where<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.909> connect<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.360> my

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
up where I can just connect it to my

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.420 
up where I can just connect it to my
battery<00:01:45.960> as<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.320> pull<00:01:46.560> into<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.920> lift<00:01:47.100> there's

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
battery as I pull into the lift there's

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.420 
battery as I pull into the lift there's
a<00:01:47.490> 15<00:01:48.240> foot<00:01:48.540> extension<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.740> i<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:49.950> reach<00:01:50.159> back

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
a 15 foot extension so i can reach back

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.789 
a 15 foot extension so i can reach back
to<00:01:50.579> my<00:01:50.700> battery<00:01:51.119> it's<00:01:51.659> actually<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.380> lot

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
to my battery it's actually a lot

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.010 
to my battery it's actually a lot
simpler<00:01:53.280> than<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.610> might<00:01:53.850> sound<00:01:54.180> now<00:01:54.810> if<00:01:54.899> you

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
simpler than it might sound now if you

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.649 
simpler than it might sound now if you
do<00:01:55.229> connect<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.890> shore<00:01:56.130> power<00:01:56.399> there<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.420> an

do connect it to shore power there is an

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.940 
do connect it to shore power there is an
inline<00:01:58.170> GFI<00:01:58.950> now<00:01:59.250> that<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.869> helpful<00:02:01.590> in

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
inline GFI now that is helpful in

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.770 
inline GFI now that is helpful in
protection<00:02:02.640> but<00:02:02.759> we<00:02:02.850> do<00:02:03.119> highly<00:02:03.750> recommend

go with the battery but you know it's a

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.140 
go with the battery but you know it's a
good<00:02:21.540> safety<00:02:21.840> feature<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.980> installation<00:02:23.580> is

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
good safety feature the installation is

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.110

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
so simple and you know I hate to use the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.020 
so simple and you know I hate to use the
words<00:02:27.560> minutes<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.430> takes<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.880> install

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
words minutes that it takes to install

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.940
