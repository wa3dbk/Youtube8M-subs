00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
would put in there but you could put a

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.910 
would put in there but you could put a
pretty<00:01:45.360> sick<00:01:45.659> MLS<00:01:46.200> side<00:01:46.409> together<00:01:46.590> now<00:01:46.890> that

pretty sick MLS side together now that
Giovinco<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.640> there<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> only<00:01:48.060> question

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
Giovinco is in there the only question

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.030 
Giovinco is in there the only question
is<00:01:48.509> are<00:01:48.750> they<00:01:48.990> gonna<00:01:49.079> give<00:01:49.350> them<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.560> downgrade

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
is are they gonna give them a downgrade

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.590 
is are they gonna give them a downgrade
I<00:01:50.070> wouldn't<00:01:50.369> imagine<00:01:50.520> he's<00:01:50.820> only<00:01:50.939> gonna<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.240> 28

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
I wouldn't imagine he's only gonna be 28

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.310 
I wouldn't imagine he's only gonna be 28
years<00:01:51.780> old

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
years old

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.530 
years old
well<00:01:52.920> no<00:01:53.040> still<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.460> 27<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.090> believe<00:01:54.329> he'll<00:01:54.509> be

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
well no still be 27 I believe he'll be

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.240 
well no still be 27 I believe he'll be
either<00:01:54.720> 27<00:01:55.259> or<00:01:55.350> 28<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.829> don't<00:01:55.979> think<00:01:56.130> they'll

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
either 27 or 28 so I don't think they'll

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.140 
either 27 or 28 so I don't think they'll
downgrade<00:01:56.610> him<00:01:56.700> for<00:01:56.850> that

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
downgrade him for that

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.970 
downgrade him for that
the<00:01:57.630> only<00:01:57.780> reason<00:01:58.140> they<00:01:58.200> might<00:01:58.380> downgrade<00:01:58.650> him

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
the only reason they might downgrade him

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.530 
the only reason they might downgrade him
is<00:01:59.160> because<00:01:59.370> of<00:01:59.460> performance<00:01:59.550> hit<00:02:00.150> that<00:02:00.330> like

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
is because of performance hit that like

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.790 
is because of performance hit that like

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
before you would have seen Giovinco at

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.270 
before you would have seen Giovinco at
centre<00:02:22.290> board<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.650> did<00:02:22.830> convert<00:02:23.160> him<00:02:23.250> to

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
centre board I did convert him to

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.550 
centre board I did convert him to
striker<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:24.480> yeah<00:02:24.720> let's<00:02:25.080> get<00:02:25.200> right<00:02:25.410> in<00:02:25.500> the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
striker so yeah let's get right in the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.560 
striker so yeah let's get right in the
game<00:02:25.710> let's<00:02:26.100> see<00:02:26.310> how<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.550> fruit<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.000> atomic

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
game let's see how the fruit and atomic

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:34.570 
game let's see how the fruit and atomic
and<00:02:27.720> perform<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:31.830> really<00:02:32.040> isn't<00:02:32.160> atomic<00:02:32.640> camp

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
and perform it really isn't atomic camp

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.970 
and perform it really isn't atomic camp
he<00:02:35.580> really<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> Gotama<00:02:37.110> camp<00:02:37.530> man

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
he really is a Gotama camp man

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.860 
he really is a Gotama camp man
also<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.670> know<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:38.940> have<00:02:39.120> yet<00:02:39.300> land<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.630> there<00:02:39.780> and

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
also I know I have yet land in there and

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.960 
also I know I have yet land in there and
he's<00:02:39.990> going<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.230> Spurs<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:40.860> uh<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.820> got<00:02:41.940> a

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
he's going to Spurs so uh you got a

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.790 
he's going to Spurs so uh you got a
factor<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.780> into<00:02:42.990> consideration<00:02:43.200> as<00:02:43.650> well

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
factor that into consideration as well

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.290 
factor that into consideration as well
so<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.040> isn't<00:02:44.310> really<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:44.670> MLS<00:02:44.970> side<00:02:45.150> that

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
so this isn't really the MLS side that

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.210 
so this isn't really the MLS side that
he'll<00:02:45.450> be<00:02:45.540> playing<00:02:45.780> with<00:02:48.740> like<00:02:49.740> forties

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
he'll be playing with like forties

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.180 
he'll be playing with like forties
