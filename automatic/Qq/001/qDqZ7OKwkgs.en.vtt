00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:09.300
 tractors designed to meet the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.509
 heavy work requiring high 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.480
 productivity in large areas with low 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.690
 fuel consumption and great comfort 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.690
 operational 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:34.310
 design the comfort and ease of 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.440
 influence directly on the 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.650
 work income 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.420
 but it is in the engine and transmission that 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:50.090
 tractors are distinguished by two requirements 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:53.330
 enviable in the revolution series s the engine is 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.580
 the copal and the consecrated engine 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.180
 worldwide for its robustness and low 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.750
 consumption 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.059
 the transmission is the newest modern bt 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.260
 and revolutionary technology in 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.690
 transmission in the world 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.300
 for all that the series s conquered the 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.440
 reputation as the most versatile and 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.690
 of the category 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.049
 field tests proves 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:27.370
 between 8 and 12 per cent in the 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.370
 fuel consumption 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.210
 transmission to vt continuously 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.500
 variable is a technology exclusive to 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.689
 haco and transformed the tractors of the series 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.909
 s on a working tool 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:50.259
 highly efficient and very productive 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.939
 bt is incredibly simple you 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.439
 learn to work with her in some 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.920
 minutes 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:59.490
 so it is so successful in Europe and 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.490
 united states 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.100
 it allows speeds from 0.03 to 40 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.920
 kilometers per hour without staggering 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:18.320
 march with the transmission to the vt 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:23.510
 programmable operation modules 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:26.030
 allow for operational errors which 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.840
 increases the service life of the 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.840
 other components 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:58.970
 The transmission offers four 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:03.610
 automatic automatic operation using 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.610
 semi automatic and manual tdp 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.040
 When you start the tractor, the system 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.780
 automatically adjusts 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.430
 more economical 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.230
 seeking the best relationship between 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.930
 speed and rotation of the motor in the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.750
 independent of the conditions of the 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:28.549
 terrain the tractor will adjust and maintain 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:31.250
 the speed chosen to rotate the 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.709
 motor will be adjusted automatically 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.579
 according to the programmed speed 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:45.500
 this is the great differential speed 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:46.310
 independent of the motor rotation with 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.209
 apt 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:54.230
 the operation of the tractor is simple on the button 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.190
 1 you record the speed of work in the 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:00.919
 button 2 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:02.989
 the speed of maneuvers at the time of 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.430
 maneuvers simply push the button 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.709
 corresponding 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:11.150
 the tractor will adjust the speed 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:15.549
 You program everything very easily without 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.549
 stress and very economical 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.720
 now if you wish to see lets you 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.210
 adjust tractor operations 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.540
 from the minimum and maximum rotation of 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.540
 job 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.910
 after the rotations are set 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.940
 the tractor will be programmed to work 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.210
 within the rotation ranges and will not 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.210
 her 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:53.640
 But what's the secret of where you come from? 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.210
 so much simplicity that it does not allow mistakes 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.210
 of operation 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.740
 the transmission receives the engine power 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.910
 through an axis that is connected 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:10.230
 directly to a hydraulic pump 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:12.120
 this pump generates pressure and flow two 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.840
 transferring hydraulic motors 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:21.470
 power to the differential transferring them 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.470
 to the final gear units by moving the tractor 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.890
 this transmission is very simple it does not have 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.960
 clutch discs or bearings 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.300
 simplicity as happens with 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.900
 transfer of engine power to 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.270
 the wheel is so admired and that 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.870
 has conquered so many producers by the 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.870
 outside world 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:08.479
 the s series tractors offer other 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:12.699
 technologies you may know 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:12.699
 visiting a dealer back 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:23.820
 with tractors series sa profitability 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.820
 is guaranteed
