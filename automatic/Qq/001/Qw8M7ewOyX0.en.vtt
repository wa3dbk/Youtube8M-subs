00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
hopefully this will be informative fun

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.870 
hopefully this will be informative fun
so<00:00:25.560> when<00:00:25.740> you're<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.130> show<00:00:26.279> ring<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.670> can

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
so when you're in the show ring you can

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.839 
so when you're in the show ring you can
either<00:00:27.060> stand<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> side<00:00:28.380> like<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.849> or

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
either stand on the side like this or

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.709 
either stand on the side like this or
you<00:00:30.269> can<00:00:30.420> stand<00:00:30.599> behind<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.140> dog<00:00:32.210> is<00:00:33.210> easier<00:00:33.660> I

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
you can stand behind the dog is easier I

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.959 
you can stand behind the dog is easier I
think<00:00:33.840> do<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> side<00:00:34.920> but<00:00:35.579> everyone<00:00:35.850> has

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
think do it on the side but everyone has

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.940 
think do it on the side but everyone has
their<00:00:36.000> own<00:00:36.120> opinion<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.469> think<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.770> lot<00:00:37.920> of

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
their own opinion and I think a lot of

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.130 
their own opinion and I think a lot of
times<00:00:38.190> when<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.399> stand<00:00:38.640> behind<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.420> when

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
times when you stand behind that so when

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.540 
times when you stand behind that so when
