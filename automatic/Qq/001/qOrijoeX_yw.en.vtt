00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.569
 and it has to do with the visit of Kelly Kelly Lion to talk about a topic 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.429
 important in our family and is close to the categorization of 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.059
 video games welcome iris 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.719

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.669
 shit suddenly 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.469
 that our children already have winds but we do not know if we have suddenly 

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:26.089
 made a good purchase not 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:31.289
 that is still the right moment when the father or the mother is going to put a child 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.160
 to buy 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.999
 a game 

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:34.360
 so 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.540
 before buying the game it's good to be informed about 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.269
 what is the type of game that our guys 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.319
 they will also play the classification and avoid the first leg 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.110
 that's what we're going to talk about and we're going to talk about this German entity that 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.310
 is responsible for regulating that decision 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.120
 then what is done is on the cover for example heritage 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.750
 a videogame 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.170

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.960
 microsoft xbox whatever the console that have excessive now let's write 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.830
 that entity is in charge 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.479
 in fact informs rne 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.930
 to the parents of the person who lost everything 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.190
 what is the type of video game that is taking 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.990
 Per hundred we can appreciate

 there is even a little man in his forties at the bottom of this one min of this 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.780
 game 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.640
 if you can appreciate 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.640
 and below the initials the ts rp 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.000
 which are the initials of the entity that is responsible for regulating 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.090
 this type of videogames 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.210
 the tea that's terrible and in the accident 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.190
 entertainment are play 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.860
 maytin 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.000
 something like radi 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.100
 oooh categorization 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.200
 entertainment software 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.690
 I have translated 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.130
 We were in Spanish 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.760
 and then it comes with a big acronym 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.220
 the current one in which one in this case is one of 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.090
 the lnd the 'rascal' 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.710
 percent 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.790
 for strap 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.340
 you can all use this video game not 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.160
 this advice should decrease for children also it was for adults 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.479
 out there in Tahrir Square suddenly catch we have someday a game 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:19.449
 it's good they existed or not because it's a lot of times we find or say yes 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:20.399
 is playing but 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:24.579
 we do not know if it really is a game that he highlights and holders both his 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:29.279
 training not because imagine around there the game was releases and that 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:30.099
 they have not 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.439
 generate violence and also necessary that is where we are going to go after 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.909
 percent 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.869
 for example this game of chance 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:38.189
 has letter t 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.189
 that the one of pinto 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:46.699
 that's for right youngsters it's suddenly little and leaked to play kids 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.929
 under 12 years a little the filter I can play 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:55.539
 percent is not that the console xbox xbox like lend are three 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:59.489
 he has a catalog of games already for adults is very demanding but also 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.709
 very 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.189
 offer salaries by 15% 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.339
 that is why it causes no group that is desirable for a sector in this case 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:11.370
 I have as repeated request 3 normally the fires went to his 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:12.590
 public adult 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.519
 in this case it has the lyrics in 23 years that they extinguish of ivory 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.929
 means no no no 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:24.329
 good releases the mature letter m mature for over 17 years and 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.879
 for adults 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.340
 and now but we do we count but because it is for adults 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.739
 at the rear 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.929
 in the back and bottom 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:39.879
 if it does not say why it has been cataloged with the letter and ing 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.999
 in this case he mentioned 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:43.419
 what is blood 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:46.809
 intensive ons who are in their intense 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.829
 languages ​​language for adults 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:54.779
 and the adult content in this case is a whole for 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.789
 elderly people then 

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:59.229
 exactly 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.339
 here all grocer this trick cummins inc 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:03.359
 rp 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:08.669
 that is to say that it respects waiting tempo valentine pending kishikawa been 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.749
 cataloged because the fire 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:11.970
 it has just come out 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.110
 then when fire 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.370
 the game comes out that recommends a hundred 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.519
 Well, you do not have to understand what is normal, this is that we are a little bit because 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.549
 opposite everything 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.400
 until I'm sure that there is an act for our children to play 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.259
 what happens that what the tcr does 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.870
 once the fire companies are at stake 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.780
 the leaders a prototype a demo of the game then this the dedication has its 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.469
 fishermen with people who are in charge of testing it 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:40.360
 3 there they are in charge of seeing 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.300
 percent by means of a protocol by let's say a list of things that have 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.629
 the number of scenes 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:49.039
 be violence be blood be 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.319
 the use of profanity wearing their language xoxeños 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:57.729
 after them they try to search according to the amount that the meetings of 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.930
 this year's foods let's see this 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.629
 a tasting in the same place exactly 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:06.770
 in Europe there will be present American in Europe there another type of facts 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.120
 categorization 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.370
 this dislate that in this case is by numbers 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:14.259
 in this case we want Spanish game 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.430
 that complaint and be more than saying 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.480
 kevin 6 up if we do not find the initials of categorization of the sdr 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.009
 then we will find 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.240
 exactly the same ones that experience grief 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.480
 in this case it is 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.390
 the right-hander also and European who goes with a nomination that this one suddenly a 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.150
 a little more 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.160
 understandable not exactly the american omen 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.910
 in any of the points of the North American coast because this is a little 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.719
 ideas so they can understand them repeat the islands 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:45.199
 the procampo today 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.090
 I even think that I do not have any but there is one with the letter c to wish three 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.770
 parts for children 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.779
 is this the letter c 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:57.509
 then we have this letter g steve walsh for all 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.409
 we have the letter t 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:00.949
 teenagers 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.259
 iii we have the letter m 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.189
 ledesma 0 fortunately and mature 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:09.189
 and we have the rpt there 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.749
 in my company exactly the same and if clarification is finally provided 

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:17.919
 I especially advice for parents 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.669
 that are aware of what their children are playing thanks to no sativex and 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:24.690
 the killer as parana 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.699
 the galleon that is already waiting for us 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:28.129
 to learn Algeria
