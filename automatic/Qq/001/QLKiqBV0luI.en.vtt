I've<00:00:09.630> been<00:00:09.840> working<00:00:10.110> on<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.200> new<00:00:10.410> engine

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
I've been working on a new engine

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.379 
I've been working on a new engine
because<00:00:11.010> if<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.250> didn't<00:00:11.490> hear<00:00:11.639> about<00:00:11.849> what

happened to the old one my USB got

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.120 
happened to the old one my USB got
stolen<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:15.109> along<00:00:16.109> with<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.320> everything<00:00:16.949> else

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
minecraft Trudy engine so a back of made

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.050 
minecraft Trudy engine so a back of made
numbers<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.590> improvements<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.550> engine<00:00:26.910> as

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
numbers of improvements to the engine as

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.299 
numbers of improvements to the engine as
you<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:27.930> see<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:29.269> the<00:00:31.099> inventories<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> bit

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
you can see the the inventories a bit

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.299 
you can see the the inventories a bit
cleaner<00:00:32.840> you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:33.870> move<00:00:34.559> stuff<00:00:34.739> around<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.190> bit

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
cleaner you can move stuff around a bit

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.299 
cleaner you can move stuff around a bit
better<00:00:35.430> makes<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.880> bit<00:00:36.000> easier<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:37.739> generating

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
better makes a bit easier the generating

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.770 
better makes a bit easier the generating
code<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.640> still<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> standard<00:00:39.059> generation

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
code is still the standard generation

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.330 
code is still the standard generation
code<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.320> as<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.680> see<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.860> prettied<00:00:41.219> up

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
code but as you can see I prettied up

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.319 
code but as you can see I prettied up
the<00:00:41.780> torches<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.989> here<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.969> did<00:00:45.149> some

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
the torches of it here and I did some

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.760 
the torches of it here and I did some
other<00:00:45.450> stuff<00:00:46.190> um<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.480> made<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.440> lot<00:00:49.710> more

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
other stuff um I just made it a lot more

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.500 
other stuff um I just made it a lot more
I<00:00:50.399> gave<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.360> bit<00:00:51.539> more<00:00:51.690> performance<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.510> this

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
I gave it a bit more performance so this

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.500 
I gave it a bit more performance so this
right<00:00:54.960> now<00:00:55.199> has<00:00:55.640> like<00:00:56.640> three<00:00:56.969> times<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.390> many

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
right now has like three times as many

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.619 
right now has like three times as many
blocks<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.100> screen<00:00:59.399> as<00:00:59.699> minecraft

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
blocks on it on the screen as minecraft

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.599 
blocks on it on the screen as minecraft
2d<00:01:01.170> previous<00:01:01.739> i'm<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.190> call<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.399> from

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
2d previous i'm going to call it from

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.679 
2d previous i'm going to call it from
now<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.140> as<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.229> can<00:01:04.350> see<00:01:04.379> diamond<00:01:04.979> spawns<00:01:05.689> at

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
now and as you can see diamond spawns at

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.429 
now and as you can see diamond spawns at
surface<00:01:07.320> which<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:08.689> not<00:01:09.689> what<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.869> want<00:01:10.200> but

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
surface which is not what we want but

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.510 
surface which is not what we want but
the<00:01:10.790> generation<00:01:12.409> code<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.590> still<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.920> bit<00:01:14.130> buggy

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the generation code is still a bit buggy

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.740 
the generation code is still a bit buggy
we've<00:01:14.729> been<00:01:14.880> working<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.479> for<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.659> little

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
we've been working on it for a little

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.880 
we've been working on it for a little
while<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:17.220> know<00:01:18.350> working<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
while but you know working on it for a

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.070 
while but you know working on it for a
while<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.400> basically<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.240> terrain<00:01:21.630> make<00:01:21.930> it

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
while just basically the terrain make it

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.340 
while just basically the terrain make it
more<00:01:22.229> interesting<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.369> flat<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.350> this

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
more interesting so just flat and this

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.080 
more interesting so just flat and this
has<00:01:25.470> actually<00:01:25.590> started<00:01:25.830> from<00:01:26.220> scratch<00:01:26.460> i

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
has actually started from scratch i

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.179 
has actually started from scratch i
started<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.810> two<00:01:28.500> days<00:01:28.710> ago<00:01:29.150> actually<00:01:31.009> so<00:01:32.009> this

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
started a two days ago actually so this

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.920 
started a two days ago actually so this
is<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.000> pretty<00:01:33.180> good<00:01:33.420> i<00:01:33.659> reckon<00:01:34.310> but<00:01:35.310> it

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
is a this is pretty good i reckon but it

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.969 
is a this is pretty good i reckon but it

does help a lot that i've done a

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.859 
does help a lot that i've done a
previous<00:01:38.460> version<00:01:38.640> because<00:01:39.150> stuff<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.659> did

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
previous version because stuff that did

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.899 
previous version because stuff that did
work<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> previous<00:01:40.740> version<00:01:41.220> i<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.610> just

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
work in the previous version i can just

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.590 
work in the previous version i can just
I<00:01:42.409> can<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.530> remember<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.570> remember

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
I can just remember and I can remember

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.929 
I can just remember and I can remember
all<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.140> troubles<00:01:46.470> i<00:01:46.560> had<00:01:46.710> with<00:01:46.890> number<00:01:47.549> with

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
all the troubles i had with number with

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.810 
all the troubles i had with number with
2d<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.600> i've<00:01:49.350> thought<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.770> ways<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.130> i<00:01:50.460> can

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
2d and i've thought of ways that i can

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.560 
2d and i've thought of ways that i can
improve<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:53.399> much<00:01:53.520> else<00:01:53.759> than<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.000> so

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
improve it but so much else than that so

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.880 
improve it but so much else than that so
