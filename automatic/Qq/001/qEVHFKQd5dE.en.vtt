 with a decrease in the number of vehicles 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.730

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.980

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.910
 especially a lot of work was in the center on 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.590
 rises in the main streets of the city of Lenin 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.590

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.240
 overcome slippery snowy rise 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.430
 Far from all drivers managed 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.080
 stuck in the middle of the roadway they 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.450
 almost completely blocked 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.760
 movement firemen moved prisoners with 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:57.250
 seats with a towing cable and 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:59.260
 KAMAZ somewhere to push stuck cars 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.270
 we had to hand oversize us 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.430
 KAMAZ maneuver on a narrow road 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.080
 it was difficult to other people's troubles not 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.010
 remained indifferent and the owners 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.650
 SUVs 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.650
 they willingly connected to auto evacuation 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.970
 I thought my all-wheel drive did not care 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.460
 they got here 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.600
 the question is helping a person a lot already 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.369
 helped that lope slightly considers the studio to 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.140
 work is not connected to the profile 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.570
 firefighters from almost all parts 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.700
 cities on duty carried mostly on 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.619
 especially problem areas only in 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.040
 the central part of Khabarovsk for three hours 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.410
 pulled over five dozen cars 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.700
 pushing cars they get stuck 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:42.840

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.229
 about 60 cars including buses 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.850
 trucks with dr from basically 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.830
 rear wheel drive who did not have time to change their shoes 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.229
 citizens as usual in such situations 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.390
 not too flattering about work 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.000
 road builders say roads from snow in 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.510
 time is not cleared from here and many hours 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.790
 traffic jams 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.990
 however, many do not take responsibility 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.900
 from the drivers themselves 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.709
 but this winter you are ready to land 1 chain 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.810
 and do not leave the poles honestly just those 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.069

 toyota corona and nissan vanette 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.599
 none of the participants of this accident 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.090
 suffered accident happened from discharge 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.950
 frivolous but annoying speed machines 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.930
 there was a small but toyota driver 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.620

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.630
 running 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.640

 says that control is lost in that 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.620
 the moment when one wheel car drove 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.390
 on the tram tracks a young man 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.640
 knew very well what the danger posed 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.739
 rails and tried to drive them over but under 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.019
 snow just did not see them 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.130
 unmanaged sedan dragged yuzom on
