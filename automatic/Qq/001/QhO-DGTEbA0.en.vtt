changes<00:02:36.600> we've<00:02:36.810> made<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.110> our<00:02:37.140> network<00:02:37.620> these

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
changes we've made to our network these

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.710 
changes we've made to our network these
will<00:02:38.670> allow<00:02:38.850> students<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.300> write<00:02:39.510> their<00:02:39.690> own

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
will allow students to write their own

will allow students to write their own
code<00:02:40.080> start<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.160> explore<00:02:41.459> computer<00:02:41.910> languages

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
code start to explore computer languages

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.890 
code start to explore computer languages
like<00:02:42.870> Python<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:43.980> how<00:02:44.130> have<00:02:44.250> we<00:02:44.340> done<00:02:44.489> it<00:02:44.900> well

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
like Python so how have we done it well

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.509 
like Python so how have we done it well
the<00:02:45.989> first<00:02:46.200> thing<00:02:46.319> we<00:02:46.530> did<00:02:46.590> was<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.220> create<00:02:47.340> a

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
the first thing we did was to create a

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.030 
the first thing we did was to create a
virtual<00:02:48.060> network<00:02:48.480> this<00:02:49.080> runs<00:02:49.350> inside<00:02:49.620> our

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
virtual network this runs inside our

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.460 
virtual network this runs inside our
standard<00:02:50.459> network<00:02:50.819> but<00:02:51.300> safeguards<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:52.080> and

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
standard network but safeguards it and

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.710 
standard network but safeguards it and
it<00:02:52.830> means<00:02:52.980> students<00:02:53.580> can<00:02:53.760> now<00:02:53.790> create<00:02:54.330> code

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
it means students can now create code

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.500 
it means students can now create code
and<00:02:54.989> run<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.800> we<00:02:56.340> can't<00:02:56.610> accidentally<00:02:57.150> corrupt

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
and run it we can't accidentally corrupt

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.809 
and run it we can't accidentally corrupt
any<00:02:57.690> system<00:02:58.050> files<00:02:58.319> now<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.400> took<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.700> while

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
any system files now this took a while

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.759 
any system files now this took a while
but<00:03:00.569> I<00:03:00.660> think<00:03:00.840> it's<00:03:00.959> going<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.170> be<00:03:01.230> worth<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.680> in

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
but I think it's going to be worth it in

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.560 
but I think it's going to be worth it in
the<00:03:01.799> long<00:03:01.890> term<00:03:02.310> because<00:03:02.910> we<00:03:03.060> can<00:03:03.209> now<00:03:03.329> allows

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
the long term because we can now allows

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.960 
the long term because we can now allows
students<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.049> code<00:03:04.320> creatively<00:03:05.070> without<00:03:05.730> any

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970
