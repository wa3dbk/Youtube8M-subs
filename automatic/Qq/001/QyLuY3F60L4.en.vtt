00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
from their swatches there's really not

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.870 
from their swatches there's really not
much<00:02:16.970> of<00:02:17.150> comparison<00:02:17.930> pigment<00:02:18.830> wise<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.640> mac

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
much of comparison pigment wise the mac

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.990 
much of comparison pigment wise the mac
is<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:20.180> lot<00:02:20.780> more<00:02:21.320> pigmented<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.250> that's<00:02:22.790> good

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
is a lot more pigmented and that's good

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.820 
is a lot more pigmented and that's good
in<00:02:23.120> some<00:02:23.390> ways<00:02:23.570> but<00:02:23.810> it's<00:02:23.990> bad<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:24.470> others<00:02:24.800> I

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
in some ways but it's bad and others I

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.680 
in some ways but it's bad and others I
mean<00:02:25.100> I<00:02:25.130> personally<00:02:25.340> like<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.270> it's<00:02:26.420> clear

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
mean I personally like that it's clear

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.300 
mean I personally like that it's clear
pigmented<00:02:27.170> because<00:02:27.530> obviously<00:02:27.770> I'm<00:02:28.100> very

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
pigmented because obviously I'm very

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.200 
pigmented because obviously I'm very
pale<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:29.480> it's<00:02:29.900> like<00:02:30.170> it's<00:02:30.950> easier<00:02:31.430> for<00:02:31.730> me<00:02:32.180> to

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
pale so it's like it's easier for me to

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.060 
pale so it's like it's easier for me to
like<00:02:32.510> put<00:02:32.540> on<00:02:32.990> I<00:02:33.050> guess<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.650> have<00:02:33.770> a<00:02:33.800> lot<00:02:34.040> of

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
like put on I guess and have a lot of

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.950 
like put on I guess and have a lot of
color<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.670> not<00:02:34.820> use<00:02:35.000> as<00:02:35.150> much<00:02:35.270> product<00:02:35.630> so

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
color and not use as much product so

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.840 
color and not use as much product so
that's<00:02:36.140> really<00:02:36.260> nice<00:02:36.500> for<00:02:36.770> me<00:02:36.920> but<00:02:37.670> at<00:02:37.760> the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
that's really nice for me but at the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.340 
that's really nice for me but at the
same<00:02:38.030> time<00:02:38.270> like<00:02:38.540> if<00:02:38.690> you're<00:02:38.870> not<00:02:38.990> comfortable

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
same time like if you're not comfortable

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.770 
same time like if you're not comfortable
with<00:02:39.800> using<00:02:40.040> blush<00:02:40.400> or<00:02:40.730> you're<00:02:41.180> new<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.600> make

with using blush or you're new to make

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.940 
with using blush or you're new to make
up<00:02:41.960> you<00:02:42.110> might<00:02:42.230> want<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.530> stick<00:02:42.710> with<00:02:42.740> the

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
up you might want to stick with the

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.100 
up you might want to stick with the
Revlon<00:02:43.340> simply<00:02:43.760> because<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.120> fact<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.600> it

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
Revlon simply because the fact that it

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.400

layers<00:02:45.740> very<00:02:46.160> well<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:46.790> of<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.990> fact<00:02:48.230> that

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410

fingers it's that easy to use but the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.320 
fingers it's that easy to use but the
mac<00:03:23.600> however<00:03:24.110> because<00:03:24.650> it's<00:03:24.950> more<00:03:25.700> pigmented

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
kind of watch out for that it takes a

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.440 
kind of watch out for that it takes a
lot<00:03:34.070> of<00:03:34.100> practice<00:03:34.550> to<00:03:34.700> learn<00:03:34.730> how<00:03:34.880> to<00:03:35.120> apply
