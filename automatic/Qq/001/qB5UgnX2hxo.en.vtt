 certificate made for iphone and this 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.910

 back and sides of the phone from 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.469

 she worn on top of the cover yes 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.850

 for example during a long trip you can 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.850
 feel free to use gps navigator and not 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.510
 afraid that the phone will be discharged after 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.510
 several hours there are two options
