00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
plastic pieces go in the wheel just the

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.430 
plastic pieces go in the wheel just the
hole<00:02:22.030> through<00:02:22.240> there<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.390> stuck<00:02:22.750> out<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:23.250> brass<00:02:24.250> a

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
hole through there I stuck out a brass a

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.550 
hole through there I stuck out a brass a
little<00:02:26.440> square<00:02:27.510> thing<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.780> square<00:02:29.170> tubing

through<00:02:29.800> there<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.100> there<00:02:30.250> drilled<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:30.580> hole

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
through there and there drilled a hole

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.460 
through there and there drilled a hole
just<00:02:31.330> big<00:02:31.420> square<00:02:31.870> tubing

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
just big square tubing

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.730 
just big square tubing
I<00:02:32.550> just<00:02:33.550> steps<00:02:33.880> in<00:02:34.030> there<00:02:34.209> I<00:02:34.480> think<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:35.410> can<00:02:35.620> also

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
I just steps in there I think I can also

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.520 
I just steps in there I think I can also
kind<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.130> take<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.400> up<00:02:36.780> finding<00:02:37.780> out<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:40.530> first

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
kind of take it up finding out but first

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
kind of take it up finding out but first
of<00:02:41.770> all<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:42.010> little<00:02:42.280> boy<00:02:43.350> can<00:02:44.350> also<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:45.040> think<00:02:45.340> I

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
of all a little boy can also I think I

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.530 
of all a little boy can also I think I
might<00:02:45.700> shorten<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.150> up

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
might shorten it up

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.140 
might shorten it up
so<00:02:46.810> can<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.459> flip<00:02:48.459> forward<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:50.200> sit<00:02:50.620> down<00:02:51.150> down

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
so can I flip forward and sit down down

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.840 
so can I flip forward and sit down down
in<00:02:52.300> there

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
in there

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:01.080 
in there
toggle<00:02:54.850> be<00:02:54.940> shorter<00:02:55.269> but<00:02:56.430> there's<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.790> I

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
toggle be shorter but there's that and I

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.479 
toggle be shorter but there's that and I
have<00:03:01.420> these<00:03:01.570> all<00:03:01.780> these<00:03:01.989> lines<00:03:05.310> just<00:03:06.310> sits

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
have these all these lines just sits

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.770 
have these all these lines just sits
down<00:03:06.610> on<00:03:06.940> there<00:03:07.209> that<00:03:09.299> and<00:03:10.299> that<00:03:10.480> looks<00:03:10.630> pretty

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
the trucks and it's got a third axle on

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
the trucks and it's got a third axle on
it<00:03:55.489> up<00:03:55.670> front<00:03:55.970> so<00:03:57.340> that's<00:03:58.340> what<00:03:58.580> and<00:03:58.880> then<00:03:59.120> they

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
it up front so that's what and then they

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.650 
it up front so that's what and then they
just<00:03:59.569> there's<00:03:59.930> one<00:04:00.140> that's<00:04:00.319> just<00:04:01.300> that<00:04:02.300> truck

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
just there's one that's just that truck

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.479 
just there's one that's just that truck
so<00:04:03.200> it<00:04:03.380> just<00:04:03.709> looks<00:04:04.220> like<00:04:06.130> just<00:04:07.130> looks<00:04:07.340> like

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
so it just looks like just looks like

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:07.960 
so it just looks like just looks like
that

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
that

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.550 
that
I<00:04:08.920> think<00:04:09.920> so

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
I think so

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.190 
I think so
the<00:04:12.560> only<00:04:12.709> time<00:04:12.950> you<00:04:13.880> need<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.390> third<00:04:14.569> axle<00:04:15.050> is

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
the only time you need a third axle is

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.620 
the only time you need a third axle is
it<00:04:15.380> I<00:04:15.650> don't<00:04:16.040> know<00:04:16.100> how<00:04:16.250> much<00:04:16.400> time<00:04:16.910> it<00:04:17.090> is<00:04:17.269> but
