light changing it's very dramatic in the
video<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.530> it's<00:00:52.769> very<00:00:53.129> smooth<00:00:53.960> transition

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
video so it's very smooth transition

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.070 
video so it's very smooth transition
between<00:00:55.409> bright<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.640> dark<00:00:56.940> areas<00:00:57.500> um<00:00:59.299> it<00:01:00.299> is

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
between bright and dark areas um it is

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.240 
between bright and dark areas um it is
not<00:01:01.940> fisheye<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.540> it<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.750> very<00:01:04.229> wide<00:01:04.559> angle<00:01:04.769> so

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
not fisheye but it is very wide angle so

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.680 
not fisheye but it is very wide angle so
you'll<00:01:05.460> notice<00:01:05.790> when<00:01:05.970> you're<00:01:06.090> panning<00:01:06.540> or

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
on 14 millimeter well you think $400

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.170 
on 14 millimeter well you think $400
lens<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.690> can't<00:02:42.990> be<00:02:43.170> all<00:02:43.320> that<00:02:43.530> great<00:02:43.880> well<00:02:44.880> if

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
say it's a little less sharp than a

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.640 
say it's a little less sharp than a

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
stop which is around a 300 f-stop so it

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.979
