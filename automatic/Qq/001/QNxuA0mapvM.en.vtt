nozzle I took out of the one gallon can
I'm<00:00:23.880> gonna<00:00:24.029> see<00:00:24.300> how<00:00:24.539> much<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:24.960> is

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
I'm gonna see how much of this is

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.420 
I'm gonna see how much of this is
siphoned<00:00:25.529> versus<00:00:25.800> how<00:00:25.920> much<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.279> is

siphoned versus how much of this is

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.920 
siphoned versus how much of this is
pumping<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.180> capable<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.720> pumping

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
pumping and this is capable of pumping

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.009 
pumping and this is capable of pumping
this<00:00:28.560> we're<00:00:28.800> just<00:00:28.920> gonna<00:00:29.039> press<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:30.019> start

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
two and a half gallons per minute I've

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.679 
two and a half gallons per minute I've
got<00:00:58.739> four<00:00:59.219> with<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.550> embattled

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:12.490 

we<00:01:06.229> were<00:01:06.320> gonna<00:01:06.439> check<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.189> flow<00:01:07.670> I<00:01:10.090> mean<00:01:11.500> not

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
we were gonna check the flow I mean not

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.249 
we were gonna check the flow I mean not
really<00:01:12.619> flowing<00:01:13.009> that<00:01:13.310> fast<00:01:13.840> but<00:01:14.840> I<00:01:14.869> mean<00:01:15.110> it

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
really flowing that fast but I mean it

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:22.719 
really flowing that fast but I mean it
is<00:01:15.380> pumping<00:01:15.770> it<00:01:15.890> up<00:01:18.100> as<00:01:19.100> you<00:01:19.220> can<00:01:19.369> see<00:01:21.729> looks

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
is pumping it up as you can see looks

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.389 
is pumping it up as you can see looks
like<00:01:22.909> it<00:01:23.149> turned<00:01:23.539> itself<00:01:23.869> off<00:01:24.140> gas<00:01:24.710> retracted

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
like it turned itself off gas retracted

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.300 
like it turned itself off gas retracted
a<00:01:25.429> little<00:01:25.579> bit<00:01:25.700> down<00:01:25.850> left<00:01:26.119> in<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.360> hose<00:01:27.310> take

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
a little bit down left in the hose take

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.740 
a little bit down left in the hose take
this<00:01:28.520> out<00:01:29.439> so<00:01:30.439> when<00:01:30.619> it<00:01:30.710> hits<00:01:31.000> that<00:01:32.000> fill<00:01:32.509> line

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
this out so when it hits that fill line

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.649 
this out so when it hits that fill line
right<00:01:33.020> there<00:01:33.259> this<00:01:33.530> marking<00:01:34.039> right<00:01:34.579> here<00:01:34.880> it

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
right there this marking right here it

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.380 
right there this marking right here it
automatically<00:01:36.110> stops<00:01:36.560> filling<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.250> tank<00:01:37.520> so

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
automatically stops filling the tank so

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.240 
automatically stops filling the tank so
you<00:01:38.420> have<00:01:38.750> a<00:01:39.399> properly<00:01:40.399> filled<00:01:40.819> tank<00:01:42.250> overall

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
you have a properly filled tank overall

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.770 
you have a properly filled tank overall
not<00:01:43.429> bad<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:45.170> then<00:01:45.349> turn<00:01:45.619> this<00:01:45.799> around<00:01:45.979> and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
not bad and then turn this around and

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.910 
not bad and then turn this around and
this<00:01:47.780> actually<00:01:48.349> stores<00:01:49.189> in<00:01:49.459> here<00:01:50.770> you<00:01:51.770> do<00:01:51.890> a

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
this actually stores in here you do a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.710 
this actually stores in here you do a
little<00:01:52.069> bit<00:01:52.220> of<00:01:52.310> gas<00:01:52.490> left<00:01:52.789> in<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.060> tube

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
little bit of gas left in the tube

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.980 
little bit of gas left in the tube
see<00:01:54.530> how<00:01:54.590> harder<00:01:54.830> just<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:54.979> get<00:01:55.130> this<00:01:55.280> out<00:01:55.990> hold

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
see how harder just to get this out hold

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.059 
see how harder just to get this out hold
the<00:01:57.140> tube<00:01:57.439> up<00:02:01.750> it<00:02:02.750> looks<00:02:03.200> like<00:02:03.380> we're<00:02:03.560> good

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
the tube up it looks like we're good

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.360 
the tube up it looks like we're good
drained<00:02:05.060> in
