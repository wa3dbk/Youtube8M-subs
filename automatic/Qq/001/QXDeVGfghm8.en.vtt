00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.519
 i 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.200
 I see producer verbenero new micro is a young author selling young 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.199
 cave kill talking about the genre 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.070
 or mario mondino on a theme 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.850
 important that the first occasion of the dairy rodeo and especially 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.560
 what characteristics does each of the foods that we are giving today have 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.470
 feeding the rodeos 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.210
 one of the main components of milk production in other fields in 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.740
 feeding 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.820
 of a correct intake of animals 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.680
 percent in December the dry matter needed 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.740
 in quantity and quality depends not only the promised ones but 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.360
 as well 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.970
 the health of animals 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.990
 normally this seems very simple this proposal must adapt 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.310
 the amount of food rodents need to eat per day in what is not 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.500
 does the field well 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.640
 that's why we thought it was wise to talk a little bit about the sector today 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.680
 dry matter about which a little is known not only the producers but 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.420
 also to those responsible 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.750
 in the fields of the feeding that is the tambero a operario of the cut 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.460
 but before speaking a bit about what is the different percentage of matter 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.460
 dry water water from food 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.659
 percent it seems very interesting democratic in very simple way 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.300
 acz what is the dry matter of food 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.730
 specifically 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.119
 the in what remains a food once the water is extracted 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.890
 you can not be cheap 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.670
 a sample of alfalfa are exactly 100 grams submitted 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.420
 aa the heat in that case of simÃ³n a microwave evaporates the water and remains what 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.550
 that we know as dry matter 30 grams in this case of 101 left 30 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.189
 we speak forgiveness 20 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:23.619
 we are talking specifically about the percentage of dry matter of these 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:26.630
 Alfalfa samples is 20% 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.720
 20 grams 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.849
 they said that we had naturally 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.569
 this is very important because the only way to adjust the diet the ration 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:35.289
 daily 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:37.990
 is our animals is to do it in function 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.349
 of dry food packaging 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.019
 but what about the other components 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.829
 for example something very used at this time of year the silage 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.249
 corn silage and sorghum lage 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:55.400
 whose percentage of dry matter can oxidize between 25% to 30% 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.819
 we have here specifically a sample 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.709
 of a portion of silage in this case were 200 grams of berra material 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.230
 which one is given from the bag 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.329
 and there were 60 grams left 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.449
 her through a very simple account 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:16.230
 this case in this sample silage the percentage dry matter 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.390
 is 30% can be 35 can be 25 depends 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.110
 at the moment when it 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.760
 between applying the crop 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.229
 and finally at the other end we have the so-called concentrated 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:33.090
 you can see here a sample of balanced a sample of it 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.479
 corn grain 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:37.430
 this concentrates have very little water 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.370
 we are usually talking about the percentage of matter 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.499
 it's 90% 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:44.410
 it means that we have 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.510
 percentages within what we use with mind 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.030
 as in the case of the position that goes between a 25 and is 25% dry matter the and 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:59.359
 those that have between 25 40% the concentrates that are the other end 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.889
 with a high percentage of dry matter 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:07.419
 the interesting thing in these cases is to be very clear about this concept. 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:12.829
 esther cite it to the ends that we can with the elements make it up 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.979
 that we answer by feeding ourselves with animals 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:16.890
 doing by applying this 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.189
 percentage of dry matter that we do not need 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:24.869
 efe to the daily do it if we stop table of foods that be to the businessman 

00:04:24.869 --> 00:04:29.300
 the one in charge of getting the responsible tampon or cinema that we can adjust in 

00:04:29.299 --> 00:04:33.710
 these concepts under these concepts the iv party we go wrong the only way 

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:35.039
 to do it 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.039
 through this procedure doing a summation 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.440
 of all the components we can get to determine 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.189
 how much our cow consumes our rodeo 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:47.199
 let's always consider a premise 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.449
 per kilo of dry matter that eat a zapatazo 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.629
 we can pretend at least 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:53.939
 one liter of milk 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:55.150
 means 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.820
 that if we are very good giving between 18 and 20 kilos keep dry 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.220
 we can pretend 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.730
 that our rodeo is with a production of 18 to peace 20 liters per 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.380
 day 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.330
 then remember very well because these important 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.240
 the dry matter in what remains a food once it brought moisture 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.820
 and that's very important to know in order to correctly adjust the 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.629
 feeding our game 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:25.849
 We appreciate the young task of arresting Mario Montero, we hope it was 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:27.410
 priority you want to 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.659
 served to clarify a little 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:34.379
 p the dry matter contents of the different foods that we offer 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:39.029
 our rodeo and that many times the volume of food does not mean that 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:44.139
 be a hundred let's say tapped eye that will not be to produce a lot of 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:45.189
 milk many times 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:49.159
 another highly concentrated food as there will only be employment regulation that raises 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:50.500
 shot hit 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.970
 important the promotion and I think that worse can be explained 2 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.160
 that prior to the concentration of dry matter that has that element of 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.539
 relationship to others such as the invoice 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:04.030
 We hope house will be operated and we will meet again and I will be the week 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.710
 comes many other
