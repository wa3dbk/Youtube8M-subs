00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.230
 walk 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.549
 is one of the most anticipated games of 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.179
 this year 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.890
 metal gear solid 'the phantom paint but 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.710
 a very interesting theory has emerged 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.410
 about it a theory that the truth 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.660
 of some very solid arguments this 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.750
 theory is neither more nor less than big box 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.950
 the big box that we see in this game is not 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.320
 other than great fox 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.000
 in this and other videos I will review 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.930
 this theory and see your bases today 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.200
 concretely let's start with your 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.200
 appearance 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.180
 ok let's start talking about this 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.190
 theory with this promotional image as 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.410
 you see in this picture you see the evolution 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.510
 of the protagonists of metal gear to what 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.600
 long history and when we can sound 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.550
 see three big box if we look at the big 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.040
 box of pace walker and the big box of 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.979
 ground zero have their name under 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.860
 key the nickname of big box the nickname that 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.020
 it was won but under banners bake not 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.720
 there is nothing this image can be the 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.330
 first test that shows that you see nome 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.780
 snake is not really big box but 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.780
 let's continue 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.720
 well here we find a shot 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.250
 of big box on the admission principle 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.750
 cron heros the first thing that calls 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.690
 attention is what age what is 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.909
 You can turn a gray beard a face 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.000
 full of wrinkles but let's compare 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.530
 this image with one of filton paint 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.530
 taken from the same angle 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.970
 well here we have the tics bots gates 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.230
 of the phantom 20 and grow cyrus lo 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.180
 first we can appreciate is that the 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.790
 the phantom 20 does not have gray hair on 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.010
 beard does not have some waters are marked 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.220
 like black a heros and we're talking 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.140
 that nine years have passed since 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.720
 to the phantom paint and nobody would say 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.580
 because he looks younger they leave him with 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.610
 penis but well let's continue with more 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.010
 images 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.390
 If one thing is clear everything is a fan of 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.550
 metal day 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.640
 is that big box has blue eyes 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.300
 but hey I snake technicolor what 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.790
 it gets good many people claim that the 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.700
 color of venom snake are not blue but 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.090
 green and that could be another clue to 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:51.670
 that this character this big box is not in 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.670
 true big box judge yourselves 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.170
 well and we continue with an image 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.430
 The phantom paint's promotional 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.739
 image and we have seen much of him 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.810
 long video but it's calling us 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.760
 much attention for the position of 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.769
 snake in this image by the post of his 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.340
 hand which between opens a little the 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.019
 fingers in that right eye which we 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.900
 it makes you think a lot about the tree you made 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.450
 in his day today and without water to guide 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.129
 alone one more specifically with the 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.010
 serious fox character in which of a 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.720
 very similar but this time with 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.240
 the hand between the emitter does not enter 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.770
 fingers you saw the visor of your helmet 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.620
 and what calls us that you understand that 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.350
 I thought about a clue of how good I snake 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.170
 it's not the real pit box and that 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.870
 maybe there's something behind that patch 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.450
 more but to talk about this we would have 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.170
 that see the trailer of e3 of 2013 is the 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.170
 fame tom payne 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.600
 you noticed we will not return to 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.600
 watch 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.470
 Well, what we are supposed to be doing 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.220
 watching here is uptick box in the eye 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.080
 straight 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.540
 in these situations like putting it on 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.150
 well and this is also within this 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.120
 theory that it may be that this pivot 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.460
 let's not recognize since it does not have 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.700
 no sense that the 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.760
 right eye since it does not have it only 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.500
 you have to remember metal gear solid 3 but 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.570
 you do not fix only on the useful gesture but 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.520
 also or listening to it there is a small click 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.520
 every time he is touching his eye 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.610
 you can also think that the 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:02.069
 spin eyepieces looking for them using 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.610
 so quickly can they be neither more nor 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:07.439
 less than also his own right eye 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.569
 and by the way you know which character also 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:11.719
 lost the eye of the fact in the metal saga 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:11.719
 gear 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.490
 cryptome 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.370
 as I see in this picture metal gear 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.910
 solid 'of playstation and also in the 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.400
 whiskey 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.430
 and now as before we are going to do the 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.590
 comparative images this time with a 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.330
 of the first images that came out 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.770
 when presenting the fox engine engine 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.770
 by konami 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.280
 for this was the demonstration image 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.440
 what did the fox engine do with me 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.210
 and what many people will come to say 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.520
 is that it looks a lot like great fox 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.520
 and in fact if we look plastic thesis 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.849
 that he has in his head is just 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.190
 where would be the scar where it comes out 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:58.460
 the horn unless it's a horn so 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:01.249
 strange that has 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.669
 the coincidences we can choose 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:07.699
 but we go where the bases more 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.680
 they have caught my attention we will be 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:12.820
 metal gear 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.820
 solid snake 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:19.080
 ok snake just beat a great box 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.760
 for the first time after a bloody 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.550
 Fight 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:27.030
 the zinc asks him why he has 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.490
 decided to go to a big box after 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.550
 be in the first game kidnap him to be 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.030
 gray fox says that the situation is very 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.720
 complicated 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:41.180
 tells him about the experiences he asked 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.940
 next to big box and 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.370
 the times that I do them but we have 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.639
 to be with the second the second is 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.639
 the most important 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:53.200
 and it's the one you see here the second time it was 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.030
 more also 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.760
 I was being tortured by a soldier 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.720
 of re hand and I went back to save 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:03.030
 they cut my nose and my ears 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.370
 and now let's see an image of 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:08.130
 penonomÃ© aesthetic from this perspective 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.770
 we can see how it has a cut in 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:13.440
 his ear and another cut in the root and if 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.020
 let's go to lauro perspectives we see how 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.360
 it also has another cut in this 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.550
 ear on the right ear and people 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:24.090
 that will say good this can be for the 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:26.940
 down hero events good come on 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:29.280
 to show another image is that you are already 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:33.000
 watching here on screen and well this is 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:36.350
 the nine year hospital loophole 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.350
 after awakening 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:42.400
 big box and as you can see there is no 

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:44.550
 ear scar 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.330
 you can also see a curious thing 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:50.659
 before we said 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:53.980
 when pivots the expert nine years 

00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:56.560
 then appreciate much younger 

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.470
 now it looks old again 

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.020
 curious 

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:04.110
 and if growth heros had not gone beyond 

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:08.430
 truth and if it were all a kind of 

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:12.470
 good virtual vision all this already 

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:12.470
 we will talk in the next video
