00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.110
 Edward this 3 part on assembling bikes 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.110
 with motor 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.490
 but 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.300
 who did not look past parts is desirable 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.179
 see their links leave in the description 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.519
 and so I finally did collect special motor 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.680
 in general, we will now fill in gasoline and 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.930
 try out shorter in the canister scored 9 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.269
 liters as written in the instructions for 1 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.280
 liter when running motor need to pour 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.379
 sixty five milliliters shorter oil 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.059
 mix the right proportion pour 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.059
 gasoline gas tank go ride 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.170
 and so in general I collected this thing in 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.479
 Basically everything is working fine, I already 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.780
 tested a little ride all 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.030
 works fine and so now I will show 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.619
 you how to start it and tell you how 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.530
 it all works is obtained in order 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.590
 to start you need to hold the grip 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.929
 and put the lock could not necessarily 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.459
 can of course hold by hand after 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.670
 how to put the lock dial 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:57.920
 let go of low speed on the pedals 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.869
 The axles and the engine will also start 2 photos 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.079
 in order for the viewer to get 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.959
 the clutch should be in that condition 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:12.340
 just take the bike and push it 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:12.340
 pedal to think 25 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.520
 and as we see the engine started 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.120
 . 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.790
 in general, how much I ride on this motor 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.530
 never legs are burned in general 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.770
 many wrote in the comments that the legs 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.480
 burn but that the first time I put this 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.130
 motor many do not burn that's how not 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.890
 try if your feet and here 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.190
 not overshadow and only in this case 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.440
 can burn the legs attack actually everything 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.930
 safe of course it all runs high 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.420
 but the legs don't move over here 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.300
 the temperature is not very big 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.060
 cylinder legs do not touch and further too 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.730
 You can turn it turns out if we allow 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.800
 motor well what's up there gasoline not 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.050
 enough it turns out just pinch 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.090
 clutch and you can go on the clutch and 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.390
 it will be the same as usual 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.390
 bicycle 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.419
 so I rolled in principle ride all 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.820
 just awesome speed gaining very 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.039
 ok now we will check the maximum 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.860
 speed and average using the app 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.600
 speedometer to attach 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.280
 worked need turn on mobile 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.280
 internet and gps navigator 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:02.850
 and so in general I will check how fast 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:06.720
 I'm going to see it now in general 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:09.780
 program recorded and so in general average 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.960
 speed of 32 kilometers per hour that's how you 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.540
 see and the maximum speed is 56 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.140
 kilometer per hour in general this principle 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.610
 normal speed is gaining good but 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.950
 also show here are obtained 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.920
 how much you drove pretty 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.750
 convenient application 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.750
 so that the bike rode 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.730
 faster 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.880
 so you get you need to remove this one 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.270
 here is the muffler cover here it is 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.910
 here 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.460
 I called you Bolton 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.950
 remove this cover unscrew this 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.730
 bolt and he will have you go faster 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.230
 about 10 or 20 kilometers an hour 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.860
 and accordingly he will make a little noise 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:56.180
 write more 6 kilometers an hour 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.180
 quite a good indicator 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.130
 well that 's all 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.480
 the bike turned out really 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:18.640
 good rides as it should be absolutely 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.650
 everyone can deliver it rather not 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.060
 difficult well what if you liked it 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.800
