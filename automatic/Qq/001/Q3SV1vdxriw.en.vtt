00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.259 

by<00:00:45.379> Oh<00:00:45.410> 50<00:00:45.769> is<00:00:45.920> very<00:00:46.129> easy<00:00:46.309> to<00:00:46.370> apply<00:00:46.640> but<00:00:47.149> it

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269 
by Oh 50 is very easy to apply but it

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:48.910 
by Oh 50 is very easy to apply but it
takes<00:00:47.480> me<00:00:47.629> less<00:00:47.899> than<00:00:47.960> a<00:00:48.170> minute<00:00:48.350> to<00:00:48.500> put<00:00:48.769> on

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
takes me less than a minute to put on

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.229 
takes me less than a minute to put on
and<00:00:49.190> after<00:00:49.820> that<00:00:49.969> my<00:00:50.239> hair<00:00:50.510> looks<00:00:50.539> great

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
and after that my hair looks great

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.819 
and after that my hair looks great
first<00:00:53.239> of<00:00:53.359> all<00:00:53.479> eyes<00:00:53.930> tell<00:00:54.409> my<00:00:54.500> hair<00:00:54.680> in<00:00:54.769> the

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
first of all eyes tell my hair in the

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.130 
first of all eyes tell my hair in the
way<00:00:54.979> I<00:00:55.010> want<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:56.239> second<00:00:56.539> step<00:00:56.750> is<00:00:57.079> to

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
way I want the second step is to

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.899 
way I want the second step is to
sprinkle<00:00:57.619> the<00:00:57.710> fibers<00:00:58.100> onto<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:58.610> thinning

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
sprinkle the fibers onto the thinning

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.240 
sprinkle the fibers onto the thinning
areas<00:00:59.210> to<00:00:59.510> conceal<00:00:59.839> the<00:00:59.960> hair<00:01:00.110> loss<00:01:00.289> and<00:01:00.589> then

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
areas to conceal the hair loss and then

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.549 
areas to conceal the hair loss and then
Pat<00:01:01.460> them<00:01:01.640> into<00:01:01.820> place

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
Pat them into place

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.960 
Pat them into place
the<00:01:03.559> final<00:01:03.860> step<00:01:04.070> is<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.309> use<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.549> Lachlan

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
the final step is to use the Lachlan

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.420 
the final step is to use the Lachlan
list<00:01:05.149> just<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.049> few<00:01:06.200> sprays<00:01:06.500> to<00:01:06.950> lock<00:01:07.100> all<00:01:07.280> the

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
list just a few sprays to lock all the

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.380 
list just a few sprays to lock all the
fibers<00:01:07.820> into<00:01:08.149> position<00:01:08.570> I<00:01:09.850> was<00:01:10.850> worried<00:01:11.210> that

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
fibers into position I was worried that

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.540 
fibers into position I was worried that
the<00:01:11.570> product<00:01:11.990> wasn't<00:01:12.440> gonna<00:01:12.619> work<00:01:12.950> especially

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
the product wasn't gonna work especially

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.300 
the product wasn't gonna work especially
when<00:01:13.670> sweating<00:01:14.090> into<00:01:14.240> a<00:01:14.390> physical<00:01:14.690> exercise

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
when sweating into a physical exercise

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.969

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
but when am i running and jogging and I

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.020 
but when am i running and jogging and I
used<00:01:19.130> to<00:01:19.220> sweat<00:01:19.460> a<00:01:19.490> lot

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030

fibers of my head I still had a big head
of<00:01:25.250> hair<00:01:26.319> when<00:01:27.319> I<00:01:27.350> had<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.590> buy<00:01:27.710> a<00:01:27.740> fake<00:01:28.069> on<00:01:28.580> my

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
of hair when I had to buy a fake on my

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.719 
of hair when I had to buy a fake on my
hair<00:01:29.000> I<00:01:29.240> I<00:01:30.140> feel<00:01:30.560> I<00:01:30.619> can<00:01:30.830> be<00:01:30.860> myself<00:01:31.100> again<00:01:31.580> and

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
hair I I feel I can be myself again and

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.640 
hair I I feel I can be myself again and
I<00:01:32.509> want<00:01:32.690> to<00:01:32.780> show<00:01:32.959> that<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.170> everyone

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.180 

I<00:01:42.690> would<00:01:43.690> recommend<00:01:43.960> splat<00:01:44.380> effect<00:01:44.710> to

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
I would recommend splat effect to

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.580 
I would recommend splat effect to
everyone<00:01:45.640> who<00:01:46.240> has<00:01:46.390> thinning<00:01:46.750> areas<00:01:47.050> he<00:01:47.440> has

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
everyone who has thinning areas he has

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.590 
everyone who has thinning areas he has
definitely<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:48.580> power<00:01:48.820> of<00:01:49.060> changing<00:01:49.450> your

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
definitely the power of changing your

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.470 
definitely the power of changing your
face<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:51.340> I<00:01:51.370> think<00:01:51.610> makes<00:01:51.970> a<00:01:52.060> huge<00:01:52.450> difference

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
face but I think makes a huge difference

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.930 
face but I think makes a huge difference
in<00:01:52.990> my<00:01:53.020> life

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.000
