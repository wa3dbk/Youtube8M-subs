00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the editing was great i agree with

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.220 
the editing was great i agree with
pretty<00:00:47.910> much<00:00:47.969> everything<00:00:48.239> Vince<00:00:48.750> said<00:00:48.960> except

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
pretty much everything Vince said except

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.869 
pretty much everything Vince said except
for<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> still<00:00:49.710> think<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.129> he<00:00:50.399> could<00:00:50.520> compete

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
for I still think that he could compete

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.380 
for I still think that he could compete
because<00:00:51.649> it's<00:00:52.649> not<00:00:52.860> as<00:00:53.039> category<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
because it's not as category and the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.360 
because it's not as category and the
experience<00:00:54.930> would<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.079> great<00:00:55.410> but<00:00:55.649> if<00:00:56.190> he

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
experience would be great but if he

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.770 
experience would be great but if he
thinks<00:00:56.579> he's<00:00:56.670> not<00:00:56.789> ready<00:00:57.030> he's<00:00:57.090> not<00:00:57.210> ready<00:00:57.360> I

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
thinks he's not ready he's not ready I

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.549 
thinks he's not ready he's not ready I
know<00:00:58.170> I'm<00:00:58.559> not<00:00:58.590> really<00:00:58.829> ready<00:00:58.920> either<00:00:59.219> but<00:01:00.149> um

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
know I'm not really ready either but um

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.219

you<00:01:01.559> know<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.969> think<00:01:02.969> it'll<00:01:03.120> it'll<00:01:03.480> give<00:01:04.049> me<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
fitness fallacies man in fact i'm

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.669 
fitness fallacies man in fact i'm
probably<00:02:09.119> going<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.420> come<00:02:10.379> out<00:02:10.530> with<00:02:10.590> a

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
probably going to come out with a

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.980 
probably going to come out with a
segment<00:02:11.160> every<00:02:11.640> time<00:02:11.790> he<00:02:11.849> sends<00:02:12.239> me<00:02:12.300> one

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
segment every time he sends me one

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.960 
segment every time he sends me one
it's<00:02:13.410> going<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.620> be<00:02:13.740> Fleming's<00:02:14.310> fitness

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
it's going to be Fleming's fitness

it's going to be Fleming's fitness
fallacies<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:16.470> here's<00:02:17.190> an<00:02:17.340> example<00:02:17.610> right<00:02:17.790> here

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
fallacies I here's an example right here

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.300 
fallacies I here's an example right here
guys<00:02:18.270> yeah<00:02:19.020> he<00:02:19.200> actually<00:02:19.350> believes<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.190> if

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
guys yeah he actually believes that if

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.500 
guys yeah he actually believes that if
you<00:02:20.370> do<00:02:20.490> higher<00:02:20.670> rep<00:02:20.910> ranges<00:02:21.300> you're<00:02:21.420> gonna

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
you do higher rep ranges you're gonna

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.870 
you do higher rep ranges you're gonna
get<00:02:21.690> more<00:02:21.900> cut<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.860> try<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.250> tell<00:02:23.490> them<00:02:23.670> it's

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
get more cut I try to tell them it's

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.430 
get more cut I try to tell them it's
it's<00:02:24.150> really<00:02:24.450> not<00:02:24.570> true<00:02:24.900> it's<00:02:25.290> all<00:02:25.410> about

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
it's really not true it's all about

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.030 
it's really not true it's all about
burning<00:02:26.070> fat<00:02:26.310> caloric<00:02:27.030> deficit<00:02:27.920> it's<00:02:28.920> a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
burning fat caloric deficit it's a

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.820 
burning fat caloric deficit it's a
really<00:02:29.250> common<00:02:29.490> misconception<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:31.020> I

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
really common misconception and I I

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.430 
really common misconception and I I
think<00:02:32.520> when<00:02:32.670> you're<00:02:32.760> bulking<00:02:33.080> it's<00:02:34.080> actually

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
think when you're bulking it's actually

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.370 
think when you're bulking it's actually
the<00:02:34.530> best<00:02:34.710> time<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.700> do<00:02:35.850> higher<00:02:36.180> like<00:02:36.870> 8<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.200> 12

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
the best time to do higher like 8 to 12

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.470 
the best time to do higher like 8 to 12
rep<00:02:37.650> ranges<00:02:38.040> hyper<00:02:38.270> hypertrophy<00:02:39.270> because

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
rep ranges hyper hypertrophy because

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.080 
rep ranges hyper hypertrophy because
that's<00:02:39.630> going<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.900> get<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.470> most<00:02:40.650> sighs

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
that's going to get you the most sighs

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.240 
that's going to get you the most sighs
here's<00:02:42.090> another<00:02:42.330> example<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.710> too<00:02:43.980> funny

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
here's another example this is too funny
