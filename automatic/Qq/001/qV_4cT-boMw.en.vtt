how do I on butterscotch calm in the
series<00:00:11.250> we're<00:00:11.429> taking<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> look<00:00:11.790> at<00:00:11.940> how<00:00:12.059> to

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
series we're taking a look at how to

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.370 
series we're taking a look at how to
build<00:00:12.300> your<00:00:12.450> own<00:00:12.509> PC<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.080> episode

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
build your own PC in this episode

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.509 
build your own PC in this episode
specifically<00:00:13.860> we're<00:00:14.009> taking<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.250> look<00:00:14.340> at<00:00:14.460> the

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
specifically we're taking a look at the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.840 
specifically we're taking a look at the
power<00:00:14.670> supply<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.839> power<00:00:16.020> supply<00:00:16.320> is

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
power supply the power supply is

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.950 
power supply the power supply is
basically<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.210> sounds<00:00:18.449> like<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.930> a

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
basically what it sounds like it is a

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.840 
basically what it sounds like it is a
unit<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.650> powers<00:00:20.070> everything<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.730> goes

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
unit that powers everything that goes

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.380 
unit that powers everything that goes
into<00:00:21.060> your<00:00:21.180> PC<00:00:21.869> now<00:00:22.279> the<00:00:23.279> power<00:00:23.460> supply<00:00:23.880> plugs

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
into your PC now the power supply plugs

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.910 
into your PC now the power supply plugs
into<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.720> wall<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.080> one<00:00:25.230> side<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.710> into

all the components inside the computer

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.450 
all the components inside the computer
and<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.289> want<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.500> be<00:00:28.560> sure<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.769> everything

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
and you want to be sure that everything

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.939 
and you want to be sure that everything
that<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:30.090> there<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.510> able<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.410> be<00:00:31.529> powered

that you have in the system or plan to
put<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> system<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:54.120> tell<00:00:54.360> you

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
put in the system and can tell you

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.330 
put in the system and can tell you
roughly<00:00:54.719> what<00:00:54.960> wattage<00:00:55.469> you'll<00:00:55.829> need<00:00:56.010> for

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
roughly what wattage you'll need for

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.520 
roughly what wattage you'll need for
your<00:00:56.489> system<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.210> would<00:00:57.840> suggest<00:00:58.079> going<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
your system I would suggest going a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.959 
your system I would suggest going a
little<00:00:58.770> bit<00:00:58.890> higher<00:00:59.129> than<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.579> rating<00:00:59.850> that

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
little bit higher than the rating that

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.099 
little bit higher than the rating that
you'll<00:01:00.090> get<00:01:00.210> using<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> power<00:01:00.780> supply

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
you'll get using the power supply

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.720 
you'll get using the power supply
calculator<00:01:01.620> because<00:01:01.920> you'll<00:01:02.070> want<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.460> little

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
calculator because you'll want a little

attached directly to the power supply

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.020 
attached directly to the power supply
unit<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.860> handy<00:01:26.640> because<00:01:26.759> they're

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
unit and this is handy because they're

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.969 
unit and this is handy because they're
all<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.330> place<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.110> also<00:01:28.200> not<00:01:28.590> handy

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
all in one place but it's also not handy

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.440 
all in one place but it's also not handy
because<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.310> don't<00:01:29.579> necessarily<00:01:29.729> need<00:01:30.240> all

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
because you don't necessarily need all

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.969 
because you don't necessarily need all
of<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> connectors<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.049> are<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.439> here<00:01:31.650> you

may<00:01:32.130> only<00:01:32.280> need<00:01:32.369> three<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.060> there<00:01:33.180> might<00:01:33.329> be
