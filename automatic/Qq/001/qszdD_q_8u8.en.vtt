00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:01.079 

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:04.649 

that<00:06:02.079> is<00:06:02.379> very<00:06:02.769> nice<00:06:03.219> I<00:06:03.579> like<00:06:04.089> that<00:06:04.360> when<00:06:04.509> it's

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
that is very nice I like that when it's

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:07.939

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
stacking the treble control has a lot of

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:16.460 
stacking the treble control has a lot of
log<00:06:08.949> effect

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.330

versatility to it I really like to try

00:06:51.940 --> 00:07:00.860 
versatility to it I really like to try
it<00:06:52.000> on<00:06:52.180> stage

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:00.870 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.980 

the<00:07:01.870> spark<00:07:02.260> setting<00:07:02.880> is<00:07:03.880> really<00:07:04.300> kind<00:07:04.720> of<00:07:04.780> cool

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990 
the spark setting is really kind of cool

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:18.659 
the spark setting is really kind of cool
it's<00:07:05.230> very<00:07:05.320> like<00:07:15.780> a<00:07:16.780> really<00:07:17.710> light<00:07:18.010> overdrive

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:18.669 
it's very like a really light overdrive

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:28.590 
it's very like a really light overdrive
at<00:07:18.850> that<00:07:19.030> point<00:07:26.729> all<00:07:27.729> right<00:07:27.760> that's<00:07:28.270> my<00:07:28.419> little

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:28.600 
at that point all right that's my little

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.770 
at that point all right that's my little
overview<00:07:29.199> of<00:07:29.350> the<00:07:29.530> full<00:07:29.919> tone<00:07:30.190> catalyst

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:31.780 
overview of the full tone catalyst

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.990 
overview of the full tone catalyst
I<00:07:31.810> like<00:07:32.650> this<00:07:32.830> pedal<00:07:33.190> I<00:07:33.340> think<00:07:33.639> it's<00:07:33.760> a<00:07:33.850> good

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 
I like this pedal I think it's a good

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.020 
I like this pedal I think it's a good
sounding<00:07:34.360> pedal<00:07:34.690> and<00:07:34.810> it<00:07:34.930> will<00:07:35.020> probably<00:07:35.260> do

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.030 
sounding pedal and it will probably do

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.810 
sounding pedal and it will probably do
about<00:07:37.030> what<00:07:37.210> the<00:07:37.360> OCD<00:07:37.990> did<00:07:38.260> a<00:07:38.919> lot<00:07:39.490> of<00:07:39.580> people

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:39.820 
about what the OCD did a lot of people

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.990 
about what the OCD did a lot of people
love<00:07:40.030> the<00:07:40.060> OCD<00:07:40.810> for<00:07:40.990> overdrive<00:07:41.560> and<00:07:41.919> I<00:07:42.760> think

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 
love the OCD for overdrive and I think

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.020 
love the OCD for overdrive and I think
the<00:07:43.090> catalyst<00:07:43.630> will<00:07:43.900> be<00:07:44.280> pretty<00:07:45.280> much<00:07:45.550> like

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:46.030 
the catalyst will be pretty much like

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.770 
the catalyst will be pretty much like
the<00:07:46.210> OCD<00:07:46.810> but<00:07:47.020> only<00:07:47.200> for<00:07:47.560> fuzz<00:07:48.150> it's<00:07:49.150> a<00:07:49.330> very

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:49.780 
the OCD but only for fuzz it's a very

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.590 
the OCD but only for fuzz it's a very
controlled<00:07:50.530> and<00:07:50.800> very<00:07:51.580> variable<00:07:52.180> fuzz<00:07:52.570> the

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:52.600 
controlled and very variable fuzz the

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.000 
controlled and very variable fuzz the
tone<00:07:53.320> controls<00:07:53.800> are<00:07:54.100> very<00:07:54.130> active<00:07:55.120> and<00:07:55.650> I<00:07:56.650> like

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.010 
tone controls are very active and I like

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.090 
tone controls are very active and I like
the<00:07:57.250> flame<00:07:57.639> in<00:07:57.789> the<00:07:57.910> spark<00:07:58.800> giving<00:07:59.800> you<00:07:59.889> two

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:00.100 
the flame in the spark giving you two

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.670 
the flame in the spark giving you two

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:02.680 
different types of gain options I think

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.640 
different types of gain options I think
