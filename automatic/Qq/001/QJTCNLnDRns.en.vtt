the camera what is actually white so

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.160

cause the camera to see white

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.139 
cause the camera to see white
differently<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.550> important<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:50.969> white

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
differently so it's important to white

trick<00:01:56.369> for<00:01:56.549> focusing<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.329> zoom<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.689> on<00:01:57.780> as

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
trick for focusing is to zoom in on as

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.260 
trick for focusing is to zoom in on as
much<00:01:58.200> as<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:58.710> do<00:01:59.310> your<00:01:59.460> manual<00:01:59.790> focus<00:02:00.149> and

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
much as you can do your manual focus and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.730 
much as you can do your manual focus and
then<00:02:00.659> zoom<00:02:00.899> out<00:02:02.750> manual<00:02:03.750> exposure<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.380> useful

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
then zoom out manual exposure is useful

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.050 
then zoom out manual exposure is useful
for<00:02:04.920> when<00:02:05.040> there's<00:02:05.189> either<00:02:05.340> too<00:02:05.610> much<00:02:05.790> light
