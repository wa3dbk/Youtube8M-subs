reload<00:00:41.489> counseling<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.360> concept<00:00:42.840> of

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
reload counseling is the concept of

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.340 
reload counseling is the concept of
going<00:00:43.590> into<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.070> reload<00:00:44.399> animation<00:00:44.610> and

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
going into the reload animation and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.049 
going into the reload animation and
interrupting<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.440> towards<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.890> end<00:00:47.250> however

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
interrupting it towards the end however

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.670 
interrupting it towards the end however
when<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.270> interrupt<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.870> little<00:00:49.320> part<00:00:49.620> in

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
when you interrupt that little part in

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.770 
when you interrupt that little part in
the<00:00:49.860> end<00:00:50.070> you'll<00:00:50.670> never<00:00:50.910> said<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.300> gun<00:00:51.510> will

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
the end you'll never said the gun will

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.860 
the end you'll never said the gun will
be<00:00:51.899> able<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.320> load<00:00:52.680> bullets<00:00:53.039> quicker<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
be able to load bullets quicker then the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.229 
be able to load bullets quicker then the
actual<00:00:55.199> animation<00:00:55.559> shows<00:00:56.010> by<00:00:56.820> interrupting

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
actual animation shows by interrupting

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.299 
actual animation shows by interrupting
this<00:00:57.750> you're<00:00:58.109> able<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> skip<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.739> last<00:00:59.070> part

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
this you're able to skip that last part

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.250 
this you're able to skip that last part
of<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> animation<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.090> thus<00:01:00.719> shaving<00:01:01.140> off

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
of the animation and thus shaving off

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.650 
of the animation and thus shaving off
milliseconds<00:01:02.010> or<00:01:02.070> even<00:01:02.340> seconds<00:01:02.879> off<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.270> your

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
milliseconds or even seconds off of your

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.859 
milliseconds or even seconds off of your
reloading<00:01:04.409> time<00:01:04.549> this<00:01:05.549> allows<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.180> have

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
reloading time this allows you to have

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.960 
reloading time this allows you to have
to<00:01:06.930> basically<00:01:07.320> avoid<00:01:07.890> using<00:01:08.220> sleight<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.670> hand

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
to basically avoid using sleight of hand

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.730 
to basically avoid using sleight of hand
and<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.689> use<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.960> for<00:01:10.080> other<00:01:10.200> perks<00:01:10.500> that

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
and you can use it for other perks that

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.190 
and you can use it for other perks that
you<00:01:10.830> would<00:01:10.979> want<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.460> your<00:01:11.580> class<00:01:11.850> now<00:01:12.689> this

well as the reload counted variant of it

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.370 
well as the reload counted variant of it
at<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.759> top<00:01:26.939> right<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.479> see<00:01:27.659> my<00:01:27.869> actual

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
at the top right you can see my actual

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
at the top right you can see my actual
hands<00:01:28.710> as<00:01:28.860> i<00:01:29.100> was<00:01:29.250> doing<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.610> clip<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.270> can

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
hands as i was doing this clip you can

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.730 
hands as i was doing this clip you can
see<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.570> i<00:01:30.720> pull<00:01:30.960> back<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.290> left<00:01:31.470> analog

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
see that i pull back on the left analog

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.830 
see that i pull back on the left analog
stick<00:01:31.950> when<00:01:32.369> i<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.759> sprint<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.329> basically

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
stick when i do the sprint and basically

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.330 
stick when i do the sprint and basically
this<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.229> sprint<00:01:34.470> canceling<00:01:34.950> variant

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
this is a sprint canceling variant

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.030 
this is a sprint canceling variant
there's<00:01:35.820> also<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.150> double<00:01:36.450> YY<00:01:36.810> cancel<00:01:37.350> but

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
there's also the double YY cancel but

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.649 
there's also the double YY cancel but
that<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.430> don't<00:01:38.520> really<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.240> much<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
that one I don't really like as much and

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.569 
that one I don't really like as much and
the<00:01:39.720> sprint<00:01:40.049> always<00:01:40.290> felt<00:01:40.590> much<00:01:40.799> more<00:01:40.829> natural

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
the sprint always felt much more natural

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.460 
the sprint always felt much more natural
to<00:01:41.610> me<00:01:41.880> now<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.600> always<00:01:42.780> going<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.960> depend<00:01:43.290> on

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
to me now it's always going to depend on

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.080 
to me now it's always going to depend on
what<00:01:43.710> type<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.040> weapon<00:01:44.430> you're<00:01:44.549> using<00:01:44.759> in

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
what type of weapon you're using in

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.609 
what type of weapon you're using in
terms<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.450> how<00:01:45.689> effective<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> reload

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
terms of how effective the reload
