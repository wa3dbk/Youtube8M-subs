 [Music] 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.060
 and good to all I am bagpipes and you 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.860
 I bring the long-awaited first episode 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.360
 of the acrobatics tutorials that you 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.130
 I promised in optical esp on the top 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.809
 acrobatics and let's start this series 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.969
 with something that is very important and very 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.890
 basic to do good acrobatics 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.360
 which is nothing but light english 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.680
 trick that you will have to handle to the 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.450
 perfection if you want to do acrobatics 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.219
 in conditions before starting with the 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.809
 explanations I will ask you if 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.190
 you want me to continue with this series that 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.320
 I teach you to do all the acrobatics 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.089
 that I ask you to leave me a 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.190
 like to see if we can get to the 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.050
 1000 likes to start the series 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.219
 well in conditions for those who 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.989
 you are very new in this of the 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.479
 acrobatics I will say in lightning 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.449
 It helps to get further with the bike 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.159
 and there are two ways to do the play and 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.960
 I 'm going to show you how to do each one 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.310
 in those ways both forms are going to 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.140
 carry the same result 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.600
 The first thing we have to do is with 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.180
 our bati tuned to the maximum to do the 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.950
 horse and continue tipping the motorbike 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.780
 back until we get to the point 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.710
 in which you see in the image as the motorcycle 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.750
 I felt nothing 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.369
 then it is when we will begin to turn 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.290
 the joystick or left rotating what 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.850
 constantly in the same direction of 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.680
 this way the bike will get 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.020
 stabilize without actually turning around 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.729
 whole and we will start to advance a lot 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.170
 forward that would be the first 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.610
 way of doing the writing we go with the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.110
 second way that maybe I can 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.000
 it becomes easier what it consists 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.399
 basically moving the joystick 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.229
 left forward backward forward back 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.020
 so constantly it is saying we would do 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.640
 all the same except that we would replace the 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.560
 rotation of the left joystick for a 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.430
 movement from front back to front 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.050
 back down up 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.850
 I leave you a few seconds for you to see 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.110
 as very ballistic on the finger what 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.030
 I'll do great in slow motion 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.710
 so you can see it perfectly as 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.810
 you have to make the movement because if you 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.060
 we do wrong or we do it very slowly 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.009
 multi-duration does not work and remember 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.050
 maintain the inclination that I have in the 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.360
 video the differences of using or not using 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.220
 this trick are very clear and if not you 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.500
 what I did, I'll leave you a comparison 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.360
 on the screen so you can see that using the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.190
 clearing we advance a lot more than not 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.959
 using it since not using it we fall in 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.640
 chopped so we barely move forward and 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.739
 we barely stay in the air once 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.570
 learned to move now it's time to learn 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.440
 to turn on and that sometimes when 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.270
 we take a 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.640
 we do not take it in the proper direction 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.560
 we do not go straight to the goal so 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.900
 we'll have to turn the air though 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.160
 it seems like something easy said that way 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.690
 quite complicated you almost see the 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.340
 movement that I do with my finger in the 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.200
 left joystick when I want to turn to 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.570
 the left turn joystick to a lower 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.130
 speed on the right side in the turn 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.810
 and on the other left side in the other 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.090
 half of the joystick spin I do it more 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.070
 fast this way the rear wheel will 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.750
 overtakes the lead and we make the 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.670
 turn otherwise it would be for the other 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.860
 applying the two things learned until 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.990
 now that it would be the glans advancing 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.300
 giving the district above work and 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.190
 the turn we could straighten our 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.870
 flight and land where we want 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.520
 use last if we want 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.350
 straighten our height is to say yes 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.430
 we go very high compared to the 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.350
 goal to which we simply go 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.910
 we will have to put the 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.000
 joystick left a little to go 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.130
 without actually hitting the top because 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.870
 if it's not 'let's waste a lot 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.270
 height then simply giving it a 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.040
 little bit by bit according to the height that 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.750
 we want to lose obviously we'll start 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.400
 come down with this would be said all 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.140
 remember that if you want the series 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.239
 continue I want you to leave your like 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.380
 in the next episode it will be like doing 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.360
 a basic nerd 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.470
 If you want to know how it's done I want to see 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.660
 your likes and your comments 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.200
 demanding me nothing I'll see you in the 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.200
 next video 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:51.579
