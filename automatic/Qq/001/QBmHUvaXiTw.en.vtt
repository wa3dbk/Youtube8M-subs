00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello youtube friends today I will talk to you 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.089
 of the history that runs through the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.010
 good internet let's start the legend of 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.139
 hero brines goes back a long time 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.480
 back when minecraft was still more 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.000
 that an alpha played by some geeks 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.310
 the original story was changing and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.750
 writhing with the passage of time 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.449
 Chinese yan have denied in multiple 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.830
 occasions that hero would exist but 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.230
 it was too late 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.180
 Sobrini was already born this image that 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.460
 you are seeing is the first image 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.619
 hero brines officer was posted by 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.750
 a user in the official forums of 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.730
 minecraft where he told how he had 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.040
 found with this guy in the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.870
 game the community spent a lot of 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.300
 theme and there was no talk of hero 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.309
 green for a while until the boys 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.410
 of drills that made a livestream of 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.690
 minecraft crossed with him or britney and 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.760
 they ran out the grace was in 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.590
 that everything was ready and after 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.660
 run and get safe the live 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.910
 streaming stopped the server fell 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.430
 it was a stop avoided by them but the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.170
 pages that previously made inah livestream 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.719
 now redirected the people that 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.549
 I entered another page where I could only see 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.300
 the face of hero bring the code of the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.970
 page 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.100
 had a message some victims were 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.350
 they retract a fantasy world in which 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.630
 they can not wake up point in this state 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.730
 catatonic the victim lives in a world 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.130
 similar to yours except that there 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.410
 are being tortured point the only 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.960
 way of awakening is found 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.480
 a note in your fantasy world point 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.820
 This note explains their situation and 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.160
 he says wake up even so they 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.290
 It can take months to be prepared for 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.450
 leave your fantasy world and please 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.250
 wake up the message implied that the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.410
 that I was reading it was in a world of 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.720
 fantasy and that this message that that 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.670
 person he had found was his note 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.590
 to go back to the real world this was the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.390
 book the hero brain and it was the beginning of 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.730
 what is now known as the legend 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.160
 as it happens with the rest of that pipes 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.930
 is the legend was modified until 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.090
 that we currently have two 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.220
 versions the most popular is that hero 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.680
 brines the brother died at night and that 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.870
 was put into the game by the same as 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.970
 a kind of tribute to his brother 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.070
 deceased this variation comes from 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.050
 another crepe and pasta is lindemann the other 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.480
 story is that hero bring is a miner 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.080
 ghost that tries to kill the character 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.390
 through 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.400
 traps to steal your waiting objects 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.980
 that players enter their caves 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.930
 to lock them up or kill us according to this 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.970
 theory can also destroy the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.190
 constructions of the players and steal in 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.990
 your chests as tribute to the popularity 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.150
 of history and very imposed the phrase 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.550
 niece removed from the lists of 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.920
 changes of minecraft versions being 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.230
 the first on June 1 , 2006 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.420
 even in the latest version 1 of 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.250
 February 2000 as you can see hero 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.440
 bringuÃ© has never existed in the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.330
 early versions of minecraft neither in the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.550
 current but already part of the 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.800
 history of my craft and in its community 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.020
 that is another example of the power of 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.000
 good internet that has been everything I hope 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.000
 what you liked and until next time
