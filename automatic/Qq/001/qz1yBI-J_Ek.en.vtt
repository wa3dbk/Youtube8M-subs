00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.900
 j 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.019
 hello everyone I did not have any new videos on 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.419
 % and this time we are on call of duty 2 so in fact I heard 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:18.220
 the call of 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.289
 scissors and gentleman the agent of 30 cadets however gibson are safe 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.439
 who said% good listening we have too much agreement on the fraud of call of 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.890
 duty% 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.239
 my child to see public yesterday 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.289
 and then better he actually asked people to offer videos on call of 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:35.800
 duty 2 so that's what now offers you 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.070
 so this video is me playing europe and actually call of duty 2 with 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.740
 the 4 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.560
 these are the best at age let's explain all through the video 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.400
 why not 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.520
 so first of all I think the action can only recognize I did not adhere 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.110
 this nickname to tell you something i'm the guy who criticized on the 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.470
 video a little while ago 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.530
 call of duty qg diabetics afd et cetera et cetera 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.550
 so what better to clarify things 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.190
 before drummond start the video 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.770
 it's not because I criticized what difficulty I do not respect 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.000
 not their job the same day this one I'm sure he offers us are 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.860
 excellent 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.520
 what I said in my video for those who would not have seen it is that in 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.110
 did i find he had too many videos for m 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.470
 too many videos flatter from the commentators who actually in year it 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.730
 was not worth it 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.050
 there I do not say how I am an excellent commentator and all armed 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.140
 I try can offer you original tax games and not necessarily 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.540
 than the call of duty black ops' and that's what I find it a pity that's 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.280
 maybe too much call of duty black ops 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.480
 even modern warfare 2 but good 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.380
 I'm not going to go back on the rational debate not seen the video is going well enough 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.990
 to go see on my chain allies always a 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.000
 this gesture on board you will be working to show how to do it well and well 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.600
 argued of this race as I had asked and and besides I 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.190
 had very good food was seeing by private message 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.040
 finally good I do not know the purpose of the video that you can see I chained 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.740
 some small texts fell on call of duty 2 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.640
 while the purpose of this identity to explain why such aviv who 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.710
 utica shifts are the best in fact 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.380
 so I simply 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.430
 abon call of duty 4 a lot of people know a lot consider 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.700
 similar call of duty i agree with them but not to forget it's 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.350
 often the lot 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.660
 the call of duty 2 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.040
 which is really here for me the most really related to the level of the site 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.899
 let me explain 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:16.469
 finally call of duty 2 months to saint-savin 8 9% and on which I play 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.749
 on call of duty 2 an announcement that is clear it's net 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.459
 it was very sexy chic good 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.349
 call of duty 2 this is the only call of duty or percent 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.459
 to the fact why so here I have for example on this video that I tell you 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.209
 wish 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.520
 but when you take a machine gun I spent some debates 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.230
 shoot down the son of people watching on reading a novel the 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.929
 video 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:40.019
 in fact when you can not first of all fida sodi which one of 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.399
 44 that his followers on the best known call of duty 2 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:47.399
 if you put the viewfinder you aim and you are fired burst like the 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:50.619
 down for example you would do with aca 47 land on the reinforcement of 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:53.309
 but in fact it's simple debate will not follow isere and what makes 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:54.980
 do not burn 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.620
 jerks like on boats that were driving for example you have 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.699
 your weapon is not a bit far 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:03.549
 tak tak it is important not to burn because it is the best way to 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.009
 give all the balls next 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.009
 see for example to play with my project is realized you granted 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.109
 % and this is a very ridiculous season if I also grant you 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:13.829
 eugenie 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:14.989
 here are my friends here 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.299
 nice little series I did here 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.369
 so I'm a little disappointed 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:22.379
 so we see that as you explain in fact we can not brimer go the saiper 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.369
 is really süd-chemie if thales played because the episcopate would be 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.969
 very well 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:28.489
 and that few people know 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.429
 only on the of the test are 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:33.139
 very very cool to play it 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.799
 enter the cenco call of duty of ten trotting races but it seems to me that he 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.509
 is on xbox 360 so aubin and what is exhibited offers you 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.809
 since then there was a little more videos on call of duty plugins like 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.339
 they said it as he had requested 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:48.029
 then it's a thing that's not bad in call of duty 2 also these 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:49.080
 challenges of tomorrow 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.820
 melee attacks in fact ie that especially the call of duty to 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.849
 from 4 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.149
 I have not played three so I want to hear what I know absolutely not 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:57.169
 how he is 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:01.479
 from call of duty to 4% the melee battle system was 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:03.229
 changed for stabbing before 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:04.619
 it was shots of lacrosse 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.899
 and I still wonder today why they have been blown 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:09.129
 knife because frankly 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.500
 already a lot of water I know the goal is not journalist I found him 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:14.099
 very arcade 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.919
 but for 100 th 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:19.069
 not frankly I found it ten times more logical to put its three rooms 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:21.430
 equipped in front of you rather than a stabbing because a guy who 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.680
 holds a weapon that weighs at least a good kilo a kilo 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.400
 % and who comes out of a sudden his knife by a good 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.400
 it is important to know why this series is not bad at all 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.830
 e see so here are in fact the call of duty of the French state 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.430
 excellent because it's not at all anticipated but percent when I say 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.029
 not at all I'm not disappointed if you see if you have you said in the 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:42.389
 video here in which children 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.430
 you really have to be mega glued to the line 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.759
 in the EU 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.969
 here I am 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:52.119
 you have to be really stuck on the line to catch the shots of lacrosse 

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:55.319
 goes through the melee attacks passes and that's really you my text the 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.770
 society the norms in our habits 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.130
 nowadays to the idea of ​​this side so there is a lot that 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.870
 debuted on the pole one of my pals in the royal family 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.529
 who debuted on call of duty 2 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:10.059
 who was really a man playing the excellent 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:11.860
 and in europe 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.270
 the port and his ways of pretending while he was playing perfectly 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.509
 alright so just I had some small lag issues at this time of the 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.229
 part of the workers beware but exclusively 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.180
 at the hague the video will accelerate because I had some disappointments 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.289
 more connection at that moment for about thirty seconds so I got 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.289
 allowed to access the video so that it does not bother you too much 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.490
 as said true call of duty 2 not at all we lie + 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.789
 teulet men are well dosed and then the lawsuit is not a lawsuit that are 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.199
 really excellent on that would be the foot 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.590
 So he was the most struggling as a public man who happened in the world 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.870
 facing the excellent 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.110
 so football and that's it 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.569
 a very nice little video on this excellent opus of call of duty 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:55.879
 unfortunately the past known at all 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:57.219
 this morning 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:00.639
 so here it is now in call of duty 2 before the video ends there 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.509
 there are some nice man who are for the d44 the pps h 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.379
 who are not bad at all to play 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:09.879
 and maybe some will know because you know finally I know he 

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:12.379
 not a lot of people on call of duty topic i think he knew the call 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:14.280
 of duty of view that add outgoing 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.289
 where the group 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:16.270
 in 2005 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.819
 in the attempt in the middle distance 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:21.210
 I'm not sure I set foot 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.259
 yeah because the usual video makes all the videos live 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.639
 and for that reason it's not for him 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:28.849
 because m 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:31.330
 you really have to concentrate when I see that the liquid is not like it 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.599
 the fact 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:34.360
 so the ump 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.360
 she was telling that she doubted to leave him a profit someday 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.659
 in 2003 that's as much for me in 2003 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:42.080
 so copied 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.379
 he aspired to an end 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:46.699
 no, I'm making you a very nice little series 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.740
 so my sides here for those who did not know yet long I you 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.580

 on the latest videos 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:02.119
 if you do not like work but it's a gene not explain why in one of 

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:04.810
 case a constructive and argued promoter because 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.070
 what's more annoying than taking a 2nd step and not understanding 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.409
 why so here 

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:11.090

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.749
 very very good evening because there 

00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:15.939
 the day I'm going to be able to recruit 

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:17.560
 go common sense everyone is for 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.090
 as veiled at the next
