00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:09.379
 We are good here at Ayrton Senna where I 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.150
 I will do it 130 180 is fourth will 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.980
 make both shots on the same stretch 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.940
 no preference for uploads and 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.710
 descents 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:23.170
 anyway this kind of thing I'll just pass the 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.170
 bug to give already starts 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.740
 first I'll do without a chip 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:43.839
 We 'll be at this girls later. 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:43.839
 crisis 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.480
 ae 11 23 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:33.330
 the back there we already do with a good 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:35.050
 I came back here as now corrected 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.580
 so does the 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.580
 Look at my lawyer. 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.230
 well john 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:19.670
 At home I go there like there and then I can 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:22.370
 having a good result right here at home is the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.660
 timer was there and with a chip 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.450
 listener two seconds without a chip or 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.870
 21.4 is a remarkable difference only 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.820
 It's small, wait a little longer and here. 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.430
 has a before and after chart 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.460
 the blue line here before the line 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.980
 red then you can notice that until 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.240
 the 4,500 spins here practically does not have 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.040
 difference 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.650
 before he had that but nothing here 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.800
 5,500 between 6000 turns 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:56.900
 basically corrected that in the numbers there 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:03.440
 no on the dynamometer dropped before 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:07.400
 had given 133 horses after 844 that the 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.390
 torque sheet where it basically shows 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.750
 great 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.980
 the touch fell a lot at the end here a lot 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.800
 fast 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.130
 he gave a apply nothing to him reminding that 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.600
 the torque and torque times it turns 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.300
 proves nothing that gave him what was 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.330
 enough to keep power going 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.500
 more linearly here at the beginning it 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.330
 said that it was kind of 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.950
 disregard why he began to weigh 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.239
 a bit late 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.640
 At first I thought it was a lie. 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:41.030
 it is bad but in practice it is not 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.989
 I realized the difference until the 4,500 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.830
 same 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.830
 anyway is this the sun value
