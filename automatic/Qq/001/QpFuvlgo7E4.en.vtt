00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.450 
olympic teams is that true I guess
that's<00:01:35.310> true<00:01:35.689> I'm<00:01:36.689> not<00:01:36.869> sure<00:01:37.140> what<00:01:37.409> that

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
that's true I'm not sure what that

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.300 
that's true I'm not sure what that
entails<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.909> means<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:40.310> distance

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
entails if that means in distance

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.789 
entails if that means in distance
running<00:01:41.520> or<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.030> track<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.270> field<00:01:42.619> or<00:01:43.619> what

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
running or in track and field or what

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.460 
running or in track and field or what
that<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.579> know<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.030> can't<00:01:45.240> be<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
that is but I know it can't be in the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.350 
that is but I know it can't be in the
whole<00:01:46.649> Olympics<00:01:47.070> because<00:01:47.220> those<00:01:47.579> gymnastics

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
whole Olympics because those gymnastics

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.380 
whole Olympics because those gymnastics
girls<00:01:48.420> are<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:48.930> 14<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:50.070> think<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.180> track

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
girls are like 14 so I think it's track

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.060 
girls are like 14 so I think it's track
and<00:01:51.570> field<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:51.930> we'll<00:01:52.590> leave<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:52.920> way

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
and field but we'll leave it that way

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.609 
and field but we'll leave it that way
it's<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.600> were<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.869> Athens<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.439> you

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
it's a so you were in Athens and you

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.840 
it's a so you were in Athens and you
really<00:01:55.890> here<00:01:56.040> we're<00:01:56.189> coming<00:01:56.460> off<00:01:56.579> an<00:01:56.729> injury

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
really here we're coming off an injury

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.090 
really here we're coming off an injury
so<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.329> don't<00:01:57.780> really<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.500> finish<00:01:58.890> all

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
so you don't really like that finish all

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.270 
so you don't really like that finish all
that<00:01:59.130> well<00:01:59.460> no<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.630> know<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.780> dnf<00:02:01.380> tin<00:02:01.649> in

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
sure you thought about have you decided

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.970 
sure you thought about have you decided
whether<00:02:51.210> you<00:02:51.390> would<00:02:51.480> try<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.750> do<00:02:52.020> both<00:02:52.260> or<00:02:52.590> pick

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
whether you would try to do both or pick

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.680 
whether you would try to do both or pick
one<00:02:53.160> no<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:53.760> definitely<00:02:54.120> will<00:02:54.330> do<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.540> marathon

i'm<00:02:55.080> not<00:02:55.230> going<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.380> plan<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.740> do<00:02:55.830> both<00:02:56.040> i<00:02:56.280> think

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
i'm not going to plan to do both i think

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.460 
i'm not going to plan to do both i think
that<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.730> would<00:02:56.820> be<00:02:56.880> a<00:02:56.970> little<00:02:57.180> greedy<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.840> i

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
that that would be a little greedy and i

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.250 
that that would be a little greedy and i
don't<00:02:58.860> know<00:02:58.980> if<00:02:59.100> i<00:02:59.220> would<00:02:59.280> i<00:03:00.000> would<00:03:00.240> be<00:03:00.810> as<00:03:00.990> good

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
don't know if i would i would be as good

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.680 
don't know if i would i would be as good
in<00:03:01.530> both<00:03:01.710> of<00:03:01.950> them<00:03:02.130> if<00:03:02.520> I<00:03:02.760> as<00:03:03.270> if<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.510> just

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
in both of them if I as if I just

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.420 
in both of them if I as if I just
concentrated<00:03:03.810> on<00:03:04.320> one<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.770> so<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:04.920> really<00:03:05.280> want

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
concentrated on one and so I really want

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.520 
concentrated on one and so I really want
to<00:03:05.520> focus<00:03:05.700> on<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.540> marathon<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.170> do<00:03:07.260> as<00:03:07.380> best

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530
