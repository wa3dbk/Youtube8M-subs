 Leo Stein found out about you under Walter Eichner 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.449

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:56.239
 it weighed up 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.899

 Everything breaks down 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.329
 to collect that 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.429

 Unigene z 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.700
 that would even exceed now Sweden had to levitate Arjen 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:30.779
 Prof bright white I have to cold the foxes 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:33.620

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.240
 No 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.559
 Jena exactly 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:43.039
 a nomination like that 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.039
 hard work you had to go 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.090
 in no case should not be shaken 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.129

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:05.749
 privately employed 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.909
 also Prof 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:13.309
 that goes off here 

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:14.969
 incomprehensible 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:16.620
 So the Trees funny 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.059

 I just do not know what it's all about here 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:54.469
 as well as the ball exactly in the middle of the screen 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.249
 Although stitches should leave no stone unturned 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:02.249
 it will probably come out in the course of the game 

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:08.089
 Lichtenstein 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.699
