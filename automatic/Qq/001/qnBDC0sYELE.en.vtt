Prante<00:00:36.870> Solomon<00:00:37.870> just<00:00:38.560> a<00:00:38.680> quickie

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
Prante Solomon just a quickie

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.670 
Prante Solomon just a quickie
I<00:00:41.190> with<00:00:41.760> office<00:00:42.240> tues<00:00:42.720> of<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> courses<00:00:43.440> to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
I with office tues of the courses to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.920 
I with office tues of the courses to
tell<00:00:43.860> family<00:00:44.190> keeper<00:00:44.520> 14<00:00:45.030> definitely<00:00:47.930> it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
tell family keeper 14 definitely it

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.600 
tell family keeper 14 definitely it
works<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.290> the<00:00:49.410> precision<00:00:49.860> because<00:00:50.040> it's<00:00:50.430> a

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
works on the precision because it's a

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.690 
works on the precision because it's a
it's<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.390> sequence<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.900> precision<00:00:52.410> jumps<00:00:52.740> but

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
it's a sequence of precision jumps but

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.030 
it's a sequence of precision jumps but
it's<00:00:54.000> also<00:00:54.330> about<00:00:54.600> concentration<00:00:55.260> because

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
it's also about concentration because

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.729 
it's also about concentration because
when<00:00:56.970> you're<00:00:57.150> the<00:00:57.510> second<00:00:58.110> or<00:00:58.260> third<00:00:58.290> you

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
when you're the second or third you

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.110 
when you're the second or third you
don't<00:00:58.920> want<00:00:59.130> to<00:00:59.250> mess<00:00:59.400> up<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> whole<00:00:59.790> sequence

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
don't want to mess up the whole sequence

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.820 
don't want to mess up the whole sequence
because<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.660> know<00:01:00.810> that<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.440> mess<00:01:01.680> up

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
because you know that if you mess up

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.530 
because you know that if you mess up
you're<00:01:02.040> gonna<00:01:02.220> start<00:01:02.550> again<00:01:02.760> all<00:01:02.910> over<00:01:03.210> so

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
you're gonna start again all over so

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.729 
you're gonna start again all over so
yeah<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.020> a<00:01:04.080> very<00:01:04.290> good<00:01:04.350> training<00:01:04.620> for

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
yeah it's a very good training for

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.570 
yeah it's a very good training for
concentration<00:01:06.860> you<00:01:07.860> don't<00:01:08.040> only<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
concentration you don't only have the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.550 
concentration you don't only have the
pressure<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.970> doing<00:01:09.300> the<00:01:09.810> jumps<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.410> also

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
pressure of doing the jumps you also

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.280 
pressure of doing the jumps you also
have<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.890> pressure<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.420> guys<00:01:12.420> making<00:01:13.080> you

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
have the pressure of the guys making you

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.570 
have the pressure of the guys making you
laugh<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:13.800> just<00:01:14.070> breaking<00:01:14.550> your

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
laugh or just breaking your

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:27.730 
laugh or just breaking your
concentration<00:01:23.990> I<00:01:25.550> stick<00:01:26.550> with<00:01:26.580> subjective

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
concentration I stick with subjective

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:39.650 
concentration I stick with subjective
yeah<00:01:28.740> you're<00:01:29.340> selfish<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:38.090> makes<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.240> repeat

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
yeah you're selfish it makes you repeat

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.170 
yeah you're selfish it makes you repeat
certain<00:01:39.930> jumps<00:01:40.380> without<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:41.640> being<00:01:41.880> really

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
certain jumps without you being really

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.330 
certain jumps without you being really
aware<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.660> you're<00:01:42.810> doing<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.440> repetition<00:01:44.040> you

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
aware that you're doing a repetition you

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.400 
aware that you're doing a repetition you
have<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> goal<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.660> until<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.050> reach<00:01:46.229> it

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
have a goal and until you reach it

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.380 
have a goal and until you reach it
you're<00:01:46.649> not<00:01:46.800> satisfied<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.789> you<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:47.910> repeat

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
you're not satisfied so you just repeat

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.150 
you're not satisfied so you just repeat
repeat<00:01:48.569> repeat<00:01:48.750> maybe<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.440> do<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.649> 50<00:01:49.830> times

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
repeat repeat maybe you do it 50 times

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.309 
repeat repeat maybe you do it 50 times
and<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.460> don't<00:01:50.610> even<00:01:50.729> count<00:01:53.929> when<00:01:54.929> it<00:01:55.170> does

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
and you don't even count when it does

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.529 
and you don't even count when it does
the<00:01:55.410> team<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.770> one<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.130> your<00:01:56.580> friend<00:01:57.030> mess<00:01:57.330> up

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
the team is one of your friend mess up

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.960 
the team is one of your friend mess up
you<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.929> restart<00:01:58.319> from<00:01:58.500> zero<00:01:58.970> start

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
you have to restart from zero start

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.649 
you have to restart from zero start
again<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.330> whole<00:02:00.450> thing<00:02:00.750> so

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
again the whole thing so

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.459 
again the whole thing so
it's<00:02:01.780> not<00:02:01.899> only<00:02:02.200> about<00:02:02.469> you<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:04.090> team<00:02:04.299> so<00:02:04.630> it's

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
it's not only about you the team so it's

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.520 
it's not only about you the team so it's
not<00:02:05.619> about<00:02:05.770> your<00:02:06.700> skills<00:02:07.090> only<00:02:07.450> about<00:02:08.289> your

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
not about your skills only about your

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.619 
not about your skills only about your
friends<00:02:08.860> as<00:02:08.979> well<00:02:09.269> that's<00:02:10.269> the<00:02:10.420> difference

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
friends as well that's the difference

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.500 
friends as well that's the difference
you're<00:02:11.080> not<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:12.160> only<00:02:12.280> one<00:02:12.489> involved<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:13.330> the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
you're not the only one involved in the

00:02:13.510 --> 00:03:21.870 
you're not the only one involved in the
game

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:37.500 

there's<00:03:22.880> one<00:03:23.030> finish<00:03:23.330> moneymaker

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.569 

you
