00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.470
 now that we know our five 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.800
 positions 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.660
 we go 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.270
 a minor what's called a body 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.950
 open these disagreements do not contain 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.630
 So they seem to play with 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.630
 empty cords 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.040
 in reality there are four positions 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.450
 okay governor and for now I 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.079
 let minor bone side 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.790
 I'll talk about it in an audit and the 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.000
 three chords to see me there on the 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.440
 minor 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.730
 he is probably the favorite rope 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.250
 all the guitarists that sounds good 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.250
 acute gathers to do the liner 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.260
 and pays him 1 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.130
 what you need to know about the agreements 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.230
 is that it is globally the 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.590
 same thing as a major deal at a 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.520
 other close there is one of their notes that 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.199
 is called the third 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.960
 we will see later on these notions of 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.260
 tyard what are we going to have played a half time 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.390
 more serious so on the guitar I put a 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.760
 half tone more serious it means backward 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.340
 of a box since a box also a 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.880
 half time and to play more serious on the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.210
 same rope 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.399
 we go to the guide and sleeve and so if 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:30.140
 we take the E major that thirds will be 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:32.720
 here on our cazin ground rope 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.009
 so we're going to have the fingers of a class 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.450
 which leads us out of sleeve 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.340
 so we play the empty horn 15 0 for 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:48.030
 have the soil note instead of having the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:52.580
 So there is so we will have the me g 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.580
 still of opinion pardon 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.450
 below our six boxes of the 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.340
 fifth string 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:06.759
 below again put him at 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.759
 cars 2 the fourth as the famous ground 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.459
 on the ground rope then always 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.459
 camp david and 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.980
 we can play with both fingers 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.980
 middle 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.700
 with the first two fingers 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.160
 then we have the minor's agreement so 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.010
 we will do the same from the 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.290
 major and we will move back his third of a 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.660
 Christian activist is ours we 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.790
 play here the C sharp with india or a 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.570
 number three on box 2 of the 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.670
 second rope we can not recoil is 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.370
 like that there in objections to change the 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.130
 fingering to adapt the fingering to pose 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:05.100
 your first finger on the famous note 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:07.640
 of water so recapitulating on the 6th 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.870
 horns and all done or not playing 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.090
 then we have the rope of the empty 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.110
 if our fundamental of the agreement of 20 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:21.180
 minors put the second must on the 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.710
 second box of the 4th strings second 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.530
 finger on the second box of the 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.300
 third string 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.260
 first finger on the first box of the 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.849
 second rope 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:38.489
 famous back to the 12th class and grants 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.489
 millet bull said what will give us 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.140
 Oh 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.940
 so a bit like for the do court 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.770
 major must be careful 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.390
 make a good arc with the 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.870
 first must not for him to come 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.140
 choke the rope 2008 and supposedly ring 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.140
 empty 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.599
 and finally the D minor chord so if 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.830
 we start from D major our famous 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.760
 triangle his thirds have D major she 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.430
 here is the note 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.310
 hello with the second must on the 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.139
 second box of the carrot half acute 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.910
 it's the F sharp 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.250
 a bit like for there we can not 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.000
 back for that position there the finger 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.760
 how much should go back 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.760
 so here we go to adapt the fingering 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.500
 third must not move he stays on his 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.130
 Dream rope on his note should lose 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.100
 we are here the second must come 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.800
 replace the first finger on the note 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.940
 the the the second box of the rope of 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.820
 ground and so first must come to rest 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:55.410
 on the lighthouse the first box of the 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.210
 first rope we play like for the first time 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.550
 major on four strings 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.520
 so we choke we play by both 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.060
 choreographers and we start on the rope 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.060
 eager to re 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.400
 Oh 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.280
 and dated minors 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.520
 there I separate the major agreements 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.430
 minor agreements for you 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.310
 can really taste the difference 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.330
 of major and lighting sounds and 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.790
 then because you have to learn well 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.470
 some others but in the big 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.210
 vast majority the music manceaux 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.320
 you're going to have a mix of chords 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.810
 major agrees minor 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.970
 so do not be satisfied with the 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.919
 danger in one corner the swimmers 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.690
 and another one is the mina chords 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.610
 must you be able to chained everything 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.250
 major and minor in any 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.169
 other have as usual to add 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.060
 your three minor chords at all 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.910
 swimmers you already know a 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.500
 godfather by chaining them first the 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:59.090
 major d minor 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.860
 the major and swimmers born minors etc 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.210
 take a lot of time it's important he 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.370
 wants more to take the time 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.470
 learning do not skip steps 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.110
 it helps to avoid bad ones 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.020
 habits and actually integrated a 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.039
 new thing going on as a result 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.039
 see you soon scratch well
