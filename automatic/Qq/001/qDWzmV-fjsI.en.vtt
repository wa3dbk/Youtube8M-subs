00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.600 
stood up and I think it was this
opposite<00:02:31.080> leg<00:02:31.319> I<00:02:31.530> think<00:02:31.800> if<00:02:31.950> he<00:02:32.100> shot<00:02:32.310> with<00:02:32.489> his

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
opposite leg I think if he shot with his

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.449 
opposite leg I think if he shot with his
left<00:02:32.819> hand<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.470> brought<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.709> arm<00:02:34.920> up<00:02:35.130> they

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
left hand and brought that arm up they

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.070 
left hand and brought that arm up they
were<00:02:35.520> standing<00:02:36.000> on<00:02:36.060> his<00:02:36.150> feet<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:36.690> thought

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
were standing on his feet and I thought

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.830

it<00:02:37.200> was<00:02:37.260> his<00:02:37.410> opposite<00:02:37.950> arm<00:02:38.130> that<00:02:38.310> got<00:02:38.520> hurt<00:02:39.170> um

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
it was his opposite arm that got hurt um
