00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.509
 Something good for the read of the journey 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.750
 I will challenge a somewhat unusual timelapse 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.750
 Hmm 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.750

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.410
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:28.960
 Taking pictures continued from the stopped place and say the time lapse 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:34.850
 Like this but I think that generally do today is that enjoy the passage of time at that location 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:41.340
 I tried to fix the camera forcibly with a tripod in the package 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:45.880
 I would like to return the time rough number in this state and drive the car 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.600
 Well what kind of picture can you take? 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.600

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:30.510
 Yes on arrival then end the time escape 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.060
 Or it would have taken in any wind to the Well 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:50.430
 Yes I did not use any car mount boot this time 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:54.990
 This tripod is one of eight cheap items on this place 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.240
 8 Wear the nx like a normal photo shoot 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.770
 A little school for a back leg book 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.580
 Kramer's 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:09.270
 Make it bite to the part that is concave in a good feeling 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:12.270
 I tried to shoot while avoiding the falling and moving while traveling 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:16.440
 A fine day like today a 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:22.430
 Even though I'm try doing now today I thought that I think we also take well 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:27.560
 In fact, the other day the cloudy sky was also taken in the evening 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.300
 Atmosphere that the time when the car at 0 o'clock started to turn on lights is quite good 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.550
 Because it was 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.440

 Caught in the mountain Oh 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.990
 Kudaranaku and I think that is dark but good 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.880

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.790

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.720
 but 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:11.400
