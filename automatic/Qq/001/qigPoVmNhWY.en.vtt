look<00:02:55.829> we're<00:02:56.220> safer<00:02:56.519> will<00:02:56.730> actually<00:02:57.000> contrast

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
look we're safer will actually contrast

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.819 
look we're safer will actually contrast
okay<00:02:59.610> one<00:02:59.790> contrast<00:03:00.120> anyway<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.709> lot

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
okay one contrast anyway and a lot

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.380 
okay one contrast anyway and a lot
actually<00:03:01.980> going<00:03:02.220> three<00:03:02.549> cuz<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:02.790> got<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:02.970> flavor

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
ended up on installing one up there

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.220 
ended up on installing one up there
anyway<00:03:10.200> but<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:11.430> took<00:03:11.670> me<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.970> friggin<00:03:12.720> ages

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
problem is the hard drive is in the way

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.340 
problem is the hard drive is in the way
and<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.970> hard<00:03:21.150> drive<00:03:21.329> cages<00:03:21.630> in<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:21.930> way<00:03:22.079> so<00:03:22.140> i

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
and the hard drive cages in the way so i

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
and the hard drive cages in the way so i
couldn't<00:03:22.590> get<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.739> in<00:03:22.950> i<00:03:23.070> was<00:03:23.160> trying<00:03:23.340> to
