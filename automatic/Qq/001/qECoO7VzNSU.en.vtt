00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.710
 ae 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.310
 it was time to show you both 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.680
 forms of application of the ultimate when 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.800
 want last tim burton is a product 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.660
 maintenance is recommended. 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.300
 use a painting that I thought was 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.090
 always after washing took the car if 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.010
 put you use it to keep the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.650
 The baby's finish also help in 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.720
 longevity of the wax to be the sealant 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.879
 have greater durability 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.720
 is a product totally free from 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.010
 abrasives so it's safe to go workshops 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.900
 and is not recommended because it is a product 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.140
 which contains silicone 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:59.040
 The traditional method is right for you. 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.190
 of traditional application consists of 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:06.750
 first use more profiles if you 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.080
 goes through a microphone spreading you 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.380
 see a microfiber cloth and do not comment 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.380
 Last 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:20.280
 simple so very easy really only 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.200
 What has a big problem is that you 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.460
 apply this way even if you 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.320
 passes the first time the cloth 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.450
 microfiber you're pulling out too much 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.880
 close to the surface passing a cloth 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.770
 It is interesting that the product goes bigger 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.500
 possible amount for the surface and 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.880
 do not be removed by noting then thinking 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.610
 I thought about doing it with the application 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.170
 a microfiber applicator where the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.640
 application is concentrated here. 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.650
 can control much better 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.050
 right application 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.590
 so now I'll show you 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:56.760
 application with two prioritized 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.410
 see off I can do half of this 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.410
 ceiling quietly 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.519
 it really pays much more than 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.540
 much more 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:22.870
 because the application is actually improved 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.970
 It is better that the traditional process 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.599
 of ultimate that you have to have a product 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.140
 dear I find an expensive product each 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:35.290
 think how I think Carlos producers 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.680
 must do the same legend after the 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.209
 application we make the removal of the UN 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.209
 at the end with a microfiber cloth 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.409
 and I sat the final finish 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.950
 proceeding with the applicator 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.630
 microfiber I did not see on the internet 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.230
 searching a lot did not see or do 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.250
 that 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.080
 then this is a procedure can here the 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.060
 volume of the traditional and so we 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.580
 can have a higher income than this 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.610
 which is an excellent product of 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.290
 maintenance in my opinion is the best 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.910
 in other markets until they have matched 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.380
 but the question of quality asks 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.420
 really is top right 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.730

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.220

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.810
 as this applicator is 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.180
 explanation that the applicator 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.100
 microfiber technical gas award 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.790
 this one is the high microfibre cloth 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.100
 america prize 40 by 60 he has two 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.940
 sides one side but was punished the other side 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.920
 a little more laughing right in this application 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.240
 removing the oil but was used 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.240
 because I was already at the end 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.970
