00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.470 

alright<00:00:00.659> so<00:00:00.840> a<00:00:01.280> rational<00:00:02.280> number<00:00:02.310> is<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:03.179> number

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
alright so a rational number is a number

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.369 
alright so a rational number is a number
that<00:00:03.659> can<00:00:04.200> be<00:00:04.350> expressed<00:00:04.920> as<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.250> fraction<00:00:05.549> of

00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:06.379 
that can be expressed as a fraction of

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:12.680 
that can be expressed as a fraction of
two<00:00:07.379> integers<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:08.540> comes<00:00:09.540> from<00:00:10.610> ratio<00:00:11.690> ratio

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
two integers and comes from ratio ratio

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.140 
two integers and comes from ratio ratio
is<00:00:13.019> just<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.230> comparison<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.950> two<00:00:14.160> numbers<00:00:14.490> so

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
is just a comparison of two numbers so

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.439 
is just a comparison of two numbers so
this<00:00:15.960> would<00:00:16.109> be<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> rational<00:00:16.529> number<00:00:17.300> one<00:00:18.300> is

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
this would be a rational number one is

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.050 
this would be a rational number one is
an<00:00:18.570> integer<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:19.260> as<00:00:19.380> an<00:00:19.470> integer<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:20.130> this

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
an integer to as an integer and this

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.000 
an integer to as an integer and this
rational<00:00:21.420> number<00:00:21.660> one<00:00:21.840> half<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.260> expressed<00:00:22.710> as

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
rational number one half is expressed as

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.210 
rational number one half is expressed as
that<00:00:23.939> fraction<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.420> two<00:00:24.570> integers<00:00:25.910> and<00:00:28.220> yes

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
that fraction of two integers and yes

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.299 
that fraction of two integers and yes
and<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.730> you've<00:00:29.910> you've<00:00:30.300> done<00:00:30.420> multiplying

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
and so you've you've done multiplying

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.709 
and so you've you've done multiplying
just<00:00:32.309> fractions<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.120> or<00:00:33.329> rational

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
just fractions like that or rational

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.500 
just fractions like that or rational
numbers<00:00:34.020> like<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.070> want<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.280> show<00:00:35.370> you

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
numbers like that and I want to show you

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.010 
numbers like that and I want to show you
what<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.630> do<00:00:36.870> when<00:00:37.820> part<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.420> rational

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
what you do when part of the rational

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.200 
what you do when part of the rational
number<00:00:40.379> or<00:00:40.680> maybe<00:00:41.460> both<00:00:41.670> parts<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
number or maybe both parts of the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.569 
number or maybe both parts of the
rational<00:00:42.960> number<00:00:44.690> it<00:00:45.690> are<00:00:45.989> an<00:00:46.890> algebraic

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
rational number it are an algebraic

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.369 
rational number it are an algebraic
expression<00:00:47.730> something<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.809> with<00:00:49.350> a

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
expression something with with a

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.209 
expression something with with a
variable<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.280> something<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:51.090> an<00:00:51.210> unknown

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
variable in it something with an unknown

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.310 
variable in it something with an unknown
value<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.910> first<00:00:54.270> let's<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.629> let's<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.050> do

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
value so first let's just let's just do

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.279 
value so first let's just let's just do
the<00:00:55.440> old-school<00:00:56.300> multiplying<00:00:57.300> rational

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the old-school multiplying rational

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.319 
the old-school multiplying rational
numbers<00:00:59.719> aka<00:01:00.719> fractions<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.620> case<00:01:01.859> so

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
numbers aka fractions in this case so

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.310 
numbers aka fractions in this case so
remember<00:01:03.329> what<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.480> do<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.870> multiply

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
remember what you do is just multiply

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.969 
remember what you do is just multiply
straight<00:01:04.379> across<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.250> straight<00:01:05.970> across<00:01:06.240> so

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
straight across and straight across so

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.219 
straight across and straight across so
this<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> same<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.760> saying<00:01:08.939> 1<00:01:09.270> times<00:01:09.689> 3

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
this is the same as saying 1 times 3

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.999 
this is the same as saying 1 times 3
over<00:01:11.130> 2<00:01:11.850> times<00:01:12.510> 7<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.439> 1<00:01:13.590> times<00:01:13.770> 3<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.340> 3<00:01:15.799> 2<00:01:16.799> times

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
over 2 times 7 so 1 times 3 is 3 2 times

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.990 
over 2 times 7 so 1 times 3 is 3 2 times
for<00:01:17.250> our<00:01:18.210> 2<00:01:18.390> times<00:01:18.570> 7<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.930> 14<00:01:19.619> right<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.880> just

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
for our 2 times 7 is 14 right so just

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.969 
for our 2 times 7 is 14 right so just
multiply<00:01:21.390> straight<00:01:21.479> across<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.020> that's

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
multiply straight across so that's

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.710 
multiply straight across so that's
that's<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.400> basic<00:01:23.729> thing<00:01:24.360> we're<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.630> be

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
that's the basic thing we're going to be

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.210 
that's the basic thing we're going to be
doing<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:25.530> was<00:01:25.650> mix<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.040> up<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.189> little

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
doing here but was mix it up a little

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.210 
doing here but was mix it up a little
bit<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:27.119> we'll<00:01:27.299> throw<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.630> some<00:01:28.220> some

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
bit because we'll throw in some some

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.560 
bit because we'll throw in some some
variables<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:30.450> turn<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.229> into<00:01:31.439> algebra

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
variables to turn this into algebra

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.569 
variables to turn this into algebra
which<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.689> good<00:01:33.900> stuff<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.320> well<00:01:35.070> multiply

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
which is good stuff so well multiply

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.460 
which is good stuff so well multiply
straight<00:01:35.640> across<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.650> what<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:37.860> means<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.369> 3x

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
straight across so what this means is 3x

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:47.420 
straight across so what this means is 3x
times<00:01:40.470> 4<00:01:41.329> over<00:01:42.740> 2<00:01:43.790> times<00:01:44.790> 5<00:01:45.500> what's<00:01:46.500> 3x<00:01:47.070> times

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
times 4 over 2 times 5 what's 3x times

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:55.520 
times 4 over 2 times 5 what's 3x times
for<00:01:47.820> that's<00:01:48.659> simply<00:01:50.960> 12x<00:01:52.460> okay<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.869> 3<00:01:55.140> times<00:01:55.350> 4

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
for that's simply 12x okay the 3 times 4

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.170 
for that's simply 12x okay the 3 times 4
is<00:01:55.560> 12<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.189> then<00:01:57.049> it's<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:59.130> x<00:01:59.610> x<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.060> can

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
is 12 and then it's the x x you can

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.770 
is 12 and then it's the x x you can
think<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.420> 3x<00:02:01.280> think<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.490> 3<00:02:02.790> x's<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:03.450> 3

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
think of 3x think of it 3 x's just 3

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.429 
think of 3x think of it 3 x's just 3
times<00:02:04.290> X<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.430> really<00:02:05.670> 3x<00:02:06.390> times<00:02:06.600> 4<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.840> 3<00:02:07.170> times

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
times X so really 3x times 4 is 3 times

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.490 
times X so really 3x times 4 is 3 times
x<00:02:07.770> times<00:02:08.670> 4<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.270> then<00:02:09.720> you're<00:02:10.140> allowed<00:02:10.349> to

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
x times 4 and then you're allowed to

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.920 
x times 4 and then you're allowed to
rearrange<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:12.360> doesn't<00:02:12.629> matter<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
rearrange this it doesn't matter the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.670 
rearrange this it doesn't matter the
order<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.349> which<00:02:13.379> you

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
order in which you

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.679 
order in which you
multiply<00:02:14.069> things<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.760> can<00:02:14.849> rearrange

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
multiply things so you can rearrange

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.610 
multiply things so you can rearrange
this<00:02:15.959> as<00:02:16.140> 3<00:02:16.409> times<00:02:17.010> 4<00:02:17.459> times<00:02:17.700> X<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:19.109> that's<00:02:19.260> 12

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
this as 3 times 4 times X so that's 12

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.030 
this as 3 times 4 times X so that's 12
times<00:02:19.980> x<00:02:20.310> which<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:21.780> make<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.140> look<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.650> little

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
times x which to make it look a little

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.789 
times x which to make it look a little
neater<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.519> can<00:02:23.640> say<00:02:23.760> just<00:02:24.030> 12<00:02:24.269> X<00:02:24.480> right<00:02:25.140> okay

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
neater you can say just 12 X right okay

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.030 
neater you can say just 12 X right okay
so<00:02:25.890> 2<00:02:26.159> times<00:02:26.280> 5<00:02:26.519> 10<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.659> actually<00:02:28.500> we<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:28.859> could

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
so 2 times 5 10 and actually we we could

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.399 
so 2 times 5 10 and actually we we could
have<00:02:29.840> reduced<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:31.139> a<00:02:31.200> little<00:02:31.409> bit<00:02:31.590> first

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
have reduced this a little bit first

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.929 
have reduced this a little bit first
here<00:02:34.409> we<00:02:34.620> could<00:02:34.769> pull<00:02:34.920> out<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.099> 2<00:02:35.459> out<00:02:35.639> of<00:02:35.670> there

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
here we could pull out a 2 out of there

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:41.080 
here we could pull out a 2 out of there
we<00:02:36.659> pull<00:02:37.079> two<00:02:37.260> out<00:02:37.409> of<00:02:37.469> there<00:02:38.239> so<00:02:39.239> really

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
we pull two out of there so really

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.720 
we pull two out of there so really
getting<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.299> a<00:02:42.359> little<00:02:42.629> bit<00:02:42.750> simpler<00:02:43.109> form

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
getting it in a little bit simpler form

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.879 
getting it in a little bit simpler form
we<00:02:44.730> have<00:02:44.760> 6<00:02:45.269> x<00:02:46.430> over<00:02:47.430> 5<00:02:48.439> which<00:02:49.439> you<00:02:49.620> can<00:02:49.739> also

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
we have 6 x over 5 which you can also

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:54.229 
we have 6 x over 5 which you can also
write<00:02:50.099> as<00:02:50.220> six<00:02:50.489> fifths<00:02:51.000> x<00:02:51.560> same<00:02:52.560> thing<00:02:53.239> all

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
write as six fifths x same thing all

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.909 
write as six fifths x same thing all
right<00:02:54.359> making<00:02:54.810> sense<00:02:54.989> so<00:02:55.079> far<00:02:55.109> all<00:02:55.799> right

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
right making sense so far all right

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.309 
right making sense so far all right
we're<00:02:56.010> going<00:02:56.099> to<00:02:56.930> complicate<00:02:57.930> things

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
we're going to complicate things

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.949 
we're going to complicate things
slightly<00:02:59.030> here<00:03:00.030> we've<00:03:00.209> got<00:03:00.239> an<00:03:00.480> algebraic

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
slightly here we've got an algebraic

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.199 
slightly here we've got an algebraic
expression<00:03:02.689> with<00:03:04.549> with<00:03:05.549> two<00:03:05.819> things<00:03:05.969> being

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
expression with with two things being

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.229 
expression with with two things being
added<00:03:06.689> so<00:03:07.469> we're<00:03:08.310> going<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.489> we're<00:03:09.060> going<00:03:09.180> to

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
added so we're going to we're going to

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.390 
added so we're going to we're going to
handle<00:03:09.719> that<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:10.079> little<00:03:10.319> bit<00:03:10.409> differently<00:03:10.769> but

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
handle that a little bit differently but

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.580 
handle that a little bit differently but
first<00:03:11.819> just<00:03:12.030> just<00:03:12.930> multiply<00:03:13.260> straight<00:03:13.379> across

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
first just just multiply straight across

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:21.830 
first just just multiply straight across
so<00:03:15.169> we've<00:03:16.169> got<00:03:16.290> 5x<00:03:16.560> plus<00:03:17.099> 3<00:03:18.169> times<00:03:19.169> 3<00:03:19.819> now<00:03:20.819> am<00:03:21.180> I

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
so we've got 5x plus 3 times 3 now am I

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.960 
so we've got 5x plus 3 times 3 now am I
just<00:03:22.079> multiplying<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:22.949> 3<00:03:23.129> times<00:03:23.310> 3<00:03:23.400> or<00:03:23.729> am<00:03:23.879> I

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
just multiplying the 3 times 3 or am I

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.119 
just multiplying the 3 times 3 or am I
multiplying<00:03:24.449> the<00:03:25.169> whole<00:03:26.540> expression<00:03:27.540> x<00:03:28.109> 3<00:03:28.349> i'm

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
multiplying the whole expression x 3 i'm

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.800 
multiplying the whole expression x 3 i'm
multiplying<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.699> whole<00:03:29.849> expression<00:03:30.239> x<00:03:30.629> 3

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
multiplying the whole expression x 3

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.030 
multiplying the whole expression x 3
this<00:03:30.989> this<00:03:31.199> whole<00:03:31.379> thing<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.829> being

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
this this whole thing is being

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.069 
this this whole thing is being
multiplied<00:03:32.430> by<00:03:32.549> 3<00:03:32.579> so<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.359> indicate<00:03:33.780> that<00:03:33.810> this

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
multiplied by 3 so it indicate that this

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.119 
multiplied by 3 so it indicate that this
this<00:03:34.349> is<00:03:34.560> a<00:03:34.590> whole<00:03:34.889> thing<00:03:36.829> let's<00:03:37.829> just<00:03:37.889> rewrite

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
this is a whole thing let's just rewrite

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.390 
this is a whole thing let's just rewrite
it<00:03:38.459> as<00:03:38.810> put<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:39.930> in<00:03:40.049> parentheses<00:03:40.409> like<00:03:40.919> that<00:03:41.069> 5x

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
it as put it in parentheses like that 5x

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:49.099 
it as put it in parentheses like that 5x
plus<00:03:41.790> 3<00:03:43.609> times<00:03:44.609> 3<00:03:45.290> right<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.970> then<00:03:48.120> over<00:03:48.599> 2

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
plus 3 times 3 right and then over 2

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:56.929 
plus 3 times 3 right and then over 2
times<00:03:49.349> 4x<00:03:50.659> ok<00:03:51.659> so<00:03:52.159> to<00:03:53.159> arm<00:03:55.489> to<00:03:56.489> finish<00:03:56.790> this

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:56.939 
times 4x ok so to arm to finish this

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.099 
times 4x ok so to arm to finish this
problem<00:03:57.209> we're<00:03:57.720> going<00:03:57.810> to<00:03:57.930> have<00:03:58.019> to

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
problem we're going to have to

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:04.999 
problem we're going to have to
distribute<00:03:58.919> this<00:03:59.549> 3<00:04:01.790> through<00:04:02.790> through<00:04:04.009> what's

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:05.009 
distribute this 3 through through what's

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:06.740 
distribute this 3 through through what's
inside<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.459> parentheses<00:04:05.579> so<00:04:06.269> I'm<00:04:06.509> going<00:04:06.659> to

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
inside the parentheses so I'm going to

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.659 
inside the parentheses so I'm going to
rearrange<00:04:06.989> this<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.799> say<00:04:07.979> it's<00:04:08.159> three<00:04:08.430> times

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
rearrange this and say it's three times

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.020 
rearrange this and say it's three times
5x<00:04:09.060> plus<00:04:09.509> 3<00:04:10.009> so<00:04:11.009> I<00:04:11.040> think<00:04:11.129> we're<00:04:11.729> all<00:04:11.790> kind<00:04:11.970> of

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
5x plus 3 so I think we're all kind of

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.369 
5x plus 3 so I think we're all kind of
used<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.329> going<00:04:12.509> left<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.870> right<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:13.079> little<00:04:13.259> bit

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
used to going left to right a little bit

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.219 
used to going left to right a little bit
so<00:04:14.389> so<00:04:15.389> first<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.229> do<00:04:16.289> with<00:04:16.470> three<00:04:16.829> times<00:04:17.220> 5x<00:04:17.489> and

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
so so first I do with three times 5x and

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.879 
so so first I do with three times 5x and
then<00:04:19.229> I<00:04:19.320> do<00:04:19.380> 3<00:04:19.799> times<00:04:20.099> 3<00:04:21.049> so<00:04:22.049> really<00:04:22.229> all<00:04:22.529> right

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
then I do 3 times 3 so really all right

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.659 
then I do 3 times 3 so really all right
i'm<00:04:23.099> going<00:04:23.250> to<00:04:23.389> rewrite<00:04:24.389> this<00:04:24.719> over<00:04:25.590> here<00:04:25.740> so<00:04:25.950> 3

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
i'm going to rewrite this over here so 3

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.870 
i'm going to rewrite this over here so 3
times<00:04:26.700> 5x

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
times 5x

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.020 
times 5x
is<00:04:27.990> 15<00:04:28.990> x<00:04:30.600> 3<00:04:31.600> times<00:04:31.960> 3<00:04:32.050> is<00:04:32.260> 9<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:32.950> this<00:04:33.160> whole<00:04:33.310> top

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
is 15 x 3 times 3 is 9 so this whole top

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.670 
is 15 x 3 times 3 is 9 so this whole top
term<00:04:34.300> becomes<00:04:34.690> 15<00:04:35.170> x<00:04:35.380> plus<00:04:35.740> 9<00:04:36.010> over<00:04:37.740> 2<00:04:39.030> times<00:04:40.030> 4x

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
term becomes 15 x plus 9 over 2 times 4x

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.180 
term becomes 15 x plus 9 over 2 times 4x
which<00:04:41.680> is<00:04:41.940> 8x<00:04:44.160> now<00:04:45.160> we<00:04:45.220> can't<00:04:45.880> simplify<00:04:46.780> that

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
which is 8x now we can't simplify that

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.130 
which is 8x now we can't simplify that
any<00:04:48.190> further<00:04:48.400> there's<00:04:49.270> no<00:04:49.450> factors<00:04:49.900> that<00:04:50.050> we

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
any further there's no factors that we

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.170 
any further there's no factors that we
can<00:04:50.260> pull<00:04:50.470> out<00:04:50.650> of<00:04:50.800> both<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.610> numerator<00:04:51.790> and

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
can pull out of both the numerator and

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.600 
can pull out of both the numerator and
the<00:04:52.240> denominator<00:04:52.330> and<00:04:53.080> then<00:04:53.370> divide<00:04:54.370> them<00:04:54.490> out

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
the denominator and then divide them out

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.700 
the denominator and then divide them out
so<00:04:55.350> that<00:04:56.350> would<00:04:56.530> be<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:57.220> answer<00:04:58.020> alright<00:04:59.020> last

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
so that would be the answer alright last

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.430 
so that would be the answer alright last
one<00:05:00.000> can<00:05:01.000> I<00:05:01.060> going<00:05:01.660> back<00:05:01.780> to<00:05:01.930> simple<00:05:02.230> land

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
one can I going back to simple land

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.700

again<00:05:03.600> after<00:05:04.600> the<00:05:04.750> mind<00:05:04.960> stretching<00:05:05.200> number

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
again after the mind stretching number

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.350 
again after the mind stretching number
three<00:05:05.890> here<00:05:06.190> so<00:05:06.730> straight<00:05:07.570> across<00:05:07.920> 2x<00:05:09.360> times

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
three here so straight across 2x times

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.170 
three here so straight across 2x times
52<00:05:11.050> x<00:05:11.560> times<00:05:12.040> 5<00:05:12.280> remember<00:05:12.730> that<00:05:12.880> you<00:05:13.000> can<00:05:13.120> think

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
52 x times 5 remember that you can think

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.850 
52 x times 5 remember that you can think
of<00:05:13.300> think<00:05:13.660> of<00:05:13.690> that<00:05:13.840> as<00:05:13.930> 2<00:05:14.170> times<00:05:14.350> X<00:05:14.620> times<00:05:14.770> 5

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
of think of that as 2 times X times 5

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:23.010 
of think of that as 2 times X times 5
over<00:05:17.860> 10<00:05:18.580> times<00:05:19.030> 4x<00:05:20.250> now<00:05:21.720> before<00:05:22.720> we<00:05:22.900> go

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
over 10 times 4x now before we go

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.560 
over 10 times 4x now before we go
further<00:05:23.230> let's<00:05:24.130> look<00:05:24.250> for<00:05:24.490> shortcuts<00:05:24.880> to<00:05:25.390> make

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
further let's look for shortcuts to make

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.680 
further let's look for shortcuts to make
life<00:05:25.840> easier<00:05:26.440> for<00:05:26.500> us<00:05:27.390> let's<00:05:28.390> see<00:05:28.450> if<00:05:28.540> there's

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
life easier for us let's see if there's

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.420 
life easier for us let's see if there's
any<00:05:28.810> factors<00:05:29.260> that<00:05:29.440> we<00:05:29.560> can<00:05:29.680> pull<00:05:29.890> out<00:05:30.040> of<00:05:30.070> of

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
any factors that we can pull out of of

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.580 
any factors that we can pull out of of
both<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:31.420> top<00:05:31.600> and<00:05:31.660> bottom<00:05:31.840> and<00:05:32.230> divide<00:05:32.560> them

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
both the top and bottom and divide them

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.970 
both the top and bottom and divide them
divide<00:05:33.100> them<00:05:33.220> away<00:05:34.380> so<00:05:35.380> part<00:05:35.680> of<00:05:35.710> me<00:05:35.770> while<00:05:35.950> I

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
divide them away so part of me while I

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.570 
divide them away so part of me while I
grab<00:05:36.100> a<00:05:36.220> sip<00:05:36.490> of<00:05:36.580> coffee<00:05:36.640> here<00:05:37.060> um<00:05:37.710> yes<00:05:38.710> factors

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
grab a sip of coffee here um yes factors

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.690 
grab a sip of coffee here um yes factors
so<00:05:40.080> let's<00:05:41.080> rewrite<00:05:41.260> the<00:05:42.070> top<00:05:42.370> as<00:05:43.530> 2<00:05:44.530> times<00:05:45.250> X

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
so let's rewrite the top as 2 times X

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.080 
so let's rewrite the top as 2 times X
times<00:05:46.300> 5<00:05:46.720> and<00:05:47.110> then<00:05:48.100> rewrite<00:05:48.460> the<00:05:48.610> bottom<00:05:48.970> as

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
times 5 and then rewrite the bottom as

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:59.310 
times 5 and then rewrite the bottom as
four<00:05:54.870> times<00:05:55.980> X<00:05:57.270> times<00:05:58.270> 10<00:05:58.960> I'm<00:05:59.200> just

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
four times X times 10 I'm just

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.840 
four times X times 10 I'm just
rearranging<00:05:59.890> the<00:06:00.040> numbers<00:06:00.340> to<00:06:00.580> make<00:06:00.700> it

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
rearranging the numbers to make it

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.020 
rearranging the numbers to make it
easier<00:06:01.180> to<00:06:01.300> see<00:06:01.480> what<00:06:01.750> we<00:06:01.900> can<00:06:02.520> factor<00:06:03.520> way<00:06:03.910> so

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
easier to see what we can factor way so

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.570 
easier to see what we can factor way so
X<00:06:07.030> divided<00:06:07.540> by<00:06:07.630> X<00:06:07.870> is<00:06:08.140> just<00:06:08.590> 1<00:06:08.860> anything

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
X divided by X is just 1 anything

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.650 
X divided by X is just 1 anything
divided<00:06:09.820> by<00:06:09.850> itself<00:06:09.940> is<00:06:10.240> 1<00:06:10.300> so<00:06:11.610> these<00:06:12.660> these

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
divided by itself is 1 so these these

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.750 
divided by itself is 1 so these these
are<00:06:13.720> gone<00:06:13.990> 1<00:06:14.770> x<00:06:15.010> 2<00:06:15.750> x<00:06:16.750> 5<00:06:17.220> it's<00:06:18.220> just<00:06:18.460> two<00:06:18.580> times

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
are gone 1 x 2 x 5 it's just two times

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.760 
are gone 1 x 2 x 5 it's just two times
five<00:06:18.940> so<00:06:19.300> we<00:06:19.540> can<00:06:19.690> ignore<00:06:19.840> it<00:06:20.020> so<00:06:20.260> the<00:06:20.350> exes<00:06:20.650> are

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
five so we can ignore it so the exes are

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.230 
five so we can ignore it so the exes are
gone<00:06:21.000> they<00:06:22.000> cancel<00:06:22.390> each<00:06:22.420> other<00:06:22.570> out<00:06:23.610> here<00:06:24.610> we

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
gone they cancel each other out here we

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.640 
gone they cancel each other out here we
can<00:06:25.390> pull<00:06:25.630> a<00:06:25.900> two<00:06:27.840> out<00:06:28.840> of<00:06:28.900> a<00:06:29.200> 2<00:06:29.380> 2<00:06:30.010> times<00:06:30.300> 1<00:06:31.300> is<00:06:31.510> 2

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
can pull a two out of a 2 2 times 1 is 2

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.350 
can pull a two out of a 2 2 times 1 is 2
we're<00:06:32.650> left<00:06:32.800> with<00:06:32.890> a<00:06:32.950> 1<00:06:33.220> here<00:06:33.490> left<00:06:34.090> with<00:06:34.210> one

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
we're left with a 1 here left with one

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.130 
we're left with a 1 here left with one
there<00:06:34.540> one<00:06:34.720> there<00:06:35.820> two<00:06:36.820> goes<00:06:37.060> into<00:06:37.090> 42<00:06:37.900> times

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
there one there two goes into 42 times

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.060 
there one there two goes into 42 times
so<00:06:38.350> we're<00:06:38.560> left<00:06:38.680> with<00:06:38.860> a<00:06:38.919> 2<00:06:39.160> down<00:06:39.370> there

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
so we're left with a 2 down there

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.490 
so we're left with a 2 down there
we<00:06:40.700> can<00:06:40.850> do<00:06:40.910> the<00:06:41.030> same<00:06:41.210> sort<00:06:41.570> of<00:06:41.630> thing<00:06:41.690> here<00:06:42.290> we

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
we can do the same sort of thing here we

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.560 
we can do the same sort of thing here we
can<00:06:42.650> we<00:06:42.950> can<00:06:43.070> pull<00:06:43.250> out<00:06:43.370> a<00:06:43.700> 5<00:06:44.120> out<00:06:44.330> of<00:06:44.360> both

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.570 
can we can pull out a 5 out of both

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.810 
can we can pull out a 5 out of both
these<00:06:44.750> guys<00:06:44.960> so<00:06:45.310> pulling<00:06:46.310> a<00:06:46.370> five<00:06:46.520> hour<00:06:46.700> there

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
these guys so pulling a five hour there

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.140 
these guys so pulling a five hour there
five<00:06:47.150> goes<00:06:47.330> into<00:06:47.360> 10<00:06:47.720> twice<00:06:48.110> so<00:06:48.940> if<00:06:49.940> we<00:06:50.000> divide

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
five goes into 10 twice so if we divide

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.890 
five goes into 10 twice so if we divide
both<00:06:50.830> this<00:06:51.830> and<00:06:52.070> this<00:06:52.400> by<00:06:53.060> five<00:06:53.330> we<00:06:53.570> get<00:06:53.690> two

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900 
both this and this by five we get two

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.790 
both this and this by five we get two
and<00:06:54.200> one<00:06:54.590> so<00:06:55.280> actually<00:06:56.260> everything<00:06:57.260> up<00:06:57.590> top

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 
and one so actually everything up top

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.550 
and one so actually everything up top
cancelled<00:06:58.580> away<00:06:58.760> or<00:06:58.940> became<00:06:59.210> ones<00:06:59.570> so<00:07:00.020> the<00:07:00.290> top

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 
cancelled away or became ones so the top

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:08.170 
cancelled away or became ones so the top
is<00:07:01.840> one<00:07:02.840> and<00:07:03.140> then<00:07:03.980> we've<00:07:04.100> got<00:07:05.410> 2<00:07:06.410> left<00:07:06.950> 2<00:07:07.340> times

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
is one and then we've got 2 left 2 times

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.650 
is one and then we've got 2 left 2 times
2<00:07:08.800> so<00:07:09.800> which<00:07:10.130> is<00:07:10.280> 4<00:07:10.550> so<00:07:11.390> this<00:07:11.750> whole<00:07:11.960> thing

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:13.660 
2 so which is 4 so this whole thing

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.620 
2 so which is 4 so this whole thing
becomes<00:07:14.660> simply<00:07:15.880> one-fourth<00:07:16.880> so<00:07:17.300> look<00:07:17.450> for

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:17.630 
becomes simply one-fourth so look for

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.360 
becomes simply one-fourth so look for
look<00:07:17.960> for<00:07:18.110> shortcuts<00:07:18.230> when<00:07:19.190> you're

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:19.370 
look for shortcuts when you're

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.960 
look for shortcuts when you're
multiplying<00:07:20.950> rational<00:07:21.950> numbers<00:07:22.460> see<00:07:22.700> if<00:07:22.880> you

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:22.970 
multiplying rational numbers see if you

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.970 
multiplying rational numbers see if you
can<00:07:23.120> cancel<00:07:23.360> things<00:07:23.900> out<00:07:24.380> of<00:07:24.440> the<00:07:24.710> top<00:07:24.920> and

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:24.980 
can cancel things out of the top and

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.540 
can cancel things out of the top and
bottom<00:07:25.280> figure<00:07:26.210> out<00:07:26.390> what<00:07:26.480> the<00:07:26.600> factors<00:07:27.020> are

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:27.550 
bottom figure out what the factors are

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.910 
bottom figure out what the factors are
and<00:07:28.550> then<00:07:28.880> pull<00:07:29.120> those<00:07:29.240> factors<00:07:29.630> out<00:07:29.810> to<00:07:30.230> to

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:30.920 
and then pull those factors out to to

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:36.370 
and then pull those factors out to to
get<00:07:31.010> a<00:07:31.390> more<00:07:32.390> simple<00:07:33.290> a<00:07:33.440> simpler<00:07:35.230> fraction<00:07:36.230> in

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:36.380 
get a more simple a simpler fraction in

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.040 
get a more simple a simpler fraction in
the<00:07:36.440> end
