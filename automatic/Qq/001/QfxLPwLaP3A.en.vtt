okay<00:00:00.690> this<00:00:00.960> is<00:00:01.170> the<00:00:01.350> Kubota<00:00:01.800> RTV<00:00:02.550> 1100<00:00:03.710> and<00:00:04.710> a

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
okay this is the Kubota RTV 1100 and a

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.760 
okay this is the Kubota RTV 1100 and a
few<00:00:05.310> years<00:00:05.549> ago<00:00:05.750> when<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:06.810> first<00:00:07.140> got<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:07.589> I

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
few years ago when I first got this I

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.490 
few years ago when I first got this I
put<00:00:07.950> this<00:00:08.130> turbocharger<00:00:08.940> on<00:00:09.090> it<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:10.050> problem

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
put this turbocharger on it the problem

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.370 
put this turbocharger on it the problem
with<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.860> turbocharger<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.570> once<00:00:13.170> it

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
with the turbocharger is that once it

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.499 
with the turbocharger is that once it
gets<00:00:13.530> hot<00:00:13.799> you're<00:00:14.519> essentially<00:00:15.030> pumping<00:00:15.360> hot

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
gets hot you're essentially pumping hot

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.200 
gets hot you're essentially pumping hot
air<00:00:15.719> into<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.109> motor<00:00:16.340> so<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.550> solution<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.150> to

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
air into the motor so the solution is to

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.150 
air into the motor so the solution is to
inter<00:00:18.570> cool<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.199> can<00:00:19.619> do<00:00:19.710> an<00:00:19.830> air-to-air

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
inter cool it you can do an air-to-air

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.150 
inter cool it you can do an air-to-air
intercooler<00:00:20.460> or<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.539> water<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.439> air<00:00:22.590> inner<00:00:22.859> core

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
intercooler or a water to air inner core

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.529 
intercooler or a water to air inner core
the<00:00:23.519> trouble<00:00:23.850> with<00:00:23.970> an<00:00:24.119> air-to-air

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
the trouble with an air-to-air

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.779 
the trouble with an air-to-air
intercooler<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.490> run<00:00:26.640> it

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
intercooler is you have to run it

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.339 
intercooler is you have to run it
upfront<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.510> by<00:00:27.660> time<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.990> do<00:00:28.109> all<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
upfront and by time you do all the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.529 
upfront and by time you do all the
charge<00:00:28.619> pipe<00:00:28.890> you're<00:00:29.880> going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.090> lose<00:00:30.269> two<00:00:30.510> or

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
charge pipe you're going to lose two or

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.930 
charge pipe you're going to lose two or
three<00:00:30.810> pounds<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.199> pressure<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.890> just<00:00:32.550> tiny

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
three pounds of pressure and just tiny

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.549 
three pounds of pressure and just tiny
three<00:00:33.390> cylinder<00:00:33.780> engine<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:34.140> only<00:00:34.290> going<00:00:34.469> to

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
three cylinder engine is only going to

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.310 
three cylinder engine is only going to
get<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.800> five<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.940> seven<00:00:36.300> pounds<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.930> boost<00:00:37.079> to

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
get you five to seven pounds of boost to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.600 
get you five to seven pounds of boost to
begin<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.070> don't<00:00:38.100> want<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.460> lose

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
begin with so you don't want to lose

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.150 
begin with so you don't want to lose
that<00:00:38.660> so<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.899> solution<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.590> come<00:00:40.890> up<00:00:41.010> with

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
that so the solution is to come up with

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.920 
that so the solution is to come up with
the<00:00:41.280> water<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.879> air<00:00:42.030> inner<00:00:42.329> core<00:00:42.600> which<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
the water to air inner core which is

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.790 
the water to air inner core which is
what<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.260> did

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
what I did

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.690 
what I did
you<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.700> see<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.090> there<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:47.430> way<00:00:47.579> it

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
you can see it there and the way it

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.900 
you can see it there and the way it
works<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.270> circulates<00:00:48.899> water<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.879> have<00:00:50.879> a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
works is it circulates water I have a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.630 
works is it circulates water I have a
pump<00:00:51.270> right<00:00:52.399> there<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:54.300> pumps<00:00:54.660> water

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
pump right there and that pumps water

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.069 
pump right there and that pumps water
into<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.420> intercooler

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
into the intercooler

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.490 
into the intercooler
and<00:00:58.230> back<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.460> there's<00:00:59.820> a<00:01:00.090> catch<00:01:00.780> basin<00:01:01.050> and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
and back here there's a catch basin and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.260 
and back here there's a catch basin and
then<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.710> comes<00:01:01.890> out<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.250> catch-can<00:01:02.940> and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
then it comes out of that catch-can and

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.690 
then it comes out of that catch-can and
comes<00:01:04.049> all<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.290> way<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:04.439> front<00:01:04.830> here

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
comes all the way up front here

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.539 
comes all the way up front here
and<00:01:06.320> then<00:01:07.320> right<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.680> front<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.070> radiator

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
and then right in front of the radiator

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:17.870 
and then right in front of the radiator
down<00:01:09.240> here<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:11.869> got<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:16.070> heat<00:01:17.070> exchanger<00:01:17.670> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
down here I got a heat exchanger a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.940 
down here I got a heat exchanger a
heater<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.049> know<00:01:19.170> out<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.439> heater<00:01:19.650> for

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
heater for you know out of a heater for

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.490 
heater for you know out of a heater for
for<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> heating<00:01:20.790> system<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.479> truck<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.409> I

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
for a heating system in a truck and I

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.929 
for a heating system in a truck and I
mounted<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.100> front<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.460> radiator<00:01:23.790> to

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
mounted it in front of the radiator to

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.760 
mounted it in front of the radiator to
keep<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.299> cool<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.840> then<00:01:25.830> inside<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.400> cab<00:01:26.700> I

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
keep it cool and then inside the cab I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.340 
keep it cool and then inside the cab I
have<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.920> button<00:01:29.220> right<00:01:29.490> here<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.350> that

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
have this button right here and that

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.660 
have this button right here and that
turns<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.829> my<00:01:31.979> pulp<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.570> circulates

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
turns on my pulp and that circulates

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.130 
turns on my pulp and that circulates
that<00:01:36.670> circulates

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
that circulates

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.140 
that circulates
water<00:01:38.740> actually<00:01:39.370> any<00:01:39.790> preschool

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.970 

then<00:01:43.510> you<00:01:43.600> can<00:01:43.750> see<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:44.050> charge<00:01:44.320> pilot<00:01:44.740> comes

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
then you can see the charge pilot comes

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.179 
then you can see the charge pilot comes
into<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.460> unit<00:01:45.700> for

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.429 

and<00:01:51.520> what<00:01:51.969> I've<00:01:52.119> noticed<00:01:52.539> with<00:01:52.689> it<00:01:52.899> is<00:01:53.079> is<00:01:53.380> that

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
and what I've noticed with it is is that

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.739 
and what I've noticed with it is is that
it<00:01:53.829> really<00:01:54.280> has<00:01:54.460> made<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.729> big<00:01:55.179> difference<00:01:55.210> in

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:55.749 
it really has made a big difference in

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:58.440 
it really has made a big difference in
the<00:01:55.869> machine<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:57.670> power<00:01:57.850> doesn't<00:01:58.149> drop

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
the machine it the power doesn't drop

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.050 
the machine it the power doesn't drop
off<00:01:58.689> once<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.170> gets<00:01:59.380> warm<00:02:00.189> because<00:02:00.850> that

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
off once it gets warm because that

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.209 
off once it gets warm because that
intercooler<00:02:01.569> keeps<00:02:01.899> it<00:02:02.109> the<00:02:02.679> charge<00:02:02.979> they<00:02:03.189> are

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
intercooler keeps it the charge they are

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.840 
intercooler keeps it the charge they are
always<00:02:03.729> cool<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:05.619> as<00:02:05.859> far<00:02:06.009> as<00:02:06.159> I<00:02:06.249> know<00:02:06.310> this<00:02:06.700> is

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
always cool so as far as I know this is

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.109 
always cool so as far as I know this is
the<00:02:06.880> world's<00:02:07.299> first<00:02:07.359> turbo<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:08.349> intercooled

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
the world's first turbo and intercooled

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.900 
the world's first turbo and intercooled

turned it turned up to pump there's a

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.309 
turned it turned up to pump there's a
whole<00:02:15.760> procedure<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.480> doing<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.170> can

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
whole procedure to doing that you can

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.020 
whole procedure to doing that you can
find<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.680> out<00:02:17.769> on<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.069> internet<00:02:18.430> there's<00:02:18.700> some

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
find it out on the internet there's some

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.180 
find it out on the internet there's some
instructions<00:02:19.629> on<00:02:19.750> how<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.900> do<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.260> involves

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
instructions on how to do that involves

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.940 
instructions on how to do that involves
removing<00:02:21.610> shims<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.180> then<00:02:22.950> making

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
removing shims and then making

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.650 
removing shims and then making
adjustments<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.519> the<00:02:24.610> pump<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.120> increase<00:02:25.450> the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
adjustments to the pump to increase the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.940 
adjustments to the pump to increase the
pressure<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.319> then<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.530> other<00:02:26.650> thing<00:02:26.920> you

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
pressure and then the other thing you

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.559 
pressure and then the other thing you
need<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.220> do<00:02:27.459> on<00:02:27.640> this<00:02:27.760> machine<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:28.360> there's

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
need to do on this machine is there's

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.180 
need to do on this machine is there's
check<00:02:28.870> valves<00:02:29.319> in<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.500> forward<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.099> the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
check valves in the forward and the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.360 
check valves in the forward and the
reverse<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:31.140> just<00:02:32.140> read<00:02:32.319> a<00:02:32.349> transmission<00:02:33.129> and

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
reverse I just read a transmission and

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.460 
reverse I just read a transmission and
you<00:02:34.000> have<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.239> take<00:02:34.420> those<00:02:34.599> valves<00:02:34.870> out<00:02:35.200> and

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
you have to take those valves out and

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.780 
you have to take those valves out and
you<00:02:35.530> have<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.799> turn<00:02:35.980> them<00:02:36.099> up<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.430> increase<00:02:36.730> the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
you have to turn them up to increase the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.850 
you have to turn them up to increase the
pressure<00:02:36.940> in<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.480> transmission<00:02:38.170> otherwise

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
pressure in the transmission otherwise

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.979 
pressure in the transmission otherwise
the<00:02:39.069> power<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:39.430> wasted<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:40.060> just<00:02:40.299> blows

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
the power is wasted it just blows

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.360 
the power is wasted it just blows
through<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.379> transmission<00:02:41.739> blows<00:02:42.160> through

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
through the transmission blows through

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.880 
through the transmission blows through
the<00:02:42.400> check<00:02:42.670> valve<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:44.319> machine<00:02:44.680> is

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
the check valve the machine is

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.530 
the check valve the machine is
completely<00:02:45.220> different<00:02:45.640> with<00:02:46.359> the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
completely different with the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.080 
completely different with the
turbocharger<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.260> intercooler<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:48.129> would<00:02:48.819> say

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
turbocharger and intercooler I would say

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.500 
turbocharger and intercooler I would say
the<00:02:49.660> torque<00:02:49.959> has<00:02:50.140> been<00:02:50.349> easily<00:02:50.799> doubled<00:02:51.510> hills

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
the torque has been easily doubled hills

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.270 
the torque has been easily doubled hills
that<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:52.780> kind<00:02:53.049> of<00:02:53.109> climb<00:02:53.319> before<00:02:53.500> this<00:02:54.099> thing

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
that I kind of climb before this thing

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.759 
that I kind of climb before this thing
just<00:02:54.430> walks<00:02:54.670> right<00:02:54.879> up<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:55.209> so<00:02:55.989> that's<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.470> the

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
just walks right up it so that's it the

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.390 
just walks right up it so that's it the
world's<00:02:57.069> first<00:02:57.250> turbo<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.269> intercooled

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
world's first turbo and intercooled

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.019
