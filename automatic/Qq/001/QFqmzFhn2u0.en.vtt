right now we've been able to you know be

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.590 
right now we've been able to you know be
one<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.830> top<00:00:16.980> 10<00:00:17.250> teams<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.449> country

one of the top 10 teams in the country

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.080 
one of the top 10 teams in the country
and<00:00:18.900> lacrosse<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.470> think<00:00:19.619> that's<00:00:19.770> been<00:00:19.920> a

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
and lacrosse and I think that's been a

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.250 
and lacrosse and I think that's been a
been<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> goal<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.359> ours<00:00:21.600> for<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> while<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.140> now

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
been a goal of ours for a while and now

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.330 
been a goal of ours for a while and now
I<00:00:22.289> think<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.590> next<00:00:22.650> goal<00:00:23.039> for<00:00:23.220> us<00:00:23.279> is

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
I think the next goal for us is

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.009 
I think the next goal for us is
obviously<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.689> win<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> national

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
obviously to to win a national

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.420 
obviously to to win a national
championship<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.769> think<00:00:25.920> that's<00:00:26.070> something<00:00:26.189> we

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
championship I think that's something we

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.720 
championship I think that's something we
talk<00:00:26.609> about<00:00:26.640> our<00:00:27.119> guys<00:00:27.689> talked<00:00:27.960> about<00:00:28.609> in<00:00:29.609> our

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
talk about our guys talked about in our

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.849 
talk about our guys talked about in our
school<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.170> definitely<00:00:31.170> behind<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.619> goal

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
school is definitely behind that goal

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.220 
school is definitely behind that goal
and<00:00:31.890> our<00:00:32.880> athletic<00:00:33.420> department<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.899> as<00:00:34.050> well

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
and our athletic department is as well

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.350 
and our athletic department is as well
and<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.530> think<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:35.489> for<00:00:35.670> us<00:00:35.730> right<00:00:35.940> now<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.180> know

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
and I think so for us right now you know

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.180 
and I think so for us right now you know
continually<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.079> build<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:37.890> what<00:00:38.010> we've<00:00:38.100> been

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
probably been one of my something I've

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.740 
probably been one of my something I've
really<00:00:53.579> enjoyed<00:00:53.730> over<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.390> last<00:00:54.539> couple

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
really enjoyed over the last couple

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.810 
really enjoyed over the last couple
years<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.469> kind<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.680> referencing<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
years is really kind of referencing the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.849 
years is really kind of referencing the
recruits<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:58.170> student<00:00:58.440> athletes<00:00:58.739> were

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
recruits and the student athletes were

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.979 
recruits and the student athletes were
bringing<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.399> now<00:00:59.579> compared<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> maybe<00:01:00.780> when

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
bringing and now compared to maybe when

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.410 
bringing and now compared to maybe when
I<00:01:01.020> first<00:01:01.260> got<00:01:01.440> here<00:01:01.680> back<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:03.210> late<00:01:03.390> 90s

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
I first got here back in the late 90s

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.530 
I first got here back in the late 90s
and<00:01:04.430> you<00:01:05.430> know<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.549> think<00:01:05.790> what's<00:01:06.299> special

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and you know I think what's special

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.929 
and you know I think what's special
about<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.260> my<00:01:07.350> mind<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.369> don't

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
about that in my mind is that I don't

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.969 
about that in my mind is that I don't
think<00:01:09.180> we're<00:01:09.299> bringing<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.810> different<00:01:10.290> type

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
think we're bringing in a different type

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.160 
think we're bringing in a different type
of<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.549> different<00:01:12.000> type<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.330> person<00:01:12.360> i<00:01:12.869> think

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
of a different type of a person i think

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.359 
of a different type of a person i think
the<00:01:13.290> characteristics<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.979> those<00:01:14.130> guys<00:01:14.310> are

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the characteristics of those guys are

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.870 
the characteristics of those guys are
are<00:01:15.000> really<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> same<00:01:16.140> i<00:01:16.710> think<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.100> i<00:01:17.460> see<00:01:17.850> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
think that there's a tremendous amount

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.210 
think that there's a tremendous amount
of<00:03:07.109> learning<00:03:07.409> going<00:03:07.560> on<00:03:07.799> in<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.040> practice

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
of learning going on in that practice

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.729 
of learning going on in that practice
field<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:09.269> on<00:03:09.359> that<00:03:09.480> game<00:03:09.720> field<00:03:10.049> from<00:03:10.530> four

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
field and on that game field from four

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.069

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
to six in the afternoon and so there's

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.899 
to six in the afternoon and so there's
such<00:03:13.349> a<00:03:13.379> wide<00:03:13.500> variety<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.340> things<00:03:14.579> that<00:03:14.790> we
