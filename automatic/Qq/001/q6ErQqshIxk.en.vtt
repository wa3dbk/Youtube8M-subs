00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.460
 meanwhile the juve di has started very well 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.610
 marine with a great shot of marchisio ci 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.849
 I bet the real Madrid goal with 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.410
 cristiano ronaldo 1 to 0 for the real 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:20.039
 let's go also on marcello chirico that is 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.020
 cost a game marcello immediately 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.850
 ready off we have greeted each other for 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.890
 advertising saying great start 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.580
 of juve look that if they weren't civil 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:34.860
 they break with draws and marcello parties 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:38.190
 well then he had committed so many others 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.950
 times more anti way than even with Milan 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.940
 20 seconds 20 seconds more goals 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:50.930
 let's go to whoever I want from 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.930
 dedicate to all lozano with the races 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.699
 you win like you are violent 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.760
 seen well since you are all in front 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.600
 to the television that the zero hundred looks 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.890
 so you don't win for sure so very good 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:12.299
 what had come in then had not entered 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.970
 in the penalty kick but gave him the 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.189
 penalty kick at the penalty kick 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.740
 but what is missing 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.170
 what can be there do not give up for one 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.750
 restrained on ramos for friend not 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.299
 jokes see but kick right 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.240
 no real merit if we ship it 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.390
 they are still protesting against hashish 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.640
 chiellini kellerine kenney calls them 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.700
 penalties seem exaggerated to me 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.300
 exaggerated but chiellini 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.280
 force in europe this is the rigor o 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.960
 less for much less two years ago a 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.150
 barcelona su nesta gave us rigor 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.820
 as from this penalty on corner not 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.800
 yet beaten you see you are not used to it 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.710
 the question deserves this rigor 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.360
 provocative never gone red for i 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.270
 files in Italy should be whistled 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.860
 this chapter a probable but 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.190
 apparently only the referee marked it 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.490
 and the assistant remembers and not larvae 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.899
 for which only in exceptional 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.250
 helping his redemption we are also 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:24.790
 release his reaction to the goal 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:27.100
 here is barbara no this time a 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.700
 relative around to everything throughout 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.860
 the game had no penalty but what 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.170
 crashed into the ground but kicked the 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.030
 cameo kicked the ground 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.330
 it seems to me completely out for now 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.500
 he says he is not given by the clerks 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.690
 value to the juventus point not so a 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.290
 you don't eat when you touch the game 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.870
 the point is that the dog is finished 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.630
 we will leave with us now we will go to 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.060
 see everyone a nard shame in May 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.489
 shameful a shame says what 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.810
 have ronaldo a shame for the sport 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.810
 goes internationally for you
