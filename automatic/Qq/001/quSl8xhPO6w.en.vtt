00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.220
 Scientists have discovered the world's first mixed shark 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.209
 They found that Shark Bob gains 呃... 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:11.969
 And sad is basically Australia's charming black tip shark 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.320
 Content black 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.570
 Australian Lactic Acid Shark, who has a common black tip that lives in warm waters 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.940
 My sister’s thinking outside of the cold water may be for 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.540
 Reproduce ANZAC to create other small sharks for Macs that can live in the cold 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.000
 The temperature starts to bypass so this happens is Australia 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.450
 Collective short 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.159
 Hey... in the colder waters of this article, like 

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:42.609
 Anyone knows that a lot of eloquent facts they have written prove that he throws 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.000
 People's rights 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.239
 country 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.510
 Participate because of Starr 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.590
 may 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.070
 Global warming is big, because 呃... in temperature fluctuations 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.400
 Oh... if water, so it actually changes the climate now at this stage of the dummy 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.370
 although 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.989
 Hey... looking for a sudden change in the Australian Blackwater soda 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.400
 Living in the cold war, I think it’s like because of the climate among them 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.170
 Socks change part of the excellent right not to buy 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.960
 Evolution 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.509
 For the first time, I feel liberal, she has always been concerned about the climate. 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:18.110
 change 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.820
 Because all he is doing a Ph.D. development and everything is going to be 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.840
 Production, if we give all will no longer Cubans 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.700
 it is good 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.830
 Anyway, we may have six arms and three eyes or different ways by the user. 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.950
 Something is a bit loaded 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.920
 I got it, so it goes straight to you and I won't watch 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.350
 At, you can start to see backups close to my love, but the world 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.810
 Yes story 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.990
 Yes 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.010
 None of my people 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.270
 But this week’s only part of the chart we just saw that they were recorded as 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.390
 We talk about chaos, you see this is their present, they have this new 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.450
 Hybrid version 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.850
 What do you know, probably decide 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.080
 Fiber version 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.820
 Hey... Australia’s collective shock so that 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.079
 So, what would you be the prize blue to make it happen 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.679
 Again, we got the third prediction 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:15.169
 Point is an emotion to create a mixed version 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.339
 11 points out of a couple's other things about strike cells 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:20.770
 Science is the twentieth percent 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.420
呃...the special field of the black tip population is broken 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.409
 Australia 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.099
 Hey... the mix chart is correct, so now they are trying to figure out 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.749
 Whether this is a recent occurrence or if it happens 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:33.989
 a period of time 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.569
 They just found out now and they did not conclude that this is 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.950
 Because of evolution, this is because of a monstrous and climate change. 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.810
 There is no clear answer, but I am satisfied, I think there is some truth. 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.450
 Since, especially the shark's hybrid chart is more suitable for living in the cold 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.699
 temperature 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:58.279
 There are mixed shortbreads on Wednesday to review all that he said, either 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:04.629
 Enya so there are a lot of your arrival witnesses before someone said that the county 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.519
 it 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:09.429
 tower 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:12.529
 Point all the sharks, of course it should be done 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:19.120
 Everything in the whole picture is worth warming 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.229
 in 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:23.539
 But I never hit a stone and I was elected president. This is fair use. 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:26.229
 5-inch absolute evolution 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:30.219
 Obviously maybe the same so we can get out of the situation 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.379
 No one knows 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.889
 Nominated for one of our own sons to ruin sex life 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.449
 participate 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:42.129
 Netvision happens to be archived 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.159
 And checkpoint top actors 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.260
 So if it is worth the bob, will, 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.430
 We will all the time for those who if they have the meaning of a weapon, is the baby 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.029
 in 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:55.959
 More 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.639
 Arabs can survive in history 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:02.189
 Warmer or colder temperatures depending on how the crime scene 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:04.579
 As it happens, it will become a new species and
