science fiction uses for silver i'll bet
at<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.510> time<00:01:12.900> nobody<00:01:13.260> expected<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.970> they

would make this nuke there's a time bomb
project<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.869> mean<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.080> was<00:01:19.140> top<00:01:19.320> secret<00:01:19.500> of

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
project I mean it was top secret of

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.170 
project I mean it was top secret of
course<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.369> would<00:01:20.490> require<00:01:20.640> all<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
course and that would require all the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.880 
course and that would require all the
silver<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.720> one<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:21.990> those<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.530> signs

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
silver this is one of those like signs

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.249 
silver this is one of those like signs
for<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.310> uses<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:23.939> technology<00:01:24.840> gets

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
for can uses and as technology gets

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.300 
for can uses and as technology gets
better<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.909> elements<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.320> find<00:01:29.070> new

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
better the elements we have find new

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.700 
better the elements we have find new
uses<00:01:29.549> look<00:01:29.939> at<00:01:30.060> these<00:01:30.180> um<00:01:30.390> rare<00:01:31.079> earths<00:01:31.380> and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
uses look at these um rare earths and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.260 
uses look at these um rare earths and
all<00:01:31.799> those<00:01:31.920> magnets<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.579> whatnot<00:01:32.970> right<00:01:33.000> so

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
got to be able to verify the sources a

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.550 
got to be able to verify the sources a
lot<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.670> stuff<00:01:41.909> we're<00:01:42.060> hearing<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:43.259> can't

know how much summer is in a missile it

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.820 
know how much summer is in a missile it
could<00:02:23.460> be<00:02:23.610> an<00:02:23.960> insignificant<00:02:24.960> amount<00:02:25.410> maybe

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
could be an insignificant amount maybe

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.070

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
like a silver expert on you cannot

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.530 
like a silver expert on you cannot
repeat<00:02:34.890> things<00:02:35.130> unless<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.760> verified<00:02:36.300> them

silver<00:04:09.240> mine<00:04:09.570> right<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:10.490> the<00:04:11.490> mine<00:04:11.730> expands

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
silver mine right and the mine expands

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.690 
silver mine right and the mine expands
it<00:04:12.480> gets<00:04:12.630> more<00:04:12.750> silver<00:04:13.170> that<00:04:13.710> is<00:04:13.770> not<00:04:14.130> included

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
it gets more silver that is not included

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.810 
it gets more silver that is not included
in<00:04:14.820> the<00:04:14.880> reserve<00:04:15.240> base<00:04:15.830> this<00:04:16.830> reserve<00:04:17.250> base<00:04:17.520> is

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
in the reserve base this reserve base is

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.240 
in the reserve base this reserve base is
not<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.390> resource<00:04:18.870> base<00:04:19.230> now<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.799> number

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
not the resource base now the number

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.490 
not the resource base now the number
that<00:04:20.400> Ted<00:04:20.640> Butler<00:04:20.940> gives<00:04:21.299> is<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:22.080> reserve

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
that Ted Butler gives is the reserve

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.480 
that Ted Butler gives is the reserve
base<00:04:23.000> so<00:04:24.000> he's<00:04:24.270> given<00:04:24.600> a<00:04:24.810> number<00:04:25.310> that<00:04:26.310> doesn't

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490

whole thing using the wrong number and
this<00:05:01.890> took<00:05:02.820> wings<00:05:03.180> like<00:05:04.110> if<00:05:04.320> you<00:05:04.530> like<00:05:05.160> Google

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
this took wings like if you like Google

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.630 
this took wings like if you like Google
like<00:05:05.850> USGS<00:05:06.570> silver<00:05:07.020> stuff<00:05:07.350> like<00:05:07.500> that<00:05:07.640> the
