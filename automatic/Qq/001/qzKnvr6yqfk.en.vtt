00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.230
 Hello dear viewers, this is already 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.040
 cool stuff 13 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.010
 That's because there was no video for a long time 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:49.430
 in general already three weeks probably the last 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:56.180
 the release was generally in the summer of cool things here 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:58.520
 and this is sort of well, in principle 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.540
 very simple thing but at the same time 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.600
 convenient because that's when you already 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.229
 have developed in minecraft you already have a lot 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.970
 of course you have a bunch of chests 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.640
 if you keep it all like this 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.650
 Here you run around you huge room 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.330
 you need to look for some sign to 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.880
 run open these chests with the same 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.790
 the system is much easier when you 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.920
 enter the room you are not watching a bunch 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.250
 chests somehow placed there and 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.229
 in general, and very beautifully set too 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.319
 plates but in my opinion when i'm like this 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.780
 you go much easier to notice them because 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.940
 that do not rush into the chests of the guide variegated 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.149
 and do not catch any motley 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:48.160
 chests and in general that is what the chip 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.899
 see let's say we need cobble and 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.539
 we enter immediately find the cobblestone and 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.459
 open it opens here 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.319
 the window we look and give here lies 

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:01.179
 close the cobblestone when we don't need 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:06.649
 everything closes us nicely plus more 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:08.270
 you can put the plates in two rows by the way 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.310
 it is better to use them than tablets 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.120
 which 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.180
 such here with inscriptions because so 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.040
 easier to notice and open i see that 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.430
 here everything related to the diet and 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.080
 close it is much more convenient than when 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.720
 just like that scattered chests 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.319
 randomly with some of these 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.769
 plus signs are required here simply 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.290
 at least redstone at least 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.810
 there is also it can be somehow all here 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.170
 so here is a beautiful cast and will generally 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.239
 cool it all look now i 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.200
 I will show you how it all looks 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:53.250
 just really well at least redstone here 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:57.959
 now I even let's build this one 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:01.440
 this diva that is just 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.440
 here so here 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.310
 chest 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.020
 So 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.400
 and so on the sides it stands sideways 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.440
 there are blocks you can use any 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.420
 You can do it all , I'm not worth it for 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:22.820
 all clear it is done here and this is how 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.000
 here still doing here we put the piston 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.880
 sticky 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.400
 here 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:35.200
 and opposite 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:38.920
 set yet 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:45.290
 the blocks on which we will stand 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:48.110
 actually the lever itself we lower it and to 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.150
 example is not so interesting that we will have 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:57.770
 devoted entirely to iron block here 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:00.860
 put it here and here will be a torch 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:04.490
 redstone here is another kindred file 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.560
 here on top so here's a block to signal 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.080
 from the bottom block passed to the top 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.710
 brick usually roadstone 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.750
 damn not not chest redstone here we put 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:19.590
 here as enter the signal is transmitted 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.270
 set 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.720
 finish here 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.720
 So 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.320
 and 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.960
 that's all actually and here we will insert 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:44.060
 there is glass because it is cool 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:47.500
 looks at the background of all this that's like that 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:51.200
 Here you can put the glass here, too, and 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.230
 when we open we see that here 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.770
 lies the fact that he is there glasses very 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.930
 conveniently 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.970
 ration is required just a minimum therefore 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.910
 can use it 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.500
 here of course yes though they are compact 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.570
 very compact, that is, on the contrary 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:14.270
 the only thing worth is that although there are none 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.400
 even you can and no you can not here because 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.540
 that the chests are not close to each other 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.670
 put that is, you can not put two 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.900
 big chests like this 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.370
 that's why there should be a distance 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.860
 between these blocks here so what 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:34.710
 subscribe put likes go to 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.990

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.360
 if you have any opera mobile 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:43.080
 you can't come in i don't know why i 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.450
 somehow done through the ass and you can

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:51.180
 ok from internet explorer google 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.050
 chromium and from anything else here I don't know 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.100
 about how else 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:58.080
