00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.450 

they're<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.639> easy<00:00:14.790> song<00:00:15.120> music<00:00:15.420> capo

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.650 
they're in the easy song music capo
I'm<00:00:17.699> not<00:00:17.880> sure<00:00:18.029> Bruce<00:00:18.449> does<00:00:18.750> or<00:00:18.930> not<00:00:20.180> but<00:00:21.180> it

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
I'm not sure Bruce does or not but it

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.269 
I'm not sure Bruce does or not but it
makes<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.990> lot<00:00:22.140> easier<00:00:22.199> if<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:23.039> will

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
makes a lot easier if you do you will

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.970 
makes a lot easier if you do you will
need<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.640> use<00:00:23.670> an<00:00:23.970> F<00:00:24.119> chord<00:00:24.619> so<00:00:25.619> if<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.800> can't

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
need to use an F chord so if you can't

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
need to use an F chord so if you can't
do<00:00:26.099> enough<00:00:26.310> chord<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:27.630> don't<00:00:27.779> work<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.080> that

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
do enough chord you don't work on that

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.099 
do enough chord you don't work on that
so<00:00:30.000> basically<00:00:30.300> I'm<00:00:30.420> just<00:00:30.570> gonna<00:00:30.660> go<00:00:31.080> through

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
so basically I'm just gonna go through

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.290 
so basically I'm just gonna go through
the<00:00:31.380> chords<00:00:31.710> maybe<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> little<00:00:32.250> bit<00:00:32.489> about<00:00:32.730> kind

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the chords maybe a little bit about kind

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.350 
the chords maybe a little bit about kind
of<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.510> unique<00:00:34.079> way<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.290> strum<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:35.360> obviously

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
of a unique way to strum it obviously

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.639 
of a unique way to strum it obviously
you<00:00:36.420> don't<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.809> swim<00:00:36.960> like<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.559> can

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
you don't have to swim like this it can

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.319 
you don't have to swim like this it can
be<00:00:37.680> just<00:00:38.219> straight<00:00:38.430> strum<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.030> sounds

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329
