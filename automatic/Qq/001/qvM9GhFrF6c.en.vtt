people we tend to not necessarily think

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:17.669 
people we tend to not necessarily think
about<00:00:16.570> them<00:00:16.720> and<00:00:16.869> our<00:00:16.930> floral<00:00:17.259> stores<00:00:17.499> we're

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:17.679 
about them and our floral stores we're

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:19.380 
about them and our floral stores we're
used<00:00:17.800> to<00:00:17.890> doing<00:00:18.039> traditional<00:00:18.669> things<00:00:18.910> often

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
used to doing traditional things often

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.569 
used to doing traditional things often
and<00:00:19.570> it's<00:00:20.349> it's<00:00:20.650> a<00:00:20.800> whole<00:00:20.980> segment<00:00:21.189> of<00:00:21.429> our

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:21.579 
and it's it's a whole segment of our

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:22.950 
and it's it's a whole segment of our
market<00:00:21.939> that<00:00:22.060> I<00:00:22.089> think<00:00:22.359> that<00:00:22.449> we<00:00:22.570> can<00:00:22.720> pick<00:00:22.929> up

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
market that I think that we can pick up

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.259 
market that I think that we can pick up
by<00:00:23.619> doing<00:00:23.919> just<00:00:24.070> a<00:00:24.159> few<00:00:24.460> different<00:00:25.089> unusual

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:25.269 
by doing just a few different unusual

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:26.849 
by doing just a few different unusual
things<00:00:25.989> that<00:00:26.199> we<00:00:26.289> might<00:00:26.529> not<00:00:26.679> necessarily

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859 
things that we might not necessarily

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.609 
things that we might not necessarily
think<00:00:27.400> about<00:00:27.669> and<00:00:28.089> we<00:00:28.689> have<00:00:28.869> a<00:00:28.900> few<00:00:29.140> examples

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
think about and we have a few examples

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:30.899 
think about and we have a few examples
of<00:00:29.710> this<00:00:29.859> here<00:00:30.069> today<00:00:30.310> but<00:00:30.489> don't<00:00:30.640> forget<00:00:30.730> that

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:30.909 
of this here today but don't forget that

the water in the in the wire not that

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.000 
the water in the in the wire not that
that<00:02:55.780> would<00:02:55.900> really<00:02:56.110> matter<00:02:56.380> but<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:56.800> really

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
that would really matter but it really

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.310 
that would really matter but it really
makes<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.400> much<00:02:58.000> cleaner<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:58.450> neater<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.170> you

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
makes it much cleaner and neater and you

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.750 
makes it much cleaner and neater and you
could<00:02:59.470> place<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.800> flowers<00:03:00.130> in<00:03:00.250> this<00:03:00.370> bud<00:03:00.580> base

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
could place the flowers in this bud base

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.490 
could place the flowers in this bud base
but<00:03:00.970> nothing<00:03:01.450> more<00:03:01.600> than<00:03:01.720> a<00:03:01.750> low<00:03:01.960> me<00:03:02.110> collar<00:03:02.380> a
