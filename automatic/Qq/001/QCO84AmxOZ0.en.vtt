this outer sheathing on this OSB board
which<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.160> made<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.700> well<00:00:36.210> fragments<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.170> wood

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
which is made of well fragments of wood

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.170 
which is made of well fragments of wood
you<00:00:37.649> can<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:37.950> look<00:00:38.129> at<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:38.700> all<00:00:38.940> these

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
you can just look at it it's all these

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.299 
you can just look at it it's all these
shards<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.379> pieces<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.890> wood<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.280> are

shards and pieces of wood that are

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.250 
shards and pieces of wood that are
pressed<00:00:41.940> together<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.719> can<00:00:42.870> see<00:00:43.020> there's

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
pressed together and you can see there's

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.049 
pressed together and you can see there's
there's<00:00:43.739> plenty<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.070> caulking<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.730> all<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
there's plenty of caulking and all the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.840 
there's plenty of caulking and all the
little<00:00:45.270> holes<00:00:45.510> but<00:00:46.320> that's<00:00:46.710> not<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.370> extent

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
little holes but that's not the extent

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.670 
little holes but that's not the extent
of<00:00:48.090> how<00:00:48.300> we're<00:00:48.480> gonna<00:00:48.570> seal<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.079> house<00:00:49.350> up

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
of how we're gonna seal this house up

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.350 
of how we're gonna seal this house up
we're<00:00:50.280> actually<00:00:50.399> going<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.700> take<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.000> wrap

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
we're actually going to take this wrap

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.510 
we're actually going to take this wrap
and<00:00:51.719> take<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.289> all<00:00:52.440> around<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.039> house<00:00:53.250> and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
and take it all around the house and

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.889 
and take it all around the house and
it's<00:00:53.640> made<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.969> plastic<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:54.480> if<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.780> look

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
it's made of plastic but if you look

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.200 
it's made of plastic but if you look
closely<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:55.980> see<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:56.699> perforated

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
closely you can see that it's perforated

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.630 
closely you can see that it's perforated
the<00:00:57.780> idea<00:00:58.440> here<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.190> will<00:00:59.340> allow

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
the idea here is that it will allow

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.410 
the idea here is that it will allow
oxygen<00:01:00.030> air<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.800> exchange<00:01:02.070> from<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.789> inside

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
oxygen air to exchange from the inside

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.649 
oxygen air to exchange from the inside
outside<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.290> want<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.739> house<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.339> breathe<00:01:05.700> so

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
outside you want a house to breathe so

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.719 
outside you want a house to breathe so
but<00:01:07.170> what<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.439> also<00:01:07.650> does<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.280> protects

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
but what this also does is it protects

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.510 
but what this also does is it protects
us<00:01:08.909> outer<00:01:09.210> sheathing<00:01:09.720> from<00:01:10.140> moisture<00:01:10.520> from

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
us outer sheathing from moisture from

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.399 
us outer sheathing from moisture from
moisture<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.060> might<00:01:12.270> blow<00:01:12.689> up<00:01:12.720> under<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
moisture that might blow up under the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.590 
moisture that might blow up under the
collaborating<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.460> we're<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.760> put<00:01:15.030> on

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
collaborating that we're going to put on

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.310 
collaborating that we're going to put on
the<00:01:15.810> house<00:01:15.990> or<00:01:16.400> probably<00:01:17.400> more<00:01:17.729> importantly

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
the house or probably more importantly

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.200 
the house or probably more importantly
condensation<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.520> what<00:01:20.520> we've<00:01:20.670> done<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.090> we've

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
condensation so what we've done is we've

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.440 
condensation so what we've done is we've
taken<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.840> wrap<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.740> comes<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.159> rolls

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
taken this wrap it comes in rolls

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.890 
taken this wrap it comes in rolls
150-foot<00:01:24.450> roll<00:01:24.720> nine<00:01:25.200> feet<00:01:25.650> tall<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:27.090> you

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
150-foot roll nine feet tall and you

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.090 
150-foot roll nine feet tall and you
know<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.170> goes<00:01:28.320> all<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.560> way<00:01:28.680> around<00:01:29.009> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
know it goes all the way around and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.859 
know it goes all the way around and
they're<00:01:29.220> put<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.670> place<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.509> these<00:01:30.630> little

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
they're put in place with these little

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.780 
they're put in place with these little
plastic<00:01:31.140> caps<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.189> serves<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.759> a

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
plastic caps so it serves is like a

inch<00:01:34.979> nail<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.299> washer<00:01:36.900> keeps

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
inch nail on it then this washer keeps

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.530 
inch nail on it then this washer keeps
it<00:01:37.409> from<00:01:37.680> tearing<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.640> cooling<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.210> see<00:01:39.390> how
