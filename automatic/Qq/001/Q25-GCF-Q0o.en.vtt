00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.480
 hi to all of you guys I'm d cabrio 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.630
 we are here with the first start of the 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.580
 our computer one few premises first 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.039
 of all you must have connected all that 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.020
 years and be sure there is electricity 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.500
 in the circuit with true in the motherboard 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.789
 there will be a led that will say that it is 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.650
 getting the current to the motherboard 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.629
 however, the computer is not turned on 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.149
 I in my core so you don't 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.309
 will see as soon as it is connected if you should 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.530
 have other problems just beginning 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.690
 say the computer will probably be 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.239
 because I have chosen ill 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.670
 components or you will have chosen one 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.040
 ramp is not compatible with that 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.520
 motherboard but you will have it later 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.219
 or you have chosen an ace tv that maybe 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.020
 it doesn't work it's broken so they might 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.620
 there are problems before you even start 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.350
 complete the first thing to do is 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.089
 connect the vga cable and not with the goose of 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.509
 m because for example on some cards 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.280
 mothers with some graphics cards there 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.640
 have problems and therefore not 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:18.369
 you can enter the bios having the cable 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.369
 hdmi that has arrived I will leave with the lie 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.860
 then turn on the monitor or the 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.159
 TV and computer 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.659
 as soon as you see the logo of the house 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.570
 motherboard manufacturer 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.650
 click punch it's my case though in 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.150
 gigabyte motherboards you enter the bios 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.610
 check also on 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.620
 google if there is another key that 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.590
 it could be bait like it could 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.960
 be f12 to enter the bios 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.090
 each motherboard of different brand for 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.100
 have a rate towards the first things 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.710
 that we will be asked to insert 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.050
 will be the date and time that they are 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.600
 under system information 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.280
 in my case for example it can also 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.900
 accept the language but here there is only 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.290
 English 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.320
 now we'll have to go on miike in this one 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.830
 section and check the frequency of 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.470
 ram and in my case as you can see here there is 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.670
 written 1600 hearts my rams are 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.780
 2,600 euros 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.490
 so we're good after doing that 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.150
 we will have to install another system 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.230
 operating 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.730
 so let's go on to see each other must 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.830
 let's go out 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.410
 after getting our system 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.420
 operational as I said it is on 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.150
 food with his usb stick 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.100
 we will have to click another key to do that 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.170
 every motherboard should be 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.600
 different 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.570
 in this case it is f12 which is called boot 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.200
 menu as I have already said here we will have to 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.910
 select our device from 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.010
 which we will install the operating system 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.550
 in this case, enter is also written 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.769
 setup 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.739
 that means he can send us too 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:04.430
 inside the bios to perform others 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.560
 operations however you want to select the 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.130
 your device 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:13.060
 and from here the installation wizard will start 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.010
 of windows 7 of linux 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:21.520
 any operating system that you 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:23.560
 so please install now 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.959
 there are two ways to choose and I will 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.690
 I highly recommend the second one 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:32.170
 or install the drivers present on the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.640
 cd of the motherboard or the second 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.540
 download the latest newer drivers 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.390
 directly from the motherboard site 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.739
 so if you have checked that there is 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.420
 an internet connection 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.360
 here on the website of the motherboard 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.459
 and download the appropriate drivers of the 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.870
 your system 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.150
 after downloading the drivers from the 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.430
 motherboard what you have to do life 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.680
 going to look for your drivers 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.860
 graphic card or in this case the 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.430
 mine is a mp you go to the amd e site 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:07.959
 download drivers 14.7 because al 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:11.530
 then those are available 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.900
 guys at this was the first start of the 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.880
 our computer plus the installation of 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.320
 I didn't show you magical things 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:22.750
 I could say almost nothing because I would 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.140
 preferred not to format the computer e 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.700
 I will make a guide about it not erase 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.080
 of the things however that on of it I know 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.970
 enough denis that you are 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.560
 intelligent and consequently you know 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.430
 do these things because they are enough 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.680
 easy 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.840
 if you have problems, register here 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.190
 below i hope they are easy because not 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.780
 I'm a computer wizard before I change 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.300
 something in the bios for example for 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.430
 overclock and do other things 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.220
 check that everything is okay 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.560
 system if stable then a little later 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.840
 having installed some drivers 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.910
 try it and leave it a bit original 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.090
 this computer to see that maybe 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.280
 what temperature it reaches because maybe 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.260
 playing for only half an hour reaches 70 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.660
 degrees and there is already some problem 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.210
 I strongly advise you to check 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.550
 that you believe there is room for it 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.169
 air circulation 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.669
 so guys are the others see you 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.949
 to the next video left online 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.840
 comment if you have any doubts if you have 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.460
 any questions if you want to believe in 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.840
 something if I see that fawcett infant 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.960
 ask me for example a guide on 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.940
 robert kromm but I could gladly do 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.110
 however, see you at the next video 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.600
 you have to do all the things I have 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.310
 already said that they are the keys to that 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.310
 see you next video pretty girl
