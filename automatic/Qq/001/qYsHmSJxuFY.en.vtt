00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
moment I made some bad decisions to

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.510 
moment I made some bad decisions to
bench<00:04:02.570> in<00:04:02.780> Coleman<00:04:03.260> after<00:04:03.800> everything<00:04:04.040> got<00:04:04.430> an

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
bench in Coleman after everything got an

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.520 
bench in Coleman after everything got an
unlikely<00:04:04.850> clean<00:04:05.180> sheet<00:04:05.420> against<00:04:05.900> Chelsea<00:04:06.350> and

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
unlikely clean sheet against Chelsea and

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.740 
unlikely clean sheet against Chelsea and
also<00:04:07.490> boretz<00:04:07.850> kept<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.120> clean<00:04:08.300> sheet<00:04:08.330> against

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
also boretz kept a clean sheet against

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.750 
also boretz kept a clean sheet against
West<00:04:09.020> Ham<00:04:09.140> so<00:04:09.770> there's<00:04:09.950> 12<00:04:10.190> points<00:04:10.550> on<00:04:10.670> the

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
West Ham so there's 12 points on the

play him over Boris worthwhile and

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.970
