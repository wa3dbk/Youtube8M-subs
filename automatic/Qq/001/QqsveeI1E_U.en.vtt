00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
and done a bit of research and purchased

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.009 
and done a bit of research and purchased
a<00:00:21.020> wine<00:00:22.020> cooling<00:00:22.470> fridge<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.279> it's<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:23.490> a

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
a wine cooling fridge so it's just a

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.810 
a wine cooling fridge so it's just a
second<00:00:25.019> head<00:00:25.140> wine<00:00:25.350> cooler<00:00:27.380> it's<00:00:28.380> fairly<00:00:28.820> deep

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
second head wine cooler it's fairly deep

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.010 
second head wine cooler it's fairly deep
that<00:00:30.090> way<00:00:30.560> I've<00:00:31.560> got<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.830> set<00:00:32.099> between<00:00:32.660> 16<00:00:33.660> to

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
that way I've got it set between 16 to

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.430 
that way I've got it set between 16 to
18<00:00:34.620> degrees<00:00:34.770> Celsius<00:00:35.120> because<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.440> read-up

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
18 degrees Celsius because of read-up

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.200 
18 degrees Celsius because of read-up
that<00:00:37.649> that's<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.219> ideal<00:00:38.670> temperature<00:00:38.910> for

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
that that's the ideal temperature for

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.319 
that that's the ideal temperature for
them<00:00:40.040> so<00:00:41.040> I've<00:00:41.340> got<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> called<00:00:41.910> rewritten

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
them so I've got the called rewritten

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.700 
them so I've got the called rewritten

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
ear so we open it up I've got up the top

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.229 
ear so we open it up I've got up the top
here<00:00:49.920> I've<00:00:50.070> got<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> container<00:00:50.610> full<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.879> water

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
here I've got a container full of water

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.939 
here I've got a container full of water
to<00:00:51.539> keep<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> humidity<00:00:52.170> up<00:00:52.410> because<00:00:52.829> they

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
to keep the humidity up because they

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.420 
to keep the humidity up because they
like<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:53.850> busy<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.829> down<00:00:55.829> here<00:00:56.100> I've<00:00:56.250> got

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
like like busy and down here I've got

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.869 
like like busy and down here I've got
their<00:00:56.670> little<00:00:56.989> enclosure<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.530> I'll<00:00:59.520> bring<00:00:59.760> it

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
their little enclosure so I'll bring it

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:23.210 
their little enclosure so I'll bring it
out<00:01:01.190> we'll<00:01:02.190> take<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.430> look<00:01:02.699> at<00:01:02.820> them<00:01:18.140> okay

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.460 

so<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.340> substrate<00:01:24.580> is<00:01:24.970> basically<00:01:25.470> sphagnum

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
so the substrate is basically sphagnum

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.330 
so the substrate is basically sphagnum
Moss<00:01:27.450> leaf<00:01:28.450> litter<00:01:28.840> bark<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:31.170> also

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
Moss leaf litter bark and also

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.399 
Moss leaf litter bark and also
vermiculite<00:01:33.340> or<00:01:34.680> mixed<00:01:35.680> in<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.140> tricky

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
vermiculite or mixed in so the tricky

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.690 
vermiculite or mixed in so the tricky
part<00:01:38.619> is<00:01:38.860> finding<00:01:39.310> them<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:42.250> I'm<00:01:42.340> just<00:01:42.399> going

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
part is finding them so I'm just going

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.680 
part is finding them so I'm just going
to<00:01:42.729> pop<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.060> camera<00:01:43.360> down<00:01:43.540> for<00:01:43.600> a<00:01:43.810> sec<00:01:44.080> and

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
to pop the camera down for a sec and

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:54.529 
to pop the camera down for a sec and
sort<00:01:46.690> through<00:01:46.840> though<00:01:52.500> I've<00:01:53.500> got<00:01:53.770> two<00:01:54.040> in<00:01:54.220> here

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
sort through though I've got two in here

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.300 
sort through though I've got two in here
there's<00:01:55.539> one<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.649> there's<00:02:00.039> the<00:02:00.220> other
