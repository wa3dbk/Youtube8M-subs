00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.570 

okay<00:00:05.380> I'm<00:00:05.680> going<00:00:05.800> to<00:00:05.859> show<00:00:05.980> you<00:00:06.040> how<00:00:06.250> to<00:00:06.279> run<00:00:06.550> a

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:06.580 
okay I'm going to show you how to run a

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.629 
okay I'm going to show you how to run a
test<00:00:06.880> for<00:00:07.149> total<00:00:07.479> calcium<00:00:07.990> hardness<00:00:08.260> and<00:00:09.219> the

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:09.639 
test for total calcium hardness and the

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:11.070 
test for total calcium hardness and the
difference<00:00:09.940> between<00:00:09.969> that<00:00:10.240> and<00:00:10.600> total

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 
difference between that and total

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.440 
difference between that and total
hardness<00:00:11.290> itself<00:00:11.920> as<00:00:12.760> a<00:00:12.790> measurement<00:00:13.179> in<00:00:13.360> your

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
hardness itself as a measurement in your

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:22.030 
hardness itself as a measurement in your
cool<00:00:13.690> water

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.350 

just<00:00:23.040> important<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.490> your<00:00:23.580> calcium<00:00:23.790> levels

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
just important on your calcium levels

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.540 
just important on your calcium levels
within<00:00:24.660> range<00:00:24.990> too<00:00:25.830> low<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.280> becomes

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
within range too low and it becomes

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.090 
within range too low and it becomes
aggressive<00:00:26.790> that<00:00:27.600> means<00:00:27.780> that<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.020> could<00:00:28.200> eat

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
aggressive that means that it could eat

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.269 
aggressive that means that it could eat
your<00:00:29.280> plaster<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.120> your<00:00:30.420> decking<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.279> too

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
your plaster and your decking and too

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.060 
your plaster and your decking and too
much<00:00:32.460> hardness<00:00:32.910> will<00:00:33.210> cause<00:00:33.770> scale<00:00:34.770> buildup

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
much hardness will cause scale buildup

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.790 
much hardness will cause scale buildup
on<00:00:35.220> your<00:00:35.370> tile<00:00:35.550> line<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.840> also<00:00:37.440> onto<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
on your tile line and also onto the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:46.960 
on your tile line and also onto the
plaster<00:00:38.190> itself

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:01:02.330 

you

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.310 

okay<00:01:03.180> first<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.720> have<00:01:03.810> to<00:01:03.900> know<00:01:04.050> that<00:01:04.080> there's

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
okay first you have to know that there's

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.410 
okay first you have to know that there's
between<00:01:04.500> total<00:01:04.860> calcium<00:01:05.130> hardness<00:01:05.640> which

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
between total calcium hardness which

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.940 
between total calcium hardness which
measures<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> calcium<00:01:07.260> level<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.620> your<00:01:07.680> pool

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
measures a calcium level in your pool

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.950 
measures a calcium level in your pool
versus<00:01:08.880> total<00:01:09.150> hardness<00:01:09.570> which<00:01:09.750> also

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
versus total hardness which also

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.320 
versus total hardness which also
measures<00:01:10.410> two<00:01:10.650> calcium<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.250> magnesium<00:01:11.400> so

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
measures two calcium and magnesium so

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.990 
measures two calcium and magnesium so
these<00:01:12.510> test<00:01:12.780> trips<00:01:13.050> will<00:01:13.260> measure<00:01:13.760> just<00:01:14.760> your

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
these test trips will measure just your

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.480 
these test trips will measure just your
total<00:01:15.420> hardness<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.680> not<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.100> calcium

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
total hardness and not just the calcium

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.430 
total hardness and not just the calcium
hardness<00:01:17.730> so<00:01:17.910> not<00:01:18.060> quite<00:01:18.300> as<00:01:18.360> accurate<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
hardness so not quite as accurate the

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.110 
hardness so not quite as accurate the
good<00:01:19.620> for<00:01:19.980> a<00:01:20.010> ballpark<00:01:20.400> see<00:01:20.760> if<00:01:20.910> you're<00:01:21.030> in

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
good for a ballpark see if you're in

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.450 
good for a ballpark see if you're in
range<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:22.260> to<00:01:22.440> get<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.650> true<00:01:23.040> test<00:01:23.280> you're

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
range but to get a true test you're

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.610 
range but to get a true test you're
going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> need<00:01:23.760> a<00:01:24.030> tailor<00:01:24.780> test<00:01:25.020> kit<00:01:25.290> that

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
going to need a tailor test kit that

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.450 
going to need a tailor test kit that
measures<00:01:26.010> just<00:01:26.360> calcium<00:01:27.360> hardness<00:01:28.460> so

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
measures just calcium hardness so

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.280 
measures just calcium hardness so
according<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.150> total<00:01:30.480> hardness<00:01:30.780> test<00:01:31.140> in

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
according to the total hardness test in

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.430 
according to the total hardness test in
this<00:01:31.380> pool<00:01:31.710> you're<00:01:32.610> looking<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:33.030> around<00:01:33.570> 500

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
this pool you're looking at around 500

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.100 
this pool you're looking at around 500
or<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.800> and<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:36.240> that's<00:01:36.390> total<00:01:36.660> hardness<00:01:36.869> it's

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
or so and so that's total hardness it's

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.900 
or so and so that's total hardness it's
not<00:01:37.260> the<00:01:37.530> calcium<00:01:37.950> hardness<00:01:38.190> like<00:01:38.640> again

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
not the calcium hardness like again

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.420 
not the calcium hardness like again
again<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.420> mentioned<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.740> measures<00:01:41.190> your

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
again I mentioned just measures your

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.830 
again I mentioned just measures your
total<00:01:41.820> hardness<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.240> your<00:01:42.360> pool<00:01:42.540> which<00:01:42.810> is

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
total hardness in your pool which is

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:52.060 
total hardness in your pool which is
magnesium

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.890 

if<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:52.730> don't<00:01:52.880> have<00:01:53.000> a<00:01:53.030> tailor<00:01:53.390> test<00:01:53.630> kit<00:01:53.810> you

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
if you don't have a tailor test kit you

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.510 
if you don't have a tailor test kit you
can<00:01:54.020> definitely<00:01:54.200> get<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.620> run<00:01:54.830> and<00:01:55.130> your<00:01:55.250> local

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
can definitely get it run and your local

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.650 
can definitely get it run and your local
cool<00:01:55.700> store<00:01:55.970> they'll<00:01:56.150> test<00:01:56.330> your<00:01:56.480> calcium

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
cool store they'll test your calcium

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.780 
cool store they'll test your calcium
hardness<00:01:57.050> for<00:01:57.320> you<00:01:57.470> they<00:01:58.190> recommend<00:01:58.580> it<00:01:58.640> once

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
hardness for you they recommend it once

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.460 
hardness for you they recommend it once
a<00:01:58.910> month<00:01:58.940> but<00:01:59.390> you<00:01:59.450> can<00:01:59.570> pretty<00:01:59.720> much<00:01:59.810> tell<00:02:00.170> in

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
a month but you can pretty much tell in

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.410 
a month but you can pretty much tell in
your<00:02:01.040> area<00:02:01.340> if<00:02:01.460> your<00:02:01.580> water<00:02:01.790> is<00:02:01.940> hard<00:02:02.120> or<00:02:02.270> not

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
your area if your water is hard or not

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.450 
your area if your water is hard or not
just<00:02:02.780> by<00:02:02.900> your<00:02:03.050> tap<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:03.590> that's<00:02:03.950> part<00:02:04.310> of<00:02:04.370> the

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
just by your tap and that's part of the

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.190 
just by your tap and that's part of the
equation<00:02:04.940> with<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.270> hardness<00:02:05.720> of<00:02:05.840> your<00:02:05.900> pool

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
equation with the hardness of your pool

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.230 
equation with the hardness of your pool
water<00:02:06.230> is<00:02:07.160> what<00:02:07.370> is<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.520> water<00:02:07.700> light<00:02:07.910> coming

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
water is what is the water light coming

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.660 
water is what is the water light coming
right<00:02:08.450> into<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.080> pool<00:02:09.320> that<00:02:09.650> was<00:02:10.340> known<00:02:10.550> as

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
right into the pool that was known as

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.420 
right into the pool that was known as
your<00:02:10.790> fill<00:02:11.030> water<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.740> can<00:02:12.860> see<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.160> range

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
your fill water so you can see the range

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.190 
your fill water so you can see the range
on<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.970> test<00:02:14.240> strips<00:02:14.540> are<00:02:15.260> very<00:02:15.320> broad<00:02:16.150> 150

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
on the test strips are very broad 150

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.590 
on the test strips are very broad 150
250<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.470> difference<00:02:19.460> in<00:02:19.580> range<00:02:19.850> whereas<00:02:20.330> the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
250 a difference in range whereas the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.440 
250 a difference in range whereas the
tailor<00:02:21.590> test<00:02:21.830> kit<00:02:22.100> calcium<00:02:22.790> hardness<00:02:23.030> test

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
tailor test kit calcium hardness test

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.990 
tailor test kit calcium hardness test
width<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:23.840> within<00:02:24.200> 10<00:02:24.500> parts<00:02:24.830> per<00:02:25.010> million<00:02:25.220> so

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
width is within 10 parts per million so

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.370 
width is within 10 parts per million so
it's<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.150> very<00:02:26.330> accurate<00:02:26.510> test<00:02:26.960> compared<00:02:27.260> to

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
it's a very accurate test compared to

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.560 
it's a very accurate test compared to
this<00:02:27.500> ballpark<00:02:27.800> total<00:02:28.760> hardness<00:02:28.940> reading<00:02:29.390> and

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
this ballpark total hardness reading and

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.720 
this ballpark total hardness reading and
again<00:02:30.200> it<00:02:30.290> also<00:02:30.410> measures<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:31.100> magnesium<00:02:31.430> in

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
again it also measures the magnesium in

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.340 
again it also measures the magnesium in
your<00:02:31.760> pool<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:32.240> it's<00:02:32.390> not<00:02:32.480> quite<00:02:32.720> as<00:02:32.810> accurate

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
your pool so it's not quite as accurate

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:44.619 
your pool so it's not quite as accurate
as<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:34.370> drop<00:02:34.760> test

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.789 

so<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:45.750> only<00:02:45.900> effective<00:02:46.319> way<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.560> lower

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
so the only effective way to lower

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:47.700 
so the only effective way to lower
calcium

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
calcium

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.950 
calcium
to<00:02:47.890> drain<00:02:48.190> some<00:02:48.910> water<00:02:49.150> down<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.600> fill<00:02:49.840> it

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
to drain some water down and fill it

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.870 
to drain some water down and fill it
with<00:02:49.990> softer<00:02:50.530> water<00:02:50.740> but<00:02:51.010> if<00:02:51.070> you're<00:02:51.250> in<00:02:51.730> an

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
with softer water but if you're in an

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.310 
with softer water but if you're in an
area<00:02:51.970> like<00:02:52.270> mine<00:02:52.540> where<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.780> water<00:02:53.020> is<00:02:53.110> hard

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
area like mine where the water is hard

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.400 
area like mine where the water is hard
coming<00:02:53.560> out<00:02:53.650> of<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:53.800> tap<00:02:54.040> that<00:02:54.790> may<00:02:54.910> not<00:02:55.060> be

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
coming out of the tap that may not be

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.580 
coming out of the tap that may not be
practical

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
practical

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.410 
practical
so<00:02:56.920> what<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.070> do<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.310> control<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:58.030> hard<00:02:58.210> water

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
so what I do to control the hard water

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.630 
so what I do to control the hard water
my<00:02:58.750> pool<00:02:59.050> my<00:02:59.380> calcium<00:03:00.070> hardness<00:03:00.250> levels

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
my pool my calcium hardness levels

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.420 
my pool my calcium hardness levels
around<00:03:00.820> 500<00:03:01.510> or<00:03:01.990> so<00:03:02.500> 4<00:03:02.710> to<00:03:02.770> 500<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.310> you

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
around 500 or so 4 to 500 and you

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.940 
around 500 or so 4 to 500 and you
generally<00:03:03.850> stays<00:03:04.150> at<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.720> use<00:03:05.350> muriatic<00:03:05.860> acid

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
generally stays at I use muriatic acid

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.070 
generally stays at I use muriatic acid
to<00:03:06.550> keep<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.880> pH<00:03:07.210> at<00:03:08.040> 7.2<00:03:09.060> 7.6<00:03:10.060> don't<00:03:10.900> let<00:03:10.990> it

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
to keep the pH at 7.2 7.6 don't let it

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.870 
to keep the pH at 7.2 7.6 don't let it
get<00:03:11.200> too<00:03:11.350> high<00:03:11.530> keep<00:03:11.800> the<00:03:11.920> alkalinity<00:03:12.160> near<00:03:12.610> 80

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
get too high keep the alkalinity near 80

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.660 
get too high keep the alkalinity near 80
that'll<00:03:13.870> keep<00:03:13.990> your<00:03:14.170> pool<00:03:14.380> from<00:03:14.590> scaling<00:03:15.010> so

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
that'll keep your pool from scaling so

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.060 
that'll keep your pool from scaling so
you<00:03:15.730> can<00:03:15.850> use<00:03:15.940> acid<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:16.420> control<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.680> calcium

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
you can use acid to control the calcium

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.190 
you can use acid to control the calcium
hardness<00:03:18.280> in<00:03:18.460> the<00:03:18.490> water<00:03:18.780> but<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:19.900> really

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
hardness in the water but you really

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.630 
hardness in the water but you really
can't<00:03:20.350> reverse<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.890> with<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.280> muriatic<00:03:21.520> acid

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
can't reverse it with the muriatic acid

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.910 
can't reverse it with the muriatic acid
just<00:03:22.360> use<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:22.870> keep<00:03:23.020> the<00:03:23.170> pH<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.680> alkalinity

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
just use to keep the pH and alkalinity

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.190 
just use to keep the pH and alkalinity
low<00:03:24.340> so<00:03:25.150> you<00:03:25.270> don't<00:03:25.420> have<00:03:25.540> scaling<00:03:26.020> in<00:03:26.110> your

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
low so you don't have scaling in your

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:35.119 
low so you don't have scaling in your
pool

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.559 

if<00:03:36.129> your<00:03:36.250> hardness<00:03:36.549> level<00:03:36.909> is<00:03:37.060> low<00:03:37.299> you<00:03:37.450> can

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
if your hardness level is low you can

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.929 
if your hardness level is low you can
actually<00:03:37.750> add<00:03:38.079> calcium<00:03:38.620> fluoride<00:03:39.069> to<00:03:39.730> bring

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:39.939 
actually add calcium fluoride to bring

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.910 
actually add calcium fluoride to bring
it<00:03:40.030> up<00:03:40.180> that's<00:03:40.930> very<00:03:41.200> easy<00:03:41.379> to<00:03:41.470> do<00:03:41.680> this

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
it up that's very easy to do this

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:51.650 
it up that's very easy to do this
broadcasting<00:03:42.610> cool

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.090 

I'm<00:03:52.660> going<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:52.870> use<00:03:52.990> the<00:03:53.110> tailor<00:03:53.440> kit<00:03:53.710> to<00:03:53.920> test

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
I'm going to use the tailor kit to test

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.640 
I'm going to use the tailor kit to test
for<00:03:54.400> calcium<00:03:54.790> hardness<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:56.170> it's<00:03:56.830> a<00:03:57.010> reagent

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
for calcium hardness and it's a reagent

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.410 
for calcium hardness and it's a reagent
creation<00:03:59.650> test<00:03:59.950> with<00:04:00.580> the<00:04:00.670> drop<00:04:00.880> test<00:04:01.150> that's

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
creation test with the drop test that's

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.670 
creation test with the drop test that's
the<00:04:01.540> most<00:04:01.720> accurate<00:04:01.900> way<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.320> test<00:04:02.590> for

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
the most accurate way to test for

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.480 
the most accurate way to test for
calcium<00:04:03.010> hardness

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
calcium hardness

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.460 
calcium hardness
okay<00:04:04.090> so<00:04:04.150> perform<00:04:04.660> this<00:04:04.810> test<00:04:05.110> you're<00:04:05.320> going

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
okay so perform this test you're going

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.210 
okay so perform this test you're going
to<00:04:05.530> actually<00:04:05.800> add<00:04:06.660> 20<00:04:07.660> drops<00:04:07.870> of<00:04:08.080> the<00:04:08.350> ar-10

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
to actually add 20 drops of the ar-10

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.750 
to actually add 20 drops of the ar-10
buffer<00:04:11.520> and<00:04:12.520> swirl<00:04:12.820> it<00:04:13.000> around<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.480> mix<00:04:13.600> it<00:04:13.750> up

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
buffer and swirl it around and mix it up

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:23.620 
buffer and swirl it around and mix it up
we're<00:04:15.760> going<00:04:15.880> to<00:04:15.940> add<00:04:16.030> 5<00:04:16.299> drops<00:04:16.329> of<00:04:16.900> r11

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.600 

and<00:04:24.110> swirl<00:04:24.380> that<00:04:24.530> around<00:04:27.070> and<00:04:28.070> if<00:04:28.250> you<00:04:28.280> have

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
and swirl that around and if you have

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.130 
and swirl that around and if you have
calcium<00:04:28.850> partners<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.330> will<00:04:29.420> turn<00:04:29.570> pink<00:04:29.780> like

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
calcium partners it will turn pink like

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.980 
calcium partners it will turn pink like
that<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:31.550> they're<00:04:31.790> going<00:04:31.910> to<00:04:32.030> add<00:04:32.210> our<00:04:32.660> 12

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
that and they're going to add our 12

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.290 
that and they're going to add our 12
counting<00:04:33.500> each<00:04:33.590> drop<00:04:33.980> and<00:04:34.190> swirling<00:04:34.610> it<00:04:34.760> and

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
counting each drop and swirling it and

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.060 
counting each drop and swirling it and
that<00:04:35.480> will<00:04:35.600> give<00:04:35.780> you<00:04:35.900> your<00:04:35.930> calcium<00:04:36.860> hardness

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
that will give you your calcium hardness

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.340 
that will give you your calcium hardness
reading<00:04:37.670> when<00:04:38.480> you<00:04:38.540> get<00:04:38.660> to<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:38.840> last<00:04:38.990> drop

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
reading when you get to the last drop

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.500 
reading when you get to the last drop
and<00:04:39.680> it<00:04:39.950> turns<00:04:40.160> blue<00:04:40.520> go<00:04:41.120> ahead<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.360> add<00:04:41.480> one

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
and it turns blue go ahead and add one

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.600 
and it turns blue go ahead and add one
more<00:04:41.810> drop<00:04:42.110> and<00:04:42.470> it<00:04:42.590> subtracted<00:04:43.190> just<00:04:43.400> to<00:04:43.460> make

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
more drop and it subtracted just to make

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.910 
more drop and it subtracted just to make
sure<00:04:43.760> that<00:04:43.970> is<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.390> right<00:04:44.600> reading<00:04:44.990> I'm<00:04:45.860> going

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
sure that is the right reading I'm going

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:56.100 
sure that is the right reading I'm going
to<00:04:46.250> keep<00:04:46.370> adding

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:08.459 

so<00:04:57.110> that<00:04:57.230> turned<00:04:57.530> blue<00:04:57.920> around<00:05:00.400> 440<00:05:01.400> drops

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:08.469 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:10.949 

and<00:05:09.309> the<00:05:09.429> very<00:05:09.610> high<00:05:09.789> chlorine<00:05:10.209> reading<00:05:10.749> could

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:10.959 
and the very high chlorine reading could

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:12.570 
and the very high chlorine reading could
throw<00:05:11.169> off<00:05:11.289> the<00:05:11.469> test<00:05:11.769> you<00:05:12.339> can<00:05:12.459> add<00:05:12.550> a

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
throw off the test you can add a

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.239 
throw off the test you can add a
chlorine<00:05:13.029> utilizer<00:05:13.709> before<00:05:14.709> you<00:05:14.830> run<00:05:15.039> the

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:15.249 
chlorine utilizer before you run the

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.409 
chlorine utilizer before you run the
calcium<00:05:15.849> hardness<00:05:16.089> test<00:05:16.479> to<00:05:16.779> counter<00:05:17.739> that

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
calcium hardness test to counter that

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.029 
calcium hardness test to counter that
and<00:05:19.419> so<00:05:19.599> on<00:05:19.749> extremely<00:05:20.080> high<00:05:20.319> chlorine<00:05:20.709> level

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
and so on extremely high chlorine level

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.939 
and so on extremely high chlorine level
can<00:05:21.159> also<00:05:21.219> interfere<00:05:22.029> with<00:05:22.869> the<00:05:23.110> test<00:05:23.469> so<00:05:23.860> you

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
can also interfere with the test so you

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.259 
can also interfere with the test so you
can<00:05:23.979> use<00:05:24.219> the<00:05:25.110> r7<00:05:26.110> and<00:05:26.519> Chloe<00:05:27.519> neutralizer<00:05:28.029> you

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:28.269 
can use the r7 and Chloe neutralizer you

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:31.229 
can use the r7 and Chloe neutralizer you
can<00:05:28.389> add<00:05:28.479> a<00:05:28.509> few<00:05:29.349> drops<00:05:29.469> in<00:05:29.889> before<00:05:30.789> you<00:05:30.939> start

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:31.239 
can add a few drops in before you start

00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:33.119 
can add a few drops in before you start
the<00:05:31.360> test<00:05:31.569> and<00:05:31.989> that<00:05:32.019> will<00:05:32.229> help<00:05:32.349> give<00:05:33.099> you

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
the test and that will help give you

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:34.439 
the test and that will help give you
more<00:05:33.249> accurate<00:05:33.669> reading<00:05:33.939> if<00:05:34.029> the<00:05:34.119> chlorine

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
more accurate reading if the chlorine

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:38.879 
more accurate reading if the chlorine
levels<00:05:34.899> really<00:05:35.139> high<00:05:37.199> see<00:05:38.199> a<00:05:38.229> turn<00:05:38.589> after

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
levels really high see a turn after

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.909 
levels really high see a turn after
about<00:05:39.219> 40<00:05:39.639> drops<00:05:39.879> and<00:05:40.869> add<00:05:40.959> 41<00:05:41.529> to<00:05:41.649> to<00:05:41.769> make

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
about 40 drops and add 41 to to make

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.619 
about 40 drops and add 41 to to make
sure<00:05:42.129> a<00:05:42.369> little<00:05:42.550> bit<00:05:42.759> of<00:05:42.849> purple<00:05:43.059> tint<00:05:43.419> to<00:05:43.599> it

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:43.629 
sure a little bit of purple tint to it

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:45.719 
sure a little bit of purple tint to it
and<00:05:44.349> that's<00:05:44.589> screw<00:05:44.979> to<00:05:45.039> the<00:05:45.219> copper<00:05:45.429> in<00:05:45.639> the

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
and that's screw to the copper in the

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:46.290 
and that's screw to the copper in the
water

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
water

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:56.420 
water
I<00:05:46.619> can<00:05:47.619> see<00:05:47.739> kicks<00:05:47.979> off<00:05:48.189> so

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.840 

you

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.580 

so<00:05:59.850> fairly<00:06:00.060> easy<00:06:00.300> test<00:06:00.630> to<00:06:00.720> perform<00:06:00.840> yourself

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
so fairly easy test to perform yourself

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.129 
so fairly easy test to perform yourself
with<00:06:01.889> the<00:06:01.979> kid<00:06:02.220> and<00:06:02.460> again<00:06:03.419> you<00:06:03.570> can<00:06:03.690> also<00:06:03.840> do

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
with the kid and again you can also do

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:06.320 
with the kid and again you can also do
the<00:06:04.290> total<00:06:04.710> hardness<00:06:04.979> with<00:06:05.460> u-kiss<00:06:05.760> trips<00:06:06.090> to

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
the total hardness with u-kiss trips to

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.300 
the total hardness with u-kiss trips to
get<00:06:06.449> a<00:06:06.479> kind<00:06:06.690> of<00:06:06.750> a<00:06:06.840> ballpark<00:06:07.290> reading<00:06:07.889> also

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
get a kind of a ballpark reading also

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.760 
get a kind of a ballpark reading also
and<00:06:09.240> the<00:06:09.300> calcium<00:06:09.630> hardness<00:06:09.870> is<00:06:10.530> really

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
and the calcium hardness is really

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.409 
and the calcium hardness is really
important<00:06:11.160> also<00:06:11.430> when<00:06:11.639> the<00:06:11.940> water<00:06:12.120> starts

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
important also when the water starts

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.150 
important also when the water starts
getting<00:06:12.660> warm<00:06:12.960> that's<00:06:13.590> why<00:06:13.740> you'll<00:06:13.860> notice

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
getting warm that's why you'll notice

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.909 
getting warm that's why you'll notice
that<00:06:14.370> a<00:06:14.430> lot<00:06:14.550> of<00:06:14.699> commercial<00:06:15.540> hot<00:06:15.750> tubs<00:06:16.020> it

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
that a lot of commercial hot tubs it

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.409 
that a lot of commercial hot tubs it
really<00:06:17.160> stay<00:06:17.400> have<00:06:17.520> a<00:06:17.580> lot<00:06:17.699> of<00:06:17.729> scale<00:06:18.060> buildup

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
really stay have a lot of scale buildup

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.480 
really stay have a lot of scale buildup
the<00:06:18.660> hotter<00:06:18.810> the<00:06:18.960> water<00:06:18.990> is<00:06:19.410> the<00:06:19.590> more<00:06:19.830> the

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
the hotter the water is the more the

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.890 
the hotter the water is the more the
calcium<00:06:20.970> doesn't<00:06:21.240> dissolve<00:06:21.479> in<00:06:21.750> there

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
calcium doesn't dissolve in there

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.659 
calcium doesn't dissolve in there
causing<00:06:22.199> that<00:06:22.470> scale<00:06:22.800> buildup<00:06:23.190> on<00:06:23.340> the<00:06:23.400> class

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
causing that scale buildup on the class

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:32.279 
causing that scale buildup on the class
there

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:32.289 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:34.349
