you cannot afford it have something
simple<00:03:03.640> simple<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.870> even<00:03:05.350> if<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:05.530> can't

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
simple simple and even if you can't

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.140

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
but keep it simple there is a difference
