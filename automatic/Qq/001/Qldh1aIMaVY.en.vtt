00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.730
 or you put it all dynamite 98 and like 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.150
 you will have seen in the title of the video os 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.009
 I bring good as a deadly trap that 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.480
 it's minecraft's worth 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:17.330
 logically it's worth it because yes and good is 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.730
 how it looks like a quicksand 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.890
 if you fall you talked about consciousness 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.689
 here it's all a bit cheeky but in 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.400
 theory if you do it right you do it for 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.009
 under the ground and everything to make it 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.269
 everything is very good but here as you see 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.300
 because as an example, it has not 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.210
 cured too much and for example here you 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.699
 I have the example of diamonds and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.550
 chest and then you say host you're going 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.469
 walking around here says is that if that as 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.149
 diamonds I do not know that they these plates 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.550
 that logically you also do not hide and 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.699
 you fall here and what does this do 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.559
 now they are not seeing anything but this is 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.539
 quiet is that's how it's worth 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.359
 pistons have been closed and what we see 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.070
 here is how the earth is falling 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.710
 and because we're going slow because they're like 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.470
 a kind of quicksand and you go 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.780
 moving between the cobwebs 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:10.600
 ok and if this is in your rival then 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.650
 like that chaos sure because more 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.480
 calm that the item only passes the 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:20.240
 first web already break all and 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.350
 well that the items are broken and what 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.590
 only thing you have to do is how do I do 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.590
 I here 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.060
 the speakers again here and that's it and 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.220
 is uploaded to go very well because it 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.229
 kisses and how he is dying and the same 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.450
 he sees suffering and everything is good 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.219
 very very funny 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.280
 and well this as I told you I 'm going to 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:42.079
 make a more hidden and good now that you 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.729
 I explained that I'm going to take off a 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.149
 bit 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.649
 how it works is this for the two 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.659
 plates are the detonator looks like a 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.569
 way that is the rest in you get caught by 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.100
 here and good and now here this is the 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:58.030
 circuit down here is the circuit and 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.030
 I already explain it to you 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.540
 today yes yes yes 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.000
 so you can see 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:15.690
 it is more a parida with a house 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.810
 we closed this vale week has passed 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.140
 the torch is compounded because it has been 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.140
 molten 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.290
 now that I had to erase all the 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.340
 mods because 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:34.060
 that's why basically because it's not 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.060
 let it be again 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.310
 host is that it melts 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.760
 now 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.680
 okay now that explained the coming 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.140
 mechanism here to power everything and you 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.489
 comes here in this repeater the 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.110
 normal repeater of all life 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.799
 noel new voucher of new ships to you 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.390
 all this and come here you put a block 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.670
 in the middle can be wood than 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.939
 ye you lay it worth one for the 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.909
 repeater here in the minimum or not is that 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.890
 as you want it is worth and in the other 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.780
 you put a redstone torch and here 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.770
 you make the circuit the rest inside 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.770
 now I explain 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:25.150
 As I said, here is possible 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.440
 a little sunken is already melted again 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.410
 a moment ay 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.650
 Direct problems not either but 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.650
 good 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.200
 is here also now it 's tom hopper 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.510
 OK 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.280
 yes it is well worth as I have said 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.709
 come here the rest forgive me for 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.569
 all these interruptions but good 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.010
 came here the redstone equal to equal 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.680
 on the other side and here you put the 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.290
 repeaters behind each piston that 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.560
 as you can imagine they are not pistons 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.010
 in hooks you're worth there are sticky sorry 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.890
 sorry and they are just normal pistons is that 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.400
 sand being sand for example me 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.400
 I put here 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.210
 minecraft usually since you know it 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.480
 no but what if I put here one of 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.480
 sand 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.210
 and they are pistons that only when opened then 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.000
 lies in the action of efe 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.000
 just open up you see the sand would fall 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.160
 here and good there is the trap and everything and 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.960
 well the same is on this side and very 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.410
 important what I told you to put 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.780
 the repeaters because if you do not put the 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.229
 repeaters is worth all this aries 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.069
 so activate and ay if it would stay that way and not 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:56.069
 it's better as I told you the other 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.069
 ostional 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.650
 and when once it arrives that is close 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.960
 to levels a while in black is not not that 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.000
 be a loops nothing is because it is not like 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.490
 a bucket person way then because you 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.740
 extend the pistons the head and you have 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.360
 to wait a little while to get down but 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.970
 good is normal so do not you 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.260
 scare and good in this trap is very 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.020
 fun for how I put you here 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.810
 that you see that bet on there is here a 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.940
 chest with diamonds and well this could 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.890
 be the bait and good to troll this 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.900
 I was really very cool, I already 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.640
 I have done and well I hope that I have 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.950
 liked the video that you vote to give to 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.520
 favorites subscribe and see you next time 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.520
 goodbye
