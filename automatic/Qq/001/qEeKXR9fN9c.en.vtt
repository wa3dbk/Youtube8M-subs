00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.810
 vucinic and kelly kelly postures as the sample 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.619
 the one that they intend to slow down the progress 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.929
 and I think it's just the opposite 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.539
 but that is our position I think the other position is precisely a 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.380
 he came back 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.609
 necessary 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:26.739
 in which we question 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.039
 guillermo development efe 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.910
 your next project 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.810
 what we content ourselves 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.160
 waste 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.500
 only love for the moon company 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.110
 to weigh 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.530
 yes block 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.530
 anita to cover 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.500
 he went through so much 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 There are compañeras and concludes 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.290
 1 culture of love defense and attack 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.880
 in the occasion they are detected greenhouse 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.880
 they are the ones that question 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.870
 but many other actions 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.060
 they are trying 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.580
 efe such a way that it is urgent to develop 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.580
 other policies that checkpoints 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.170
 We are the human beings who should expect the least amount possible to 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.290
 meet our needs 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.740
 and for that we should forget about internal politics 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.659
 that has been done so far and that some want to continue developing in 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.110
 this region with him 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.980
 bush or other hydraulic infrastructures 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.330
 sun among others the winning company 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.010
 if we use 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.130
 a massive tourism on our coasts 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.149
 water pipes will shoot precisely and peak periods 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.010
 trip 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.530
 and if you also enhance urbanizations with golf courses 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.100
 as a garden 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.560
 in dry periods as a small 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.350
 dennis thousand inhabitants hardly exist any water policy I think 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.589
 to resist 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:14.849
 it is not possible to provide as much water as you wish 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.479
 because it is a limited good 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:18.709
 hyundai sustainable policy 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.709
 mike serenity through web-based management 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:23.679
 that causes the minor 

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:27.899
 the possible impact on natural ecosystems development of activities 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:31.149
 economic ones that put them to those criteria 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:32.769
 so it is imperative 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.599
 manage the resource 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.759
 they not only satisfy the rioja 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:41.189
 avoided this one of life and the need to 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:43.579
 for all this 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.839
 the members of the university 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:47.419
 the home under the signer 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.419
 we consider the proposal of qom unsustainable 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.859
 the reservoir of entrepeñas natural park of networks in the ebro valley 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.009
 pepa lin 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.009
 besides having been declared a natural reserve 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.029
 a change in water policy and the party is considered very 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:14.429
 muse de mcqueen have economic benefit and consider their values 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:17.429
 sociocultural identity 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.459
 a policy that is chaired by 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.719
 God will say 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.299
 and so we want to state
