00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.990 

when<00:00:02.700> I<00:00:02.760> went<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.030> rebuild<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.830> dinette<00:00:05.000> the

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
when I went to rebuild the dinette the

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.600 
when I went to rebuild the dinette the
two<00:00:06.180> seats<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.720> dinette<00:00:07.109> up<00:00:07.319> front

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
two seats of the dinette up front

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.980 
two seats of the dinette up front
the<00:00:09.570> wood<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.710> makes<00:00:11.099> up<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.670> sides<00:00:11.990> of

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
the wood that makes up the sides of

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.840 
the wood that makes up the sides of
these<00:00:13.259> benches<00:00:14.240> was<00:00:15.240> too<00:00:16.020> far<00:00:16.230> gone

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
these benches was too far gone

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.480 
these benches was too far gone
so<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:19.850> just<00:00:20.850> cut<00:00:21.060> out<00:00:21.180> some<00:00:21.449> new<00:00:22.310> quarter<00:00:23.310> inch

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
so I just cut out some new quarter inch

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.370 
so I just cut out some new quarter inch
birch<00:00:24.199> and<00:00:25.279> attached<00:00:26.300> this<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.840> rail<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
birch and attached this this rail the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.380 
birch and attached this this rail the
same<00:00:28.680> rail<00:00:30.050> to<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.890> either<00:00:32.130> side<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.149> then

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
same rail to it on either side and then

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.010 
same rail to it on either side and then
used<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.430> think<00:00:35.430> use<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> same<00:00:36.030> type<00:00:36.989> of

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
used I think use the same type of

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.229 
used I think use the same type of
framing<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.710> was<00:00:38.329> originally<00:00:39.329> in<00:00:39.360> there

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
framing that was originally in there

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.990 
framing that was originally in there
raise<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.450> seat<00:00:42.780> up<00:00:43.610> we've<00:00:44.610> got<00:00:44.640> something

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
raise the seat up we've got something

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.750 
raise the seat up we've got something
stored<00:00:45.390> under<00:00:45.660> there<00:00:45.809> now<00:00:46.309> but<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.610> see

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
stored under there now but you can see

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.720 
stored under there now but you can see
the<00:00:47.879> backside<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.980> four<00:00:49.980> inch<00:00:50.160> birch<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
the backside of that four inch birch and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.229 
the backside of that four inch birch and
you<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:50.940> see<00:00:51.120> kind<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.360> how<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:52.219> this<00:00:53.219> seat<00:00:54.030> is

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
you can see kind of how the this seat is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.790 
you can see kind of how the this seat is
made

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
made

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.849 
made
are<00:00:56.340> these<00:00:56.489> strips<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:58.440> seat<00:00:59.539> sits<00:01:00.539> on

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
are these strips that the seat sits on

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.399 
are these strips that the seat sits on
was<00:01:01.859> original<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.390> actually<00:01:03.690> yeah

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
was original and I think actually yeah

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.690 
was original and I think actually yeah
actually<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.960> end<00:01:07.260> piece<00:01:07.530> just<00:01:08.460> cut<00:01:08.670> a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
actually on this end piece just cut a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.399 
actually on this end piece just cut a
piece<00:01:09.020> that<00:01:10.020> would<00:01:10.170> fit<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:12.200> nailed<00:01:13.200> it

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
piece that would fit and just nailed it

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.260 
piece that would fit and just nailed it
right<00:01:13.439> over<00:01:13.830> at<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> top<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.610> what<00:01:15.150> was

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
right over at the top of what was

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.929 
right over at the top of what was
already<00:01:15.479> there<00:01:15.689> because<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.259> was<00:01:16.380> gonna<00:01:16.470> be

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
already there because it was gonna be

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.060 
already there because it was gonna be
too<00:01:17.939> much<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.360> try<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.570> get<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.110> framing<00:01:19.799> all

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
too much to try to get the framing all

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.969 
too much to try to get the framing all
off<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.460> back<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.150> everything<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.799> put

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
off the back and everything so just put

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.190 
off the back and everything so just put
it<00:01:23.070> right<00:01:23.189> over<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.000> let<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.049> original

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
it right over it and let the original

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.260 
it right over it and let the original
door<00:01:25.590> back<00:01:25.830> on

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.330 

it's<00:01:32.270> something<00:01:32.570> similar<00:01:32.810> on<00:01:32.960> this<00:01:33.290> side<00:01:36.340> you

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
it's something similar on this side you

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:46.560 
it's something similar on this side you
see<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:39.530> water<00:01:39.770> line<00:01:40.100> I'm<00:01:40.610> gonna<00:01:40.790> here

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.300 

and<00:01:47.570> then<00:01:48.370> just<00:01:49.370> had<00:01:49.550> to<00:01:49.700> attach<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.480> hardware

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
and then just had to attach the hardware

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.490 
and then just had to attach the hardware
for<00:01:52.310> this<00:01:52.490> table<00:01:54.520> actually<00:01:55.520> had<00:01:55.970> to<00:01:56.060> do<00:01:56.210> that

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
that done got the original table back in

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:13.480 
that done got the original table back in
here<00:02:10.810> Tara<00:02:11.810> made<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.320> cushions<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.190> the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
that she made the piping the piping is

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.130 
that she made the piping the piping is
gonna<00:02:19.130> be<00:02:19.280> pretty<00:02:19.520> expensive<00:02:19.850> she<00:02:20.810> made<00:02:20.990> all

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140

the<00:02:25.040> side<00:02:25.250> panels<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:25.959> in<00:02:26.959> order<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.530> make<00:02:27.950> it

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
the side panels and in order to make it

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.480 
the side panels and in order to make it
a<00:02:28.100> little<00:02:28.220> bit<00:02:28.370> easier<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:29.090> do<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.050> upholstery

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
a little bit easier to do the upholstery

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.030 
a little bit easier to do the upholstery
she<00:02:32.090> left<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.480> side<00:02:32.690> panels<00:02:33.110> long<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.740> folded

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
she left the side panels long and folded

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.970 
she left the side panels long and folded
them<00:02:34.160> over<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:34.700> we<00:02:35.540> cut<00:02:35.750> out<00:02:35.989> some<00:02:36.380> some

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
them over and we cut out some some

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.650 
them over and we cut out some some
boards<00:02:37.459> that<00:02:37.970> were<00:02:38.090> just<00:02:38.300> a<00:02:38.360> little<00:02:38.540> bit

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
boards that were just a little bit

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.500 
boards that were just a little bit
smaller<00:02:38.959> than<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.760> dimensions<00:02:40.760> of<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.270> each

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
smaller than the dimensions of the each

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.710 
smaller than the dimensions of the each
cushion<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.800> was<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.880> same<00:02:44.150> quarter<00:02:44.570> inch

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
cushion it was the same quarter inch

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.370 
cushion it was the same quarter inch
paneling<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:45.880> just<00:02:46.880> folded<00:02:47.540> over<00:02:47.630> pulled<00:02:48.230> it

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
paneling and just folded over pulled it

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.320 
paneling and just folded over pulled it
snug<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.830> stapled<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.340> so<00:02:49.820> it<00:02:50.030> turned<00:02:50.209> out

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
snug and stapled it so it turned out

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.140 
snug and stapled it so it turned out
really<00:02:50.390> really<00:02:50.840> nice
