going<00:00:35.850> they're<00:00:36.140> putting<00:00:37.140> all<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.320> F<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.620> and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
going they're putting all that F in and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.380 
going they're putting all that F in and
not<00:00:38.070> focusing<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.550> form<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.089> we're<00:00:39.180> gonna<00:00:39.269> take

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
not focusing on form so we're gonna take

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.569 
not focusing on form so we're gonna take
a<00:00:39.449> look<00:00:39.629> at<00:00:39.720> form<00:00:39.989> here<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.379> here<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.370> have<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
a look at form here so here we have the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.420 
a look at form here so here we have the
triceps<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.180> their<00:00:42.360> slightly<00:00:43.129> bent<00:00:44.129> easy

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430

pressure<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> elbows<00:00:49.140> noticing<00:00:50.010> things

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
pressure on the elbows noticing things

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.880 
pressure on the elbows noticing things
here<00:00:50.579> are<00:00:51.269> shoulders<00:00:51.960> elbows<00:00:52.140> positioning

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
here are shoulders elbows positioning

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.590 
here are shoulders elbows positioning
shoulders<00:00:53.309> are<00:00:53.400> swinging<00:00:53.729> up<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.059> down<00:00:54.239> like

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
shoulders are swinging up and down like

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.570 
shoulders are swinging up and down like
a<00:00:54.659> forwards<00:00:55.140> saying<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.470> the<00:00:55.530> elbows<00:00:55.890> hips

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
a forwards saying with the elbows hips

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.310 
a forwards saying with the elbows hips
are<00:00:56.820> kicked<00:00:56.970> back<00:00:57.150> which<00:00:57.420> clear<00:00:57.689> space<00:00:58.019> and

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
are kicked back which clear space and

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.140 
are kicked back which clear space and
angles<00:00:58.739> aren't<00:00:58.979> very<00:00:59.250> slightly<00:00:59.610> forward<00:00:59.909> so

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
angles aren't very slightly forward so

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.219 
angles aren't very slightly forward so
even<00:01:00.390> when<00:01:00.479> I<00:01:00.510> get<00:01:00.659> to<00:01:00.720> full<00:01:00.869> extension

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
even when I get to full extension

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:02.600 
even when I get to full extension
there's<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> slight<00:01:01.739> angle<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.220> arm<00:01:02.369> and

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
there's a slight angle on the arm and

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.460 
there's a slight angle on the arm and
that<00:01:03.000> takes<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.360> load<00:01:03.510> off<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.989> elbow<00:01:04.110> joint

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
that takes a load off the elbow joint

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.710 
that takes a load off the elbow joint
itself<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.670> make<00:01:05.850> sure<00:01:05.880> when<00:01:06.240> you're<00:01:06.360> doing<00:01:06.390> it

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
itself so make sure when you're doing it

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.600 
itself so make sure when you're doing it
that<00:01:06.840> you're<00:01:06.990> minimizing<00:01:07.290> joint<00:01:08.220> movement

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
that you're minimizing joint movement

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.010 
that you're minimizing joint movement
from<00:01:08.729> anything<00:01:08.939> else<00:01:09.180> other<00:01:09.479> than<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> elbow

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
from anything else other than the elbow

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.090 
from anything else other than the elbow
joint<00:01:10.259> that<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.530> supposed<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:10.979> moving<00:01:16.100> so

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
joint that you supposed to be moving so

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.530 
joint that you supposed to be moving so
that<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> first<00:01:17.610> section<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.360> is

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
that was the first section so this is

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.480 
that was the first section so this is
now<00:01:18.689> at<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.140> heavier<00:01:19.439> towards<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> end<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
now at the heavier towards the end of a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.789 
now at the heavier towards the end of a
final<00:01:20.850> set<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.320> see<00:01:22.500> here<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
final set so you can see here the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.380 
final set so you can see here the
difference<00:01:23.159> between<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.520> first<00:01:23.670> set<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
difference between the first set and the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.820 
difference between the first set and the
end<00:01:24.509> set<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.080> shouldn't<00:01:25.380> see<00:01:25.470> much

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
end set you shouldn't see much

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.230 
end set you shouldn't see much
difference<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.250> form<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.880> will<00:01:27.030> see

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
difference in form but what you will see

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.240 
difference in form but what you will see
on<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.510> because<00:01:27.960> we're<00:01:28.230> doing<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> heavy<00:01:28.800> and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
on this because we're doing a heavy and

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.710 
on this because we're doing a heavy and
behind<00:01:29.520> me<00:01:29.640> heavy<00:01:29.940> I<00:01:29.970> mean<00:01:30.090> heavy<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
behind me heavy I mean heavy for the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.170 
behind me heavy I mean heavy for the
technique<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.650> your<00:01:32.250> heavy<00:01:32.550> weight<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.030> not

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
technique so your heavy weight is not

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.280 
technique so your heavy weight is not
something<00:01:33.480> you<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.780> shift<00:01:33.900> up<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.230> down

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
something you can just shift up and down

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.720 
something you can just shift up and down
heavy<00:01:34.680> weight<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.040> something<00:01:35.190> that<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.580> can

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
heavy weight is something that you can

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.480 
heavy weight is something that you can
lift<00:01:36.030> with<00:01:36.540> good<00:01:36.870> form<00:01:37.260> to<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> lower<00:01:38.220> failure

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
lift with good form to a lower failure

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.370 
lift with good form to a lower failure
point<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.600> you're<00:01:39.720> getting<00:01:39.900> less<00:01:40.110> reps

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
point so you're getting less reps

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.660 
point so you're getting less reps
because<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.740> way<00:01:40.830> it's<00:01:40.950> kind<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.130> your<00:01:41.340> form

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
because the way it's kind of your form

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.790 
because the way it's kind of your form
isn't<00:01:41.880> not<00:01:42.270> suffering<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.260> is<00:01:43.380> hugely

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
isn't not suffering that is hugely

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.410 
isn't not suffering that is hugely
important<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.670> you're<00:01:44.790> looking<00:01:44.880> at<00:01:45.120> we're

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
important so you're looking at we're

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.100 
important so you're looking at we're
gonna<00:01:45.600> pull<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.080> I<00:01:46.260> set<00:01:46.680> my<00:01:46.800> shoulders<00:01:47.190> back

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
gonna pull it in I set my shoulders back

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.780 
gonna pull it in I set my shoulders back
coming<00:01:49.110> down<00:01:49.290> nice<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.799> straight<00:01:50.159> up<00:01:50.280> slow

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
coming down nice and straight up slow

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.760 
coming down nice and straight up slow

these hitting the exercise like you
should<00:03:39.380> notice<00:03:40.160> how<00:03:40.280> he's<00:03:40.730> really<00:03:41.120> having<00:03:41.209> to

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
should notice how he's really having to

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.789 
should notice how he's really having to
drive<00:03:41.600> through<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.019> get<00:03:42.140> that<00:03:42.290> tension<00:03:42.560> and

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
drive through and get that tension and

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.160 
drive through and get that tension and
just<00:03:43.010> suddenly<00:03:43.340> clicks<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:44.120> hits<00:03:44.360> and<00:03:44.720> then

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
just suddenly clicks it hits and then

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.870 
just suddenly clicks it hits and then
that<00:03:45.500> weight<00:03:45.680> won't<00:03:45.890> go<00:03:46.040> up<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:46.459> at<00:03:46.730> that

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
that weight won't go up and at that

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.920 
that weight won't go up and at that
point<00:03:47.060> that's<00:03:47.239> where<00:03:47.360> most<00:03:47.480> people<00:03:47.600> start

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
point that's where most people start

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.360 
point that's where most people start
twisting<00:03:48.290> and<00:03:48.380> contorting<00:03:48.440> don't<00:03:49.130> take<00:03:49.340> a

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
twisting and contorting don't take a

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.280 
twisting and contorting don't take a
rest<00:03:49.610> pause<00:03:49.880> and<00:03:50.390> just<00:03:50.570> try<00:03:50.720> and<00:03:50.780> hit<00:03:50.870> one<00:03:51.079> more

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
rest pause and just try and hit one more

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.900 
rest pause and just try and hit one more
clean<00:03:51.530> rep<00:03:51.769> keep<00:03:52.310> doing<00:03:52.489> that<00:03:52.549> over<00:03:52.700> time

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
clean rep keep doing that over time

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:10.050 
clean rep keep doing that over time
you're<00:03:53.150> going<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.329> see<00:03:53.480> that<00:03:53.630> progression

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.280 

so<00:04:11.060> again<00:04:11.270> this<00:04:11.390> is<00:04:11.540> just<00:04:11.750> a<00:04:11.840> looking<00:04:12.170> at<00:04:12.260> a

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
so again this is just a looking at a

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.170 
so again this is just a looking at a
heavier<00:04:12.860> set<00:04:13.130> here<00:04:13.340> once<00:04:13.700> you<00:04:13.820> get<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.000> good

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
heavier set here once you get a good

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.640 
heavier set here once you get a good
technique<00:04:14.540> and<00:04:14.840> you're<00:04:14.960> able<00:04:15.080> to<00:04:15.260> really

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
technique and you're able to really

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:16.870 
technique and you're able to really
concentrate<00:04:15.920> on<00:04:16.220> that<00:04:16.280> Magda<00:04:16.640> muscle

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
concentrate on that Magda muscle

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.670 
concentrate on that Magda muscle
connection<00:04:17.120> you<00:04:17.660> can't<00:04:17.900> do<00:04:18.050> a<00:04:18.080> few<00:04:18.350> power

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
connection you can't do a few power

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.870 
connection you can't do a few power
movements<00:04:19.130> through<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.340> heavier<00:04:19.610> weights

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
movements through the heavier weights

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.640 
movements through the heavier weights
still<00:04:20.660> keeping<00:04:20.959> that<00:04:21.050> focus

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
still keeping that focus

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.410 
still keeping that focus
the<00:04:22.070> trick<00:04:22.460> is<00:04:22.580> again<00:04:22.880> not<00:04:23.120> letting<00:04:23.330> no

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
the trick is again not letting no

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.060 
the trick is again not letting no
shoulders<00:04:23.840> rock<00:04:24.020> where<00:04:24.200> elbows<00:04:24.560> chested

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
shoulders rock where elbows chested

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.250 
shoulders rock where elbows chested
within<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.400> muted<00:04:25.700> position<00:04:26.090> but<00:04:26.900> avoid

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
within the muted position but avoid

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.840 
within the muted position but avoid
powering<00:04:28.130> through<00:04:28.310> like<00:04:28.430> I<00:04:28.580> was<00:04:28.670> just<00:04:28.700> doing

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
powering through like I was just doing

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.160 
powering through like I was just doing
there<00:04:29.150> when<00:04:29.300> you're<00:04:29.420> first<00:04:29.570> dying<00:04:29.840> out<00:04:30.020> and

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
there when you're first dying out and

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.840 
there when you're first dying out and
get<00:04:30.290> used<00:04:30.530> to<00:04:30.590> resetting<00:04:31.370> your<00:04:31.400> technique<00:04:31.730> and

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
get used to resetting your technique and

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:39.040 
get used to resetting your technique and
resetting<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.300> body<00:04:32.420> postures

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.960 

so<00:04:39.530> again<00:04:39.740> look<00:04:39.920> how<00:04:39.950> resetting<00:04:40.520> nicob<00:04:40.790> up

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
so again look how resetting nicob up

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.540 
so again look how resetting nicob up
before<00:04:41.450> he<00:04:41.570> even<00:04:41.660> starts<00:04:42.230> making<00:04:42.680> sure<00:04:42.950> hips

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
before he even starts making sure hips

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.970 
before he even starts making sure hips
chest<00:04:44.090> shoulders<00:04:44.990> elbows<00:04:45.170> all<00:04:45.650> in<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.830> right

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
chest shoulders elbows all in the right

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.470 
chest shoulders elbows all in the right
position<00:04:46.370> then<00:04:46.730> he's<00:04:46.910> driving<00:04:47.300> through

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
position then he's driving through

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.180 
position then he's driving through
coming<00:04:48.170> straight<00:04:48.380> up<00:04:48.440> straight<00:04:48.740> down<00:04:48.830> quite<00:04:49.160> a

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
coming straight up straight down quite a

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.070 
coming straight up straight down quite a
robotic<00:04:49.640> motion<00:04:49.790> and<00:04:50.420> not<00:04:50.660> letting<00:04:50.840> the

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
robotic motion and not letting the

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.320 
robotic motion and not letting the
handle<00:04:51.410> swinging<00:04:51.770> swing<00:04:52.070> out<00:04:52.220> not<00:04:52.880> rotating

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
handle swinging swing out not rotating

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.450 
handle swinging swing out not rotating
on<00:04:53.420> the<00:04:53.450> wrists<00:04:53.840> keeping<00:04:54.590> it<00:04:54.680> stripped<00:04:55.070> and<00:04:55.280> on

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
on the wrists keeping it stripped and on

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.460 
on the wrists keeping it stripped and on
the<00:04:55.640> tricep<00:04:56.090> this<00:04:56.120> is<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.450> point<00:04:56.690> most<00:04:57.200> people

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
the tricep this is the point most people

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.810 
the tricep this is the point most people
forget<00:04:58.010> that<00:04:58.100> the<00:04:58.190> body's<00:04:58.430> gonna<00:04:58.490> try<00:04:58.730> and

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
forget that the body's gonna try and

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.890 
forget that the body's gonna try and
cheat<00:04:59.000> it's<00:04:59.150> gonna<00:04:59.240> try<00:04:59.450> and<00:04:59.570> switch<00:04:59.750> that

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
cheat it's gonna try and switch that

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.150 
cheat it's gonna try and switch that
tension<00:05:00.290> boy<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:00.650> that's<00:05:00.740> what<00:05:00.890> we<00:05:01.010> both

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
tension boy and that's what we both

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:24.989 
tension boy and that's what we both
started<00:05:01.520> doing

00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:24.999 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:27.459 

eisah<00:05:25.999> realtors<00:05:26.449> finally<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:27.020> look<00:05:27.169> out<00:05:27.259> today

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:27.469 
eisah realtors finally to look out today

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:28.719 
eisah realtors finally to look out today
which<00:05:27.620> I<00:05:27.710> think<00:05:27.889> a<00:05:27.949> lot<00:05:28.069> of<00:05:28.099> people<00:05:28.370> don't<00:05:28.550> use

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
which I think a lot of people don't use

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.610 
which I think a lot of people don't use
it<00:05:28.879> is<00:05:29.029> a<00:05:29.060> really<00:05:29.330> nice<00:05:29.449> exercise<00:05:29.779> this<00:05:30.379> is<00:05:30.529> the

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
it is a really nice exercise this is the

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.769 
it is a really nice exercise this is the
underhand<00:05:31.189> grip<00:05:31.279> extensions<00:05:32.029> so<00:05:32.449> you<00:05:32.509> can<00:05:32.659> do

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:32.779 
underhand grip extensions so you can do

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:34.149 
underhand grip extensions so you can do
this<00:05:32.960> on<00:05:33.050> whatever<00:05:33.199> handle<00:05:33.560> you<00:05:33.650> feels<00:05:33.860> nice

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:34.159 
this on whatever handle you feels nice

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:35.409 
this on whatever handle you feels nice
you<00:05:34.340> can<00:05:34.430> even<00:05:34.550> do<00:05:34.729> it<00:05:34.819> on<00:05:34.879> two<00:05:35.090> separate

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
you can even do it on two separate

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:36.730 
you can even do it on two separate
handles<00:05:35.749> ones<00:05:35.960> that<00:05:36.110> usually<00:05:36.259> used<00:05:36.590> to<00:05:36.680> do

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
handles ones that usually used to do

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.860 
handles ones that usually used to do
cable<00:05:37.069> crossovers<00:05:37.580> with<00:05:37.699> they<00:05:38.449> work<00:05:38.629> quite

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
cable crossovers with they work quite

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.269 
cable crossovers with they work quite
well<00:05:38.900> as<00:05:39.349> well<00:05:39.529> as<00:05:39.620> a<00:05:39.680> straight<00:05:39.919> bar<00:05:40.129> just

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:40.279 
well as well as a straight bar just

well as well as a straight bar just
depending<00:05:40.610> on<00:05:40.639> what<00:05:40.729> feels<00:05:41.060> more<00:05:41.150> comfortable

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
depending on what feels more comfortable

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.709 
depending on what feels more comfortable
