00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:13.830
 rudel in the aftermarket at the start as a klaus 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:15.299
 hajek bourse slokar I do not want to go there 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.300
 I want to go into it 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.330
 actually more or less you times 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.650
 so much to think about 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.130
 my subscribers of course us 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.560
 get the knowledge that just heike off 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.840
 grad hicad vegan the best thing is you 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.850
 can do it 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.219
 but of course there are many 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.110
 of course that are of course lures 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.210
 Rates now look special and chaos 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.760
 make you fat and back and forth and ramallah 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.390
 and I just want to do it like that 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.410
 Give a little food for thought 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.420
 So first of all no question low carb 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.550
 works 24 weeks 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.809
 Competition preparation therapy is complete 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.460
 no question but on the duration 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.260
 It does not work like many people 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.180
 They have ten fifteen years 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.550
 low carb and no progress is 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.979
 Today on Heiko on the way and lay hey 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.290
 I could not prove that 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.400
 I always believed in low carb 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.590
 have and always the shit 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.520
 So now let's think about it 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.340
 very briefly the brain works with 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.590
 glycogen stores the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.460
 Energy storage in the body will be with you 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:27.240
 glycogen filled the nervous system 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:30.030
 works with glycogen of the body 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.009
 needs glycogen around many processes too 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.780
 control and produce many hormones 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.280
 and many hormones to transport the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.420
 chp all this synapses and shit 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.170
 works with kripo go glycogen 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.369
 comes from carbohydrates 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.110
 Now I have to ask myself again 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:54.119
 ask how can that be that that 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:58.049
 what my body from the here to the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.990
 foot c needs bad for my body 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.409
 is or makes my body fat like can 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.030
 it think its just once over it 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.670
 does not work or little if you 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.009
 bought in gasoline and the tank the e85 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.799
 he reappeared 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.989
 but will run shit and each of the 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.840
 local I have no government 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:22.040
 I do not know what to eat 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.829
 animal garbage fat and sometimes a 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.209
 little food for thought I have little fat 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:32.450
 What kind of hormone production is that ? 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:36.680
 transport therapy cell regeneration 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.629
 cell structure is sufficient and have so many 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.470
 carbohydrates the mine's energy needs 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:44.659
 Cover or I have so much fat before 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.879
 not only so much for the 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:49.010
 hormone production cells generations 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.879
 terra need and I have so much 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.250
 carbohydrates 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.900
 Now the body takes the carbohydrates 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.920
 takes a bit fat but it does 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:02.230
 There is a lot left to do now 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:05.930
 the chronik rate fat or make you 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.030
 This little exercise fat that ye may 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.370
 in most cases still animal 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.720
 fat is and this animal fat can 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.720
 The body can not rate it 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.319
 either use it as fuel or he 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.930
 it can store 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.569
 you notice something on the subject of carbohydrate 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.000
 make it thick then too 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.840
 Just have a look 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.959
 vegan Heikamp types of 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.940
 there is no fat one of the only 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.889
 fat vegan I know that is 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.109
 this patrick barbuda that is the 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.760
 Germany's strongest man, I know 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.560
 but not if the hai cable often 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.250
 probably not because 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:49.699
 he's pretty strong yes 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.379
 people now just think about it 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:53.690
 I 've often said so but you 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.099
 can you answer it yourself 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.370
 also very short 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:01.400
 of course the body can be i think so 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.230
 genese me, I'm the technical term 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.780
 I totally think I have such a junk 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.790
 Do not remember because I know how it works 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.560
 really works better, yes better 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.060
 In any case, if there is no coal turn 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.540
 then a body can do just that 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.219
 carbohydrates itself wants 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.590
 in theory, the body would need 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:20.579
 no carbohydrates but to what 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.229
 Price if you are yours 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.389
 Firewood buys then you have in too 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.639
 ikea or furniture opener and buys you 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.680
 the most expensive cabinet and then has the 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.360
 too small wood and in your new yard too 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.100

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.539

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.030
 the firewood in the same group 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.620
 can throw in the forest in the 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.300
 carbohydrates furniture openers are fat 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.280
 and protein what the body broke 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.610
 has to do or has to rebuild what 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.729
 Of course, much inefficient is yes 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.750
 but just come to 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.539
 Cardiovascular problems this whole 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.949
 field there stay petra wpa and it is yes 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.330
 I do not say anything about it 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.880
 but you can read you can 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.840
 inform that is just so that 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.970
 I'm not so expert 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.620
 held but just do not like 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.000
 just have a conversation because I 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.590
 just know that it is better with you 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.120

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.190
 wanted 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.349
 In that sense I hope I could 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.190
 your thoughts a little bit about it 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:17.419
 encourage thinking about what 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.740
 really better for your body 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.630
