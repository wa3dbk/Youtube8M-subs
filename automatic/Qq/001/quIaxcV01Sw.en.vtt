to hold this down for about eight or

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.439 
to hold this down for about eight or
nine<00:05:14.960> seconds<00:05:15.800> it's<00:05:16.250> going<00:05:16.580> to<00:05:16.699> power<00:05:16.909> up<00:05:17.240> and

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:24.909 
it with my device so there's no problem
there<00:05:23.259> basically<00:05:24.259> you're<00:05:24.349> going<00:05:24.439> to<00:05:24.529> hold<00:05:24.740> it

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
there basically you're going to hold it

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.219

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
it does it's powered off very

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.040 
it does it's powered off very
comfortable<00:05:30.830> for<00:05:31.460> the<00:05:31.659> immediate<00:05:32.659> short-term

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
comfortable for the immediate short-term

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.079 
comfortable for the immediate short-term
once<00:05:33.589> you<00:05:33.710> get<00:05:33.860> into<00:05:33.979> in<00:05:34.370> my<00:05:34.520> opinion<00:05:34.879> about<00:05:35.029> a

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:35.089 
once you get into in my opinion about a

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:37.929 
once you get into in my opinion about a
four<00:05:35.479> hour<00:05:35.800> time<00:05:36.800> frame<00:05:37.189> then<00:05:37.520> you<00:05:37.550> start

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:37.939 
four hour time frame then you start

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:39.159 
four hour time frame then you start
feeling<00:05:37.969> them<00:05:38.449> a<00:05:38.539> little<00:05:38.750> bit<00:05:38.870> but<00:05:39.020> they're

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
feeling them a little bit but they're

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.010 
feeling them a little bit but they're
not<00:05:39.409> excessively<00:05:40.099> heavy<00:05:40.460> I<00:05:40.819> like<00:05:41.689> that<00:05:41.930> you

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
not excessively heavy I like that you

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.760 
not excessively heavy I like that you
can<00:05:42.259> cut<00:05:42.469> the<00:05:42.649> cord<00:05:42.979> with<00:05:43.520> these<00:05:44.180> headphones

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
can cut the cord with these headphones

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.889 
can cut the cord with these headphones
and<00:05:45.770> I<00:05:46.069> think<00:05:46.430> they're<00:05:46.729> depending<00:05:47.449> upon<00:05:47.569> what

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:47.899 
and I think they're depending upon what

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:49.929 
and I think they're depending upon what
you're<00:05:48.080> looking<00:05:48.379> for<00:05:48.649> a<00:05:48.889> relatively<00:05:49.789> good

00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:49.939 
you're looking for a relatively good

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:51.879 
you're looking for a relatively good
deal<00:05:50.360> they're<00:05:50.689> also<00:05:50.899> available<00:05:51.349> in<00:05:51.649> a<00:05:51.740> wide

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889 
deal they're also available in a wide

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:53.469 
deal they're also available in a wide
variety<00:05:52.189> of<00:05:52.430> color<00:05:52.729> so<00:05:53.060> you<00:05:53.149> don't<00:05:53.300> have<00:05:53.360> to

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
variety of color so you don't have to

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.029
