00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
frankly so what we have here is a

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.250 
frankly so what we have here is a
follow-up<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.150> clover<00:00:21.570> trail<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:22.109> is

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
follow-up to clover trail this is

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.300 
follow-up to clover trail this is
baytril<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.250> it's<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.519> 22<00:00:23.850> nanometer<00:00:24.359> part

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
baytril so it's a 22 nanometer part

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.439 
baytril so it's a 22 nanometer part
specifically<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.519> one<00:00:26.670> has<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> quad<00:00:27.210> core

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
specifically this one has a quad core

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.320 
specifically this one has a quad core
SOC<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.380> there<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.580> our<00:00:29.699> Intel<00:00:30.000> reference

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
SOC in there this is our Intel reference

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.550 
SOC in there this is our Intel reference
design<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:30.929> you're<00:00:31.050> not<00:00:31.170> going<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.349> see<00:00:31.439> this

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
design so you're not going to see this

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.410 
design so you're not going to see this
product<00:00:32.460> on<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> market<00:00:32.960> and<00:00:34.280> you<00:00:35.280> look<00:00:36.239> we

product on the market and you look we

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.330 
product on the market and you look we
actually<00:00:36.719> have<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> really<00:00:37.710> high<00:00:37.829> resolution

actually have a really high resolution
screen<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.670> here<00:00:38.879> it's<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.239> 2560<00:00:40.050> x<00:00:40.230> 1440<00:00:40.770> screen

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
screen on here it's a 2560 x 1440 screen

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.490 
screen on here it's a 2560 x 1440 screen

let's talk about project Elvis why this

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.160 
let's talk about project Elvis why this
is<00:01:52.869> a<00:01:52.899> king<00:01:53.140> of<00:01:53.289> graphic<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.720> here<00:01:56.020> what<00:01:56.140> you

is a king of graphic so here what you
see<00:01:56.320> is<00:01:57.450> android<00:01:58.450> app<00:01:58.660> running<00:01:58.869> on<00:01:59.110> core<00:01:59.649> and

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
see is android app running on core and

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.260 
see is android app running on core and
from<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.440> speed<00:02:02.649> point<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:03.009> view<00:02:03.160> well<00:02:03.369> it's<00:02:04.030> hot

from a speed point of view well it's hot

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.010 
from a speed point of view well it's hot
to<00:02:04.479> do<00:02:04.630> better<00:02:05.550> at<00:02:06.550> 65<00:02:07.090> per<00:02:07.240> second<00:02:07.600> is<00:02:07.750> really

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
to do better at 65 per second is really

fast I'm going to move I'm going to
increase<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.929> volume<00:02:11.020> because<00:02:11.560> that's<00:02:12.430> cool

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
increase the volume because that's cool

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:23.310 
increase the volume because that's cool
and<00:02:13.500> here<00:02:14.500> we<00:02:14.530> go

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
is not a project coqueta sees the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.180 
is not a project coqueta sees the
performance<00:03:03.080> group<00:03:03.230> playing<00:03:03.560> with<00:03:03.890> what<00:03:04.070> we

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
performance group playing with what we

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.100 
performance group playing with what we
have<00:03:04.340> inside<00:03:04.640> in<00:03:04.820> tales<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.240> a<00:03:05.330> lot<00:03:05.540> of<00:03:05.630> graphic

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
have inside in tales of a lot of graphic

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.460 
have inside in tales of a lot of graphic
drivers<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.709> lot<00:03:06.890> of<00:03:06.980> things<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:09.260> is

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
drivers a lot of things and this is

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:16.240 
drivers a lot of things and this is
because<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.070> could<00:03:14.500> so<00:03:15.500> web<00:03:15.680> browsing<00:03:15.890> look

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
because I could so web browsing look

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.690 
because I could so web browsing look
like<00:03:16.459> this<00:03:17.290> so<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.350> have<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.650> full<00:03:18.860> flash<00:03:19.070> CNN

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
like this so you have the full flash CNN

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.620 
like this so you have the full flash CNN
and<00:03:19.940> then<00:03:23.470> ridiculously<00:03:24.470> fast<00:03:25.239> to<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.360> point

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
and then ridiculously fast to the point

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.479 
and then ridiculously fast to the point
that<00:03:26.720> you<00:03:27.230> never<00:03:27.440> give<00:03:27.709> up<00:03:27.800> 60<00:03:28.190> frames<00:03:28.430> per

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
that you never give up 60 frames per

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.970 
that you never give up 60 frames per
second<00:03:28.880> so<00:03:29.720> this<00:03:29.870> is<00:03:29.989> a<00:03:30.019> this<00:03:30.290> is<00:03:30.500> a<00:03:30.680> king<00:03:30.890> of

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
second so this is a this is a king of

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.310 
second so this is a this is a king of
other<00:03:31.130> way
