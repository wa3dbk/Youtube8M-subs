if<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.189> don't<00:00:20.340> know<00:00:20.460> what<00:00:20.609> hit<00:00:20.730> cardio<00:00:21.119> is

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
if you don't know what hit cardio is

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.509 
if you don't know what hit cardio is
it's<00:00:21.600> basically<00:00:21.949> high<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.189> stands<00:00:23.430> for

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
it's basically high it stands for

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.820 
it's basically high it stands for
high-intensity<00:00:23.789> interval<00:00:24.420> training<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.380> it

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
high-intensity interval training and it

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.029 
high-intensity interval training and it
is<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.340> great<00:00:26.670> way<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.910> burn<00:00:27.539> fat<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.769> short

is a great way to burn fat in a short
amount<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.369> time<00:00:29.460> rather<00:00:29.939> than<00:00:30.060> doing

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
amount of time rather than doing

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.959 
amount of time rather than doing
steady-state<00:00:30.840> cardio<00:00:31.320> where<00:00:31.769> you

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
steady-state cardio where you

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.030 
steady-state cardio where you
maintaining<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> same<00:00:33.329> amount<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.780> speed<00:00:34.079> hit

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
maintaining the same amount of speed hit

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.930 
maintaining the same amount of speed hit
car<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.910> do<00:00:36.570> intervals<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.530> you'll<00:00:37.890> do<00:00:38.129> for

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
a muscle on the elliptical but that's

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.189 
a muscle on the elliptical but that's
enough<00:00:50.280> that's<00:00:50.550> another<00:00:50.820> video<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.930> great

enough that's another video it's a great

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.270 
enough that's another video it's a great
way<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.739> preserve<00:00:53.190> muscle<00:00:54.079> and<00:00:55.079> do<00:00:55.680> cardio<00:00:55.949> at

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
way to preserve muscle and do cardio at

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.819 
way to preserve muscle and do cardio at
the<00:00:56.399> same<00:00:56.640> time<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.870> I'm<00:00:58.289> going<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.590> show<00:00:58.770> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
guys how I approach hit cardio and I

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.450 
guys how I approach hit cardio and I
think<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.899> guys<00:01:04.049> gonna<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:05.280> been

think you guys gonna like it it's been

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.910 
think you guys gonna like it it's been
very<00:01:05.729> effective<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.210> me<00:01:06.380> it's<00:01:07.380> allowed<00:01:07.619> me<00:01:07.740> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
very effective for me it's allowed me to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.690 
very effective for me it's allowed me to
hold<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.240> muscle<00:01:10.280> while<00:01:11.280> I'm<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.670> my

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
hold on to muscle while I'm in my

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.719 
hold on to muscle while I'm in my
cutting<00:01:12.150> phase<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.950> allows<00:01:13.950> me<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.280> burn<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
cutting phase and allows me to burn a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.280 
cutting phase and allows me to burn a
lot<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.000> fat<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> short<00:01:15.960> amount<00:01:16.110> of

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
lot of fat in just a short amount of

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.130 
lot of fat in just a short amount of
time<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.770> can<00:01:16.799> burn<00:01:17.130> anywhere<00:01:18.090> from<00:01:18.330> 400<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
time you can burn anywhere from 400 to

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.410 
time you can burn anywhere from 400 to
600<00:01:20.070> calories<00:01:22.130> if<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.310> do<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> 20<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.090> 30<00:01:24.119> minute

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
600 calories if you do a 20 to 30 minute

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.510 
600 calories if you do a 20 to 30 minute
hit<00:01:25.110> cardio<00:01:25.500> session<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.100> burn<00:01:26.220> anymore

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
hit cardio session you can burn anymore

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.390 
hit cardio session you can burn anymore
it<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:27.000> depends<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.290> know<00:01:28.409> how<00:01:28.740> intense

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
it just depends on you know how intense

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.249 
it just depends on you know how intense
you<00:01:29.700> want<00:01:29.729> your<00:01:30.119> intense<00:01:30.420> moments<00:01:30.900> are<00:01:31.049> so

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
you want your intense moments are so

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.840 
you want your intense moments are so
like<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.770> mentioned<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.310> know<00:01:32.640> it's

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
like I mentioned you know it's

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.520 
like I mentioned you know it's
high-intensity<00:01:33.180> interval<00:01:33.540> training<00:01:33.900> so

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
high-intensity interval training so

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.730 
high-intensity interval training so
you're<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.970> short<00:01:36.780> periods<00:01:37.229> of

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
you're going for short periods of

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.480 
you're going for short periods of
intense<00:01:39.290> like<00:01:40.290> intense<00:01:40.680> running<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.250> then

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
intense like intense running and then

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.480 
intense like intense running and then
you<00:01:41.729> follow<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.600> with<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:43.380> minute<00:01:44.070> or<00:01:44.280> so

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
you follow that up with a minute or so

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.080 
you follow that up with a minute or so
of<00:01:44.899> of<00:01:45.899> low<00:01:46.140> intensity<00:01:46.619> or<00:01:46.979> walking<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.880> what<00:01:48.060> I

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
of of low intensity or walking so what I

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.410 
of of low intensity or walking so what I
like<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.740> track<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.030> run

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
like to do on the track I like to run

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.910 
like to do on the track I like to run
the<00:01:51.600> straightaways<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.470> run<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the straightaways I run the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.959 
the straightaways I run the
straightaways<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.390> edges<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:55.969> walked

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
straightaways and on the edges I walked

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.170 
straightaways and on the edges I walked
I<00:01:57.180> walked<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.630> edges<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.700> how<00:01:59.880> I

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
I walked the edges so this is how I

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.410 
I walked the edges so this is how I
approach<00:02:00.750> hit<00:02:01.049> cardio<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.880> before<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:02.909> get

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
approach hit cardio and before I get

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.810 
approach hit cardio and before I get
into<00:02:03.540> my<00:02:04.049> actual<00:02:04.799> running<00:02:05.070> and

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
into my actual running and
