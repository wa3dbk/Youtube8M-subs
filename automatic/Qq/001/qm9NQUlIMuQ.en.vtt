scanning the prints and not the

scanning the prints and not the
negatives<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.559> think<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:35.460> you're

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
negatives and I think you if you're

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.250 
negatives and I think you if you're
special<00:00:35.850> you're<00:00:36.059> archiving<00:00:36.600> photos<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.050> want

special you're archiving photos you want

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.780 
special you're archiving photos you want
to<00:00:37.440> scan<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> negatives<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.610> why<00:00:38.730> I

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
to scan the negatives and that is why I

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.420 
to scan the negatives and that is why I
picked<00:00:39.149> up<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:40.079> plus<00:00:40.379> text<00:00:40.770> scanner<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.280> is

picked up this plus text scanner this is

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.979 
picked up this plus text scanner this is
the<00:00:41.550> 8200<00:00:42.480> eye<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.079> there<00:00:43.620> are<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> number<00:00:44.370> of

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
the 8200 eye and there are a number of

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.270 
the 8200 eye and there are a number of
varieties<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.020> plus<00:00:46.410> text<00:00:46.739> scanners<00:00:47.100> for

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
varieties of plus text scanners for

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.310 
varieties of plus text scanners for
negatives<00:00:47.700> available<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.930> went<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.200> this

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
negatives available but I went with this

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.229 
negatives available but I went with this
one<00:00:49.530> for<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> couple<00:00:50.100> reasons<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.000> one

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
one for a couple reasons one is this one

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.930 
one for a couple reasons one is this one
supports<00:00:52.230> scanning<00:00:52.890> slides<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.730> some

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
supports scanning slides and I have some

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.000 
supports scanning slides and I have some
slides<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.329> my<00:00:54.449> father<00:00:54.660> has<00:00:55.500> around<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
slides that my father has around the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.740 
slides that my father has around the
house<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.399> wanted<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.730> get<00:00:56.879> those<00:00:57.120> preserved

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
house so I wanted to get those preserved

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.439 
house so I wanted to get those preserved
and<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.649> also<00:00:58.800> has<00:00:59.100> an<00:00:59.280> infrared<00:00:59.609> scanner<00:01:00.059> for

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
and it also has an infrared scanner for

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.420 
and it also has an infrared scanner for
detecting<00:01:00.960> scratches<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.920> negatives<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
detecting scratches on the negatives and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.979 
detecting scratches on the negatives and
I'll<00:01:02.550> show<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.789> how<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:02.969> works<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.600> minute

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
I'll show you how that works in a minute

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.050 
I'll show you how that works in a minute
it<00:01:04.439> comes<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:04.769> two<00:01:04.979> trays<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.820> one

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
it comes with two trays this is the one

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.399 
it comes with two trays this is the one
for<00:01:06.299> negatives<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.930> basically<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.380> just

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
for negatives and basically you just

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.010 
for negatives and basically you just
load<00:01:07.710> your<00:01:07.740> negatives<00:01:08.310> into<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.479> hopper<00:01:09.810> here

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
load your negatives into the hopper here

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.649 
load your negatives into the hopper here
you<00:01:10.320> snap<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.740> down<00:01:11.060> now<00:01:12.060> when<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.390> look<00:01:12.540> at

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
you snap it down now when you look at

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.030 
you snap it down now when you look at
this<00:01:12.810> thing<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.140> might<00:01:13.290> think<00:01:13.530> oh<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.830> thing

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
this thing you might think oh this thing

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.859 
this thing you might think oh this thing
will<00:01:14.430> scan<00:01:14.729> really<00:01:15.060> quick<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.479> just<00:01:15.659> push

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
will scan really quick and just push

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.149 
will scan really quick and just push
these<00:01:16.080> negatives<00:01:16.500> through<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.890> you're<00:01:16.979> done

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
these negatives through and you're done

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.460 
these negatives through and you're done
in<00:01:17.310> 20<00:01:17.549> minutes<00:01:17.820> well<00:01:18.030> not<00:01:18.570> really<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.110> fact<00:01:19.320> it

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
in 20 minutes well not really in fact it

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.200 
in 20 minutes well not really in fact it
takes<00:01:19.590> about<00:01:19.770> five<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.159> ten<00:01:20.520> even<00:01:20.850> 20<00:01:21.119> minutes

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
takes about five to ten even 20 minutes

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.359 
takes about five to ten even 20 minutes
per<00:01:21.509> photo<00:01:21.840> because<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.680> have<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.040> do<00:01:23.159> each

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
per photo because you have to do each

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.030 
per photo because you have to do each
one<00:01:23.610> individually<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.900> feels<00:01:25.320> very<00:01:25.680> nice

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
one individually it feels very nice

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.620 
one individually it feels very nice
because<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.430> has<00:01:26.580> grooves<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.479> know

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
because it has grooves so that you know

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.050 
because it has grooves so that you know
where<00:01:27.810> each<00:01:27.960> frame<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:28.829> you're<00:01:28.950> not<00:01:29.100> having

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
where each frame is so you're not having

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.450 
where each frame is so you're not having
to<00:01:30.210> try<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.540> guess<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.439> re<00:01:31.650> guess<00:01:31.860> where<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
to try to guess and re guess where the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.969 
to try to guess and re guess where the
scan<00:01:33.299> head<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.840> position<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> photo<00:01:34.710> so

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
scan head is in position to the photo so

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.039 
scan head is in position to the photo so
that's<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.250> nice<00:01:35.400> little<00:01:35.640> feature<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.750> at<00:01:36.930> least

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
that's a nice little feature to at least

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.289 
that's a nice little feature to at least
speed<00:01:37.890> things<00:01:38.070> up<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> little<00:01:38.490> bit<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:39.060> comes

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
speed things up a little bit it comes

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.319 
speed things up a little bit it comes
with<00:01:39.479> software<00:01:39.990> from<00:01:40.700> silver<00:01:41.700> fast<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.270> this

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
with software from silver fast and this

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.179 
with software from silver fast and this
is<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.869> 8.0<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.619> software<00:01:44.070> it's

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
is the 8.0 of the software it's

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.450 
is the 8.0 of the software it's
available<00:01:44.399> for<00:01:44.820> mac<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.479> pc<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.920> get<00:01:47.250> both

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
available for mac and pc so you get both

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.609 
available for mac and pc so you get both
discs<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.390> box<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.810> PC<00:01:49.140> version<00:01:49.500> gives

discs in the box the PC version gives
you<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> little<00:01:49.979> bit<00:01:50.189> more<00:01:50.340> flexibility<00:01:50.939> that

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
you a little bit more flexibility that

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.910 
you a little bit more flexibility that
you<00:01:51.149> can<00:01:51.360> push<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> button<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.439> have<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.649> load

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
you can push a button and have it load

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.710 
you can push a button and have it load
up<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.189> software<00:01:53.340> automatically<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.360> I've

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
up the software automatically but I've

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.050 
up the software automatically but I've
never<00:01:54.869> found<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.530> all<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.829> useful

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
never found that to be all that useful

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.819 
never found that to be all that useful
on<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.420> side<00:01:57.630> here<00:01:57.840> you've<00:01:57.990> got<00:01:58.170> more<00:01:58.469> options

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
on the side here you've got more options

00:01:58.829 --> 00:01:59.929 
on the side here you've got more options
and<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.009> know<00:01:59.100> what<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.310> do<00:01:59.430> with<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.790> would

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
and you know what to do with I would

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.789 
and you know what to do with I would
strongly<00:02:00.299> suggest<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:01.079> spend<00:02:01.290> some<00:02:01.439> time<00:02:01.649> with

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
strongly suggest to spend some time with

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.380 
strongly suggest to spend some time with
the<00:02:01.890> tutorials<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.490> come<00:02:02.729> with<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.180> I

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the tutorials that come with it and I

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.330 
the tutorials that come with it and I
would<00:02:03.899> go<00:02:03.990> online<00:02:04.380> also<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.950> try<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.100> find

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
would go online also and try to find

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.649 
would go online also and try to find
some<00:02:05.520> videos<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.000> really<00:02:06.090> show<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.420> how<00:02:06.600> to

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
some videos that really show you how to

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.869 
some videos that really show you how to
do<00:02:06.810> all<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.079> stuff<00:02:07.140> because<00:02:07.500> there<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> lot

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
do all this stuff because there is a lot

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.850 
do all this stuff because there is a lot
to<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.599> it's<00:02:10.020> really<00:02:10.110> important<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.770> get

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
to do and it's really important to get

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.680 
to do and it's really important to get
your<00:02:11.009> scan<00:02:11.310> as<00:02:11.520> good<00:02:11.760> as<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.030> can<00:02:12.239> before<00:02:12.660> you

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
your scan as good as you can before you

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.590 
your scan as good as you can before you
bring<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.110> into<00:02:13.230> photo

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
bring it into photo

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.990 
bring it into photo
shop<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.080> some<00:02:14.290> other<00:02:14.470> packages<00:02:15.040> but<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.880> does

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
shop and some other packages but it does

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.340 
shop and some other packages but it does
a<00:02:16.030> lot<00:02:16.210> of<00:02:16.300> basic<00:02:16.570> things<00:02:16.600> pretty<00:02:16.960> easily<00:02:17.110> like

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
a lot of basic things pretty easily like

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.710 
a lot of basic things pretty easily like
exposure<00:02:17.710> control<00:02:18.160> as<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.340> can<00:02:18.490> see<00:02:18.640> here<00:02:18.940> it

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
exposure control as you can see here it

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.140 
exposure control as you can see here it
also<00:02:19.900> allows<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.100> choose<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:21.640> film<00:02:21.910> that

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
also allows you to choose the film that

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.150 
also allows you to choose the film that
you're<00:02:22.240> using<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:23.050> it'll<00:02:23.620> it'll<00:02:23.830> color

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
you're using so it'll it'll color

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.820 
you're using so it'll it'll color
correct<00:02:24.580> based<00:02:24.850> on<00:02:25.170> what<00:02:26.170> film<00:02:26.500> you

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
correct based on what film you

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.160 
correct based on what film you
originally<00:02:27.490> shot<00:02:27.760> with<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.750> can<00:02:28.870> see<00:02:29.050> it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
originally shot with and you can see it

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.600 
originally shot with and you can see it
makes<00:02:29.410> quite<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.680> quite<00:02:30.070> a<00:02:30.100> difference<00:02:30.460> there

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
makes quite a quite a difference there

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.830 
makes quite a quite a difference there
especially<00:02:31.030> if<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.150> have<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.270> wrong<00:02:31.540> film

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
especially if you have the wrong film

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.600 
especially if you have the wrong film
selected<00:02:32.470> for<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.830> film<00:02:33.010> that<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.280> scanned

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
selected for the film that you scanned

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.670 
selected for the film that you scanned
with<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.150> has<00:02:34.840> some<00:02:34.990> nice<00:02:35.140> features<00:02:35.350> out<00:02:35.590> of

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
with so has some nice features out of

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.080 
with so has some nice features out of
the<00:02:35.740> box<00:02:35.920> there<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.310> infrared<00:02:36.790> scanning

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
the box there the infrared scanning

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.840 
the box there the infrared scanning
actually<00:02:37.600> works<00:02:37.840> quite<00:02:37.960> well<00:02:38.850> when

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
actually works quite well when

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.180 
actually works quite well when
conditions<00:02:40.540> allow<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:41.260> example<00:02:41.980> would<00:02:42.160> be

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
conditions allow so example would be

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.670 
conditions allow so example would be
cloudy<00:02:42.880> skies<00:02:43.240> like<00:02:43.510> we're<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.780> clear<00:02:44.440> blue<00:02:44.650> sky

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
cloudy skies like we're a clear blue sky

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.050 
cloudy skies like we're a clear blue sky
like<00:02:45.010> we<00:02:45.100> have<00:02:45.280> here<00:02:45.460> in<00:02:45.520> this<00:02:45.670> white<00:02:45.880> house

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
like we have here in this white house

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.450 
like we have here in this white house
photo<00:02:46.380> corrected<00:02:47.380> very<00:02:47.560> nicely<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:48.190> scan

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
photo corrected very nicely the scan

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.060 
photo corrected very nicely the scan
goes<00:02:49.240> through<00:02:49.570> it<00:02:49.870> looks<00:02:50.110> for<00:02:50.440> first<00:02:50.800> of<00:02:50.920> all

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
goes through it looks for first of all

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.560 
goes through it looks for first of all
gets<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.400> image<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:51.910> then<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.150> goes<00:02:52.300> back

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
gets the image and then it goes back

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.450 
gets the image and then it goes back
with<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.810> infrared<00:02:53.260> scanner<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.830> then<00:02:54.220> looks

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
with the infrared scanner and then looks

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.070 
with the infrared scanner and then looks
for<00:02:54.550> scratches<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.270> then<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.450> can<00:02:55.570> get<00:02:55.930> those

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
for scratches and then it can get those

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.900 
for scratches and then it can get those
scratches<00:02:56.380> out<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:57.130> only<00:02:57.250> thing<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.640> is<00:02:57.790> if

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
scratches out the only thing is is if

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.370 
scratches out the only thing is is if
you're<00:02:58.000> using<00:02:58.030> black<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.660> white<00:02:58.780> film<00:02:59.020> the

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
you're using black and white film the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.740 
you're using black and white film the
scratch<00:02:59.800> detection<00:03:00.400> infrared<00:03:01.180> scanner<00:03:01.450> thing

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
scratch detection infrared scanner thing

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.330 
scratch detection infrared scanner thing
doesn't<00:03:02.170> work<00:03:02.350> because<00:03:02.560> there's<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.070> lot<00:03:03.220> of

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
doesn't work because there's a lot of

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.490 
doesn't work because there's a lot of
silver<00:03:03.670> content<00:03:04.090> in<00:03:04.300> black<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.110> white<00:03:05.230> film

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
silver content in black and white film

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.530 
silver content in black and white film
that<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:05.740> don't<00:03:05.980> have<00:03:06.160> in<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:06.670> color<00:03:06.880> film<00:03:07.150> so

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
that you don't have in the color film so

if you're primarily scanning black and
white<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:09.910> wouldn't<00:03:10.570> go<00:03:10.750> for<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:11.050> more

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
white I wouldn't go for the more

expensive<00:03:11.610> scanner<00:03:12.610> with<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.260> built-in

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
expensive scanner with the built-in

expensive scanner with the built-in
infrared<00:03:14.920> scanner<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:15.640> just<00:03:16.300> bear<00:03:16.450> that<00:03:16.480> in

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
infrared scanner so just bear that in

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.720 
infrared scanner so just bear that in
mind<00:03:16.870> as<00:03:17.230> well<00:03:17.350> but<00:03:17.650> beyond<00:03:18.160> that<00:03:18.220> it's<00:03:18.670> a

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
mind as well but beyond that it's a

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.580 
mind as well but beyond that it's a
decent<00:03:19.060> scanner<00:03:19.300> it<00:03:19.510> works<00:03:19.750> quite<00:03:20.140> well<00:03:20.170> it's

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
decent scanner it works quite well it's

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.900 
decent scanner it works quite well it's
not<00:03:20.740> the<00:03:20.920> fastest<00:03:21.340> thing<00:03:21.460> in<00:03:21.520> the<00:03:21.580> world<00:03:21.790> but

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
not the fastest thing in the world but

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.030 
not the fastest thing in the world but
it's<00:03:22.060> no<00:03:22.210> it's<00:03:22.510> no<00:03:22.660> slower<00:03:23.080> than<00:03:23.350> doing<00:03:23.920> the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
it's no it's no slower than doing the

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.620 
it's no it's no slower than doing the
same<00:03:24.250> thing<00:03:24.520> on<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.760> desktop

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
same thing on a desktop

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.200 
same thing on a desktop
flatbed<00:03:26.440> scanner<00:03:26.770> and<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:27.580> get<00:03:27.730> much<00:03:28.000> better

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
flatbed scanner and you get much better
