00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.130
 everyone 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.590
 what's up all crazy gamers all crazy 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.660
 but because crazy because I got caught 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.110
 one thing I was looking for back 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.700
 very much very much time and in fact 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.920
 I'll see if you find one thing that 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.900
 before I did not look for this is here is 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.600
 perfect, many may remember 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.150
 of this game here we have is one of the 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.670
 rings the return of the king then as 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.129
 You see, I had it for playstation two 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.400
 things that like he dedicated me to the pc and 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.440
 I came good single PC as it was 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.690
 a bitch because I tried to look 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.570
 emulators but I've had a lot of luck or 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.120
 I have not really known how to use them and 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.129
 then on as the ps3 is not 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.050
 retrocompatible could not even 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.380
 play it right now unless you put 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.900
 there 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.710
 with everything installed on playstation 2 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:04.280
 so my only option was to find the 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.170
 PC version and I told you where I 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.220
 had sent a couple of games do 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.290
 nothing that was in this store in fix here 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.190
 you have it text that has a web page 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.880
 buy.com and it turns out here I'm going to make it 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.880
 every moment 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.190
 What do I have? Yes, ladies and gentlemen, you can 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.460
 do it right now 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.340
 yes yes 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.429
 and here is the game 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.859
 he did not avoid even removing the 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:38.719
 stickers or anything for three turkeys there what 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.060
 you can see that it has come out very 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.070
 all right 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.960
 and good the truth is that we will have to see 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.450
 see if it now installs without problems 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.579
 I hope we cross our fingers because 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.460
 there are games that good as facts for 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.740
 stress that does not go well but is activated 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.049
 the compatibility mode that the 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.390
 windows 7 so let's say that rule as 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.700
 the xp with which there is no problem 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.619
 receives something some other games like 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.720
 milks or two countries have very large 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.329
 very big problems for 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.429
 work what is the problem that this 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.970
 game is not money from the 90's or from 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.760
 2006 and 2005 this game I remember that 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.040
 is from 2003 so it's a big unknown 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.480
 if it can be installed or not but good 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.299
 case is that to see me from the pain 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.370
 let 's try it back to me has 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.400
 side did not want to buy online 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.799
 because it cost me 12 bucks plus expenses 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.069
 shipping that were 6 or so I've gone from 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.590
 spend 18 bucks to spend only three 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.240
 hours that I'm going to open it and here you have and 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.080
 the 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.940
 the manual with its things its characters 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.470
 we go the typical thing to still I am not going to you 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.560
 do the both and it's only to teach what 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.010
 what's inside and well here you have two 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.830
 steam rc pcc disks so here they go 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.140
 two discs and then another one more right here 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.540
 so 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.030
 I could install it as soon as I have a 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.290
 free time and good I am the truth that 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.060
 very excited because I put a lot 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.800
 hours to this I remember that with 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.740
 friends in cooperative mode I could 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.170
 start the god so good is 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.880
 curious who will call now have both the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.220
 PC version as the version of 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.980
 playstation 2 one thing that only me 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.630
 happened before with a couple of games that 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.320
 is the being the battle is one and it was 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.780
 star wars battlefront 2 some games that 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.400
 if I can I have them in pcpi in all 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.860
 platforms that are less obviously 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.020
 xbox that is another console just like 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.840
 play station then it does not compensate me 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.660
 have a decades version so I hope 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.489
 that you have liked this idea and I suppose 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.040
 that if it works well it will come in gameplays 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:44.540
 within very very little so nothing 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.540
 until the next
