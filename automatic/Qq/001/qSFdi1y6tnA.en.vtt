00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.300
 I'm excited but not nervous me 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.400
 We think we have a great team 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.529
 and a great car but everything else 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.029
 is new to me never a race in 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.500
 caught the night I am glad 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.689
 scary on the race but no 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.870
 I'm not just nervous 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.870
 excited 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.960
 I position myself here in 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.500
 Daytona for the first time a 24 hours 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.480
 run 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.250
 that's something very special for me 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.020
 Of course I tried this way 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.460
 thorough and professional as possible 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.350
 to prepare for the race 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.120
 I have many other drivers 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.440
 I'm proud to be a part of 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.809
 to be a porsche family 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.940
 for me it's an honor and such a thing 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.140
 top-class field I'll start 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.140
 do everything so that we do well 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.850
 first time here in daytona that is 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.159
 my twelfth year here in the turner 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.930
 at the 24 hours run my first time 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.149
 was my first race ever as 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.439
 porsche factory driver at that time has alwin 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.130
 springer timo bernhard and her 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.930
 inculcated 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.520
 if you are porsche with another 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.780
 collides then leaves immediately 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.670
 stretch and never come back 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.860
 I think the times have come 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.759
 little changed my first race here 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.310
 I won immediately 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.990
 2003 then even brought the overall victory 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.600
 I already had errors here 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.020
 This year it would be time again 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.020
 new clock
