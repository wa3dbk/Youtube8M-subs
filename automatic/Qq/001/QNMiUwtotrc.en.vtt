cardinal<00:00:21.119> numbers<00:00:21.539> are<00:00:21.810> very<00:00:22.680> easy<00:00:23.180> everyone

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
cardinal numbers are very easy everyone

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.450 
cardinal numbers are very easy everyone
learns<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.690> count<00:00:24.990> when<00:00:25.650> they<00:00:25.830> learn<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.100> new

fingers but ordinal numbers can be a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.340 
fingers but ordinal numbers can be a
little<00:00:51.749> trickier<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:53.190> use<00:00:53.519> them<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.120> tell<00:00:54.749> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
little trickier we use them to tell the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.079 
little trickier we use them to tell the
rank<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.239> order<00:00:57.239> or<00:00:58.159> the<00:00:59.159> position<00:00:59.639> of

rank the order or the position of
something<00:01:00.690> most<00:01:01.619> commonly<00:01:02.399> we<00:01:02.819> use<00:01:02.850> them<00:01:03.329> to

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
something most commonly we use them to

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.770 
something most commonly we use them to
talk<00:01:03.780> about<00:01:04.049> dates<00:01:04.680> or<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:06.030> order<00:01:06.570> in

sequence or in line for instance what do
you<00:01:11.070> do<00:01:11.310> first<00:01:11.940> when<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.840> turn<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.140> your

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
you do first when you turn on your

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.240 
you do first when you turn on your
computer<00:01:14.090> what<00:01:15.090> do<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.660> second<00:01:16.560> when<00:01:17.130> you

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
computer what do you do second when you

computer what do you do second when you
turn<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.520> your<00:01:17.760> computer<00:01:18.980> so<00:01:19.980> let's<00:01:20.010> look<00:01:20.520> at

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
turn on your computer so let's look at

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.290 
turn on your computer so let's look at
some<00:01:21.090> examples<00:01:22.400> there<00:01:23.400> are<00:01:24.680> suffixes<00:01:25.680> for

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
some examples there are suffixes for

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.690 
some examples there are suffixes for
each<00:01:27.300> of<00:01:27.600> those<00:01:27.840> ordinal<00:01:28.740> numbers<00:01:29.730> s<00:01:30.530> T<00:01:31.530> as<00:01:31.800> in

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
each of those ordinal numbers s T as in

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.970 
each of those ordinal numbers s T as in
first<00:01:33.420> n<00:01:34.610> D<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.560> second<00:01:37.560> R<00:01:38.300> D<00:01:39.300> as<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:40.290> third

first n D as in second R D as in third

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.750 
first n D as in second R D as in third
and<00:01:41.330> T<00:01:42.330> H<00:01:42.630> as<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.860> fourth<00:01:44.580> fifth<00:01:45.710> sixth<00:01:46.760> seventh

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
and T H as in fourth fifth sixth seventh

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.340 
and T H as in fourth fifth sixth seventh
eighth<00:01:48.530> ninth<00:01:49.530> tenth<00:01:50.430> yes<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.990> one's<00:01:52.260> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
eighth ninth tenth yes that one's the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.880 
eighth ninth tenth yes that one's the
most<00:01:52.680> common<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.600> instance<00:01:55.140> if<00:01:55.440> we're

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
most common so for instance if we're

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.590 
most common so for instance if we're
talking<00:01:56.130> about<00:01:56.580> a<00:01:56.790> date

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
talking about a date

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.469 
talking about a date
we<00:01:58.500> don't<00:01:58.740> say<00:01:59.100> July<00:01:59.729> 4<00:02:01.400> 1776<00:02:02.400> we<00:02:03.300> say<00:02:03.600> July<00:02:04.350> 4th

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
we don't say July 4 1776 we say July 4th

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.190 
we don't say July 4 1776 we say July 4th
1776<00:02:07.519> does<00:02:08.519> anyone<00:02:08.939> know<00:02:09.179> why<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.539> date<00:02:09.989> is

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
1776 does anyone know why this date is

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.770 
1776 does anyone know why this date is
so<00:02:10.409> important<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.159> me<00:02:11.340> as<00:02:11.519> an<00:02:11.939> American<00:02:12.560> maybe

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
so important to me as an American maybe

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.949 
so important to me as an American maybe
it's<00:02:13.930> something<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.740> can<00:02:14.980> look<00:02:15.190> up<00:02:15.400> later<00:02:15.970> we

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
it's something you can look up later we

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.480 
it's something you can look up later we
also<00:02:17.230> use<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:18.069> to<00:02:18.330> talk<00:02:19.330> about<00:02:19.569> position

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
also use it to talk about position

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.970 
also use it to talk about position
looking<00:02:21.490> at<00:02:21.700> my<00:02:21.910> list<00:02:22.209> 1<00:02:23.140> John<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:25.060> Mary<00:02:25.990> 3

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
looking at my list 1 John to Mary 3

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.699 
looking at my list 1 John to Mary 3
Henry<00:02:27.910> for<00:02:28.690> Sally<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:30.420> what<00:02:31.470> position<00:02:32.470> is

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
Henry for Sally so what position is

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.350 
Henry for Sally so what position is
Henry<00:02:33.330> Henry<00:02:34.330> is<00:02:34.720> third<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.850> ordinal

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
Henry Henry is third that is the ordinal

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.930 
Henry Henry is third that is the ordinal
number<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.680> how<00:02:38.980> will<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.370> keep<00:02:39.670> these

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
number so how will you keep these

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.410 
number so how will you keep these
straight<00:02:40.920> there<00:02:41.920> are<00:02:42.130> some<00:02:42.430> easy<00:02:42.640> ways<00:02:42.880> to

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
straight there are some easy ways to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.120 
straight there are some easy ways to
remember<00:02:44.130> remember<00:02:45.130> see<00:02:46.320> Cardinal<00:02:47.320> is<00:02:47.560> four

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
remember remember see Cardinal is four

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.199 
remember remember see Cardinal is four
counting<00:02:48.670> one<00:02:49.510> two<00:02:50.310> three<00:02:51.310> an<00:02:52.470> ordinal<00:02:53.470> o<00:02:54.209> is

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
counting one two three an ordinal o is

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.680 
counting one two three an ordinal o is
for<00:02:56.050> order<00:02:56.620> first<00:02:57.450> second<00:02:58.450> third<00:02:59.370> fourth<00:03:00.370> I

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
for order first second third fourth I

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.240 
for order first second third fourth I
hope<00:03:01.690> this<00:03:01.900> has<00:03:02.140> helped<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.620> make<00:03:03.010> the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
hope this has helped you make the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.460 
hope this has helped you make the
