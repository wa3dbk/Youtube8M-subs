00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
colors on there it's very important that

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.090

when you go to lay it on the skin

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.070 
when you go to lay it on the skin
whether<00:01:58.729> you're<00:01:58.970> using<00:01:59.119> on<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.570> face<00:01:59.780> which

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
whether you're using on the face which

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.680 
whether you're using on the face which

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.770 
difference
that<00:03:46.680> there<00:03:46.860> are<00:03:46.950> powder<00:03:47.280> based<00:03:47.670> paint<00:03:48.090> which

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
that there are powder based paint which

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.360 
that there are powder based paint which
means<00:03:49.140> they<00:03:49.530> don't<00:03:49.830> melt<00:03:51.050> now<00:03:52.050> the<00:03:52.140> upside<00:03:53.070> is

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
means they don't melt now the upside is

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.650 
means they don't melt now the upside is
that<00:03:53.400> they<00:03:53.580> don't<00:03:53.760> melt<00:03:53.910> in<00:03:54.270> a<00:03:54.360> while<00:03:54.510> and

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
that they don't melt in a while and

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.510 
that they don't melt in a while and
South<00:03:54.870> Florida<00:03:55.230> it's<00:03:55.320> really<00:03:55.620> hot<00:03:55.830> humid<00:03:56.190> so

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
South Florida it's really hot humid so

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.400 
South Florida it's really hot humid so
this<00:03:56.670> is<00:03:56.790> a<00:03:56.820> great<00:03:57.120> alternative<00:03:57.240> for<00:03:57.750> me<00:03:57.930> the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
this is a great alternative for me the

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.470 
this is a great alternative for me the
downside<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.370> that<00:03:59.430> they<00:03:59.850> require<00:04:00.210> a<00:04:00.240> little

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
downside is that they require a little

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.400 
downside is that they require a little
bit<00:04:00.630> more<00:04:00.900> water<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.290> activate<00:04:01.920> them<00:04:02.160> so<00:04:03.410> again

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
bit more water to activate them so again

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.440 
bit more water to activate them so again
this<00:04:04.530> is<00:04:04.710> just<00:04:04.950> a<00:04:05.070> damp<00:04:05.310> sponge<00:04:05.670> I'm<00:04:06.030> just

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
this is just a damp sponge I'm just

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.740 
this is just a damp sponge I'm just
rubbing<00:04:07.050> it<00:04:07.260> against<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.830> surface<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.750> then

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
rubbing it against the surface and then

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.800 
rubbing it against the surface and then
you'll<00:04:09.900> see<00:04:10.200> how<00:04:10.230> intense<00:04:10.830> this<00:04:11.070> color<00:04:11.430> is

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
you'll see how intense this color is

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.900 
you'll see how intense this color is

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
mix it with just a little bit on the

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.070 
mix it with just a little bit on the
same<00:04:29.160> sponge<00:04:29.520> I<00:04:29.760> want<00:04:30.330> to<00:04:30.390> mix<00:04:30.570> it<00:04:30.780> with<00:04:30.810> my

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
same sponge I want to mix it with my

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.650 
same sponge I want to mix it with my
metallic<00:04:31.500> white<00:04:31.950> from<00:04:32.310> Wolfe<00:04:32.580> look<00:04:33.360> at<00:04:33.540> how

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
metallic white from Wolfe look at how

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.140 
metallic white from Wolfe look at how
amazing<00:04:34.140> this<00:04:34.260> color<00:04:34.590> turns<00:04:35.010> up<00:04:35.190> so<00:04:35.700> that's<00:04:35.970> it

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
amazing this color turns up so that's it

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.550 
amazing this color turns up so that's it
without<00:04:36.540> it<00:04:37.490> this<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.790> it<00:04:39.000> with<00:04:39.870> mixed<00:04:40.350> with<00:04:40.530> a

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
without it this is it with mixed with a

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.030 
without it this is it with mixed with a
little<00:04:40.680> bit<00:04:41.040> of<00:04:41.100> metallic<00:04:41.430> white<00:04:42.740> so<00:04:43.740> you<00:04:43.830> get

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
little bit of metallic white so you get

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.450 
little bit of metallic white so you get
that<00:04:44.250> really<00:04:45.110> beautiful<00:04:46.110> pearlescent<00:04:46.920> blue

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
that really beautiful pearlescent blue

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.310 
that really beautiful pearlescent blue
so<00:04:47.820> by<00:04:48.000> adding<00:04:48.240> just<00:04:48.600> a<00:04:48.780> little<00:04:49.050> bit<00:04:49.200> of<00:04:49.230> that

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
so by adding just a little bit of that

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.659 
so by adding just a little bit of that
metallic<00:04:49.920> wait<00:04:50.160> to<00:04:50.850> a<00:04:50.880> strong<00:04:51.510> color<00:04:51.930> lake

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
metallic wait to a strong color lake

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:58.070 
metallic wait to a strong color lake
like<00:04:53.669> this<00:04:53.700> magenta<00:04:55.490> this<00:04:56.490> is<00:04:56.760> a<00:04:56.790> magenta<00:04:57.690> from

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
like this magenta this is a magenta from

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.210 
like this magenta this is a magenta from
the<00:04:58.260> bin<00:04:58.440> ein<00:04:59.690> by<00:05:00.690> adding<00:05:01.260> just<00:05:01.470> a<00:05:01.710> little<00:05:02.010> bit

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
the bin ein by adding just a little bit

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.580 
the bin ein by adding just a little bit
so<00:05:02.880> I'm<00:05:02.970> going<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.240> just<00:05:03.300> lay<00:05:03.690> it<00:05:03.840> down<00:05:04.050> by

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
so I'm going to just lay it down by

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.240 
so I'm going to just lay it down by
itself<00:05:05.070> and<00:05:05.690> its<00:05:06.690> really<00:05:07.050> intense<00:05:07.710> and<00:05:07.950> bold

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
itself and its really intense and bold

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.280 
itself and its really intense and bold
colors<00:05:08.820> but<00:05:09.120> once<00:05:09.360> you<00:05:09.510> add<00:05:09.750> just<00:05:10.110> a<00:05:10.260> little

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
colors but once you add just a little

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.370 
colors but once you add just a little
bit<00:05:10.740> of<00:05:10.980> that<00:05:11.010> metallic<00:05:11.669> white<00:05:11.940> it<00:05:12.380> changes

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
bit of that metallic white it changes

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.800 
bit of that metallic white it changes
the<00:05:13.590> entire<00:05:13.710> color<00:05:14.400> which<00:05:15.120> is<00:05:15.300> why<00:05:15.480> I<00:05:15.510> like<00:05:15.750> it

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
the entire color which is why I like it

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.680 
the entire color which is why I like it
so<00:05:16.020> much<00:05:16.610> see<00:05:17.610> how<00:05:17.669> beautiful<00:05:18.270> pearlescent

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
so much see how beautiful pearlescent

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.460 
so much see how beautiful pearlescent
that<00:05:19.110> becomes<00:05:20.270> so<00:05:21.270> this<00:05:21.540> is<00:05:21.720> a<00:05:21.750> way<00:05:21.870> for<00:05:22.050> you

right<00:05:32.250> on<00:05:32.280> top<00:05:32.669> of<00:05:32.850> it<00:05:32.940> in<00:05:33.090> my<00:05:33.240> even<00:05:33.540> it<00:05:33.720> might

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
right on top of it in my even it might

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.530 
right on top of it in my even it might
even<00:05:34.470> beat<00:05:34.860> up<00:05:35.040> so<00:05:35.610> what<00:05:35.820> you<00:05:35.970> need<00:05:36.120> to<00:05:36.240> do<00:05:36.419> is

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
puddle of water on top and work it

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.720 
puddle of water on top and work it
around<00:05:42.390> until<00:05:42.930> you<00:05:43.410> get<00:05:43.680> it<00:05:43.860> to<00:05:44.280> a<00:05:44.310> creamy
