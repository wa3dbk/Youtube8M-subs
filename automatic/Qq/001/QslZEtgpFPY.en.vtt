00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.780
 tell me 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.290
 very good today I bring you a video very 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.320
 short because I wanted to do a survey 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.939
 to you who see the video I have 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.430
 many doubts about what is who to buy 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.050
 I'm a teacher there, I'm worth 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.869
 three that you are seeing on screen in 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.239
 master and chosen master of samurai and 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.550
 master killer guide I like all three 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.350
 I love all three and I do not have 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.400
 pajolera idea of ​​what to buy me so 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.410
 Well I ask you a little help so that 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:48.250
 you are the ones who decide 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.900
 skin I buy myself I will also vote for 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.180
 course but my vote will be worth exactly 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.320
 the same as yours one vote one 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.350
 vote 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.350
 and well then I will show you a 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.260
 little the in game model or the 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.269
 model in the game so that you appreciate with 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.240
 a tad more detail these skins are not 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.540
 only seeing the splash art that having 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.780
 received master and a visual reborn is not 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.720
 very useful then I will show you the five 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.450
 more detail so you can choose better 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.620
 or maybe see the model of your cante 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.380
 decision 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.380
 lofalk is main who guides 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.860
 well here we have the master skin and 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.420
 killer is worth as we see it really changes 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.940
 a little bit of style happens to be a 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.490
 kind of samurai good not really a 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.950
 ice flavor but a swordsman to be a 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.580
 kind of ninja with a hood colors 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.590
 darker 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.320
 and well basically what I like that 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.440
 has a more ninja style they are not 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.920
 samurai warriors nor patxi nor anything by 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.420
 the style 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.009
 basically that's the style that I 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.500
 like it I like dark colors 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.990
 also and that's what it's basically 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.030
 it seems more like a murderer a ninja than 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:10.220
 a swordsman that's all 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.680
 and a blaine radio 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.990
 well here we have the master skin and 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.210
 I have chosen as we can see a saber 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.670
 Jedi laser or serious as you like 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.160
 to call 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.160
 and really the character's outfit does not 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.750
 I like it I find it a bit bland 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.640
 What I like is the lightsaber 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.280
 basically now you see that it is blue by 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.310
 example if we activate the e turns green 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.100
 It's always worth it when we do not have it in 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.740
 cool down vale 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.970
 and for example I can create the enemies and 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.970
 You see, listen to that 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.250
 when it hits the enemies it sounds like 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.060
 we hit with a lightsaber 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.310
 that's funny is great and also 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.260
 for example if we activate the veis changes 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.300
 of color that also has the effect of 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.550
 sound as if it were a lightsaber to 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:03.050
 defend yourself and that 's when you go in cool 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:04.330
 down live stays like this stays in color 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.250
 blue again 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.910
 It really is what I like about the skin 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.710
 the lightsaber that is very original 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.060
 the rest of skills is practically 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.420
 same 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:20.170
 let's go to the next corner 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.170
 astrium up in the student 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.090
 and finally here we have a master and 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:29.120
 samurai is to say that I love everything 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.790
 related to japan the samurai the 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.470
 mythology I love everything that's why this 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.950
 skin I like so much the only detail that 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.440
 I do not like anything are the boots 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.900
 they are not even boots are flip flops 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.140
 with socks or Sunday plan 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.819
 I also want German on the beaches or 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.019
 so be it 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.489
 that 's the only detail that I do not like 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.290
 the rest I love and a catana takes 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:55.550
 a helmet armor 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:58.280
 I love it or is it skin is 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.010
 my favorite in a way is that that is 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.470
 the problem that I like all three 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.120
 that I'm so hesitant good at 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.950
 description I will leave you 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.890

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.620
 your favorite as well as the links to 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.930
 the kings so you can see them 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.260
 the models in more detail with more 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.680
 Stop if you want and that's all 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.680
 until next time
