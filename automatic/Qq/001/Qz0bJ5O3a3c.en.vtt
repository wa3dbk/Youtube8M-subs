00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.320
 I was led to a video of the project during 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.540
 developing asaylum but at that time I still 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.549
 did not know what exactly we will work on 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.410
 Well, then I was told that this is Batman and 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:13.469
 it was wonderful news was me 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.329
 so honestly I she we have a lot 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.530
 work to finish everything we work 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.680
 over combat system 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.870
 Predator mode is now even more powder 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.030
 villains and - truly trying to produce 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.640
 characters and animates the city in the best 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.180
 tones and the game itself will be more in 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.350
 four times than arkhem city 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:36.030
 5 see even more than I think we 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.249
 also finalized some previous 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.350
 animation elements for example batman 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:42.899
 finished off the opponent in an interesting way 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.390
 a kind of pose we like to do this 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.969
 hit more cool we added such 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.859
 new items as a weapon you use 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.170
 can raise anything land in the same 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.969
 time to use objects around 2 for 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.219
 In order to break through the enemy's head 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.350
 or tear anything off the wall apply 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.300
 much more in this battle 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.609
 polishing naturally collected 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.009
 details in the animation that we create in 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.090
 separately I want to emphasize the transitions from 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.219
 video games 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.439
 and back this is what we did 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:12.570
 really good in the knight game 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.090
 arkhema and i think that people will be in 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.369
 delighted with what we see we have more 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.140
 spacious studio as you see we have 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.509
 very high caliber actors for 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.280
 reviving the characters we create 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.560
 for exactly me and my team happens here 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.539
 twice a week and my main role is 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.880
 make sure the guys move in 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.710
 right direction and this is so i'm very 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.560
 proud of them now we will hold a rehearsal 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.030
 one scene separately for doing this 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.340
 all for a grip 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.430
 movements and get used to the setting and in 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.990
 Mostly this is only the first part of work 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:48.240
 memory also a chance 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.929
 for cutscene depending on the scene and 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.850
 actor 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.640
 we have the ability to capture movement 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.979
 body and face against the background of voice at the same time 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.079
 and since the actors live in the states we 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.119
 do without the presence of voice acting in 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.859
 real time so we just 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.859
 connect everything after recording 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.149
 we use the voice of kevin conroy and 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.039
 play the recording in the studio and here we are 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.510
 grab you body and move it 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.670
 very cool as you see a guy 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.420
 who walks back and forth feeling himself 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.430
 batman 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.530
 these guys know what they are doing the way they are 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.840
 worked on throughout the trilogy 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.120
 so they surely know themselves 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.100
 leads batman as gordon moves everything in 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.230
 course what aspires we captured 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.420
 almost everyone and everything except 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.430
 crazy dynamics that you will see in 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.530
 fighting but we tried it earlier but not 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.540
 worked as a combat system in the end 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.760
 was getting sluggish so we tied up 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.860
 syakim was a lot of sessions when a guy 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.080
 hears a voice and he repeats the same 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.489
 string again and again until no 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.410
 running one hundred percent 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.690
 animators in turn will end 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.820
 the scenes and revive the movements of us no one 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.750
 limits we are awarded freedom in 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.610
 creating a model 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.160
 however sometimes I ask you to change something 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.989
 after creating a certain model 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.239
 it's natural sometimes annoying 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.290
 actors because you have a lot 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:07.850
 do again and win back the scene are 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.850
 difficulties working in this industry
