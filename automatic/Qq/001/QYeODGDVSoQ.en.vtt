you<00:02:23.560> made<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.800> pen<00:02:24.100> with<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.430> put<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.610> ice<00:02:24.730> down

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
you made a pen with and put the ice down

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.040 
you made a pen with and put the ice down
on<00:02:25.150> Dave<00:02:25.780> our<00:02:25.960> spawn<00:02:26.290> are<00:02:26.740> these<00:02:26.950> chicken<00:02:27.730> a

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
on Dave our spawn are these chicken a

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.170 
on Dave our spawn are these chicken a
cheaper<00:02:29.050> chicken<00:02:29.350> on<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.470> pig<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.910> I'll<00:02:30.970> try<00:02:31.120> the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
cheaper chicken on a pig so I'll try the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.370 
cheaper chicken on a pig so I'll try the
pig<00:02:31.450> first<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.880> if<00:02:33.880> you<00:02:34.240> move<00:02:34.420> them<00:02:34.690> they<00:02:35.350> just

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
pig first and if you move them they just

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.750 
pig first and if you move them they just
go<00:02:35.680> sliding<00:02:36.070> around<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:36.580> all<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.940> animals<00:02:37.300> a

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
go sliding around so all the animals a

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.460 
go sliding around so all the animals a
good<00:02:39.760> thing<00:02:39.970> just<00:02:40.180> they<00:02:40.420> all<00:02:40.570> thought<00:02:41.230> Hills

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
good thing just they all thought Hills

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.920 
good thing just they all thought Hills
ma'am<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:42.130> know<00:02:42.459> but<00:02:43.180> they<00:02:43.300> just<00:02:43.450> go<00:02:43.570> sliding

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
ma'am you know but they just go sliding

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.050 
ma'am you know but they just go sliding
around<00:02:44.290> so<00:02:45.250> this<00:02:45.400> could<00:02:45.520> be<00:02:45.580> good<00:02:45.730> for<00:02:45.880> keeping

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
around so this could be good for keeping

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.729 
around so this could be good for keeping
like<00:02:46.450> creepers<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:46.989> monsters<00:02:47.440> away<00:02:47.530> from

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
your house if using the right way we

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.460 
your house if using the right way we
just<00:02:50.320> spawn<00:02:50.530> those<00:02:50.800> in<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.070> landslide<00:02:51.520> over

having races and your friends so you

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.650 
having races and your friends so you

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
could set out lanes like this and just

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.650 
could set out lanes like this and just
go<00:03:01.900> look<00:03:02.890> how<00:03:03.040> fast<00:03:03.400> i<00:03:03.610> got<00:03:03.730> across<00:03:03.940> from<00:03:04.480> there

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
go look how fast i got across from there

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.580 
go look how fast i got across from there
to<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:05.670> bit<00:03:06.670> of<00:03:06.700> frame<00:03:06.970> rate<00:03:07.150> there<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:08.440> that's

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
to the bit of frame rate there so that's

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.710 
to the bit of frame rate there so that's
pretty<00:03:08.920> it's<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.520> pretty<00:03:09.760> cool<00:03:10.000> mud<00:03:10.239> guys<00:03:10.480> it

ice

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.990 
ice
underneath<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.080> glacier<00:03:15.230> ice<00:03:15.620> so<00:03:16.280> this<00:03:16.970> is

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
underneath the glacier ice so this is

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.500 
underneath the glacier ice so this is
you<00:03:17.660> don't<00:03:17.780> go<00:03:17.990> really<00:03:18.230> fast<00:03:18.500> on<00:03:18.680> this<00:03:18.770> but<00:03:19.580> the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
you don't go really fast on this but the

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
glacier ice is still above the norm I so

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.280 
glacier ice is still above the norm I so
you<00:03:22.520> do<00:03:22.700> get<00:03:22.819> both<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.240> these<00:03:23.780> are<00:03:23.959> just<00:03:24.020> going
