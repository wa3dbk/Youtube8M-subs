 1.29 if I know it ends on that island 1.28 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.679
 About five days ago this liquor temps 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.839
 that urged tea or dirty money valeter 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.160
 or this but this came out this information 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.690
 left before departure until the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.820
 update it was thought that this was going to 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.710
 go out in the ingot skins matches today 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.330
 a change of life so it's not worth it 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.510
 today with you this and nothing basically 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.460
 this is noted that it is the greatest 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.830
 that has been done so love photo 5 more 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.050
 popular are races basically be 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.520
 in the create as the sitting race 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.050
 and people play it, it's like the most 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.399
 fun no more than people do now 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.540
 I do not know if it's what you do so 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.300
 less what I do goes directly 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.399
 before he missed this and then I have already 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.770
 announced that it 's officially going 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.870
 to bring this in some opde and it does not say that 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.390
 next you say that one day 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.280
 hitting next things so they can 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.899
 make you very nutritious can put as 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.210
 what other additional things so that 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.420
 it's like what's already crazy 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.160
 ramp things that can deal with this speed bump 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.750
 well around races 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.710
 and this I think it would be like having 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.140
 new things and basically there is an area 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.360
 on the grand theft auto 5 map that is the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.790
 more punk than apparently script of 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.800
 game came out as if that area are 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.540
 room struggling because as it is there 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.040
 like everything formed with many parts 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.590
 grand theft auto 5 that they are 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.770
 done I can not put in it then if 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.500
 this is still nobody that is already made there 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.270
 six motor ramps and it is believed that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.790
 they will open it but that is not sure 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.320
 what but in this already yes that 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.390
 that you think is going to open and 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.130
 basically in credits then when by 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.899
 a lot of new things and that's what 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.490
 what do you think he does in this next 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.229
 update would be pretty cool 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.970
 that has as well as extinct moved with 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.340
 do new things and I do not know how to 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.110
 they have more things plus more things to 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.640
 be hitting without races and 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.350
 spread the fun that there is for 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.170
 now without big picture 5 until they open 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.940
 the casino I do not know how much fuck then 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.080
