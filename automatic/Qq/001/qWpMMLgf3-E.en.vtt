00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.250
 very good how we walk poor 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.740
 welcome to a new video today 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.370
 I bring a tip a tip to make 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.320
 macro photography but as you know the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.940
 photo and macro photography requires 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.580
 specialized objectives that leave you 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.119
 get a lot closer and they can do first 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.619
 flat planes detail of elements but 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.570
 clear to be able to do that kind of 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.779
 photography is needed 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.020
 objectives macro and clear a goal 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.630
 macro because it costs you at least 200 euros if 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.410
 you are not going to buy one here we are poor 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.100
 ok you're not going to buy objective 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.220
 producing euros just to make 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.400
 talca photographs then there are 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.650
 some lenses a kind of magnifying glasses that you 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.200
 let them bring closer the objective 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.930
 you can get closer to what it is 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.920
 photograph and so do a detail of 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.920
 that's so without more 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.500
 here I have the package I bought them 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.010
 one garlic masters in description 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.220
 I already have the article open here 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.220
 is it so 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:17.220
 are polaroid are these four filters or 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.550
 filters rings lenses are put on the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.310
 objective 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:29.290
 It is October 4 10 increases is not as 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.290
 the increase is measured but good with here 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.140
 + 1 + 2 410 are for a ring of 52 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.509
 millimeters 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.600
 I bought them for this purpose that 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.189
 I have that is a 50 millimeter canon 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.759
 for this camera that I'm with 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.140
 recording now and nothing simply the 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.020
 rings 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.590
 they are screwed in this diameter which are 52 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.590
 millimeters 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.130
 let's leave the goal here and go 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.130
 to open the package 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.479
 so there comes a 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.950
 an example of what we can 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.530
 approaching a frog's eye 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.870
 Here we have the very premium case 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.260
 very much like polaroid very well done this 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.980
 I like I love it and here we have the 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.980
 different filters 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.880
 here we have one of them in this case 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.850
 is the increase number a number 10 we go 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:39.260
 to see it up close as you can see 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.380
 a the lens is as well as bulging for 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.380
 outside 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.880
 to buy the goal we will only have 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.880
 that the oscar has threads 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.030
 and you have to give and you have screwed it would already be 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.190
 coupled and so we could do 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.190
 macroband photography look I am 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.060
 when you look at what you can do 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.570
 well and this is how these lenses work 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.270
 approach that let you take photos 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.120
 macro photography or macro video or what 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.920
 you want but now you will say but this is 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.200
 a go pro channel because you teach us 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.140
 some lenses that are for a camera 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.160
 SLR for objectives can not not 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.900
 calm the camera as you know the 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.790
 go pro camera you can wear lenses 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:51.430
 also and there are go pro adapters 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.560
 to this type of lens and if you can 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.910
 make macro video macro photography of go 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.910
 pro with these lenses 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.360
 you need this piece that is a 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.670
 lens converter this is placed here 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.200
 good and you put the lenses this and 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.690
 I fill you in another video that I have 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.970
 preparations 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.970
 good and now then I leave you 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:22.620
 some pictures to show you how much you stop 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:25.110
 bring these lenses to an object I will 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.320
 bring everything you leave to the camera 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.820
 and focus and you will see as in the 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.580
 macro photography with this type of lenses 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.830
 first he showed them a picture with this 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.470
 normal objective 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.700
 with everything that lets me get closer and 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.480
 then we will be testing the 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.920
 different 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.920
 the different lenses 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:09.040
 and one thing that we said I have here 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:11.800
 four lenses 10 April 2 and 1 according to the 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.020
 the increase this is the one that increases the most 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.390
 has and this is the least 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.700
 tell you that we can combine these 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.940
 lenses could for example have a 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.370
 increase of 14 if we take the 10's and 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.130
 we take the 4, we'll have a 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:32.650
 increase of 14 we can take things and 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:37.210
 have an increase 17 and it is more 4 14 plus 2 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:39.760
 16 plus 117 the curls we all go and 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.000
 we will have the maximum moment we are going to 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.000
 see him 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.970
 we already have the four curled lenses 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.760
 to the goal I 'm wrong I'm here creating a 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.350
 new objective from good lenses 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.129
 because this can make it lose 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.249
 much quality 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:04.319
 the rays of light have to go through 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:08.719
 many many crystals and this makes 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:08.719
 good they believe and throw 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:14.930
 and portability in the images to crist 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.689
 Antwerp 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:21.299
 the four curled lenses 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:23.639
 I suppose also a photo for you to see 

00:06:21.299 --> 00:06:25.740
 what you are going to bring 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:29.340
 with these four lenses placed at the same time 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.830
 and also for you to see the poor quality 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.400
 you do not notice it as much but if you 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.350
 loses quality 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.600
 good and here I say goodbye with these four 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.000
 approach lenses I hope that you 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.770
 I liked it and that I discovered you then 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.229
 that's a way of doing macro photography 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.970
 well without buying having objective purchase 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:50.180
 obviously if you have a goal 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:53.980
 macro is much better gives much more 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:56.200
 quality and good but good this is a 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.870
 an advice for us poor people who 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.030
 we do not have money to buy us a 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:05.030
 objective and good is a video more than you 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:09.460
 I teach here we have the four lenses 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.460
 dyad 42 and 1 all together 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:15.750
 and I hope you liked it, see you 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.750
 in the next video chao
