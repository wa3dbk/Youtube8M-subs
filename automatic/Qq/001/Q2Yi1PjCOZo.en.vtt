00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.879
 to 

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.460
 in this video I want 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:11.130
 explain how to make a curtain with 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:16.050
 recycled tapas very easy we will use 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:21.039
 cords or strings of any type 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:23.910
 It also imports cans lid 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.900
 recycled in different colors 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.150
 and a plier 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.670
 So what we are going to do is take 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.370
 a horizontal rope 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.070
 then verticals of the same size 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.990
 that depending on the curtain that the 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.900
 let's go do 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.440
 and we are tying the vertical things 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.340
 about two centimeters from each other 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.270
 let's make a knot 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.270
 simple 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.899
 and we tighten it very well 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.620
 and then let's give it 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.330
 one round 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.330
 to hold it better 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.630
 we press and in this way 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.200
 we will continue doing with all the rest 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.200
 parts 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.760
 the anchor and the height depends where the 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.790
 go to place 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.370
 in this case I already have 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.930
 all practically 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:38.040
 moored at the doors 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.360
 on this side I will put one more 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.340
 the last 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.850
 we will make the nudist 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.780
 and later we will go around 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.780
 ensure the best 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.330
 very well here we already have everything 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.520
 then we will take a cap we give it a 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.700
 little with your fingers and let's go the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.180
 squeezing with the pliers 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.680
 let's go putting on the whole string 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.680
 horizontal yellow for that 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.909
 another cap we folded it with our fingers 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.909
 little and then we're going to put it right away 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.769
 with the pliers 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.769
 let's comment 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.670
 thus 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.610
 and so on we will do with all 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.200
 the others until completing all the rope 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.920
 horizontal 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.920
 you can see 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.780
 and then we'll start putting the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.410
 caps on the vertical ropes 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.380
 in the same way we doubled a bit 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:56.460
 cabuya grabbing the rope and then 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.800
 the pliers we are lending boxing 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.740
 one corner of the lid / below 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.980
 the other 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.760
 and we look good 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.760
 her face 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.620
 place in the last one we tighten as 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.110
 can see 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.130
 ready then do very little to no 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.620
 it runs 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.270
 and so we will continue doing with all 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.320
 other strings 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.320
 up to the end 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.300
 in this case I am already finishing the 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.300
 last string 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.980
 this takes a little bit of time 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.980
 and patience but it's very good 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.510
 we put the cap on the rope and with the 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.709
 pliers 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.709
 let's go squeezing 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.070
 very well 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.640
 and then here it shows you an image in 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:00.000
 where it is collected then it is loose from 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.000
 powder 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:07.600
 I'll put another rope to pick up 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:11.790
 we count then from this other side I have 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:15.630
 the other other party collected 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.570
 and so finally we would have the curtain 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.270
 good, ready, friends , everything has been 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.660
 we see in a next tutorial and the 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.660
 bless
