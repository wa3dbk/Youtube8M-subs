00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 we return where professionalism is of 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.710
 home left back from elite sport a 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.200
 castellammare marco mauriello reed 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.759
 welcome on dop runners 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.019
 welcome to you from elite sport in my 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.940
 sale 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.550
 today we begin to glimpse a 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.590
 a new journey we begin to do a little 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.599
 then the specifications on the shoes 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.590
 we will talk from time to time about each 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.000
 template 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.310
 now let's make the presentation of a 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.800
 new model that the poor who arrived 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.539
 to the very flamboyant version 8 in 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.120
 so color a shoe too 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.410
 as aggressive as impact can be 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.760
 also match from my t-shirt to 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.960
 this house my choice 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.430
 we say that at this moment we are 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.649
 combined we hope to have no problems 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.210
 with very very flu images 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.429
 then returning the poor to the shoe 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.390
 8 we will be very quick in these 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:51.489
 explanations 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.909
 first of all I want to show also 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.129
 plow 7 as these two shoes 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.140
 they are tied by hand with the 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.460
 they alone were poor 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.739
 shoe that has had so much success 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.530
 in fact he didn't think well of 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.659
 keep the same one as or less than 7 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.530
 then ground support part e 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.720
 inter part of cushioning 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.950
 adding a small layer of hayes 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.860
 in more then a little bit of 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.800
 cushioning and more why pass 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.210
 from number 7 to the garden number 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.670
 mainly because it looks good 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.460
 from the upper the colors of the vii 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.290
 surely they weren't just dark ones 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.330
 from the upper this as 8 is much more 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.160
 aggressive the important thing is that 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.770
 right away the light is that in this one 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.170
 question there is no seam then 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.690
 we all have this heat seal 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.150
 involves lightening 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.770
 yes even if only a few grams of the 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.990
 shoe weight maintaining 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.580
 the amortization unchanged 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.310
 we have another detail 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.970
 inside perhaps this is not possible 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.970
 see well but has a fly system that 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.440
 combines lacing with the part 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.820
 bottom of the shoe then in the 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.770
 moment in which we go to 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.920
 fasten this shoe will be much more 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.259
 enveloping the foot therefore favors of 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.300
 more even if the least way 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.390
 circulation that is in the lower part 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.000
 of the last foot differentiation from the 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.310
 Plow 7 is in the back working 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.319
 seven wore an external helmet in 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.480
 some athlete can get some 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.300
 problematic as the heel was in 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.430
 hard plastic version sometimes 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.210
 it happened to them it could be split 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.130
 this is back again 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.530
 what was already available 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.600
 version 6 then a heel inside 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.050
 a capsule inside the 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.640
 romania of the shoe with a fit 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.590
 surely greater then all this 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.390
 comforted by an internal rent then by 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.140
 a part of material that should be wrapped 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.570
 the foot much much softer 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.970
 this will be more or less the reason of the 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.440
 our interventions therefore fast targeted 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.970
 in the explanation of the models of the 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.040
 the shoe is there but not the akita 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.530
 we recommend this is the recommend ad 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.080
 medium to high athletes than yours 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.580
 they want to use also for competitions there 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.410
 they are many athletes even of average weight 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.880
 lightweight that use it as a shoe from 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.810
 fund then to make us so many 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.880
 kilometres 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.800
 definitely a shoe that gives so much 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.870
 comfort and amortization a 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.040
 shoe of great tradition the bomb was 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.040
 8 of the nike
