answer that is yes to an extent super

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.560 
answer that is yes to an extent super
high<00:00:41.160> torque<00:00:41.430> engine<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.850> push<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.390> her<00:00:42.480> to

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
high torque engine you push on her to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.970 
high torque engine you push on her to
squeeze<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.079> or<00:00:43.200> twist<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.649> too<00:00:43.860> hard

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
squeeze on it or twist on it too hard

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.700 
squeeze on it or twist on it too hard
it's<00:00:44.579> gonna<00:00:44.730> take<00:00:45.030> off<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.289> don't<00:00:46.500> twist

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
do this little fine tuning adjustments

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.290 
do this little fine tuning adjustments
so<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:58.559> you're<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.770> middle<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.070> mix<00:00:59.300> go

same<00:01:05.289> thing<00:01:05.439> with<00:01:05.530> a<00:01:05.590> spindle<00:01:05.950> you<00:01:06.159> can<00:01:07.859> see

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:08.859 
same thing with a spindle you can see

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:09.899 
same thing with a spindle you can see
how<00:01:08.920> it<00:01:08.979> just<00:01:09.069> kind<00:01:09.219> of<00:01:09.249> takes<00:01:09.460> off<00:01:09.609> it<00:01:09.759> means

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
how it just kind of takes off it means

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.710 
how it just kind of takes off it means
you<00:01:10.119> got<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.270> be

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720

from<00:01:35.479> vinyl<00:01:35.720> over<00:01:36.079> to<00:01:36.170> something<00:01:36.350> like<00:01:36.470> this

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
from vinyl over to something like this

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.950 
from vinyl over to something like this
there<00:01:37.429> are<00:01:37.640> fine-tuning<00:01:38.390> adjustments<00:01:38.509> that

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
there are fine-tuning adjustments that

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.359 
there are fine-tuning adjustments that
you<00:01:39.020> can<00:01:39.140> do<00:01:39.409> with<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.590> spindle<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:40.220> the

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
you can do with a spindle and the

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.870 
you can do with a spindle and the
platter<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:42.009> it<00:01:43.009> does<00:01:43.159> feel<00:01:43.369> pretty<00:01:43.429> dang

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
platter and it does feel pretty dang

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.399 
platter and it does feel pretty dang
close<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.270> vinyl<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.929> other<00:01:45.079> thing<00:01:45.289> that's

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
close to vinyl the other thing that's

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.330 
close to vinyl the other thing that's
really<00:01:45.500> important<00:01:46.100> to<00:01:46.700> point<00:01:46.880> out<00:01:47.060> is<00:01:48.340> pitch

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
really important to point out is pitch

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.359 
really important to point out is pitch
drift<00:01:49.670> something<00:01:50.600> that<00:01:50.750> plagued<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.470> 3700<00:01:52.189> is

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
drift something that plagued the 3700 is

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.460 
drift something that plagued the 3700 is
not<00:01:52.729> here<00:01:53.030> it's<00:01:53.209> it's<00:01:53.539> just<00:01:53.869> not<00:01:54.020> here<00:01:56.470> so

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
not here it's it's just not here so

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.660 
not here it's it's just not here so
we're<00:01:57.649> up<00:01:57.740> this<00:01:57.890> beat<00:01:58.069> and<00:01:58.099> we'll<00:01:58.369> just<00:01:58.520> go<00:01:58.610> and

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
we're up this beat and we'll just go and

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.130 
we're up this beat and we'll just go and
use<00:01:58.819> this<00:01:58.970> all<00:01:59.149> this<00:01:59.299> visual<00:01:59.599> reference<00:01:59.959> and

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
use this all this visual reference and

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:08.520 
use this all this visual reference and
I'm<00:02:00.200> just<00:02:00.289> gonna<00:02:00.380> start<00:02:00.709> just<00:02:01.130> a<00:02:01.280> chirp<00:02:01.939> and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.440 

initial<00:02:09.530> release<00:02:09.769> of<00:02:09.799> a<00:02:10.009> 3500<00:02:10.759> I'd<00:02:11.120> have<00:02:11.299> been

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
initial release of a 3500 I'd have been

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.080

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.560 
had that kind of funny velocity thing
when<00:02:51.110> it<00:02:51.230> launched<00:02:51.530> where<00:02:51.709> you'd<00:02:51.860> backspin<00:02:52.340> it

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
when it launched where you'd backspin it

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.350 
when it launched where you'd backspin it
and<00:02:53.570> it<00:02:54.050> would<00:02:54.700> go<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.820> like<00:02:55.940> a<00:02:55.970> constant

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
and it would go it like a constant

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.699 
and it would go it like a constant
velocity<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:57.019> then<00:02:57.110> would<00:02:57.200> take<00:02:57.230> off<00:02:57.530> again

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
velocity and then would take off again

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.320 
velocity and then would take off again
it<00:02:57.890> didn't<00:02:58.130> have<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.459> feel<00:02:58.850> where<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.150> can

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
it didn't have that feel where you can

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.759 
it didn't have that feel where you can
feel<00:02:59.540> it<00:02:59.660> kind<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.870> slow<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.410> then<00:03:00.500> take<00:03:00.650> off

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
feel it kind of slow and then take off

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.440 
feel it kind of slow and then take off
in<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:00.950> other<00:03:01.010> direction<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.700> this<00:03:02.209> one
