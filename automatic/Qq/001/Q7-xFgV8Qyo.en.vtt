00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.100 
complaining about it I thought it was
fine

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
fine

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.910 
fine

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.640 
the other thing that I wish they could
change<00:02:03.460> and<00:02:03.729> I'm<00:02:03.790> sure<00:02:03.970> they<00:02:04.150> will<00:02:04.360> eventually

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
change and I'm sure they will eventually

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.969 
change and I'm sure they will eventually
my<00:02:05.650> cap<00:02:06.160> is<00:02:06.369> kind<00:02:06.610> of<00:02:06.729> big<00:02:06.970> and<00:02:07.000> so<00:02:07.330> I<00:02:07.890> there's<00:02:08.890> a

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
my cap is kind of big and so I there's a

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.590 
my cap is kind of big and so I there's a
comb<00:02:09.190> on<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.340> top<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:09.970> bottom<00:02:10.149> of<00:02:10.479> the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
comb on the top and the bottom of the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.540 
comb on the top and the bottom of the
unit<00:02:10.929> but<00:02:11.410> there's<00:02:11.500> nothing<00:02:11.770> on<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:11.980> side<00:02:12.220> and

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
unit but there's nothing on the side and

unit but there's nothing on the side and
there's<00:02:12.730> no<00:02:12.880> drawstring<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.110> when<00:02:14.950> you're

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
there's no drawstring and so when you're

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.590 
there's no drawstring and so when you're
blending<00:02:15.340> your<00:02:15.670> hair<00:02:15.880> you<00:02:16.000> have<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.239> keep<00:02:16.420> some

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
of the hair out in the front and in the

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.460 
of the hair out in the front and in the
back<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.250> for<00:02:18.910> me<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.570> cap<00:02:19.750> was<00:02:19.900> too<00:02:20.080> big<00:02:20.290> and

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
back and for me the cap was too big and

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.610 
back and for me the cap was too big and
I<00:02:20.530> have<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.739> big<00:02:21.190> head<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.510> cap<00:02:22.750> what's

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
I have a big head and the cap what's

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.070 
I have a big head and the cap what's
still<00:02:23.800> kind<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.010> too<00:02:24.160> thick<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.550> so<00:02:25.080> I've

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
still kind of too thick and so I've

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.600 
still kind of too thick and so I've
pinned<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.560> on<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.800> sides<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.160> little<00:02:27.190> bit<00:02:27.370> just

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
pinned it on the sides a little bit just

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.790 
pinned it on the sides a little bit just
so<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.880> it<00:02:27.970> stays<00:02:28.239> in<00:02:28.480> place<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:29.560> those<00:02:29.709> are

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
so that it stays in place so those are

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.890 
so that it stays in place so those are
the<00:02:29.860> only<00:02:29.890> two<00:02:30.190> things<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.580> I<00:02:30.640> really<00:02:30.900> you

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
the only two things that I really you

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.150 
the only two things that I really you
know<00:02:31.930> don't<00:02:32.200> really<00:02:32.410> care<00:02:32.590> for<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:33.070> I<00:02:33.100> know

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
know don't really care for and I know

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.490 
know don't really care for and I know
that<00:02:33.400> can<00:02:33.580> be<00:02:33.760> changed<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.180> that's<00:02:34.330> fine<00:02:34.600> but

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
that can be changed and that's fine but

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.199 
that can be changed and that's fine but
other<00:02:35.709> than<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.070> really<00:02:36.489> love<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.850> unit

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
other than that I really love the unit

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.390 
other than that I really love the unit
what<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:37.840> have<00:02:37.959> to<00:02:38.080> understand<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:39.010> like<00:02:39.190> I

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
what you have to understand and like I

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.610 
what you have to understand and like I
did<00:02:39.850> my<00:02:40.000> research<00:02:40.209> before<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:40.840> bought<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.140> unit

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
did my research before I bought the unit

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.190 
did my research before I bought the unit
and<00:02:41.739> I<00:02:41.800> saw<00:02:42.070> and<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:43.180> is<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.390> angle<00:02:43.540> balanced

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
and I saw and this is the angle balanced

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.720 
and I saw and this is the angle balanced
and<00:02:44.470> I'm<00:02:44.590> sorry<00:02:44.769> I<00:02:44.920> didn't<00:02:45.160> say<00:02:45.310> much<00:02:45.430> when<00:02:45.489> it

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
and I'm sorry I didn't say much when it

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.310 
and I'm sorry I didn't say much when it
was<00:02:45.850> it's<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.060> ankle<00:02:46.390> balanced<00:02:46.750> unit<00:02:47.019> so<00:02:47.170> it's

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
was it's the ankle balanced unit so it's

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.900 
was it's the ankle balanced unit so it's
a<00:02:47.380> little<00:02:47.620> bit<00:02:47.769> longer<00:02:48.010> than<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.370> urban<00:02:48.519> vibe

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
a little bit longer than the urban vibe

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.729 
a little bit longer than the urban vibe
that<00:02:49.090> they<00:02:49.209> have<00:02:49.420> but<00:02:49.989> shorter<00:02:50.350> than<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.590> new

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
that they have but shorter than the new

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.770 
that they have but shorter than the new
longer<00:02:51.160> wonder<00:02:51.430> they<00:02:51.579> just<00:02:52.360> put<00:02:52.540> up<00:02:54.750> one<00:02:55.750> of

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
longer wonder they just put up one of

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.770 
longer wonder they just put up one of
the<00:02:55.959> things<00:02:56.019> that<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.380> saw<00:02:56.680> when<00:02:56.829> I<00:02:56.920> researched

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
the things that I saw when I researched

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.090 
the things that I saw when I researched

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
singer coma and this unit in particular

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.979 
singer coma and this unit in particular
was<00:03:00.670> that<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.060> texture<00:03:01.480> did<00:03:01.630> not<00:03:01.780> match<00:03:01.959> that

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
was that the texture did not match that

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.900 
was that the texture did not match that
in<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.410> picture<00:03:02.799> and<00:03:03.370> what<00:03:03.519> you<00:03:03.670> need<00:03:03.790> to

understand when you buy here when you're

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.150 
understand when you buy here when you're
buying<00:03:07.120> here<00:03:07.360> here<00:03:07.570> that's<00:03:07.750> not<00:03:07.930> yours<00:03:08.230> it

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160

needs<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.370> be<00:03:09.489> manipulated<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.450> so<00:03:11.170> you<00:03:11.950> know

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
needs to be manipulated and so you know

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.220 
needs to be manipulated and so you know
as<00:03:12.579> soon<00:03:12.790> as<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:13.060> pulled<00:03:13.299> it<00:03:13.420> out<00:03:13.510> of<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.750> box<00:03:13.989> I

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.560 
sat down and I pulled all the curls
apart<00:03:16.540> so<00:03:16.959> that<00:03:17.110> I<00:03:17.140> could<00:03:17.380> get<00:03:17.500> back<00:03:17.709> volume

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
apart so that I could get back volume

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.080 
apart so that I could get back volume
and<00:03:19.570> then<00:03:20.019> today<00:03:20.260> what<00:03:20.680> I<00:03:20.709> had<00:03:20.920> done<00:03:21.130> I<00:03:21.400> did<00:03:21.850> two
