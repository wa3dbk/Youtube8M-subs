the transition from a front lever to a
Muslim<00:00:42.180> now<00:00:43.180> I'll<00:00:43.270> be<00:00:43.390> short<00:00:43.630> what's<00:00:43.780> the

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
Muslim now I'll be short what's the

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.800 
Muslim now I'll be short what's the
difference<00:00:44.110> between<00:00:44.350> a<00:00:44.530> false<00:00:44.800> grip<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:45.910> a

difference between a false grip and a
regular<00:00:47.110> grip<00:00:48.420> now<00:00:49.420> what's<00:00:49.630> important<00:00:50.110> to<00:00:50.200> do

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
regular grip now what's important to do

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.930 
regular grip now what's important to do
is<00:00:50.410> transition<00:00:50.740> from<00:00:51.190> a<00:00:51.310> pull-up<00:00:51.550> into<00:00:51.850> the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
is transition from a pull-up into the

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.600 
is transition from a pull-up into the
dip<00:00:52.180> which<00:00:52.360> which<00:00:52.930> is<00:00:53.110> the<00:00:53.230> muscle<00:00:53.380> up<00:00:53.650> is<00:00:54.250> 20

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
dip which which is the muscle up is 20

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.580 
dip which which is the muscle up is 20
months<00:00:54.790> just<00:00:54.880> to<00:00:55.030> get<00:00:55.120> stronger<00:00:55.510> it's<00:00:56.380> not

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
months just to get stronger it's not

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.410 
months just to get stronger it's not
really<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:56.980> false<00:00:57.250> cripple<00:00:57.610> or<00:00:57.700> the<00:00:58.120> regular

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
really the false cripple or the regular

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.600 
really the false cripple or the regular
grip<00:00:58.570> you<00:00:58.870> want<00:00:58.900> to<00:00:59.080> become<00:00:59.260> stronger<00:00:59.770> so<00:01:00.430> if

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
grip you want to become stronger so if

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:08.580 
grip you want to become stronger so if
this<00:01:00.970> becomes<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.450> easier<00:01:01.750> movement<00:01:01.870> for<00:01:02.230> you

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.200 

the<00:01:09.590> transition<00:01:10.100> comes<00:01:10.310> natural<00:01:10.820> as<00:01:11.000> you're

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
the transition comes natural as you're

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.400 
the transition comes natural as you're
coming<00:01:11.420> up<00:01:11.600> if<00:01:11.750> you're<00:01:11.960> strong<00:01:12.140> enough<00:01:12.200> to

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
coming up if you're strong enough to

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.530 
coming up if you're strong enough to
come<00:01:12.650> over<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:13.430> transition<00:01:13.940> comes<00:01:14.120> natural

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
come over the transition comes natural

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.940 
come over the transition comes natural
so<00:01:14.750> just<00:01:14.960> can<00:01:15.050> remember<00:01:15.290> to<00:01:15.380> keep<00:01:15.560> moving<00:01:15.830> your

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
so just can remember to keep moving your

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
wrist as you're going up it's not

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.060 
wrist as you're going up it's not
something<00:01:17.870> that<00:01:17.930> you<00:01:18.080> should<00:01:18.290> be<00:01:18.440> forcing<00:01:18.980> to

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
something that you should be forcing to

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.770 
something that you should be forcing to
happen<00:01:19.400> if<00:01:19.610> you're<00:01:20.090> not<00:01:20.120> strong<00:01:20.390> enough<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:20.660> go

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
happen if you're not strong enough to go

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.480 
happen if you're not strong enough to go
over<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.410> flicking<00:01:21.830> of<00:01:21.950> your<00:01:22.070> wrist<00:01:22.250> is<00:01:22.370> not

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
going to make or not make the muscle up

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.010 
going to make or not make the muscle up
as<00:01:24.580> you<00:01:25.580> see<00:01:25.790> my<00:01:26.000> hands<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.540> wrists<00:01:26.870> are<00:01:26.990> in

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
as you see my hands and wrists are in

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.770 
as you see my hands and wrists are in
sync<00:01:27.380> with<00:01:27.530> my<00:01:27.650> body<00:01:27.890> so<00:01:28.760> they're<00:01:29.030> both<00:01:29.420> going

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
sync with my body so they're both going

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.280 
sync with my body so they're both going
up<00:01:30.080> from<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:31.190> power<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:32.020> momentum<00:01:33.020> from<00:01:33.170> the

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
up from the power and momentum from the

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.440 
up from the power and momentum from the
movement<00:01:33.740> there's<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:34.400> transitioning<00:01:35.060> period

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
movement there's a transitioning period

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.750 
movement there's a transitioning period
that<00:01:35.540> takes<00:01:35.810> your<00:01:35.960> hands<00:01:36.710> from<00:01:37.010> pull-up<00:01:37.400> to

that takes your hands from pull-up to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.510 
that takes your hands from pull-up to
dip<00:01:37.970> position

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520
