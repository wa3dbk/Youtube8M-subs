prefer<00:00:24.270> is<00:00:24.780> a<00:00:25.050> whale<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:26.010> kind<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.990> like

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
prefer is a whale I kind of like

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.800 
prefer is a whale I kind of like
pronouncing<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.830> index<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.300> feel<00:00:30.780> that

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
pronouncing it index but I feel that

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.229 
pronouncing it index but I feel that
maybe<00:00:31.380> uh<00:00:31.680> next<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:32.400> the<00:00:32.550> proper

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
maybe uh next is the proper

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.710 
maybe uh next is the proper
pronunciation<00:00:33.710> it<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.130> military

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
pronunciation it is the military

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.950 
pronunciation it is the military

explosion<00:00:39.960> pretty<00:00:40.860> simple<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:42.390> little

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
explosion pretty simple is this little

explosion pretty simple is this little
cartoony<00:00:44.160> sort<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.670> whale<00:00:45.450> here<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
cartoony sort of whale here with the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.430 
cartoony sort of whale here with the
eyes<00:00:46.470> at<00:00:46.830> the<00:00:47.040> front<00:00:47.300> no<00:00:48.300> real<00:00:48.540> mouth<00:00:49.199> or

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
eyes at the front no real mouth or

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.100 
eyes at the front no real mouth or
anything<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:50.160> that's<00:00:51.059> fine<00:00:51.390> he<00:00:51.540> has<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.840> fins

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
anything but that's fine he has the fins

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.710 
anything but that's fine he has the fins
on<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.350> side<00:00:52.650> and<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.670> tail<00:00:53.910> back<00:00:54.150> here<00:00:54.390> very

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
on the side and the tail back here very

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.460 
on the side and the tail back here very
square<00:00:55.200> very<00:00:55.530> blocky<00:00:56.450> he<00:00:57.450> does<00:00:57.630> sort<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.960> have

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
square very blocky he does sort of have

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.950 
square very blocky he does sort of have
a<00:00:58.739> blowhole<00:00:59.460> here<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.420> because<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.810> how<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
a blowhole here just because of how the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.189 
a blowhole here just because of how the
pieces<00:01:01.350> go<00:01:01.440> together<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:02.280> kind<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.550> just<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
pieces go together it's kind of just a

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.560 
pieces go together it's kind of just a
coincidence<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:05.149> again<00:01:06.149> I<00:01:06.240> just<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
coincidence but again I just have a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.060 
coincidence but again I just have a
little<00:01:06.750> purple<00:01:07.290> flame<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.800> don't<00:01:07.920> have

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
little purple flame here I don't have

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.920 
little purple flame here I don't have
any<00:01:08.220> blue<00:01:08.430> flames<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:09.300> this<00:01:10.110> will<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.500> do

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
any blue flames so this will have to do

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.749 
any blue flames so this will have to do
the<00:01:12.930> tail<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.500> kind<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.800> move<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.729> a

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
the tail can kind of move but it is a

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.280 
the tail can kind of move but it is a
little<00:01:15.119> fragile<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.840> we'll<00:01:15.930> get<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.170> in

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
little fragile and we'll get to that in

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.810 
little fragile and we'll get to that in
a<00:01:16.530> second<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:18.560> but<00:01:19.560> yeah<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.340> move<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
a second but but yeah it can move just a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.240 
a second but but yeah it can move just a
little<00:01:20.850> bit<00:01:21.180> these<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.660> rotate<00:01:22.009> does<00:01:23.009> show<00:01:23.220> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
little bit these can rotate does show a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.760 
little bit these can rotate does show a
little<00:01:23.490> bit<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.670> green<00:01:23.880> through<00:01:24.420> there<00:01:24.929> which

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
little bit of green through there which

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.600 
little bit of green through there which
is<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.220> little<00:01:26.280> unfortunate<00:01:27.050> but<00:01:28.050> it<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.250> sort

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
is a little unfortunate but it is sort

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.859 
is a little unfortunate but it is sort
of<00:01:29.700> hidden<00:01:29.910> by<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.569> fin<00:01:31.229> at<00:01:31.440> least<00:01:32.660> yeah<00:01:33.660> just

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
of hidden by the fin at least yeah just

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.410 
of hidden by the fin at least yeah just
a<00:01:33.959> very<00:01:34.110> simple<00:01:34.350> little<00:01:35.340> whale<00:01:36.319> no<00:01:37.319> big

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
a very simple little whale no big

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.830 
a very simple little whale no big
exciting<00:01:39.420> things<00:01:39.810> here<00:01:40.190> so<00:01:41.190> let's<00:01:42.179> transform

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
exciting things here so let's transform

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.169 
exciting things here so let's transform
it<00:01:43.350> now<00:01:44.280> we're<00:01:44.399> going<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.580> do<00:01:44.670> something<00:01:45.149> a

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
it now we're going to do something a

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:46.609 
it now we're going to do something a
little<00:01:45.330> bit<00:01:45.569> different<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.140> Indexes

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
little bit different with Indexes

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.889 
little bit different with Indexes
transformation<00:01:47.459> here<00:01:47.819> we're<00:01:48.209> first<00:01:48.450> going<00:01:48.750> to

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
transformation here we're first going to

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.469 
transformation here we're first going to
transform<00:01:49.349> it<00:01:49.530> into<00:01:49.740> his<00:01:50.190> initial<00:01:50.640> robot<00:01:50.970> mode

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
transform it into his initial robot mode

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.350 
transform it into his initial robot mode
what<00:01:52.200> he<00:01:52.349> transforms<00:01:52.920> from<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.640> into

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
what he transforms from this into

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.770 
what he transforms from this into
without<00:01:55.020> taking<00:01:55.440> anything<00:01:55.860> off<00:01:56.250> at<00:01:56.759> all<00:01:57.209> this

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
without taking anything off at all this

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.770 
without taking anything off at all this
is<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.410> initial<00:01:58.679> robot<00:01:59.429> mode<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.569> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
is the initial robot mode and it's a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.990 
is the initial robot mode and it's a
little<00:02:01.020> more<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.470> guess<00:02:02.000> perfect

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
little more I guess perfect

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.249 
little more I guess perfect
transformation<00:02:03.330> because<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.929> don't<00:02:04.080> have<00:02:04.140> to

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
transformation because you don't have to

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.559 
transformation because you don't have to
take<00:02:04.380> anything<00:02:04.619> off<00:02:04.830> and<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.490> fine<00:02:05.880> but

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
take anything off and that is fine but

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.230 
take anything off and that is fine but
once<00:02:06.869> we<00:02:07.020> get<00:02:07.140> there<00:02:07.440> I'll<00:02:07.649> show<00:02:07.709> you<00:02:08.340> how<00:02:08.940> I

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
once we get there I'll show you how I

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.660 
once we get there I'll show you how I
like<00:02:09.630> transforming<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.590> taking<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.370> bit<00:02:11.550> off

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
like transforming it taking a bit off

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.160 
like transforming it taking a bit off
and<00:02:11.910> turning<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.209> into<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.420> weapon<00:02:12.660> just<00:02:13.050> to

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
and turning it into a weapon just to

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.430 
and turning it into a weapon just to
make<00:02:13.319> him<00:02:13.530> look<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.830> little<00:02:14.040> bit<00:02:14.280> cooler<00:02:14.819> but

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
make him look a little bit cooler but

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.510 
make him look a little bit cooler but
let's<00:02:16.440> just<00:02:16.620> do<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.890> perfect<00:02:17.099> transformation

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
let's just do the perfect transformation

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.030 
let's just do the perfect transformation
here<00:02:18.090> first<00:02:18.750> what<00:02:19.410> you're<00:02:19.500> going<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.739> want<00:02:19.980> to

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
here first what you're going to want to

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.870 
here first what you're going to want to
do<00:02:20.900> strain<00:02:21.900> out<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.050> tail<00:02:22.260> first<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.880> pull

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
do strain out the tail first and pull

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.550 
do strain out the tail first and pull
this<00:02:24.000> piece<00:02:24.239> out<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:27.410> pull<00:02:28.410> this

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
this piece out like that and pull this

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.390 
this piece out like that and pull this
out<00:02:28.710> just<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.820> so<00:02:31.070> same<00:02:32.070> on<00:02:32.370> this<00:02:32.730> side

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
out just like so same on this side

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.580 
out just like so same on this side
and<00:02:34.409> straighten<00:02:35.409> these<00:02:35.560> pieces<00:02:35.890> out<00:02:37.590> just

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
and straighten these pieces out just

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.890 
and straighten these pieces out just
like<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:39.730> bottom<00:02:40.120> side<00:02:40.299> is<00:02:40.599> more<00:02:40.810> or

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
like that the bottom side is more or

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.490 
like that the bottom side is more or
less<00:02:40.959> mirrored<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:42.159> we're<00:02:42.580> going<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.879> do<00:02:43.500> the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
less mirrored so we're going to do the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.740 
less mirrored so we're going to do the
same<00:02:45.420> down<00:02:46.420> here

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.069 

wiggle<00:02:49.750> these<00:02:49.870> pieces<00:02:50.110> out<00:02:52.860> bring<00:02:53.860> them<00:02:53.950> up

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
wiggle these pieces out bring them up

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.000 
wiggle these pieces out bring them up
and<00:02:56.790> there<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:57.879> go

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
and there you go

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.390 
and there you go
next<00:03:01.049> rotate<00:03:02.049> these<00:03:02.440> fins<00:03:02.769> here<00:03:04.379> bring<00:03:05.400> the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
next rotate these fins here bring the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.119 
next rotate these fins here bring the
limbs<00:03:06.670> down<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:10.120> whole<00:03:10.359> section

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
limbs down and this whole section

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.670 
limbs down and this whole section
rotates<00:03:12.129> around<00:03:12.400> like<00:03:12.790> that<00:03:13.260> then<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.470> tail

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
rotates around like that then the tail

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.309 
rotates around like that then the tail
has<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.010> little<00:03:15.310> hinge<00:03:15.910> here<00:03:16.299> again<00:03:16.930> this<00:03:17.109> is<00:03:17.290> a

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
has a little hinge here again this is a

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.289 
has a little hinge here again this is a
little<00:03:17.530> fragile<00:03:17.769> and<00:03:18.250> this<00:03:18.790> is<00:03:19.000> one<00:03:19.150> of<00:03:19.239> the

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
little fragile and this is one of the

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.809 
little fragile and this is one of the
main<00:03:19.510> reasons<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:20.049> changed<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:21.340> robot<00:03:21.670> mode

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
main reasons I changed the robot mode

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.479 
main reasons I changed the robot mode
but<00:03:22.150> we'll<00:03:22.269> get<00:03:22.420> to<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.569> in<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:23.049> bit

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
but we'll get to that in a bit

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.880 
but we'll get to that in a bit
then<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:24.670> rotate<00:03:25.180> this<00:03:25.739> like<00:03:26.739> so<00:03:28.650> bring<00:03:29.650> this

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
then you rotate this like so bring this

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.880 
then you rotate this like so bring this
back<00:03:30.659> just<00:03:31.659> like<00:03:31.780> that<00:03:31.840> and<00:03:32.730> bring<00:03:33.730> these<00:03:33.879> down

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
back just like that and bring these down

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.360 
back just like that and bring these down
those<00:03:35.890> will<00:03:36.010> become<00:03:36.099> the<00:03:36.310> legs<00:03:36.569> now<00:03:37.569> this

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
those will become the legs now this

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:48.020 
those will become the legs now this
comes<00:03:39.370> up<00:03:40.950> rotates<00:03:41.950> around<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:45.630> comes<00:03:46.630> back

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
comes up rotates around and comes back

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.720 
comes up rotates around and comes back
then<00:03:49.030> these<00:03:49.269> come<00:03:49.540> down<00:03:49.810> like<00:03:50.139> this<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:53.730> there

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
then these come down like this and there

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:02.369 
then these come down like this and there
is<00:03:55.120> an<00:03:55.690> X<00:03:56.019> in<00:03:56.230> his<00:03:57.129> initial<00:03:57.819> robot<00:03:58.720> mode<00:04:01.379> so

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
is an X in his initial robot mode so

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.640 
is an X in his initial robot mode so
here<00:04:02.560> is<00:04:02.680> indexes<00:04:03.400> initial<00:04:04.239> robot<00:04:04.989> mode<00:04:05.290> and

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
here is indexes initial robot mode and

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.819 
here is indexes initial robot mode and
it's<00:04:06.639> perfectly<00:04:07.269> fine<00:04:07.480> I<00:04:07.810> think<00:04:08.379> it's<00:04:08.709> got

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
it's perfectly fine I think it's got

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.170 
it's perfectly fine I think it's got
this<00:04:08.889> little<00:04:09.099> bit<00:04:09.250> jutting<00:04:09.579> out<00:04:09.639> the<00:04:09.819> front

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
this little bit jutting out the front

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.300 
this little bit jutting out the front
but<00:04:10.480> that's<00:04:10.629> sort<00:04:11.290> of<00:04:11.379> compensated<00:04:12.099> by<00:04:12.250> this

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
but that's sort of compensated by this

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.150 
but that's sort of compensated by this
bit<00:04:12.609> jutting<00:04:12.910> out<00:04:12.970> at<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.359> back<00:04:13.919> gives<00:04:14.919> him<00:04:15.069> an

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
bit jutting out at the back gives him an

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.339 
bit jutting out at the back gives him an
interesting<00:04:15.970> silhouette<00:04:16.239> to<00:04:16.870> say<00:04:17.019> the<00:04:17.169> least

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
interesting silhouette to say the least

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.770 
interesting silhouette to say the least
at<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:18.190> back<00:04:18.310> here<00:04:18.609> he<00:04:18.789> does<00:04:18.970> have<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.419> tail

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
at the back here he does have the tail

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.089 
at the back here he does have the tail
and<00:04:20.160> that<00:04:21.160> is<00:04:21.370> just<00:04:21.789> fine<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.960> really<00:04:23.229> like<00:04:23.440> that

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
and that is just fine I really like that

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.689 
and that is just fine I really like that
however<00:04:24.849> this<00:04:25.599> bit<00:04:25.900> here<00:04:26.320> is<00:04:26.530> just<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.490> little

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
however this bit here is just a little

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.939 
however this bit here is just a little
fragile<00:04:27.910> just<00:04:28.510> being<00:04:28.720> stubbed<00:04:29.199> friction<00:04:29.680> and

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
fragile just being stubbed friction and

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.120 
fragile just being stubbed friction and
a<00:04:30.130> jumper<00:04:30.520> plate<00:04:30.760> and<00:04:31.530> so<00:04:32.530> is<00:04:32.680> this<00:04:32.860> bit<00:04:33.099> just

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
a jumper plate and so is this bit just

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.510 
a jumper plate and so is this bit just
coming<00:04:33.669> off<00:04:33.789> all<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.210> time<00:04:34.389> so<00:04:34.870> I<00:04:35.110> decided<00:04:35.740> to

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
coming off all the time so I decided to

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.020 
coming off all the time so I decided to
give<00:04:37.120> him<00:04:38.220> this<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.729> replace<00:04:39.880> it<00:04:41.400> it<00:04:42.400> has<00:04:42.669> no

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
give him this to replace it it has no

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.940 
give him this to replace it it has no
rotation<00:04:43.659> it<00:04:44.050> has<00:04:44.320> these<00:04:44.409> two<00:04:44.560> little<00:04:44.740> pegs

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
rotation it has these two little pegs

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.429 
rotation it has these two little pegs
here<00:04:45.250> and<00:04:45.460> it<00:04:45.700> has<00:04:45.909> these<00:04:46.180> missiles

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:47.439 
here and it has these missiles

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:51.989 
here and it has these missiles
torpedoes<00:04:48.389> right<00:04:49.389> there<00:04:50.550> this<00:04:51.550> is<00:04:51.699> where<00:04:51.879> his

00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:51.999 
torpedoes right there this is where his

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:55.409 
torpedoes right there this is where his
name<00:04:52.179> index<00:04:52.719> comes<00:04:53.379> from<00:04:53.679> and<00:04:53.949> it<00:04:54.819> just<00:04:55.119> plugs

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
name index comes from and it just plugs

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.139 
name index comes from and it just plugs
in<00:04:55.629> under<00:04:56.050> here<00:04:56.469> underneath<00:04:57.369> the<00:04:57.610> arm<00:04:57.789> and

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:58.149 
in under here underneath the arm and

00:04:58.149 --> 00:05:01.019 
in under here underneath the arm and
he's<00:04:58.269> got<00:04:58.479> this<00:04:58.659> cool<00:04:59.129> missile<00:05:00.129> weapon<00:05:00.489> the

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:01.029 
he's got this cool missile weapon the

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:02.339 
he's got this cool missile weapon the
only<00:05:01.209> problem<00:05:01.479> with<00:05:01.539> this<00:05:01.689> is<00:05:01.929> now<00:05:02.080> he's<00:05:02.229> got

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
only problem with this is now he's got

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:06.029 
only problem with this is now he's got
this<00:05:02.439> huge<00:05:02.769> gap<00:05:03.099> in<00:05:03.129> his<00:05:03.429> back<00:05:03.699> so<00:05:04.659> to<00:05:05.499> fix<00:05:05.709> that

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
this huge gap in his back so to fix that

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.179 
this huge gap in his back so to fix that
I<00:05:06.360> just<00:05:07.360> rotated<00:05:07.779> this<00:05:07.959> whole<00:05:08.139> section<00:05:08.589> around

00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:09.189 
I just rotated this whole section around

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:15.409 
I just rotated this whole section around
and<00:05:10.589> rotated<00:05:11.589> this<00:05:11.769> whole<00:05:11.949> section<00:05:12.309> around

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:23.609 

and<00:05:17.759> here<00:05:18.759> is<00:05:19.289> his<00:05:20.289> new<00:05:20.699> robot<00:05:21.699> mode<00:05:21.999> and<00:05:22.619> I

00:05:23.609 --> 00:05:23.619 
and here is his new robot mode and I

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:25.949 
and here is his new robot mode and I
just<00:05:23.829> think<00:05:23.919> this<00:05:24.159> looks<00:05:24.519> a<00:05:24.729> lot<00:05:25.329> better

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:25.959 
just think this looks a lot better

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:29.399 
just think this looks a lot better
that<00:05:26.259> piece<00:05:26.649> jutting<00:05:27.129> out<00:05:27.309> of<00:05:27.719> his<00:05:28.719> back<00:05:29.019> now

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
that piece jutting out of his back now

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.850 
that piece jutting out of his back now
fills<00:05:29.800> in<00:05:29.979> the<00:05:30.099> torso<00:05:31.259> the<00:05:32.259> only<00:05:32.469> real<00:05:32.649> problem

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
fills in the torso the only real problem

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.589 
fills in the torso the only real problem
is<00:05:33.189> that<00:05:33.219> the<00:05:33.459> undersides<00:05:34.029> of<00:05:34.119> the<00:05:34.239> studs<00:05:34.479> are

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
is that the undersides of the studs are

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.899 
is that the undersides of the studs are
showing<00:05:34.899> there<00:05:35.169> but<00:05:35.949> overall<00:05:36.279> I<00:05:36.429> think<00:05:36.639> it's

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
showing there but overall I think it's

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.479 
showing there but overall I think it's
an<00:05:37.029> improvement<00:05:37.439> and<00:05:38.439> I<00:05:38.529> really<00:05:38.800> do<00:05:38.979> like<00:05:39.219> the

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:39.489 
an improvement and I really do like the

00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:43.619 
an improvement and I really do like the

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:43.629 
missile weapon there I went with a green

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:45.809 
missile weapon there I went with a green
