00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.840
 hello how about movie garage friends we go 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:09.679
 to talk about the premieres of 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.940
 this weekend one of them also 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.320
 a long-awaited premiere 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.360
 especially for people who like 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.750
 the animation cinema is my villain 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.939
 Favorite 2 directed again grew up 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.560
 again because we repeat to the 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.380
 directors of the first part of me 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.519
 favorite villain 'pierre coffin and chris 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.320
 renaud they are in a few words then 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.100
 yes continuing the story we had 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.900
 had in the first part of this ultra 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.790
 villain in which they concentrate 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.550
 virtually all all 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.320
 defects all the all traits and 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.450
 the characteristics that one finishes 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.950
 considering how despicable it is that it is 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.080
 actually one of the words that 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.080
 they are arranged in the original name 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.850
 in English of explained in me and from 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.610
 from there they end up building everything 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.740
 speech in which not only 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.930
 reaffirms that personal personality 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.300
 but the individual personality I want 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.640
 say is so valid 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.570
 like those of others that one has to be 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.030
 who is 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.720
 obviously always pulling towards 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.220
 the best according to other types of standards 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.320
 everyone deserves to be loved in 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.409
 few words is a little speech 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.240
 that we had in the first part in this 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.640
 second part that speech extends 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.720
 a little but now I think they are a 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.700
 little more focused on building us a 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.190
 family around this person that 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.280
 she was somehow as healed 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.700
 as drawn from that world of evil and 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.160
 of darkness and begin to insert another 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.380
 type of characters to play rather to 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.570
 family formation to try to 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.270
 returning the speech is a bit to what 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.340
 we had already in the cinema of the 80s in the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.530
 commercial cinema of the 80s this defense or 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.420
 family tranza here there is not a 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.960
 defense to which there is an allegation towards 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.580
 try to reintegrate society or 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.909
 world at least to this character 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.220
 just starting from there as 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.600
 movie I do not want to be scared is not 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.460
 not boring at all 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.380
 a speech also drawn in a way 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.760
 very superficial practically unspoken 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.650
 but the movie is very entertaining 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.750
 the movie is very funny has a 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.090
 devilish speed the gags go 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.770
 falling one after the other and although if 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.620
 the approach is a bit more 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.080
 crazy that in the first one that is a 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.239
 defect that the sequels of 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.280
 animated movies not necessarily 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.200
 all pixar is careful not to 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.510
 enlarge of an inflate on that side 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.959
 is if it comes to rub a little and the 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.390
 extravagance and there are sequences that one 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.489
 I would say we did not need them to be so 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.280
 big maybe the output should have been 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.569
 worked a little bit more on script for 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.580
 let us breathe instead of giving 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.019
 these these outcomes so 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.390
 grandiloquent not talking about 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.850
 outcomes in the film practically 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.470
 ends with a sequence of action 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.000
 the one that is involved gruwell the 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.160
 character that we met in the first 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.049
 part and all the others that are 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.670
 new characters except children who 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.549
 they are also out there and that 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.190
 they also receive their renewal is a 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.140
 action sequence a fight in form 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.380
 between the villain 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.300
 and let's say there's a 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.850
 confrontation between goodness and evil 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.260
 between darkness and light by calling it 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.180
 somehow be alone and minimal 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.850
 sequence of action that if anything lasts 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.950
 five minutes I think it has more 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.380
 meaning is better built and is 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.000
 better developed than any 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.830
 sequence of actions 3 can find 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.750
 in movies like for example superman 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.360
 that is the level at which we are already 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.130
 we are moving on the other side 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.380
 I insist it's a very throwing movie 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.270
 towards romantic comedy by the 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.890
 situations that are posed by the 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.560
 refreshment that the character receives 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.780
 group to enter this second 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.700
 part but once again the animation is 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:00.310
 great the dubbing is very good 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.500
 we are again finding the level in 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.690
 the Mexican dubbing have left many 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.180
 vices aside the public complained with 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.010
 reason he was rightly and rightly 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.019
 fortunately now we are 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.120
 recovering a great level in the dubbing 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.880
 at least for this type of movies 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.900
 it's a fairly extensive subject 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.419
 then go 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.000
 calmly go carefully I do not think not 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.590
 do not take it carefully with confidence no no no 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.479
 there's going to be no disappointment 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.400
 maybe we will not reach the levels of 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:30.460
 charm that we had in the first part 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.220
 maybe we will not achieve the rapture and 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.470
 the discovery of this character that 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.210
 starts it starts on a very dark side and 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.759
 finished one very bright because here already 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.710
 bright side we have only them 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:43.660
 let's say that it's up to you to qualify what now 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.919
 however it is a very movie 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.300
 entertaining is a very movie 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.979
 fun only applies that you can see 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.199
 without any problems and that if 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.220
 I highly recommend for this summer 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.220
 bibiano favorites
