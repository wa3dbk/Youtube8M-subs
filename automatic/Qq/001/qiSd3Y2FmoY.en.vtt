 to do and very easy to break we know 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.710
 perfectly the long-term consequences 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.289
 term of bad habits and all 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.259
 we want to change them for some as 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.230
 difficult is to find the strength of 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.980
 will or determination to do those 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.770
 changes and for others is to keep them 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.230
 long term there are more and more 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.410
 studies on how to make changes 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.620

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.440
 keep them changing is always possible 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.530
 you're never too out of shape with 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.720
 too overweight or too old 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.350
 to make positive changes 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.230
 of the most common habit changes 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.740
 they find feeding them better and doing 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:11.860
 exercise no matter what your goal 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.920
 change studies suggest that there are 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.070
 certain strategies that can help 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.640
 create a good habit and make it part of 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.960
 your daily life one of the most 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.380
 important in maintaining a habit 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.610
 healthy is one to determine and understand 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.530
 what motivates you towards the change and two 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.229
 identify the possible obstacles that 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.290
 you can face and that can demotivate 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.440
 if we start with this, we're going for a 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.020
 good way to keep some 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.259
 reasons for the most common changes are 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.960
 lose weight improve health see 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.570
 better and feel good one of the mistakes 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.540
 most common is to set goals for us 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.229
 realistic any change needs 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.990
 small goals defined and accompanied 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.780
 of some solid plan to achieve the goal 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.690
 final for example if our goal is 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.910
 lose 30 kilos we can put a goal 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.430
 smaller than 3 kilos per month 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.220
 the next key point is to develop 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.070
 an action plan you can choose to walk 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.770
 half an hour to burn more calories 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.840
 stop eating unprocessed foods 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.170
 include more vegetables in your diet or 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.930
 keep a daily calorie count 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.540
 these specific behaviors can 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.280
 help meet your goal with less to 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.590
 that a habit lasts we have to 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.310
 prepare for the challenges we can 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.710
 deal 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.950
 we must think that is what motivates us 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:45.150
 to change if it is important to us 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.410
 or if we are influenced by others 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.080
 Research suggests that it is more 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.750
 easy that we get attached to something when 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.540
 it really is more important to 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.420
 us that for others is to surround us 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.060
 of an environment that supports us is key 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.460
 there is evidence that indicates that if we 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.920
 we engage with people with goals 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.900
 similar helps us to motivate ourselves 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.630
 continue with our effort for example 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.480
 if we involve our family partner 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.420
 or friends, we can carry out activities 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.750
 together like exercising and getting attached 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.750
 more to our goals to do activities 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.200
 in a group allows us to learn from each 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.780
 member and support each other one thing 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.380
 is to make a change and the other is 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.120
 keep it requires commitment 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.460
 continuous so that it becomes part of 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.010
 our life when a person keeps 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.460
 or commits in an effort to 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.550
 6 to 8 weeks is more likely to be 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.670
 able to adopt it in the long term try 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.610
 of having a plan b in case of feeling that 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.430
 you want to give up if you feel that it is for 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.850
 Lack of motivation reviews why it was 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.800
 that you started the change and its important 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.870
