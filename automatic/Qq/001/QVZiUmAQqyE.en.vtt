of<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> Giants<00:01:48.000> handily<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:49.020> don't<00:01:49.680> see<00:01:49.920> this

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
of the Giants handily I don't see this

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.770 
of the Giants handily I don't see this
being<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.460> letdown<00:01:50.670> for<00:01:51.000> Cincinnati<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.540> think

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
being a letdown for Cincinnati I think

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.450 
being a letdown for Cincinnati I think
Cincinnati's<00:01:52.470> got<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.799> train<00:01:53.070> rolling<00:01:53.369> at

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
Cincinnati's got the train rolling at

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.460 
Cincinnati's got the train rolling at
the<00:01:53.549> right<00:01:53.729> time<00:01:54.030> Andy<00:01:54.750> doll<00:01:54.930> I'll<00:01:55.170> starting

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
the right time Andy doll I'll starting

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.289 
the right time Andy doll I'll starting
to<00:01:55.530> play<00:01:55.680> really<00:01:55.979> well<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.579> defense<00:01:56.820> played

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
to play really well the defense played

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.630 
to play really well the defense played
phenomenal<00:01:58.079> against<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.500> Giants<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.130> can't

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
phenomenal against the Giants I can't

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.370 
phenomenal against the Giants I can't
see<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> Chiefs<00:02:00.299> moving<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> ball<00:02:00.899> much<00:02:01.200> at

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
see the Chiefs moving the ball much at

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.499 
see the Chiefs moving the ball much at
home<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.430> Cincinnati<00:02:02.969> takes<00:02:03.210> care<00:02:03.479> of

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
home I I think Cincinnati takes care of

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.600 
home I I think Cincinnati takes care of
business<00:02:03.899> by<00:02:04.049> least<00:02:04.619> 10<00:02:04.920> points<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:05.520> game

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
business by least 10 points in this game

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.219 
business by least 10 points in this game
I<00:02:05.969> think<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.450> team<00:02:06.630> sits<00:02:06.899> actually

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
I think this team sits actually

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.809 
I think this team sits actually
determined<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.740> make<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> playoff<00:02:08.190> push<00:02:08.520> where

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
determined to make a playoff push where

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.940 
determined to make a playoff push where
the<00:02:09.479> city's<00:02:09.750> done<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.140> mean<00:02:10.259> again<00:02:10.410> city<00:02:10.709> can't

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
the city's done I mean again city can't

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.750 
the city's done I mean again city can't
figure<00:02:11.129> out<00:02:11.220> what<00:02:11.340> they<00:02:11.459> want<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.640> do<00:02:11.730> a

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
figure out what they want to do a

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.740 
figure out what they want to do a
quarterback<00:02:12.239> they<00:02:12.450> can't

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
quarterback they can't

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.730

figure out what they want to do in the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.130 
figure out what they want to do in the
run<00:02:13.890> game<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:14.340> think<00:02:15.090> Cincinnati<00:02:15.720> wins<00:02:16.020> this

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
run game I think Cincinnati wins this

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.810 
run game I think Cincinnati wins this

don't<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.230> think<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.739> books<00:02:49.950> made<00:02:50.220> this

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
don't you think that the books made this

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.660 
don't you think that the books made this
you<00:02:50.760> know<00:02:50.880> six<00:02:51.390> points<00:02:51.750> or<00:02:51.870> even<00:02:52.170> seven<00:02:52.670> so

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
it's a good point i don't know if it's

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.210 
it's a good point i don't know if it's
because<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.590> way<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.010> cheese

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
competitive but you know i think though

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.729 
competitive but you know i think though
I<00:03:03.180> think<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.510> books<00:03:03.750> are<00:03:03.930> valuing<00:03:04.530> way<00:03:04.680> too

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
I think the books are valuing way too

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.440 
I think the books are valuing way too
much<00:03:05.100> in<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.430> home<00:03:05.580> field<00:03:05.820> advantage<00:03:06.270> or<00:03:06.360> the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
much in the home field advantage or the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.449 
much in the home field advantage or the
NFL<00:03:06.840> has<00:03:06.870> been<00:03:07.050> pretty<00:03:07.380> sporadic<00:03:07.709> all<00:03:08.130> year<00:03:08.430> I

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
NFL has been pretty sporadic all year I

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.370 
NFL has been pretty sporadic all year I
mean<00:03:08.790> I<00:03:08.880> don't<00:03:09.150> think<00:03:09.330> you<00:03:09.390> can<00:03:09.540> pinpoint<00:03:09.840> a

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
mean I don't think you can pinpoint a

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.770
