00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.190 
about 8 minutes long at most and I want
to<00:01:44.250> apologize<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.570> gonna<00:01:45.659> be<00:01:45.810> shorter

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
to apologize this is gonna be shorter

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.070 
to apologize this is gonna be shorter
than<00:01:46.580> most<00:01:47.580> parts<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.450> didn't<00:01:48.659> want<00:01:48.900> this

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
than most parts but I didn't want this

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.710 
than most parts but I didn't want this
like<00:01:49.350> video<00:01:49.650> to<00:01:49.830> drag<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:50.790> about<00:01:51.090> 20

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
like video to drag on to like about 20

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.899 
like video to drag on to like about 20
minutes<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.470> that's<00:01:52.650> why<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.890> that's<00:01:53.640> why<00:01:53.820> this

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
minutes so that's why I that's why this

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.120 
minutes so that's why I that's why this
parts<00:01:54.330> gonna<00:01:54.420> be<00:01:54.540> much<00:01:54.810> shorter<00:01:55.020> than<00:01:55.799> usual

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
parts gonna be much shorter than usual

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.320 
parts gonna be much shorter than usual
because<00:01:56.310> most<00:01:56.549> these<00:01:56.670> levels<00:01:57.000> are<00:01:57.119> like

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
because most these levels are like

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.520 
because most these levels are like
around<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.810> 10<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.470> 15<00:01:58.770> minutes<00:01:59.040> long<00:01:59.220> and

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
around like 10 to 15 minutes long and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.530 
around like 10 to 15 minutes long and
like<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.680> said<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:02.009> really<00:02:02.820> didn't<00:02:03.030> want<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.330> don't

like I said I really didn't want I don't

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.499 
like I said I really didn't want I don't

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
part of the construction site level

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.180 
part of the construction site level
which<00:04:55.660> is<00:04:55.870> that<00:04:56.080> an<00:04:56.200> actual<00:04:56.350> chase<00:04:56.830> level

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
which is that an actual chase level

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.980 
which is that an actual chase level
because<00:04:57.730> as<00:04:57.850> you<00:04:57.940> can<00:04:58.150> see<00:04:58.330> from<00:04:58.480> at<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:58.810> top

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
because as you can see from at the top

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.810 
because as you can see from at the top
right<00:04:59.230> corner<00:04:59.280> there<00:05:00.280> is<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.400> little<00:05:00.460> time

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
right corner there is a little time

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.250 
right corner there is a little time
limit<00:05:01.090> and<00:05:01.330> at<00:05:01.660> that<00:05:01.750> time<00:05:01.840> limit<00:05:02.050> goes<00:05:02.170> to

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
limit and at that time limit goes to

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.110 
limit and at that time limit goes to
zero<00:05:02.440> well<00:05:02.680> we<00:05:02.830> will<00:05:03.010> fail<00:05:03.190> the<00:05:03.310> mission<00:05:03.460> so

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
zero well we will fail the mission so

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.000 
zero well we will fail the mission so
yes<00:05:04.390> we're<00:05:04.660> actually<00:05:04.840> chasing<00:05:05.350> Malacca<00:05:05.770> if

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
yes we're actually chasing Malacca if

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.160 
yes we're actually chasing Malacca if
you<00:05:06.100> take<00:05:06.310> too<00:05:06.580> long<00:05:06.790> Malacca<00:05:07.300> will<00:05:07.630> get<00:05:07.930> away

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
you take too long Malacca will get away

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.820 
you take too long Malacca will get away
so<00:05:09.160> don't<00:05:09.850> take<00:05:10.120> too<00:05:10.180> long<00:05:10.410> even<00:05:11.410> though<00:05:11.770> you

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
so don't take too long even though you

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.740 
so don't take too long even though you
really<00:05:12.460> shouldn't<00:05:12.790> be<00:05:12.850> taking<00:05:13.210> that<00:05:13.330> long<00:05:13.510> you

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
really shouldn't be taking that long you

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.080 
really shouldn't be taking that long you
have<00:05:13.960> plenty<00:05:14.350> of<00:05:14.560> time<00:05:15.040> to<00:05:15.400> catch<00:05:15.850> up<00:05:16.000> with

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
have plenty of time to catch up with

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.460 
have plenty of time to catch up with

it's just a really fun level it's very
fast-paced<00:05:56.350> chase<00:05:56.830> level<00:05:57.160> and<00:05:57.490> it<00:05:58.300> does<00:05:58.600> add<00:05:58.990> a
