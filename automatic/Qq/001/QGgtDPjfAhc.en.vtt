00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.960
 foam gun 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.060
 how a couple of tips work 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.289
 work 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.289
 a friend of difficulty but nothing more 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:31.039
 gun handles short here we have 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:39.360
 this is also a twist knob on the position 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:45.059
 crimping here with the more open to those 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.460
 more foam head goes there more 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.210
 strong it is possible to fasten 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:56.910
 adjust less pressure whichever 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.649
 singing is the principle of whispering dark 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.760
 It's hard to break it up and the meaning of ap 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.690
 how much is a spring like 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.690
 crush on stock 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.690
 the trigger itself here with us too 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:19.940
 the spring is twisted all drunk 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:22.330
 wind the ball should work 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:28.360
 unscrew 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:32.090
 Worked spun completely like ours 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:36.410
 pressured at full capacity of factories not 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.550
 will hit the ball and mixed in like 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:45.140
 so here under the bunk made 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:47.420
 will live and work there for you always 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.990
 we must try to always defense 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.990
 the wall rose 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.290
 until the end and produce if 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:04.130
 work out to the end you must stock 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:07.840
 beau monde foam and immediately change and set 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.360
 shop surely the ball did not have foam 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.300
 already tighten then you have to 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.510
 flushing wash meaning is not a master 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.500
 industrial work is so simple 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:27.340
 rule to remember 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:29.750
 worked closed work you press the finish 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.350
 the threads smoothly and push 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:39.670
 see what you can not serve 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:44.510
 little by little we show you 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:47.320
 balance and must be on top of Ukraine 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.320
 the tip of the dagi 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:01.200
 zapenili 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.329
 we closed don't forget to cheat if 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.360
 You will 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:14.150
 so that she then hardens his pistol 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:17.359
 have to disassemble clean spun all 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:22.799
 cherry foam you immediately 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:30.480
 rag wet then have principle 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:34.940
 knife simple rules in working with this 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.940
 you will stick with the gun 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.989
 enough to help for a long time then
