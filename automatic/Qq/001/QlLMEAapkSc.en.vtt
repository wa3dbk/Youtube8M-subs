crookedly or have an unequal weight in
the<00:00:50.309> reins<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.270> we've<00:00:51.629> developed<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.379> saddle

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the reins so we've developed a saddle

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.160 
the reins so we've developed a saddle
and<00:00:53.100> reigns<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.149> over<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> million

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170

sensor<00:00:55.949> points<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:57.149> are<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.690> sensitive<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
sensor points that are so sensitive and

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.189 
sensor points that are so sensitive and
what<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.579> we<00:01:00.090> adjust<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.840> riders

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
what we do is we adjust the riders

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.460 
what we do is we adjust the riders
position<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.460> give<00:01:03.239> them<00:01:03.660> some<00:01:04.080> muscle

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
position and give them some muscle

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.950 
position and give them some muscle
memory<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.129> then<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> buzzword<00:01:05.880> connected<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
memory and then a buzzword connected to

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.990 
memory and then a buzzword connected to
that<00:01:07.080> muscle<00:01:07.500> memory<00:01:07.680> maybe<00:01:08.159> their<00:01:08.400> pelvis<00:01:08.820> is

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
that muscle memory maybe their pelvis is

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.420 
that muscle memory maybe their pelvis is
twisted<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.780> we'll<00:01:10.229> tell<00:01:10.439> them<00:01:10.619> point<00:01:11.280> your

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
twisted and we'll tell them point your

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.219 
twisted and we'll tell them point your
left<00:01:11.670> seat<00:01:11.909> bone<00:01:11.939> toward<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> horses<00:01:12.990> right

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
left seat bone toward the horses right

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.260 
left seat bone toward the horses right
here<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.580> see<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> screen

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
here and we can see on the screen

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.570 
here and we can see on the screen
whether<00:01:16.229> they<00:01:16.439> end<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.770> sitting<00:01:16.979> centered<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
whether they end up sitting centered and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.789 
whether they end up sitting centered and
balanced<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.049> stationary<00:01:19.650> to

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
balanced and we do that stationary to

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.620 
balanced and we do that stationary to
begin<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.610> then<00:01:20.640> we<00:01:21.119> get<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.330> horse

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
begin with and then we get the horse

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.660 
begin with and then we get the horse
moving<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:22.650> see<00:01:22.860> if<00:01:22.950> they<00:01:23.189> revert<00:01:23.640> to

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
moving and we see if they revert to

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.270 
moving and we see if they revert to
their<00:01:23.970> own<00:01:24.150> muscle<00:01:24.750> memory<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:25.950> cue

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
their own muscle memory but we can cue

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.859 
their own muscle memory but we can cue
them<00:01:26.460> with<00:01:26.640> their<00:01:26.790> buzz<00:01:26.970> word<00:01:27.270> they<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.659> make

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
them with their buzz word they can make

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.350 
them with their buzz word they can make
the<00:01:28.049> correction<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.280> what<00:01:29.520> we're<00:01:29.700> able<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.210> do

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
the correction and what we're able to do

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.840 
the correction and what we're able to do
because<00:01:30.570> we<00:01:30.900> really<00:01:31.380> have<00:01:31.650> refined<00:01:32.310> these

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
because we really have refined these

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.940 
because we really have refined these
corrections<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.049> said<00:01:34.320> more<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.770> than<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
corrections like I said more so than the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
corrections like I said more so than the
naked<00:01:35.340> eye<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.729> see<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.780> can<00:01:36.900> reduce<00:01:37.970> fixing

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
naked eye can see we can reduce fixing

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.319 
naked eye can see we can reduce fixing
chronic<00:01:39.570> position<00:01:40.110> problems<00:01:40.979> from<00:01:41.340> years<00:01:42.119> and

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329

equestrian<00:01:46.049> games<00:01:46.350> we<00:01:46.829> had<00:01:46.979> one<00:01:47.159> lady<00:01:47.310> sitting

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
the tax she was very very crooked we got

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.490 
the tax she was very very crooked we got
her<00:01:50.280> straight<00:01:50.670> she<00:01:51.299> came<00:01:51.540> back<00:01:51.750> two<00:01:52.350> days

remembered<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.930> muscle<00:01:58.380> memory<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:59.009> it's

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
remembered the muscle memory so it's

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.709

it's<00:01:59.490> an<00:01:59.670> amazing<00:02:00.210> breakthrough<00:02:00.630> because

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
it's an amazing breakthrough because

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.410 
it's an amazing breakthrough because

the<00:02:08.190> program<00:02:08.670> where<00:02:08.940> did<00:02:09.209> these

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
the program where did these

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.220 
the program where did these
million<00:02:10.009> sensors<00:02:10.729> come<00:02:11.599> from<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.110> be

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
million sensors come from and be

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.199 
million sensors come from and be
developed<00:02:12.709> I<00:02:12.920> have<00:02:13.430> some<00:02:13.970> incredible

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
same sensation of fatigue the chest pain

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.990 
same sensation of fatigue the chest pain
for<00:03:09.739> multiple<00:03:10.069> sclerosis<00:03:10.700> they<00:03:10.849> could

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
for multiple sclerosis they could

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.289 
for multiple sclerosis they could
simulate<00:03:11.239> double<00:03:11.900> vision<00:03:12.110> dizziness<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:14.000> I'm

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
simulate double vision dizziness so I'm

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.120 
simulate double vision dizziness so I'm

whole lot more and he's like well I can
do<00:03:46.489> that<00:03:46.669> and<00:03:46.970> that's<00:03:47.389> how<00:03:47.540> we<00:03:47.599> started<00:03:47.930> it

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
do that and that's how we started it

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.220 
do that and that's how we started it
also<00:03:49.250> seems<00:03:49.549> to<00:03:49.730> some<00:03:50.120> degree<00:03:50.299> that<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:50.930> allows

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
also seems to some degree that it allows

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.610 
also seems to some degree that it allows
you<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:52.040> get<00:03:52.819> at<00:03:53.060> least<00:03:53.090> under<00:03:53.959> the<00:03:54.139> horses

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
you to get at least under the horses

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.699 
you to get at least under the horses
skin<00:03:55.040> and<00:03:55.370> this<00:03:56.180> can<00:03:56.389> also<00:03:56.599> kind<00:03:56.930> of<00:03:57.139> represent

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
skin and this can also kind of represent

in it well you we have so many different
programs<00:05:47.560> like<00:05:47.770> I<00:05:47.860> said<00:05:48.040> we<00:05:48.130> have<00:05:48.250> the<00:05:48.340> EQ

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
programs like I said we have the EQ

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.240 
programs like I said we have the EQ
training<00:05:49.660> centers<00:05:50.260> where<00:05:50.860> we<00:05:50.980> trained

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
training centers where we trained

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.730 
training centers where we trained
instructors<00:05:52.090> like<00:05:52.600> like<00:05:52.960> our<00:05:53.110> instructor

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
instructors like like our instructor

instructors like like our instructor
here<00:05:54.100> we<00:05:54.790> have<00:05:55.090> training<00:05:55.540> centers<00:05:55.930> where

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
here we have training centers where

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.160 
here we have training centers where
actual<00:05:56.920> students<00:05:57.400> can<00:05:57.640> come<00:05:57.970> we<00:05:58.900> are

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
actual students can come we are

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.210 
actual students can come we are
developing<00:05:59.560> a<00:06:01.200> scaled-down<00:06:02.200> version<00:06:02.890> of<00:06:03.010> this

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
developing a scaled-down version of this

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.000 
developing a scaled-down version of this
so<00:06:03.610> that<00:06:03.760> it<00:06:03.910> can<00:06:04.030> be<00:06:04.150> in<00:06:04.390> the<00:06:04.660> home<00:06:05.010> almost

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
so that it can be in the home almost

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.650 
so that it can be in the home almost
like<00:06:06.160> a<00:06:06.190> wii<00:06:06.460> game<00:06:06.760> so<00:06:07.030> that<00:06:07.180> people<00:06:07.510> can

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
like a wii game so that people can

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.140 
like a wii game so that people can
practice<00:06:08.080> at<00:06:08.200> home<00:06:08.260> we<00:06:09.250> have<00:06:09.400> so<00:06:09.760> many

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
practice at home we have so many

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.300 
practice at home we have so many
different<00:06:10.600> variations<00:06:11.140> on<00:06:11.560> this<00:06:11.710> and<00:06:11.920> so

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
different variations on this and so

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.200 
different variations on this and so
every<00:06:12.850> single<00:06:13.390> program<00:06:13.960> training<00:06:14.650> center
