00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.650
 hello welcome 6 crowd crafting I want 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.369
 take advantage to send a greeting to frank 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:12.429
 moscoso and also to josÃ© luis lozano 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:14.650
 soda and aura hernandez 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.810
 here I send your greeting I hope that 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.820
 find very well and I want to leave them 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.990
 with the tutorial I hope you like it and we 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.990
 we see until the next 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.200
 this time we will make a mini album 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.200
 with a simple binding 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.460
 some time ago I took a video to 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.130
 participate in a contest that was held 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.980
 creations and yes it's called my life in 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.680
 scrap 2 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.120
 I posted it on the channel and many of 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.270
 you asked me how was there 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.610
 done this mini album I told you that 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.760
 creations and if I teach this structure 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.150
 but I've been asked for the tutorial and so 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.910
 I will show you how to make this structure 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.129
 and so we would have the result of this 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.930
 mini album with the binding that we 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.780
 taught easy and the mini album that consists 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.330
 in 5 sheets and the truth that is very 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.009
 pretty so you have to see the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.009
 materials to see how it's done 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.990
 ah 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:32.960
 cardboard of one or several colors 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.960
 coz paper rule 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.950
 pencil 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.660
 scissors 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.310
 Cotton yarn and lasa and a needle 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:52.440
 first we have to draw five 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:56.670
 rectangles of 16.3 by 25 centimeters 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.670
 in our base card 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.280
 since we have cut our 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.510
 five rectangles what we will do is 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.510
 fold them in half 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.210
 here we have our five sheets of 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.670
 cardboard we leave them aside and we take 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.520
 Another piece of card can be from 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:50.190
 same color or different and we draw a 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:50.190
 rectangle of 16.3 x 26.5 centimeters 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:00.450
 and then we make a measure at 12.5 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.220
 and at 14 this part will form the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.930
 loin of the mini album 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.930
 and we do the folds 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.379
 and we will remain this way 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.660
 Now what is missing is decorating our 5 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.970
 Cardboard sheets and our cover 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.000
 then we have to trace on the spine 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.330
 a measurement at two centimeters of each 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.330
 side 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.520
 then we put the rule in both 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.310
 points that we outlined earlier in 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.790
 this case measures 12 points 2 centimeters 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:01.260
 so mark the area at 6.1 for 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.750
 have three chicks later in the ojito 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.709
 that we draw we have to draw first 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:11.400
 to three millimeters and then to the 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:15.410
 two millimeters and so on until 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.410
 have five eyes 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.540
 then we take one of our leaves 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.280
 and we mark 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.870
 in the part where we indicate where they will go 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.870
 the little eyes 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.040
 and we do the same with the 5 leaves 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.120
 then with the needle we have to do 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.120
 our perforations 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.070
 then we have to drill 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.330
 also in the brands that we made in 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.330
 our sheet of cardboard 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.520
 with the thread and the needle we start 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.039
 sew 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.039
 we put the needle in the first hole 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:29.400
 we flipped our cover and 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.480
 back cover and we put the needle in the 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:37.210
 first hole on the left side 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.210
 and we pull and tighten the thread very well 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:51.110
 then we have to move on from this 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:51.110
 hole to the second 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.790
 and we pull very well 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.770
 ah 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:13.160
 now we will put the needle in the third 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.160
 hole both inside and outside 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:36.240
 we arrange our sheet very well for 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:38.569
 that is right now we return in the 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.839
 Wrong Way 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:44.469
 from this hole we start in 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:44.469
 the middle 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.490
 and we go back to the first hole 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.120
 We made this same step with the 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.600
 leaves remaining and in this way we 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:16.410
 the binding is 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.740
 and that's all, I hope that 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.740
 I liked it 

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:35.469
 ah 

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:35.469
 i 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:41.850
 do not 

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.850
 Y
