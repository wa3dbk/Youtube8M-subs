another<00:05:23.360> eyes<00:05:25.390> so<00:05:26.390> the<00:05:26.630> movies<00:05:27.260> do<00:05:27.560> tend<00:05:28.400> to

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
another eyes so the movies do tend to

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.700 
another eyes so the movies do tend to
load<00:05:29.150> a<00:05:29.180> little<00:05:29.479> bit<00:05:29.570> slower<00:05:29.900> but<00:05:30.229> once<00:05:30.560> they

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
load a little bit slower but once they

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.710
