 from the country 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.149
 the piece of Brazil where Brazil is more 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.729
 grows is a great state also in the 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.949
 environment where the Pantanal and 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.140
 Amazon rainforest coexist in a way that 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.239
 rich and diverse 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.930
 mato grosso is a shopping and 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.930
 bold 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.880
 the majority of its municipalities was 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.930
 created in the 80's 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.420
 driven by agricultural activity 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.470
 although cities already account for 82% of 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.950
 population 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.940
 population density is low after all 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.369
 state is the third largest in the country 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.500
 the quality of life of the population is 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.050
 improving the rate of development 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.860
 of mato grosso is among the 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:37.600
 the best in the country and increases 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.600
 average income of mato grosenses families 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.649
 with an unemployment rate below 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.930
 national index 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.520
 mato grosso is the Brazilian state whose 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.520
 GDP grows more per year 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.140
 for great achievements it takes a lot 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.430
 work and dedication strength and claw 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.070
 This is a lesson I learned from my 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.840
 state my name is Felipe file only 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.640
 recognizes South American Brazilian 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.100
 swimming and mato grosso is my land in 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.740
 basis of this performance is the 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.530
 agro-livestock for export 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.420
 the sale of products to other countries 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.420
 grew 518% 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.090
 currently the state accounts for 24% of the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.299
 total grain production in the country and from 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.390
 2004 has the largest cattle herd in the 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.390
 Brazil 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.210
 ae 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.450
 to stand out in any obvious place 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.190
 It's important that everyone works 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.260
 The secret lies in discovering the talents 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.260
 and make it that's it 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.170
 note says failure adds rest of top 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.069

 Mateus 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.190
 the grandeur of thick bush is not 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.040
 summarizes to the agribusiness here several 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.660
 sectors are in full generating activity 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.660
 amazing results 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.319
 tourism is one of the activities that most 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.319
 grow in thick mato 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.709
 the natural wealth of the state as well 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.780
 favors the activity of generating 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.630
 energy is either from the use of 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.410
 rivers or investment in the 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.360
 thermal 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.670
 the tendency is for the state to expand its 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.209
 energy production capacity 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.209
 more 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.770
 in addition, private enterprise and government 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.930
 are investing in clean energy 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.209
 leveraging existing wire in the mass 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.480
 and increasing the generation of 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.660
 potential biodiesel is what is not lacking 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.540
 but only potential also does not help the 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.000
 state government knows this and acts to 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.950
 to reconcile economic growth with 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.090
 improvement in the quality of life of 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.620
 people 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.130
 invests heavily in qualifying 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.800
 and offers incentives to 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.079
 entrepreneurs looking for mato grosso 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.470
 another area that receives special attention 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.630
 of government is logistics with the challenge of 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.389
 interconnect a state as large as the 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.460
 mato grosso, the government pioneered 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:29.010
 creation of consortia of initiative 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.450
 private prefectures and state for the 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.450
 road paving 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.970
 furthermore encourages intermodal use to 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.150
 from the railroad and the waterways 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.460
 existing environmental preservation the 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.669
 Balance between production and medium are 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.800
 fundamental to this government only 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.930
 taking care of our ecosystems to 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.940
 ensure that more potentials arise in 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.130
 thick mato 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.319
 thinking the government has modified the 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.150
 environmental legislation and can now 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:00.880
 control the actions more closely 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.199
 criminals 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.000
 in addition when seeking new partnerships 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.220
 with the private sector 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.710
 public power requires compliance with the 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.259
 laws and adoption of environmental practices 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.570
 correct 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:16.880
 result of burning and deforestation 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:21.370
 the two major environmental problems of 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.370
 mato grosso are in excellent curve 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.190
 this is the thick we want to 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:33.430
 present a large state in your 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.980
 potential capable of accounting for large 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.640
 challenges and prepared for large 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.640
 partnerships
