00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.150
 hello t3 friends one more time we're going to 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.269
 review a new game this time it's your turn 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.310
 software ultimate edition that is a 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.160
 remastering the first gears of war 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.650
 that went out for xbox 360 back in the year 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.050
 of 2006 already has enough time 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.300
 in this game when it came out at that time 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.010
 because it was very revolutionary because 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.289
 changed our perspective of how it 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.090
 I should see a game many said that 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.940
 be the true arrival of the new 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.040
 generation and that is that in raleigh nn in 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.920
 which he has worked since ethical 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.300
 a long time evolved to a point where 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.340
 we have a graphics quality 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.700
 incredible and to give you an idea 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.520
 let's compare the two versions here 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.320
 notice how in 360 we have those little ones 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.440
 errors in the subtracted lines that the anti 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.660
 today's aliasing corrects see 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.340
 example the texture of the skin of 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.649
 characters see the amount of details 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.449
 what they have and how will this change 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.769
 dramatically when we see the version 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.769
 from xbox one below 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.430
 It is not in the difference 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.210
 lighting in how there are effects of 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.100
 particles look what it looks like 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.649
 our version and also notice how the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.259
 Camille kinematics changed so that 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.880
 they would be worth the braying more 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.590
 kinematics that look like a 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.530
 movie that have these angles of 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.270
 camera because more worked is not 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.000
 simply the engine of the game 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.530
 running for the story now as it 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.600
 you can see software only you have 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.459
 tested is a third-person shooter 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.200
 which is based on this mechanics of 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:46.259
 be covering yourself always be 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.209
 covered in the game really punishes 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.189
 the player trying to go around nothing 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:54.090
 more running and killing as if it were 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.549
 rambo here in the game is to be more 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.390
 patient to have this strategy for 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.849
 play and where does this come from he 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.890
 the game designers clip and biker 

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:07.049
 the director of well in when the game 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.750
 came out and I know he was very inspired by the 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.030
 gotcha and like in the gotcha then you have 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.970
 that working as a team you have to leave 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.390
 covering that not simply 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.930
 out there with his gun in the air destroys 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.700
 a noticed nothing you have to work and 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.290
 talking about working the work in 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.990
 team in cooperative mode is 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.280
 great because the whole story was 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.310
 designed so you're always 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.440
 accompanied by the bone from your site and that 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.030
 is your action adventure partner 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.740
 borrow and the fish when you can in 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.890
 cooperative because it really is not that 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.720
 I appear in mono and extra but always 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.810
 You are with your partner from the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.030
 principle then the cooperative mode to 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.980
 Despite the years that have passed, 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.500
 being very good you can play it in the 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.810
 same console you can not play online 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.400
 They also have many options for 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.520
 example something that I had not seen in 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.890
 a formation play in the cndh that is in 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.300
 a local network that we had two teams 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.970
 or someone brings in the back of your house 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.340
 we can do that game and talking about 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.380
 games which are multiplayer not 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.420
 we had opportunity for the review of 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.000
 play the multiplayer of our version 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.920
 advanced because the population of 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.230
 players is still very small given that 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.330
 only what we call review units 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.100
 we can play it 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.990
 but as it goes by in your 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.780
 that will not have our multiplayer of 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.020
 done we play the multiplayer beta 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.060
 Before everything was running without any problem 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.150
 then the software does not have many 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.890
 options has for example a switch 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.470
 where you can remove the voceries and the 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.300
 blood of the game in case you wanted 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.580
 share it with someone smaller as 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.470
 your son who was not this age but 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.990
 however the kinematics the blood 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.760
 keeps coming up so look the blood 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.000
 that appears is the blood of game one 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.680
 of the kinematics finally you have to 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.290
 mention that the game gives you the 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.110
 four versions the four deliveries of 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.000
 xv software and Xbox 360 through 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.520
 retrocompatibility when it is 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.650
 official on xbox one from 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.780
 November you will be able to download your 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.670
 other games while you're going to have the 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.130
 complete collection very much like what 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.959
 I made the master chief collection but 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.780
 Now only one of the games 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.019
 remastered and it's good because it shows 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.520
 which is a pretty well done job of 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.200
 that the developers were all 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.520
 the time and I should mention that 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.520
 develop people 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.419
 then I software is a great option 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.280
 It has many details 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.830
 the price is very small compared to 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.449
 in today's releases 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.690
 then you will have great content 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.310
 of game a game that like few with the 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.280
 time has remained in perfect 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.410
 conditions but if you already played everything 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.120
 you see that you save and the software you're not going to 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.800
 find too much new content to 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.410
 despite the new missions and others 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.150
 then it is only for this part of 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.979
 that have all the remakes in their 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.080
 against which we are going to put a 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.849
 final grade of 8 is a game 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.759
 solid but it depends on your experience 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.930
 previous with stews from where we come to 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:09.080
 recover 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.080
 ah 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.460
 ah
