as the charger for the mouse so this

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.880 
as the charger for the mouse so this

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
internet and what I found this really

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.070 
internet and what I found this really
comfortable<00:01:17.790> while<00:01:18.060> using<00:01:18.540> something<00:01:18.930> like

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
comfortable while using something like

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.620 
comfortable while using something like
Photoshop<00:01:19.770> after<00:01:20.250> effects<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.330> for<00:01:21.509> all<00:01:21.600> you

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
Photoshop after effects so for all you

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.270 
Photoshop after effects so for all you
graphic<00:01:22.140> design<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.860> actually

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
graphic design is this is actually

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.570 
graphic design is this is actually
really<00:01:23.490> good<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> laptop<00:01:24.390> and

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
really good if you have a laptop and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.550 
really good if you have a laptop and
basically<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:27.060> can<00:01:27.330> super<00:01:27.869> easy<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.140> actually

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
basically you can super easy to actually

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.840 
basically you can super easy to actually
just<00:01:28.770> scroll<00:01:29.070> around<00:01:29.189> with<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> actual

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
just scroll around with the actual

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.149 
just scroll around with the actual
device<00:01:30.180> here<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.079> can<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.229> go<00:01:31.560> let's<00:01:31.950> say<00:01:32.100> to

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
device here we can just go let's say to

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.429 
device here we can just go let's say to
engadget<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:36.030> scroll<00:01:36.360> down<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:37.079> actually

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
engadget and to scroll down you actually

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.010 
engadget and to scroll down you actually
just<00:01:37.470> tilt<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.280> device<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.939> its<00:01:39.299> side<00:01:39.659> like

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
just tilt the device on its side like

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.010 
just tilt the device on its side like
there<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.070> then<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.060> has<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> scroller<00:01:42.720> wheel

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
there and then it has a scroller wheel

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.580 
there and then it has a scroller wheel
on<00:01:43.520> its<00:01:44.520> side<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.810> scroll<00:01:46.439> it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
on its side so you can just scroll it

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.130 
on its side so you can just scroll it
with<00:01:46.710> your<00:01:46.860> finger<00:01:47.270> but<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.420> not<00:01:48.630> as<00:01:48.780> smooth

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
with your finger but it's not as smooth

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.800 
with your finger but it's not as smooth
I<00:01:49.439> guess<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:50.939> better<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.390> turn<00:01:51.659> it

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
I guess so it's better just to turn it

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.410 
I guess so it's better just to turn it
on<00:01:51.930> its<00:01:52.110> side<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.710> scroll<00:01:53.670> which<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.240> really

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
on its side and scroll which is really

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.280 
on its side and scroll which is really
cool<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.979> let's<00:01:55.979> say<00:01:56.250> if<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:56.820> were<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.290> comment

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
cool and let's say if we were to comment

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.480
