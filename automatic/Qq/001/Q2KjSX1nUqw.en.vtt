00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
is fancy box number one you're gonna

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.760 
is fancy box number one you're gonna
fold<00:02:57.450> in<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:59.970> triangle<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.260> then<00:03:02.260> fold<00:03:02.590> it

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
fold in a triangle and then fold it

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.580 
fold in a triangle and then fold it
again<00:03:04.020> and<00:03:05.550> we're<00:03:06.550> making<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.350> square<00:03:08.350> base

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
again and we're making the square base

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.440 
again and we're making the square base
the<00:03:08.890> preliminary<00:03:09.460> base<00:03:09.700> whatever<00:03:10.270> you<00:03:10.420> want

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
the preliminary base whatever you want

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.120 
the preliminary base whatever you want
to<00:03:10.660> call<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:10.870> there's<00:03:11.410> all<00:03:11.590> sorts<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:12.010> names

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
to call it there's all sorts of names

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:20.010 
to call it there's all sorts of names
for<00:03:12.430> this<00:03:12.550> particular<00:03:13.350> base<00:03:15.840> um<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.870> know

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
for this particular base um you know

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.310 
for this particular base um you know
we've<00:03:20.380> we've<00:03:20.650> been<00:03:20.830> through<00:03:20.980> this<00:03:21.070> before<00:03:21.250> and

just bend it back like that and when you

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.160 
just bend it back like that and when you
do<00:04:08.910> that<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:10.050> helps<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:12.690> what<00:04:12.900> you're<00:04:13.020> gonna

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
did with that diagonal and you're going

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.860 
did with that diagonal and you're going
to<00:04:24.810> bend<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:25.470> and<00:04:27.770> really<00:04:28.770> really<00:04:29.370> bend<00:04:30.000> it<00:04:30.210> so

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
to bend it and really really bend it so

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.030 
to bend it and really really bend it so
oh<00:04:31.580> god<00:04:32.580> keep<00:04:32.940> going<00:04:32.970> on<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.330> zoom<00:04:33.900> okay<00:04:34.830> one

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
oh god keep going on a zoom okay one

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.280 
oh god keep going on a zoom okay one
second<00:04:35.430> okay<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:36.000> had<00:04:36.150> two<00:04:36.330> repositions<00:04:37.080> and

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
second okay I had two repositions and

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.450 
second okay I had two repositions and
stuff<00:04:37.470> but<00:04:37.650> hopefully<00:04:38.010> this<00:04:38.160> works<00:04:38.540> so<00:04:39.540> again

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
stuff but hopefully this works so again

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.400 
stuff but hopefully this works so again
what<00:04:41.460> you've<00:04:41.610> got<00:04:41.850> to<00:04:42.000> do<00:04:42.180> is<00:04:42.570> take<00:04:42.930> it<00:04:42.990> in<00:04:43.380> here

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
what you've got to do is take it in here

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.060 
what you've got to do is take it in here
poke<00:04:43.980> your<00:04:44.160> thumb<00:04:44.430> through<00:04:44.760> after<00:04:45.620> you<00:04:46.620> bent

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
poke your thumb through after you bent

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.920 
poke your thumb through after you bent
it<00:04:47.540> through<00:04:48.540> like<00:04:48.840> that<00:04:49.169> and<00:04:50.120> then<00:04:51.120> just<00:04:51.570> take

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
it through like that and then just take

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.870 
it through like that and then just take
it<00:04:52.350> and<00:04:53.990> bend<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.110> top<00:04:55.320> just<00:04:55.860> bend<00:04:56.310> it<00:04:56.490> down

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.250 

like<00:04:59.880> that<00:05:01.850> so<00:05:02.850> it's<00:05:03.060> pretty<00:05:03.450> again<00:05:04.050> on<00:05:04.169> the
