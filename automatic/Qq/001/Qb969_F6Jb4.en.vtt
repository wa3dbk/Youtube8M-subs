00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.690 
example we've been having issues with
trying<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.959> get<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> panel<00:02:49.680> at<00:02:49.890> VidCon<00:02:49.920> a

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
trying to get a panel at VidCon a

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.750 
trying to get a panel at VidCon a
booktube<00:02:51.570> panel<00:02:52.019> at<00:02:52.170> VidCon<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.680> so<00:02:53.190> we've

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
booktube panel at VidCon and so we've

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.630 
booktube panel at VidCon and so we've
tried<00:02:54.030> tweeting<00:02:54.510> we've<00:02:54.840> tried<00:02:55.280> spreading<00:02:56.280> the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
tried tweeting we've tried spreading the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.270 
tried tweeting we've tried spreading the
message<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:57.269> way<00:02:57.470> emailing<00:02:58.470> all<00:02:58.769> that<00:02:58.980> stuff

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
message that way emailing all that stuff

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.430 
message that way emailing all that stuff
and<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.820> don't<00:03:00.120> think<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.480> we're<00:03:00.780> close<00:03:01.050> to

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
and I don't think that we're close to

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.100 
and I don't think that we're close to
having<00:03:01.650> our<00:03:02.040> own<00:03:02.430> panel<00:03:03.000> at<00:03:03.300> VidCon<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.930> I'm

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
having our own panel at VidCon and I'm

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.020 
having our own panel at VidCon and I'm
just<00:03:04.260> saying<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:04.590> if<00:03:04.890> maybe<00:03:05.370> those<00:03:05.760> bigger

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
just saying that if maybe those bigger

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.320 
just saying that if maybe those bigger
booktubers<00:03:06.840> made<00:03:07.200> videos<00:03:07.650> more<00:03:08.610> diversely

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
booktubers made videos more diversely

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.840 
booktubers made videos more diversely
and<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:10.709> dipped<00:03:11.010> into<00:03:11.220> other<00:03:11.550> communities

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
and that dipped into other communities

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.110 
and that dipped into other communities
if<00:03:12.540> we<00:03:12.810> did<00:03:13.019> that<00:03:13.050> then<00:03:13.650> we'd<00:03:14.310> have<00:03:14.340> our<00:03:14.790> foot

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
if we did that then we'd have our foot

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.479 
if we did that then we'd have our foot
in<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.330> door<00:03:15.480> at<00:03:15.930> VidCon<00:03:16.380> also<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.310> think

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
in the door at VidCon also I think

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.460 
in the door at VidCon also I think
that's<00:03:17.880> really<00:03:18.450> good<00:03:18.630> to<00:03:18.660> make<00:03:18.930> different

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
that's really good to make different

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.440 
that's really good to make different
kinds<00:03:19.620> of<00:03:19.829> videos<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.670> we<00:03:20.790> don't<00:03:20.970> forget

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
kinds of videos so that we don't forget

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.780 
kinds of videos so that we don't forget
that<00:03:21.690> were<00:03:21.900> people<00:03:22.650> behind<00:03:22.980> these<00:03:23.190> cameras

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
that were people behind these cameras

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.690 
that were people behind these cameras
we're<00:03:24.060> not<00:03:24.209> just<00:03:24.780> people<00:03:25.110> who<00:03:25.380> make<00:03:26.190> videos

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
we're not just people who make videos

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.180 
we're not just people who make videos
about<00:03:27.060> books<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:27.900> read<00:03:28.350> books<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.950> make

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
about books and read books and make

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.690 
about books and read books and make
friday<00:03:29.519> read<00:03:29.820> videos<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.709> sort<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:31.769> humanizes

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
friday read videos it sort of humanizes

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.390 
friday read videos it sort of humanizes
us<00:03:32.910> in<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.269> way<00:03:33.450> that's<00:03:34.230> that's<00:03:34.890> a<00:03:34.980> benefit

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
us in a way that's that's a benefit

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.490 
us in a way that's that's a benefit
within<00:03:35.670> itself<00:03:36.049> so<00:03:37.049> I<00:03:37.079> guess<00:03:37.230> my<00:03:37.260> main

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
within itself so I guess my main

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.319 
within itself so I guess my main
audience<00:03:38.010> here<00:03:38.459> is<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.790> people<00:03:39.060> who<00:03:39.150> make

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
audience here is the people who make

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.300 
audience here is the people who make
videos<00:03:39.750> because<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.500> can't<00:03:40.709> really<00:03:40.890> talk<00:03:41.070> to

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
videos because you can't really talk to

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.449 
videos because you can't really talk to
the<00:03:41.790> audience<00:03:42.000> who<00:03:42.870> watches<00:03:43.290> videos<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:44.130> tell

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
the audience who watches videos and tell

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.150 
the audience who watches videos and tell
them<00:03:44.640> what<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.030> do<00:03:45.180> that's<00:03:45.959> called<00:03:46.230> fascism<00:03:46.799> I

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
them what to do that's called fascism I

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.039 
them what to do that's called fascism I
