 I flew to Moscow not for a day or two exactly 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.560
 at 18:00 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.080
 Now in hours his time is measured from 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.119
 these precious 18 2 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.790
 paid acts to the racetrack 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.320
 moscow raceway met us with rain so 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.070
 that we quickly moved to a new reno 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.230
 megan rs 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.870
 first thing quat glad that 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.930
 Transmission Manual does not like to talk 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.090
 machine 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.090
 it is a single image is turning 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:58.050

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.910
 prepare weekend 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.850
 from the first turn it became clear 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.490
 it's good that I did not eat breakfast 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.860
 They pick up a very confident true time track 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.950
 perfectly familiar with everything 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.590
 winning it is here 2012 he 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.840
 won two races of the world series reno 20 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.310
 in the hardest battle with a rival 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.750
 Belgian 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.750
 tell me about the shaped 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.299
 Daria Belgium went well 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.159
 I think it was loud at a high level 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.499
 we are 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.320
 we struggled with not at all throughout 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:36.670
 race 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.500
 spam 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.960
 elder stock large property so 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.570
 what 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.050
 we were pleased with the figures from and looking at 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.409
 track. 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:51.600
 Yes, I saw register Lena 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:54.060
 I think that very form is wealth 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.409
 saw not 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.590
 two near but 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.210
 I think equal 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.070
 but 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.940
 that is , you know something like that inside 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.500
 not yet 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.980
 they told me that as i said yes 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.979
 means 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.060
 makes its maximum here especially 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.950
 demand from yourself to anyone 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.310
 I do not see a special race we have me 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.070
 I think that you can just show what 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.960
 can you do daniel quat started your 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.240
 go kart track then there was a program 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.750
 training pilots in red bull victory in 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.610
 gp3 it was noticed by a young daring and 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.020
 the feed speed of hope 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.020
 taken into the main part 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.230
 Now the most important thing is that it lies on 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.230
 couch 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:51.510
 while i'm kind 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.180
 I think that we have progressed over 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.440
 season 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.420
 was given 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.740
 and some repetitions. 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.600
 make sure i would say we 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.880
 on them aragon 2 roles of stalin five important 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.880
 qualifications and it was in normal 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:10.390
 conditions like grandma so i think 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.580
 that the car went through fix and often 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.840
 we can't fight percy children yet 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.390
 or lit up was to donate a little 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:22.740
 nina de stat when motor car 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.240
 we are all what firmly sarah canada 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.460
 all sorts of major and how are stacked 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.340
 relations 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.560
 and 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.120
 inward with a team of great swing 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.040
 solid team we 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.040
 maybe what I want so 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:47.530
 so in the team I respect them too 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:51.370
 feel some feedback 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.890
 and everything goes well for a debutant class 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.080
 really good driving progresses 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.030
 best mate rozhana Eric right 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.970
 who will soon have to leave 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.840
 next year's team is on heels 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.830
 are coming 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.830
 the same 17-year-old max force that are an oven 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.500
 reminded 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.170
 so here again 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:21.130
 for the sake of salvation you can so 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.130
 yes but 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.129
 romadin 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.880
 filed in this young sport so 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:29.759
 road 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.190
 states and the state yes we have there 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:35.360
 well done 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:39.680
 I think this field is normal 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.620
 he hinted technology work on this 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.310
 just a bunch because if fashion guy 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.430
 laroche 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.530
 but he has so much time 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.320
 to show yourself what a lot of time 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:55.280
 what to punish themselves for not coming 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.280
 I do not know a good career 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.310
 from the race track going to Moscow 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.590
 auto show where brought the pain of the past 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.110
 the season is also a duty 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.529
 pilot to represent new items and chat with 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.539
 by fans 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:11.120
 last year's car had more 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.190
 downforce so that 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.220
 at the games on the gate went faster than 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.100
 this year, but not so his 40 runs 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.740
 I think 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.860
 this year's car 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.990
 very suitable now in Moscow daniel 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.840
 They will quit only after the grand prix 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:30.060
 find the schedule too tight ahead 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:34.230
 7 crucial steps 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.720
 we have the root of the Russian stage 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.240
 royal race is a little more at 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.150
 of the month all the hotels on the grand prix line 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.120
 Sochi has already booked the finished track 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.870
 say she will be 1 myself 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.120
 I'm on speed and of course for good luck 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:54.270
 turning Russian fans of hope 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.500
 the fact that our first stage is royal 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.200
 racing 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.470
 successful first of all russian 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.470
 the pilot
