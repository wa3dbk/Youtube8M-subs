we're working on a ceremonial mace for

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.520 
we're working on a ceremonial mace for
the<00:00:07.649> university<00:00:08.660> most<00:00:09.660> universities<00:00:10.110> usually

the university most universities usually

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.259 
the university most universities usually
have<00:00:10.710> you<00:00:11.370> know<00:00:11.490> some<00:00:11.639> sort<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:11.910> type<00:00:12.120> of

ceremonial mace for graduations and

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.970 
ceremonial mace for graduations and
other<00:00:14.730> things<00:00:15.230> mu<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.379> different<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.800> way

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
other things mu is different in that way

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.010 
other things mu is different in that way
it<00:00:17.100> hasn't<00:00:17.430> had<00:00:17.580> one<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.600> we<00:00:18.750> took<00:00:18.869> this

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
it hasn't had one so we took this

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.260 
it hasn't had one so we took this
project<00:00:19.380> on<00:00:19.490> well<00:00:20.490> actually<00:00:20.609> right<00:00:20.939> when<00:00:21.119> we

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
project on well actually right when we

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.090 
project on well actually right when we
were<00:00:21.300> talking<00:00:21.720> about<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.170> catalog<00:00:22.650> landed

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
were talking about it a catalog landed

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.150 
were talking about it a catalog landed
on<00:00:23.189> my<00:00:23.340> desk<00:00:23.420> where<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.510> can<00:00:24.660> buy<00:00:24.810> mace<00:00:25.160> you

on my desk where you can buy mace you

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.179 
on my desk where you can buy mace you
can<00:00:26.340> buy<00:00:26.550> for<00:00:27.320> $25,000<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> mace

can buy for $25,000 you can have a mace

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.099 
can buy for $25,000 you can have a mace
custom-made<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.150> that's<00:00:30.720> it's<00:00:30.869> not<00:00:30.990> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
custom-made and that's it's not the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.229 
custom-made and that's it's not the
mizzou<00:00:31.529> way<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:32.189> know<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:32.640> didn't<00:00:32.850> want<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.090> do

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
mizzou way you know we didn't want to do

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.150 
mizzou way you know we didn't want to do
that<00:00:33.270> we<00:00:33.690> wanted<00:00:33.960> something<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.440> more

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
that we wanted something that more

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.970 
that we wanted something that more
thoroughly<00:00:35.489> represented<00:00:36.420> our<00:00:36.510> university<00:00:37.260> so

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
thoroughly represented our university so

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.720 
thoroughly represented our university so
we<00:00:38.700> were<00:00:38.850> able<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.210> get<00:00:39.960> ahold<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.460> some<00:00:41.460> beams

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
we were able to get ahold of some beams

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.819 
we were able to get ahold of some beams
that<00:00:42.149> had<00:00:42.270> been<00:00:42.420> taken<00:00:42.570> out<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.930> Switzer<00:00:43.559> Hall

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
that had been taken out of Switzer Hall

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.010 
that had been taken out of Switzer Hall
the<00:00:44.430> oldest<00:00:44.789> remaining<00:00:45.059> academic<00:00:45.750> building

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the oldest remaining academic building

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.459 
the oldest remaining academic building
on<00:00:46.110> campus<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:47.309> make<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.850> handle<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.260> mace

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
on campus to make the handle of the mace

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.850 
on campus to make the handle of the mace
and<00:00:49.940> then<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.090> happened<00:00:51.480> upon<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.199> College<00:00:52.829> of

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and then we happened upon the College of

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.950 
and then we happened upon the College of
Engineering's<00:00:53.550> 3d<00:00:53.910> printing<00:00:54.390> lab<00:00:54.570> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
Engineering's 3d printing lab and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.560 
Engineering's 3d printing lab and
thought<00:00:55.800> we<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.760> do<00:00:56.850> something<00:00:57.180> really<00:00:57.300> cool

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
thought we can do something really cool

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.770 
thought we can do something really cool
with<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:59.030> you<00:01:00.030> know<00:01:00.120> we've<00:01:00.329> connected

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
with that so you know we've connected

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.439 
with that so you know we've connected
the<00:01:01.170> history<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.100> institution<00:01:02.789> through

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the history of the institution through

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.810 
the history of the institution through
the<00:01:03.629> wood<00:01:03.870> from<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.350> academic<00:01:05.220> building<00:01:05.250> and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the wood from the academic building and

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.359 
the wood from the academic building and
the<00:01:06.600> future<00:01:06.960> looking<00:01:07.260> technology<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.340> 3d

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.020 
the future looking technology of 3d
printing<00:01:09.590> so<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.740> we've<00:01:10.860> combined<00:01:11.400> old<00:01:11.760> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
printing so that we've combined old and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.719 
printing so that we've combined old and
new<00:01:12.350> as<00:01:13.350> part<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> project<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.130> was<00:01:14.310> helped

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
new as part of the project I was helped

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.260 
new as part of the project I was helped
with<00:01:14.909> design<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.670> mechanical<00:01:17.670> components<00:01:18.119> of

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
with design and mechanical components of

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.899 
with design and mechanical components of
the<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:19.049> Mason<00:01:19.409> itself<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.979> made

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
the the Mason itself I made

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.390 
the the Mason itself I made
computer-aided<00:01:21.780> design<00:01:22.170> files<00:01:22.680> CAD<00:01:23.130> files

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
computer-aided design files CAD files

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.730 
computer-aided design files CAD files
and<00:01:23.930> pretty<00:01:24.930> much<00:01:24.960> drew<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.470> all<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
and pretty much drew it all in a

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.310 
and pretty much drew it all in a
computer<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:27.150> way<00:01:27.270> those<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.259> were

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
computer and that way those that were

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.929 
computer and that way those that were
interested<00:01:28.770> could<00:01:28.950> see<00:01:29.159> what<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.729> would<00:01:29.820> look

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
interested could see what it would look

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.480 
interested could see what it would look
like<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.860> they<00:01:31.860> could<00:01:31.920> decide<00:01:32.250> whether

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
like and then they could decide whether

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.649 
like and then they could decide whether
or<00:01:32.579> not<00:01:32.700> they<00:01:32.880> want<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.060> progress<00:01:33.240> with<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
or not they want to progress with the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.130 
or not they want to progress with the
project<00:01:34.619> not<00:01:35.150> as<00:01:36.150> far<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.600> i<00:01:36.659> know<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.930> one's

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
project not as far as i know this one's

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.149 
project not as far as i know this one's
fairly<00:01:38.130> unique<00:01:39.140> not<00:01:40.140> only<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.500> its<00:01:40.710> shape<00:01:40.979> and

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
fairly unique not only in its shape and

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.460 
fairly unique not only in its shape and
structure<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.479> been<00:01:42.659> 3d<00:01:43.110> printed

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.620 
structure but that it's been 3d printed
or<00:01:43.829> parts<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.340> all<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.509> we

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
or parts of it have all that we

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.210 
or parts of it have all that we
remodeled<00:01:46.049> inside<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.350> computer<00:01:46.530> first<00:01:46.950> and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
remodeled inside a computer first and

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.639 
remodeled inside a computer first and
then<00:01:47.640> individual<00:01:48.390> components<00:01:48.899> were<00:01:49.530> then

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
then individual components were then

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.530 
then individual components were then
modeled<00:01:49.979> at<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.159> computer<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.700> 3d<00:01:50.970> printed<00:01:51.329> so

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
modeled at a computer and 3d printed so

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.690 
modeled at a computer and 3d printed so
that<00:01:51.689> they<00:01:51.869> could<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.140> unique<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.890> also

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
that they could be unique and also

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.050 
that they could be unique and also
display<00:01:54.030> the

they<00:02:42.080> call<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.410> double<00:02:42.769> nut<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.190> then

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
they call it the double nut and then

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.820 
they call it the double nut and then
aspire<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.630> then<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:47.090> would<00:02:47.209> be<00:02:47.299> it<00:02:47.830> believe

aspire and then that would be it believe

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.809 
aspire and then that would be it believe
it<00:02:48.950> or<00:02:49.010> not<00:02:49.130> I've<00:02:49.310> volunteered<00:02:49.459> for<00:02:50.030> it<00:02:51.819> they

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
it or not I've volunteered for it they

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.430 
it or not I've volunteered for it they
were<00:02:53.209> looking<00:02:53.330> for<00:02:53.450> somebody<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.870> do<00:02:54.080> it<00:02:54.110> so

were looking for somebody to do it so

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.770 
were looking for somebody to do it so
they<00:02:55.280> said<00:02:55.519> they<00:02:55.610> needed<00:02:55.790> someone<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.690> know

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
if it works her at the university to do

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.330 
if it works her at the university to do
it<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.459> I<00:02:58.760> think<00:02:59.360> it's<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.780> privilege<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.799> ask

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.980 
it and I think it's a privilege to ask
this<00:03:01.850> department<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.450> do<00:03:02.600> it

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
we all have to start from about a five

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.710 
we all have to start from about a five
by<00:03:11.690> five<00:03:12.040> chunk<00:03:13.040> of<00:03:13.160> wood<00:03:13.370> and<00:03:13.580> then<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:14.600> will

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
by five chunk of wood and then it will

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.450 
by five chunk of wood and then it will
you<00:03:15.050> know<00:03:15.170> we'll<00:03:15.890> trim<00:03:16.490> it<00:03:17.260> Square<00:03:18.260> and

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
you know we'll trim it Square and

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.340 
you know we'll trim it Square and
remount<00:03:19.460> it<00:03:19.550> in<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.790> light<00:03:19.970> again<00:03:23.050> this<00:03:24.050> is<00:03:24.320> a

remount it in the light again this is a

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.430 
remount it in the light again this is a
kind<00:03:25.100> of<00:03:25.250> what<00:03:25.970> our<00:03:26.390> department<00:03:26.960> is<00:03:27.020> here<00:03:27.200> for

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
kind of what our department is here for

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.580 
kind of what our department is here for
for<00:03:27.920> things<00:03:28.100> like<00:03:28.190> this<00:03:28.580> we<00:03:29.360> have<00:03:29.600> a<00:03:30.020> lot<00:03:30.560> of

for things like this we have a lot of

00:03:30.590 --> 00:04:02.229 
for things like this we have a lot of
talent

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.820 

it's<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.330> process<00:04:03.569> of<00:04:04.019> taking<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.439> field<00:04:04.620> big

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
it's a process of taking the field big

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.190 
it's a process of taking the field big
band<00:04:05.099> saw<00:04:05.400> then<00:04:06.299> you<00:04:06.420> run<00:04:06.569> across<00:04:06.659> the<00:04:06.959> planer

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
band saw then you run across the planer

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.869 
band saw then you run across the planer
and<00:04:07.379> you<00:04:07.650> take<00:04:07.829> it<00:04:07.860> to<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.099> table<00:04:08.280> saw<00:04:08.610> and

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
and you take it to the table saw and

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.699 
and you take it to the table saw and
then<00:04:09.420> just<00:04:09.599> about<00:04:09.840> whatever<00:04:10.110> you<00:04:10.290> else<00:04:10.530> you

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
then just about whatever you else you

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.920 
then just about whatever you else you
have<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:11.010> do<00:04:11.159> is<00:04:11.280> farce<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.790> in<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.239> squaring

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
have to do is farce and in and squaring

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.440 
have to do is farce and in and squaring
and<00:04:13.230> that<00:04:13.709> sort<00:04:13.920> of<00:04:13.980> thing<00:04:14.099> to<00:04:14.849> get<00:04:15.030> something

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
and that sort of thing to get something

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.590 
and that sort of thing to get something
that<00:04:15.810> will<00:04:16.109> turn<00:04:16.459> equal<00:04:17.459> balanced<00:04:18.419> on<00:04:18.539> the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
that will turn equal balanced on the

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:27.010 
that will turn equal balanced on the
lathe

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.560 

that's<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.440> biggest<00:04:28.880> obstacle<00:04:29.880> you<00:04:30.000> have<00:04:30.030> is

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
that's the biggest obstacle you have is

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.780 
that's the biggest obstacle you have is
trying<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.080> get<00:04:31.260> it<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:32.780> turn<00:04:34.190> with<00:04:35.190> some<00:04:35.490> sort

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
trying to get it to turn with some sort

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.790 
trying to get it to turn with some sort
of<00:04:37.430> consistency<00:04:38.430> in<00:04:38.640> a<00:04:38.700> safe<00:04:38.940> way<00:04:38.990> so<00:04:39.990> that<00:04:40.500> it

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
of consistency in a safe way so that it

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.800 
of consistency in a safe way so that it
doesn't<00:04:40.950> try<00:04:41.130> to<00:04:41.190> fly<00:04:41.430> out<00:04:41.580> of<00:04:41.640> there<00:04:41.850> or<00:04:42.120> tear
