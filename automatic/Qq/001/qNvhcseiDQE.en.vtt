have missed it but you can see this
version<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.500> set<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.309> get<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> table

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
version is a set and you get the table

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.869 
version is a set and you get the table
clamp<00:00:54.780> with<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.070> has<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> table<00:00:56.670> clamp

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
clamp with it so it has the table clamp

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.479 
clamp with it so it has the table clamp
this<00:00:57.390> extension<00:00:57.930> piece<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.649> then<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.280> has

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
this extension piece and then it has

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.060 
this extension piece and then it has
what<00:00:59.730> they<00:00:59.850> call<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.329> spider<00:01:00.809> which<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
up to sort of form what could be

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.390 
up to sort of form what could be
described<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> spider<00:01:09.840> type<00:01:10.260> clamp<00:01:10.830> you

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
described as a spider type clamp you

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.160 
described as a spider type clamp you
also<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.790> instructions<00:01:11.939> about<00:01:12.780> this

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
also have instructions about this

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.050 
also have instructions about this
version<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> clamp<00:01:14.460> how<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> use

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
version of it with the clamp how to use

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.870 
version of it with the clamp how to use
it<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:15.960> each<00:01:16.110> part<00:01:16.470> does<00:01:16.670> pretty<00:01:17.670> much<00:01:17.850> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
it what each part does pretty much a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.270 
it what each part does pretty much a
QuickStart<00:01:18.600> guide<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.710> as<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:19.979> see<00:01:20.159> the

QuickStart guide and as you can see the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.310 
QuickStart guide and as you can see the
clamp<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.729> all<00:01:20.880> plastic<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:21.540> very<00:01:21.900> well

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
clamp it's all plastic but very well

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.190 
clamp it's all plastic but very well
designed<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.340> manufactured<00:01:23.970> has<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> super

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
designed and manufactured has a super

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.710 
designed and manufactured has a super
rubberized<00:01:26.189> piece<00:01:26.700> at<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.909> bottom<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.479> the

rubberized piece at the bottom and the
top<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.229> ensure<00:01:28.350> good<00:01:29.159> grip<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.939> tabletop

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
top to ensure good grip on the tabletop

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.719 
top to ensure good grip on the tabletop
that<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.900> attach<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:32.369> then<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.520> can

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
that you attach it to but then you can

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.149 
that you attach it to but then you can
see<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.210> actually<00:01:33.720> has<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> like<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> lever

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
see it actually has a like a lever

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.190 
see it actually has a like a lever
system<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:36.000> close<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.110> will

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
system to close it so that it will

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.780 
system to close it so that it will
tighten<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.710> up<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.040> then<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.340> button<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.759> the

into place with one lock and then you

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.870 
into place with one lock and then you
have<00:01:48.420> an<00:01:48.570> actual<00:01:48.990> locking<00:01:49.710> mechanism<00:01:50.430> above

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
have an actual locking mechanism above

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.090 
have an actual locking mechanism above
it<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.540> ensure<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.229> can't<00:01:52.560> come<00:01:52.860> off
