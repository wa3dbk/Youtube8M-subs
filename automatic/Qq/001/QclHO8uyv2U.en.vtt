brush I'm gonna be creating two

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.310 
brush I'm gonna be creating two
indentations<00:00:32.070> one<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.149> going<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.480> be<00:00:33.690> bigger

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
indentations one is going to be bigger

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.520 
indentations one is going to be bigger
they<00:00:34.590> are<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.890> one<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:36.000> like<00:00:36.809> more<00:00:37.140> deep

of the hair holds in liquid latex then

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.560 
of the hair holds in liquid latex then
I'm<00:00:58.079> gonna<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.500> creating<00:00:59.219> kind<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.640> separation

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
I'm gonna be creating kind of separation

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.410 
I'm gonna be creating kind of separation
with<00:01:00.960> clay<00:01:01.230> follow<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.190> both<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.030> bums

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
with clay follow the both of the bums

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.880 
with clay follow the both of the bums
because<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.780> wanted<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.290> completely

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
because I wanted to be completely

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.250 
because I wanted to be completely
separate<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:06.180> then<00:01:06.330> I'm<00:01:06.420> gonna<00:01:06.540> let<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.960> dry

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
the skin so it's going to be the blend

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.330 
the skin so it's going to be the blend
out<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:40.750> smoothed<00:01:41.200> out<00:01:41.380> on<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.770> edges<00:01:41.950> and

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
out and smoothed out on the edges and

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.110 
out and smoothed out on the edges and

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
to create an extra rooms in this area

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.830 
to create an extra rooms in this area
like<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.009> base<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.729> women<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.660> create

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
like on the base of the women to create

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.620 
like on the base of the women to create
more<00:02:10.229> like<00:02:10.470> an<00:02:10.649> open<00:02:10.920> effect<00:02:11.520> like<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:12.120> skin

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
more like an open effect like that skin

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.809 
more like an open effect like that skin
is<00:02:12.780> being<00:02:13.020> ripped<00:02:13.380> up<00:02:13.590> there<00:02:13.860> too<00:02:14.160> even<00:02:14.190> where

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
is being ripped up there too even where

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.030 
is being ripped up there too even where
the<00:02:15.090> bone<00:02:15.390> doesn't<00:02:15.690> show<00:02:16.140> I'm<00:02:16.530> also<00:02:16.680> gonna<00:02:16.920> be

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
the bone doesn't show I'm also gonna be
