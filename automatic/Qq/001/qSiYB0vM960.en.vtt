00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 I vegetable base step shocked us 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.879
 will need 2 bell peppers 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.859
 about 300 large bulbs 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.010
 milliliters finely chopped 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.450
 canned tomatoes this is exactly 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.969
 canned in its own juice 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.520
 tomatoes are not pickled need 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.240
 spices mazer crust and red ground 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.310
 pepper 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.300
 then a little more black fragrant 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.210
 add pepper 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.849
 and 3 4 garlic cloves to start everything 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.970
 finely chopped finely chopped i finely 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.090
 sliced onions also fine 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.180
 I cut the pepper into cubes and 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.910
 then finely chop the garlic along the way a couple 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.860
 words about tomato since 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.690
 Moscow good tomatoes can be bought 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.730
 only in season and even then not always 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.289
 I prefer to cook shakshuku with 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.600
 canned tomatoes 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.690
 but it is not necessary you can quite 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.329
 cook it and with fresh tomatoes for 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.129
 Scald this tomato with boiling water 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:02.190
 peel them off then cut 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.559
 remove seeds and liquid about seeds 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.670
 here are these finely cut stenochka 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.220
 and then all the prescription to start we 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.770
 olive oil fry chopped 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.460
 onions fry it somewhere minutes 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.520
 5-7 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.180
 to such a nice piece of gold 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.130
 no need to fry the onions 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.420
 canned fresh tomato can 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.640
 still take such a mix 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:33.299
 fresh tomato tomato paste block y 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.329
 I'm fried all over even I spread 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:41.220
 sliced â€‹â€‹bulgarians and pepper fry more 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.060
 together somewhere a minute 2 3 then here 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.070
 lay out 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.790
 chopped garlic finely chopped 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.700
 garlic and spices and spice I have taken over 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.409
 teaspoon of turmeric jeera is not about 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.740
 half a teaspoon red ground 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.590
 hot pepper spices burn very easily 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.659
 so after you added 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.030
 be sure to mix intensively 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.009
 so that the spices are not burnt fry 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.810
 spices with garlic literally somewhere 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.850
 just a second it will be quite 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.300
 enough and lay out the tomatoes 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.540
 and then here is this tomato mass we 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.100
 stew to the consistency of a standard oven 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.490
 by that is enough to thick 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.050
 State extinguishing time depends on 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.080
 initial moisture by window 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.510
 if you have a lot of fluid that 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.060
 stew will have longer if not enough 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.840
 less time that's how much mass you have 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.300
 thickened I put out and maybe minutes somewhere 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.770
 10-15 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.550
 add a little black ground 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:46.960
 pepper 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:50.320
 you rule tasty salt sugar and vegetable 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.480
 the base is ready traditional shakshuku 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.270
 serves portions of the pan 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.490
 but I have someone who kind of sneezes therefore 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:02.080
 I will cook them in portioned cuffs 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:04.380
 for baking this amount of vegetable 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.720
 the mixture is enough for two such full-fledged 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:14.500
 portions lay out a portion of tomato 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:18.820
 baking pan making holes in 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:22.870
 I drive in these holes by a couple 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:27.690
 eggs, but basically you can drive three eggs 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.220
 if desired, in general, it turned out that 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.700
 Originally I was going to make two 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.830
 portions but cooked three servings that is 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.760
 one such normal full-bodied and 2 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.440
 half ladies turkey like this 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:47.590
 we drive in eggs and put the oven 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:51.060
 We put a little salt oven before 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:54.370
 moment that we have squirrel 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.610
 sprinkle with ground parsley and a nice 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.610
 your appetite
