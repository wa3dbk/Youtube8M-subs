00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.290
 saha him the geeks and the geekettes his 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.570
 video was I hope you did well 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.830
 we go for a short video was are 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.610
 that men in reality is a 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.279
 replay of last Thursday's live in 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.199
 does one of the fights well well worships 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.270
 what's it going to hit very very hard 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.949
 in this fight there so I fall face to 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.480
 it was shouting xelor and heliotrope so that's 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.420
 rather bora in front a always this 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.309
 heliotrope compo plus xelor it's very 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.600
 very bad 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.430
 here on this map it's when he gets 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.500
 place like that it gives the possibility 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.440
 to place a bullying to separate them 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.129
 and another to type on the personal the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.680
 further left 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.180
 good knowing that the sep to mega mega 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.829
 interesting but when there is a zoo 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.980
 for example and especially when the zobal 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.329
 and whoever is far from the two characters 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.520
 there on one side of the other often the zobal 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.780
 comes next to his mates for their 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.300
 give the shields and be able to do 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.250
 bullying like that at the beginning it helps to 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.980
 Split and the team and prevent them the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.650
 Shield points on everyone 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.519
 so that's pretty good but I 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.979
 do not know then I would have to 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.360
 look at replacing two portals 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.920
 if there is a way to make a 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.340
 placement of portals that would allow 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.720
 taunt about on one of the two 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.700
 but it's not easy because in fact 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.990
 the money portals for places and we 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.520
 does not have a huge reach 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.710
 so here we have to do with what we have 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.530
 I rage like a headphone port with my 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.030
 ecaflip so far it's true that the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.560
 lack of placement like that of both 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.000
 portals next to each other it's 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.670
 that it does not give one is a huge 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.990
 well worn there is a huge stuff pm what 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.310
 so that's good it's true it's 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.750
 still a little bit a fault what 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.100
 is also possible with heliotrope on 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.869
 this map is to put the first 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.909
 group portal pretty much where he 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.649
 is put and put one more behind 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.149
 next to my other allies so that my 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.770
 allies 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.490
 the other two characters what's up and 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.020
 then know if pmu pm 10 pm gratos what 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.430
 just right hertz the portal ends up 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.340
 at the other end of the hand there the 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.170
 heliotrope 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.670
 in front of gold it surprised me that he had 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.859
 fact that investment there because it would 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.409
 that they offer me to put him the swords 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:05.299
 diop right in the middle what so 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.340
 Well here it is almost 2000 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.569
 damage in a little bit less 1800 of 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.129
 guys like that before they even 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.510
 so start there it's the turn of 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.180
 sacred then we'll see if I could 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.970
 whistle a sacrifice or not he equates 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.019
 200 points of life pretty much so when 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.940
 even at 70 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.879
 he sacrificed on his heliotrope 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.680
 but suddenly his zeal and unprotected 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.080
 him at 3400 points of life leghzal so 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.430
 it's not huge when it's too 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.069
 strong in my team so there with 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.340
 the other bridges approach the portals 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:42.319
 with Thai rice and watch there kikoo kameha 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:48.040
 kikoo kamya polita is 750 damage x 2 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.040
 through the map that pecks 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.380
 then the other what is it that makes these 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.700
 portals are added tac tac and tac of which 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.050
 he's doing the same thing he's saving me 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.510
 the same fate I did to his friend 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.760
 except that he uses it to hide so 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.320
 it's kind of earthy so the sense of smell 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.580
 allows to have three more pa 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:17.410
 so that's a lot of ass it's done 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:19.709
 but I could not really use 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.650
 portals to type log zale so 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.910
 I'm going live 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.970
 I hesitate to do wrong I say good 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.140
 go I master the pages of me 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.140
 to type alone 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.260
 Well, I believe in the consecration 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.050
 did not have any resistance in 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.550
 huge percentage so that's going to do 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.700
 maybe a little bit of a putsch when I 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.650
 am going to hit on it 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.940
 the xi good then leghzel the series that I 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.390
 ask me the question why is this 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.830
 that he came to type in my yop what he 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.110
 could have also gone on my heliotrope 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.569
 he could have made the kill so big of 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.800
 know from them what elected me to 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.780
 temple is really not a lot of him 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.989
 although it has an effect backlash 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.900
 there was still a little good there 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:11.680
 the power of yop in action is 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.180
 sarah two countries that are doing very badly 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.920
 of the big lag he would be the guy in the face 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.019
 vigo the arrival of the court to the great lakes 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:24.200
 on the beta it was the opening day 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:27.940
 of the beta stÃ© Thursday julian 9 april the 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.940
 bag ridon that in me of absorption 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.820
 so around my heliotrope there from 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.010
 blow is that he laid portals that 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.400
 left him open so he too will go 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:47.600
 bite your fingers 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.060
 look at that huge 1200 taunts at 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.830
 taunting 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.710
 poor sakhri there he must regret 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.270
 to have made the sacrifice circle to say 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.560
 oh damn good here I messed up a little bit 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.960
 embarrassed I lost 3 peace with my 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.669
 heliotrope I have a little galley but 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.310
 it's true that this lag and there is the 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.840
 video is accelerated I accelerated the 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.310
 speed of the image but otherwise it's true 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.419
 that this lag is not bad but in fact 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.040
 it's weird because when I look 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.350
 the ping the ping is not very very high 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.229
 1.54 second is classic 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.550
 dofus but yet I blunder it 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.600
 opponents also the war so I know 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.600
 not really where it comes from 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.160
 so here it is attention there it will do 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.690
 pleasure four portals the cases fiez 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.640
 you see the preview it goes up 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.230
 until 2049 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.300
 even if in the end there must be a 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.610
 bangs on the preview because 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.940
 that it's not so bad in the end but look 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.260
 the little bluff at 1082 that kills the sakhri 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.840
 so theoretically it could have done 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.210
 even worse but well here's a little 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.140
 bluff at 1082 and for that I told myself 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.730
 I was going to give you the video 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.190
 it's true that it makes it really 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.420
 pleasure it's really nawak do 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.230
 anything dofus game 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:58.030
 oh there we laugh we laugh but good at 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.890
 final is still sad for this 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.820
 game that had a bright future ahead of him 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:07.090
 they did anything with so 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.920
 Here in any case it remains well roxx him 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.570
 alas I was looking for my family I had 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.630
 not put the shortcut no but I have not 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.650
 had time to prove since it was 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.130
 the opening of the beta I had not 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.960
 still put all my sisters all that 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.000
 but well here are these good fights 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.740
 nag that typed hard enough in the face it's 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.730
 pity that here if he had killed my elioth 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.560
 fast might have a little 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.210
 chance to get out but hey it's 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.350
 like that is life 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.490
 I hope you liked the little video 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.080
 do not forget a small commentary 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.620
 inch to this video was I disconnected 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.620
 has more
