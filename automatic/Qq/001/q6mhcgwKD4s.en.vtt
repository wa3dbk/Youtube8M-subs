00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
back in the shop exploring how CNC

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.950 
back in the shop exploring how CNC
routing<00:00:15.309> can<00:00:15.429> enhance<00:00:15.910> our<00:00:16.240> woodworking

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
routing can enhance our woodworking

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.290 
routing can enhance our woodworking
experience<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:18.520> know<00:00:18.640> I<00:00:18.670> can<00:00:19.029> drill<00:00:19.270> holes

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
experience you know I can drill holes

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.420 
experience you know I can drill holes
pretty<00:00:19.810> accurately<00:00:20.290> and<00:00:20.770> I<00:00:20.950> can<00:00:21.160> drill<00:00:21.400> a

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
pretty accurately and I can drill a

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.310 
pretty accurately and I can drill a
bunch<00:00:21.640> of<00:00:21.849> them<00:00:22.000> but<00:00:22.540> what<00:00:22.689> if<00:00:22.779> I<00:00:22.869> had<00:00:22.990> to<00:00:23.080> drill

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
bunch of them but what if I had to drill

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.470 
bunch of them but what if I had to drill
over<00:00:23.920> 200<00:00:24.550> holes<00:00:24.760> and<00:00:25.000> drill<00:00:25.029> them<00:00:25.359> all

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
over 200 holes and drill them all

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.570 
over 200 holes and drill them all
perfectly<00:00:25.720> like<00:00:26.619> say<00:00:26.859> if<00:00:26.980> I<00:00:27.130> was<00:00:27.250> going<00:00:27.490> to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
perfectly like say if I was going to

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.290 
perfectly like say if I was going to
make<00:00:27.789> a<00:00:28.080> cribbage<00:00:29.080> board<00:00:29.310> well<00:00:30.310> that's<00:00:30.910> a<00:00:31.029> task

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
make a cribbage board well that's a task

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.509 
make a cribbage board well that's a task
that<00:00:31.480> the<00:00:31.960> CNC<00:00:32.439> router<00:00:32.650> can<00:00:32.890> do<00:00:33.070> perfectly

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:33.519 
that the CNC router can do perfectly

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:36.509 
that the CNC router can do perfectly
every<00:00:34.000> time<00:00:34.239> and<00:00:34.570> so<00:00:35.170> I'm<00:00:35.620> gonna<00:00:35.830> use<00:00:36.100> the<00:00:36.280> CNC

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519 
every time and so I'm gonna use the CNC

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:38.939 
every time and so I'm gonna use the CNC
today<00:00:37.000> to<00:00:37.059> help<00:00:37.269> me<00:00:37.480> make<00:00:37.690> some<00:00:37.900> gifts<00:00:38.350> some

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
today to help me make some gifts some

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:40.680 
today to help me make some gifts some
cribbage<00:00:39.309> boards<00:00:39.670> that<00:00:40.000> I'll<00:00:40.150> be<00:00:40.239> able<00:00:40.330> to<00:00:40.479> use

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
cribbage boards that I'll be able to use

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.780 
cribbage boards that I'll be able to use
later<00:00:40.930> so<00:00:41.350> let's<00:00:41.890> get<00:00:42.040> started<00:00:42.430> and<00:00:42.549> I'll<00:00:42.640> show

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
later so let's get started and I'll show

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.410 
later so let's get started and I'll show
you<00:00:42.820> how<00:00:43.030> we<00:00:43.089> do<00:00:43.299> it<00:00:44.580> one<00:00:45.580> thing<00:00:45.610> a<00:00:45.909> CNC<00:00:46.390> router

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
you how we do it one thing a CNC router

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.759 
you how we do it one thing a CNC router
can<00:00:46.870> do<00:00:47.019> really<00:00:47.229> well<00:00:47.559> is<00:00:49.110> drill<00:00:50.110> holes<00:00:50.379> and

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
can do really well is drill holes and

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.180 
can do really well is drill holes and
drill<00:00:50.799> an<00:00:51.489> accurate<00:00:52.000> pattern<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:53.710> it<00:00:53.830> doesn't

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
drill an accurate pattern but it doesn't

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.890 
drill an accurate pattern but it doesn't
need<00:00:54.309> to<00:00:54.460> be<00:00:54.489> registered<00:00:54.909> off<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.420> side<00:00:55.629> of<00:00:55.659> a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
need to be registered off the side of a

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.829 
need to be registered off the side of a
square<00:00:56.580> board<00:00:57.580> or<00:00:57.790> anything<00:00:57.970> like<00:00:58.180> that<00:00:58.239> we

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
square board or anything like that we

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.990 
square board or anything like that we
can<00:00:59.019> put<00:00:59.199> that<00:00:59.320> pattern<00:00:59.769> perfectly<00:01:00.280> into<00:01:00.699> an

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
can put that pattern perfectly into an

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.500 
can put that pattern perfectly into an
odd<00:01:01.659> shaped<00:01:02.290> piece<00:01:02.470> of<00:01:02.619> wood<00:01:02.769> so<00:01:03.119> I'm<00:01:04.119> gonna<00:01:04.299> do

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
odd shaped piece of wood so I'm gonna do

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.810 
odd shaped piece of wood so I'm gonna do
that<00:01:04.689> with<00:01:04.869> this<00:01:05.080> cut-off<00:01:05.590> limb<00:01:05.920> section<00:01:06.640> I

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
that with this cut-off limb section I

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.640 
that with this cut-off limb section I
think<00:01:07.090> it'll<00:01:07.450> make<00:01:07.510> a<00:01:07.630> cool<00:01:07.990> cribbage<00:01:08.619> board

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
think it'll make a cool cribbage board

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.970 
think it'll make a cool cribbage board
and<00:01:08.979> I<00:01:09.010> hope<00:01:09.189> you'll<00:01:09.369> agree<00:01:10.350> we've<00:01:11.350> taken<00:01:11.650> care

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.000 
clamped to the deck to check the program
this<00:01:58.420> gave<00:01:58.690> me<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.900> added<00:01:59.440> benefit<00:01:59.830> of<00:01:59.860> being

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
this gave me the added benefit of being

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.890 
this gave me the added benefit of being
able<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.520> place<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:00.970> organically<00:02:01.630> shaped

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
able to place the organically shaped

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.210 
able to place the organically shaped
piece<00:02:02.110> of<00:02:02.290> stock<00:02:02.500> on<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.860> deck<00:02:03.040> and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
piece of stock on the deck and

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.070

so I could easily locate where the

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.859 
so I could easily locate where the

complete the handy thing is that once

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.059 
complete the handy thing is that once
you<00:02:17.120> get<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.420> cribbage<00:02:17.720> board<00:02:17.750> done<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.920> can

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
you get the cribbage board done you can

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.530 
you get the cribbage board done you can
get<00:02:19.190> busy<00:02:19.430> doing<00:02:19.670> other<00:02:19.849> tasks<00:02:20.330> while<00:02:20.420> the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
get busy doing other tasks while the
