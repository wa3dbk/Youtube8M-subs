00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.910
 Patrick Luck and you would have to victory 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.410
 the first think what has happened 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:46.440
 in the second has changed everything 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:51.809
 yes but I think we have exactly how 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.610
 in 100 shoot we stay on the ball 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.719
 The feeling is quite nervous he 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.059
 actually had to come exactly that 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.469
 made what we wanted to do 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.469
 we have a certain heaviness 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.610
 started and after that we have that 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.899
 easy and wants the football happens and 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.570
 After that we were a bit unsure 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.380
 and then we caught ourselves in it 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.380
 says gas given 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.920
 the good more at home and plays from 19 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.090
 clock are still even the 3 1 shoots and 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.819
 can be feted beautiful 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.909
 yes that's it's like I said this is 

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:27.619
 then feel good where you get the knock three times 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.619
 I look at the gate in 90 minutes 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.189
 take the positive and thanks to this 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.700
 time the normal nice 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.770
 congratulations to the victory 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.600
 which was second different from first 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.790
 halftime struggled early 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.310
 i think i have it in the beginning 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.259
 really well done we have ours 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.369
 had pulled a couple of game 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.090
 possibilities and then we go as 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.979
 unhappy 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.810
 in residue but then I have in the 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.520
 210 of course, still in the first as 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.189
 a bit unsettled in the 19 but 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.539
 they have a lot of stretch over long distances 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.130
 played well and then at the end 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.719
 put it for the course 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.569
 what you, the trainer with her 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.539
 give so that we continue playing brave 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.069
 should and that 1 0 we have it 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.349
 Last time the players we have that 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.049
 single given away now we were the 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.430
 that had turned and that was important 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.640
 we just had the courage to us 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.110
 play and that has shown again and 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.739
 wifo is always such a goal again 3 1 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.760
 to win 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.079
 the home I think we do not care if it 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.660
 a derby is or generally normal 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:31.569
 game today was definitely yes 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.349
 important because we last week old the 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.390
 the english week is good now 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.910
 have survived and now yes I say 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.720
 times seven points took last three 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.160
 play and very well done beside the 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.819
 Positive the next weeks with and 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.959
 thank you very much 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.120
 to today always with the red 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.829
 radiate in the year 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.450
 Great game of the second beautiful goal 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.650
 made 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.019
 yes, I think a bit of luck belongs 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.060
 to that all on marcel 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.609
 I focus on his corner 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.180
 that we are our most dangerous man 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.970
 want to take out 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.269
 he gave me the free space 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.360
 and then the strongest 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.890
 good 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.020
 a little bit of luck that there is something behind 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.140
 was running so it was everything to me 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.310
 wurscht some combatants has 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.020
 a bit respectful at the beginning 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.490
 cottbus that want to play so many 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.890
 did not go that well as that went 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.030
 second a bit better 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.350
 yes I think that we are in the 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.360
 have made some time ago 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.690
 that we did not want to lose here like that 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.760
 a little courage of despair sat 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.220
 said a lot but it just was not 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.270
 had a lot to lose and that's why 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.320
 because could play forward courageously 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.590
 and then rewarded in the end 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.209
 been 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.650
 you have the right one for the end 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.540
 guys want to play longer that has 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.100
 a fun but words like one 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.610
 team so in and second 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.140
 half 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.450
 yes I think you have noticed that so 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.860
 none of us wanted to lose here and 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.060
 after the 1 1 still has the feeling 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.150
 that there is no draw here 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.830
 want and can also be said after the 2 1 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.170
 that we are not just defending it now 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.660
 but also if possible 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.000
 the third refill what we then in the 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.980
 last weeks have missed and been 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.720
 a good mood and space and how 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.410
 we are all happy that the week 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.610
 is over but also won before 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.940
 just then take the positive in the 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.080
 next week thank you very much now 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.640
 finally from the beginning at home 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.180
 then also plays against the old one 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.340
 society 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.530
 Thun plays well and for the game 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.750
 not so much more fear 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.100
 you already have a bit I mean that 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.180
 a special game for me 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.720
 I think so already 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.860
 said cottbus in dresden are games 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.030
 because I'm so ex-club because of me 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.460
 are and he prepares himself or herself 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.450
 it motivates a little more than 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.970
 is not supposed to be the case 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.470
 Of course, every game you can do yourself 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.580
 but would have to prepare one 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.160
 special game for me if the 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.570
 I enjoy and of course you have one 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.010
 one prepares oneself in such plays and 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.690
 momentary spot more pieces 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.090
 if you play against the ex or 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.229
 against ex colleagues partly and yes there 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.640
 I was already looking forward to it and 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.860
 I think that we are really good game 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.300
 have come and maybe would have 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.580
 you have to do this before 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.400
 not succeeded 10 back but this time 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.040
 not only 90 minutes but in the 15th 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.330
 and 20 degrees still okay that one then 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.070
 a little something can correct 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.320
 that was our half time and made 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.700
 I think the second one has seen 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.800
 that we countered a bit 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.600
 good luck with that with the pale 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.190
 niklas really good holds yes and then 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.420
 Do you meet such a game and was for me? 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.340
 It was important for the team or 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.320
 important that we do the 3 1 that we do 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.230
 close the bag and I'm glad that 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.220
 they hit me hit before 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.840
 I'm proud of the team 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.700
 you will also have one with you 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.140
 nervousness noticed at the end so well 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.680
 clean a even in the shot 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.090
 submitted 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.460
 I believe in the last home game last 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.690
 year he did not go in today but not quite 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.520
 I'm a little glad that it is 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.030
 then for yourself then too 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.690
 it is going on well 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.250
 yes I mean, of course, you play 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.500
 does not have the practice in the game 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.200
 Sovereignty if you want to be if you are 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.670
 not always plays but the shot 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.440
 I did not want to go in with intention 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.550
 We would be the cottbuser I would have 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.470
 probably then banned in cottbus 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.410
 aside I was shooting the long corner 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.490
 drag in the area and that the 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.930
 I'm not happening I'm not 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.790
 Striker I 'm defense of that 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.080
 that would be me too i believe my old ones 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.340
 Days do not even learn great from 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.760
 so I'm glad we won 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.720
 to have 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.940
 that was a really good one 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.860
 have brought team performance only 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.780
 That's the way things are going so well 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.760
 ok thanks so much the whole 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.830
 positive we will inform you with guys and 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.000
 then next seen for me 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.000
 thanks to the temptation
