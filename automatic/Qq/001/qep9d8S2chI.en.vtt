00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
the cold and that's for basic use if

something like that something is going
to<00:00:31.470> conduct<00:00:31.650> cold<00:00:32.130> into<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.579> your<00:00:32.850> hands<00:00:33.059> will

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
to conduct cold into you your hands will

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.090 
to conduct cold into you your hands will
get<00:00:33.390> much<00:00:33.570> colder<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.050> course<00:00:34.260> these<00:00:34.890> are<00:00:34.950> just

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
get much colder of course these are just

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.979 
get much colder of course these are just
insulation<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.820> protection<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.660> from<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
insulation and protection and from the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.979 
insulation and protection and from the
cold<00:00:37.140> there's<00:00:37.829> no<00:00:38.129> magic<00:00:38.489> involved<00:00:38.760> here<00:00:39.149> you

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
cold there's no magic involved here you

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.900 
cold there's no magic involved here you
know<00:00:40.110> eventually<00:00:40.770> your<00:00:41.070> hands<00:00:41.250> will<00:00:41.489> get<00:00:41.640> cold

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
know eventually your hands will get cold

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.119 
know eventually your hands will get cold
and<00:00:42.149> eventually<00:00:42.690> it'll<00:00:43.590> have<00:00:43.680> problems<00:00:44.040> but

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
and eventually it'll have problems but

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.290 
and eventually it'll have problems but
these<00:00:44.280> things<00:00:44.430> will<00:00:44.579> protect<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:44.969> for<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.149> long

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
these things will protect you for a long

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.970 
these things will protect you for a long
time<00:00:45.510> they're<00:00:45.719> really<00:00:45.809> good<00:00:46.110> they<00:00:46.559> also<00:00:46.710> have

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
time they're really good they also have

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.340 
time they're really good they also have
the<00:00:47.129> abrasion<00:00:47.879> protection<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.840> they<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.320> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
the abrasion protection and they have a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.560 
the abrasion protection and they have a
little<00:00:49.530> bit<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.800> impact<00:00:50.250> resistance<00:00:50.789> meaning

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
little bit of impact resistance meaning

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.209 
little bit of impact resistance meaning
they<00:00:51.809> kind<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.050> pad<00:00:52.260> everything<00:00:52.800> because<00:00:53.070> they

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
they kind of pad everything because they

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.069 
they kind of pad everything because they
have<00:00:53.340> about<00:00:53.550> twice<00:00:53.879> as<00:00:54.090> much<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.629> nylon

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
have about twice as much of the nylon

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.880 
have about twice as much of the nylon
and<00:00:55.399> very<00:00:56.399> little<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.059> elastic<00:00:57.890> material

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
and very little of the elastic material

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.540 
and very little of the elastic material
but<00:00:59.160> twice<00:00:59.370> as<00:00:59.520> much<00:00:59.640> nylon<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.660> polymer<00:01:01.620> that

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
but twice as much nylon the polymer that

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.160 
but twice as much nylon the polymer that
they<00:01:02.670> use<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> grip<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> little<00:01:04.049> bit

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
they use on the grip is a little bit

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.320 
they use on the grip is a little bit
thicker<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.189> also<00:01:05.580> hide<00:01:05.850> repellant

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
thicker and it's also hide repellant

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.870 
thicker and it's also hide repellant
technology<00:01:06.869> involved<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.350> these<00:01:07.560> gloves

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
technology involved in these gloves

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.810 
technology involved in these gloves
meaning<00:01:08.880> water<00:01:09.570> doesn't<00:01:10.140> go<00:01:10.320> through<00:01:10.619> this

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.859 

covering<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.360> doesn't<00:01:15.600> go<00:01:15.659> through<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
covering it doesn't go through the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.960 
covering it doesn't go through the
gripping<00:01:16.229> surface<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.830> actually<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
gripping surface and actually the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.550 
gripping surface and actually the
backside<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.479> fairly<00:01:18.689> resistant<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.470> as

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
backside is fairly resistant to it as

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.770 
backside is fairly resistant to it as
well<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.040> that's<00:01:20.670> another<00:01:20.909> reason<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.630> your

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
well so that's another reason that your

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.350 
well so that's another reason that your
hands<00:01:21.990> will<00:01:22.170> stay<00:01:22.350> warm<00:01:22.799> or<00:01:23.400> longer<00:01:23.790> because

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
hands will stay warm or longer because

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.390 
hands will stay warm or longer because
of<00:01:24.509> course<00:01:24.720> once<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.259> cold<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.860> wet<00:01:26.100> you

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
of course once you get cold and wet you

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.300 
of course once you get cold and wet you
get<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.240> cold<00:01:27.950> like<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.009> said<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.220> have

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
get really cold like I said I have

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.649 
get really cold like I said I have
tested<00:01:29.610> these<00:01:29.670> things<00:01:29.880> down<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.150> about<00:01:30.270> 26

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
tested these things down to about 26

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.429 
tested these things down to about 26
below<00:01:30.950> anywhere<00:01:31.950> from<00:01:32.100> about<00:01:32.250> 10<00:01:32.610> degrees

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
below anywhere from about 10 degrees

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.319 
below anywhere from about 10 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:34.439> down<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:35.009> 26<00:01:35.640> below<00:01:35.820> these<00:01:36.119> things

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
Fahrenheit down to 26 below these things

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.380 
Fahrenheit down to 26 below these things
are<00:01:36.450> fantastic<00:01:37.369> they're<00:01:38.369> really<00:01:38.640> good<00:01:38.850> I've

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
are fantastic they're really good I've

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.480 
are fantastic they're really good I've
tested<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> hide<00:01:40.140> repellent<00:01:40.650> technology<00:01:41.280> and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
tested the hide repellent technology and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.910 
tested the hide repellent technology and
it<00:01:41.579> does<00:01:41.759> work<00:01:42.000> keeps<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.450> pretty<00:01:42.600> dry<00:01:42.920> they

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
it does work keeps you pretty dry they

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.940 
it does work keeps you pretty dry they
keep<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.189> warm<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:45.320> rate<00:01:46.320> these<00:01:46.439> things<00:01:46.500> -<00:01:46.770> 5

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
keep you warm I rate these things - 5

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.190 
keep you warm I rate these things - 5
out<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.159> 5<00:01:47.399> they're<00:01:47.640> very<00:01:47.880> good<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.390> they

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
out of 5 they're very good and they

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.170 
out of 5 they're very good and they
actually<00:01:49.380> don't<00:01:49.710> cost<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.159> much<00:01:50.430> more<00:01:50.729> than

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.539
