you haven't seen that yet but one of the
issues<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.580> raised<00:00:29.910> was<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.300> fact<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.599> army

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
issues I raised was the fact that army

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.290 
issues I raised was the fact that army
of<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.230> Dead<00:00:31.470> was<00:00:31.679> going<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.980> be<00:00:32.070> taking<00:00:32.579> away

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300

decays<00:00:36.630> were<00:00:36.780> going<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.380> ability

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
decays were going to have this ability

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.459

now<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.730> seems<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.120> wasn't<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.629> only<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.290> who

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
ability removals and he said something

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.270 
ability removals and he said something
very<00:01:08.070> very<00:01:08.820> interesting<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.869> his<00:01:10.080> response<00:01:10.280> he

but one thing they're talking about

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.359 
but one thing they're talking about
right<00:01:17.820> now<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.360> army<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> Dead<00:01:19.439> it's

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
right now is army of the Dead it's

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.609 
right now is army of the Dead it's
something<00:01:20.700> iconic<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.780> being<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.200> death<00:01:22.380> knight

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
something iconic to being a death knight

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.260 
something iconic to being a death knight
and<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:22.950> something<00:01:23.280> they're<00:01:23.549> considering

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and it's something they're considering

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.510 
and it's something they're considering
bringing<00:01:24.689> back<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.590> might<00:01:25.890> mean<00:01:26.130> they<00:01:26.280> take

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
bringing back it might mean they take

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.780 
bringing back it might mean they take
something<00:01:26.850> else<00:01:27.000> instead<00:01:27.330> maybe<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:29.130> this

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
something else instead maybe not so this

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.760 
something else instead maybe not so this
is<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> really<00:01:30.450> really<00:01:30.810> great<00:01:31.229> thing<00:01:31.590> because

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
is a really really great thing because

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.679 
is a really really great thing because
it<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.220> proves<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.700> world<00:01:33.450> warcraft

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
it just proves that world warcraft

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.970 
by a movement impairing effect you will
generate<00:03:36.330> three<00:03:36.720> runic<00:03:37.020> power<00:03:37.050> every<00:03:37.800> one

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
generate three runic power every one

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.790 
generate three runic power every one
second<00:03:38.430> for<00:03:38.640> ten<00:03:38.910> seconds<00:03:39.600> so<00:03:40.260> that's<00:03:40.440> all<00:03:40.620> the

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
second for ten seconds so that's all the

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.140 
second for ten seconds so that's all the
new<00:03:40.950> glyphs<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.430> we<00:03:41.610> have<00:03:41.820> so<00:03:42.000> far

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
new glyphs that we have so far

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.270 
new glyphs that we have so far
definitely<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.840> couple<00:03:43.260> of<00:03:43.350> very<00:03:43.620> good<00:03:43.830> ones<00:03:44.070> in

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
definitely a couple of very good ones in

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.760 
definitely a couple of very good ones in
