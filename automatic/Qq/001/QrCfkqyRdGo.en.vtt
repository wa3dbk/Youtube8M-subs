00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:03.260
 this poses 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.310
 eighteen 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.730
 the solution that I found to put back my three nights body in a 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.149
 suitcase as well as the remote control and 6 10 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:14.759

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.230
 the father cbs 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.060
 ps in Alsace 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.849
 it's been a long time since I'm a solution for everything without surrender 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:22.199
 in the island 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.579
 I want to show that I wrote from English ross 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.979
 which I have seen in several pieces 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.979
 and I made the form of Gaddafi 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.790
 to be able the big time council for the calaisis 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.760
 but I did the most beautiful 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.000
 depressed the most 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.610
 in fact here 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.610
 it's all found 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.630
 jack wall street 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.080
 I did this 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.150
 but three years ago 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.150
 dear parents of my jurisdiction 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.300
 every time 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.890
 lenari come here 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.800
 to lock the key 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.800
 as favorite but in any reverse direction 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
 group account 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.130
 on the eve 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.930
 for this match against the om 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.460
 access 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.140
 I'm shaking 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.670
 of this threshold 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.490
 Secondly 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.000
 voting intentions 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.540
 heavy 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.540
 but on the very basis that yesterday 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.350
 then as you can see 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.630
 all stays in the lead 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.300
 we are in the middle of a race 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.280
 here I have more 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.690
 the place for the ism index 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.309
 so I have two boxes 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:11.019
 with austria 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.609
 the place cap I used a lot to put down the price 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:21.889
 I knew that if the vote 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.889
 now 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.769
 right here 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:36.229
 Inc. 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.299
 Why 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.109
 then as here 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.279
 a handful the women of gay couples 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:46.210
 eliminated 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.679
 - if it is to wear 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:50.199
 opposition 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:51.650
 so to fit in 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.650
 perfectly 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:58.639
 so 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.589
 a simple workout 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:02.049
 mua 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.239
 and I did not make a piece of myself 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.279
 Austria is known for its novels 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.279
 when I come back to the transport studio 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:14.389
 quite simply 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.389
 everything is nickel 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.839
 but can carry in any sense 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:29.769
 filming then maybe we could get acquainted 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.119
 l 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.119
 these are my three 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:36.189
 now here is the doubled
