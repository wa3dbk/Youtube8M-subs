little book we did making system it's a

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.460 
little book we did making system it's a
German<00:00:05.180> system<00:00:05.720> it's<00:00:05.900> been<00:00:06.109> on<00:00:06.230> the<00:00:06.319> market

German system it's been on the market
since<00:00:06.970> 1935<00:00:07.970> so<00:00:08.029> it's<00:00:08.480> not<00:00:08.599> a<00:00:08.660> new<00:00:08.900> gimmick<00:00:09.110> and

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
since 1935 so it's not a new gimmick and

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.980 
since 1935 so it's not a new gimmick and
it's<00:00:09.980> all<00:00:10.160> based<00:00:10.460> on<00:00:10.670> the<00:00:10.820> golden<00:00:11.000> rule<00:00:11.480> now

it's all based on the golden rule now
the<00:00:12.050> golden<00:00:12.469> rule<00:00:12.650> means<00:00:12.980> it<00:00:13.130> doesn't<00:00:13.370> matter

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
you measure from that little guard today

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.170 
you measure from that little guard today
that's<00:00:27.019> the<00:00:27.140> size<00:00:27.349> of<00:00:27.560> our<00:00:27.680> feet<00:00:27.980> so<00:00:28.670> we<00:00:28.699> want

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
that's the size of our feet so we want

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.540 
that's the size of our feet so we want
on<00:00:29.269> this<00:00:29.510> universe<00:00:30.019> portions<00:00:30.710> that<00:00:30.859> we<00:00:31.010> call

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
on this universe portions that we call

on this universe portions that we call
and<00:00:33.040> we<00:00:34.420> take<00:00:35.420> our<00:00:35.870> measurements<00:00:36.440> quite

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
and we take our measurements quite

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.830 
and we take our measurements quite
different<00:00:37.219> from<00:00:37.399> the<00:00:37.670> ordering<00:00:38.120> integral

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
different from the ordering integral

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.380

cross comical pattern so you will see

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.190 
cross comical pattern so you will see
that<00:01:24.680> might<00:01:25.040> affect<00:01:25.400> can<00:01:25.640> rotate<00:01:25.970> around<00:01:26.420> 100

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
that might affect can rotate around 100

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.499 
that might affect can rotate around 100
times<00:01:27.530> now<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.189> I've<00:01:28.759> got<00:01:28.970> all<00:01:29.210> these<00:01:29.450> little
