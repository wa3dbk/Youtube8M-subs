eyelid surgery to tighten excess skin
I'm<00:00:30.330> wondering<00:00:31.330> what<00:00:31.540> would<00:00:31.570> be<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:31.990> best

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
I'm wondering what would be the best

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
a cosmetic oculofacial plastic surgeon I

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.940 
a cosmetic oculofacial plastic surgeon I
deal<00:01:22.420> with<00:01:22.600> this<00:01:22.720> kind<00:01:23.200> of<00:01:23.259> question<00:01:23.710> every

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
deal with this kind of question every

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.600 
deal with this kind of question every
day<00:01:24.130> and<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:26.320> know<00:01:26.440> there's<00:01:26.770> it's<00:01:27.009> important

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
day and you know there's it's important

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.370 
day and you know there's it's important
to<00:01:27.789> really<00:01:28.470> understand<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:30.070> limits<00:01:30.580> of

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
to really understand the limits of

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.039 
to really understand the limits of
lasers<00:01:32.380> and<00:01:32.409> surgery<00:01:33.369> and<00:01:33.460> also<00:01:33.850> have<00:01:34.630> a<00:01:34.659> clear

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
lasers and surgery and also have a clear

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.960 
lasers and surgery and also have a clear
understanding<00:01:35.260> of<00:01:35.770> outcome<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:36.670> of<00:01:36.760> course

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
understanding of outcome and of course

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.600 
understanding of outcome and of course
that's<00:01:37.119> why<00:01:37.330> you<00:01:37.390> submit<00:01:37.840> a<00:01:37.869> new<00:01:38.049> question<00:01:38.610> but

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
that's why you submit a new question but

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.060 
that's why you submit a new question but
there's<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.350> three-dimensional<00:01:41.350> aspect<00:01:41.950> of

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
there's a three-dimensional aspect of

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.399 
there's a three-dimensional aspect of
this<00:01:42.280> that<00:01:42.580> we<00:01:42.759> can't<00:01:43.180> address<00:01:43.420> without<00:01:44.200> a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
this that we can't address without a

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.920 
this that we can't address without a
physical<00:01:44.830> exam<00:01:45.369> so<00:01:46.330> when<00:01:46.540> someone<00:01:46.900> like

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
physical exam so when someone like

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.080 
physical exam so when someone like
yourself<00:01:47.259> comes<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:47.920> my<00:01:48.070> practice<00:01:48.580> this<00:01:48.909> is

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
yourself comes to my practice this is

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.560 
yourself comes to my practice this is
what<00:01:49.240> I<00:01:49.270> typically<00:01:49.720> do<00:01:50.549> I'll<00:01:51.549> have<00:01:52.150> them<00:01:52.360> sit

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
what I typically do I'll have them sit

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.830 
what I typically do I'll have them sit
down<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:53.020> I'll<00:01:53.829> apply<00:01:54.280> a<00:01:54.610> q-tip<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:55.600> just

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
down and I'll apply a q-tip and just

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.039 
down and I'll apply a q-tip and just
kind<00:01:56.020> of<00:01:56.049> roll<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.560> skin<00:01:56.970> underneath<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.750> show

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
kind of roll the skin underneath to show

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.760 
kind of roll the skin underneath to show
what<00:01:59.470> would<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.869> strategic<00:02:01.869> reduction<00:02:02.590> of

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
what would the strategic reduction of

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.179 
what would the strategic reduction of
excessive<00:02:03.700> skin<00:02:04.110> do<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.590> change<00:02:05.979> the

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
excessive skin do to change the

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.910 
excessive skin do to change the
appearance<00:02:06.400> I<00:02:07.170> also<00:02:08.170> notice<00:02:08.619> there's<00:02:08.829> a

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
appearance I also notice there's a

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.770 
appearance I also notice there's a
little<00:02:09.070> bit<00:02:09.220> of<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.519> puffiness<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.540> the<00:02:10.600> inner

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
little bit of a puffiness of the inner

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.580 
little bit of a puffiness of the inner
corner<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:12.190> eye<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:13.180> if<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:14.470> are

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
corner of the eye so if you are

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.370 
corner of the eye so if you are
considering<00:02:15.100> just<00:02:15.579> a<00:02:15.760> laser<00:02:16.000> procedure<00:02:16.600> you

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
considering just a laser procedure you

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.690 
considering just a laser procedure you
would<00:02:17.530> not<00:02:17.680> be<00:02:17.890> able<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.250> address<00:02:18.400> the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
would not be able to address the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.310 
would not be able to address the
puffiness<00:02:18.880> because<00:02:19.329> that<00:02:19.510> puffiness<00:02:19.989> in<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
puffiness because that puffiness in the

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.400 
puffiness because that puffiness in the
inner<00:02:20.500> aspect<00:02:21.239> represents<00:02:22.239> eyelid<00:02:23.019> fat

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
inner aspect represents eyelid fat

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.970 
inner aspect represents eyelid fat
prolapse<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.880> since<00:02:25.329> you<00:02:25.840> can't<00:02:26.140> laser<00:02:26.620> off

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
prolapse so since you can't laser off

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.220 
prolapse so since you can't laser off
fat<00:02:27.340> from<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.880> outside<00:02:28.329> you<00:02:28.630> would<00:02:28.930> have<00:02:29.110> to

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
fat from the outside you would have to

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.870 
fat from the outside you would have to
need<00:02:29.440> surgery<00:02:29.709> you<00:02:29.980> would<00:02:30.130> need<00:02:30.340> surgery<00:02:30.670> to

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
need surgery you would need surgery to

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.100 
need surgery you would need surgery to
reduce<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.480> fat<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:33.030> it's<00:02:34.030> very<00:02:34.360> important<00:02:34.989> to

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
reduce the fat so it's very important to

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.390 
reduce the fat so it's very important to
have<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.470> clear

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
have a clear

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.660 
have a clear
of<00:02:38.180> what<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:38.930> would<00:02:39.049> look<00:02:39.230> like<00:02:39.290> after<00:02:39.799> a

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
of what you would look like after a

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.399 
of what you would look like after a
procedure<00:02:42.040> now<00:02:43.040> people<00:02:43.849> have<00:02:44.000> tried<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:45.170> try

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
procedure now people have tried to try

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.600 
procedure now people have tried to try

laser<00:02:50.299> what<00:02:51.049> do<00:02:51.110> we<00:02:51.260> what<00:02:51.680> are<00:02:51.709> we<00:02:51.799> doing<00:02:52.069> when

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
laser what do we what are we doing when

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.920 
laser what do we what are we doing when
we<00:02:52.220> are<00:02:52.310> applying<00:02:52.519> laser<00:02:52.940> we're<00:02:53.720> applying

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
we are applying laser we're applying

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.699 
we are applying laser we're applying
thermal<00:02:54.650> energy<00:02:55.129> heat<00:02:56.049> to<00:02:57.049> try<00:02:57.290> to<00:02:57.349> get<00:02:57.590> the

thermal energy heat to try to get the

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.420 
thermal energy heat to try to get the
skin<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.670> contract<00:02:59.000> in<00:02:59.810> a<00:03:00.019> way<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.560> smoothen

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
skin to contract in a way and smoothen

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.420 
skin to contract in a way and smoothen
to<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.269> point<00:03:02.540> where<00:03:02.989> a<00:03:03.290> lot<00:03:03.560> of<00:03:03.799> that<00:03:03.950> extra

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
to the point where a lot of that extra

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.319 
to the point where a lot of that extra
skin<00:03:04.760> gets<00:03:05.569> tighter<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:07.040> thing<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.459> when<00:03:08.209> you

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
skin gets tighter the thing is when you

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.369 
skin gets tighter the thing is when you
try<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.599> apply<00:03:08.900> heat<00:03:09.910> aggressively<00:03:10.910> it

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
try to apply heat aggressively it

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.479 
try to apply heat aggressively it
becomes<00:03:12.379> difficult<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:13.069> predict<00:03:13.730> how<00:03:14.510> much

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
becomes difficult to predict how much

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.750 
becomes difficult to predict how much
skin<00:03:16.489> you'll<00:03:16.849> tighten<00:03:17.209> into<00:03:17.660> what<00:03:18.079> degree<00:03:18.799> so

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
skin you'll tighten into what degree so

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.080 
skin you'll tighten into what degree so
you<00:03:20.239> can<00:03:20.420> certainly<00:03:20.690> try<00:03:21.230> a<00:03:21.709> laser<00:03:22.159> like<00:03:22.519> a<00:03:22.549> co2

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
you can certainly try a laser like a co2

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.289 
you can certainly try a laser like a co2
laser<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.480> people<00:03:23.870> have<00:03:23.989> done<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.440> and

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
laser and people have done that and

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.970 
laser and people have done that and
invariably<00:03:26.299> there's<00:03:26.569> improvement<00:03:27.319> the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
invariably there's improvement the

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.649 
invariably there's improvement the
question<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.549> have<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.700> ask<00:03:28.879> yourself<00:03:29.359> is<00:03:29.510> how

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
question you have to ask yourself is how

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.750 
question you have to ask yourself is how
much<00:03:29.930> improvement<00:03:30.290> would<00:03:30.950> be<00:03:31.129> acceptable<00:03:31.640> to

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
much improvement would be acceptable to

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.030 
much improvement would be acceptable to
you<00:03:32.590> so<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:34.269> think<00:03:35.409> consultation<00:03:36.409> with<00:03:37.010> a

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
you so I think consultation with a

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.699 
you so I think consultation with a
qualified<00:03:37.730> surgeon<00:03:38.420> would<00:03:39.200> be<00:03:39.349> very

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
qualified surgeon would be very

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.789 
qualified surgeon would be very
important<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.510> looking<00:03:41.510> at<00:03:41.630> yourself<00:03:42.109> with

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
important and looking at yourself with

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.520 
important and looking at yourself with
the<00:03:43.340> rolling<00:03:43.940> of<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.180> skin<00:03:44.810> so<00:03:45.290> that<00:03:45.410> you

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
the rolling of the skin so that you

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.190 
the rolling of the skin so that you
could<00:03:45.709> see<00:03:45.889> how<00:03:46.190> much<00:03:46.400> eyelid<00:03:46.910> would<00:03:47.060> show<00:03:47.329> the

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
could see how much eyelid would show the

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.530 
could see how much eyelid would show the
reality<00:03:48.470> is<00:03:48.859> that<00:03:49.099> you<00:03:49.340> have<00:03:49.370> a<00:03:49.730> certain<00:03:50.239> range

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
reality is that you have a certain range

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.289 
reality is that you have a certain range
of<00:03:50.930> skin<00:03:51.739> that<00:03:51.919> can<00:03:52.220> be<00:03:52.340> addressed<00:03:52.579> because

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
of skin that can be addressed because

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.430 
of skin that can be addressed because
you<00:03:53.480> have<00:03:53.569> to<00:03:53.660> understand<00:03:54.019> if<00:03:54.109> your<00:03:54.230> eyes<00:03:54.410> are

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
you have to understand if your eyes are

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.640 
you have to understand if your eyes are
prominent<00:03:55.280> when<00:03:56.030> you<00:03:56.180> close<00:03:56.720> your<00:03:56.930> eyes<00:03:56.989> you

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
prominent when you close your eyes you

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:58.990 
prominent when you close your eyes you
have<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.829> have<00:03:58.010> enough<00:03:58.250> skin<00:03:58.609> to<00:03:58.730> be<00:03:58.819> able<00:03:58.910> to

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
have to have enough skin to be able to

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000 
have to have enough skin to be able to
close<00:03:59.269> your<00:03:59.480> eyes<00:03:59.599> so<00:04:00.169> if<00:04:00.470> you<00:04:00.590> are<00:04:00.680> trying<00:04:00.919> to

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
close your eyes so if you are trying to

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.300 
close your eyes so if you are trying to
just<00:04:01.430> basically<00:04:02.150> cover<00:04:02.690> a<00:04:02.989> round<00:04:03.500> shape

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
just basically cover a round shape

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.819 
just basically cover a round shape
you<00:04:04.669> can't<00:04:05.030> just<00:04:05.480> aggressively<00:04:06.319> take<00:04:06.500> so<00:04:06.709> much

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
you can't just aggressively take so much

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.319 
you can't just aggressively take so much
skin<00:04:07.099> that<00:04:07.280> you'd<00:04:07.400> have<00:04:07.519> difficulty<00:04:08.090> with<00:04:08.180> eye

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
skin that you'd have difficulty with eye

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.110 
skin that you'd have difficulty with eye
closure<00:04:08.690> so<00:04:09.650> there's<00:04:09.889> a<00:04:09.980> range<00:04:10.190> you<00:04:10.549> can<00:04:10.970> be

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
closure so there's a range you can be

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.970 
closure so there's a range you can be
conservative<00:04:11.629> or<00:04:11.989> slightly<00:04:12.530> more<00:04:12.949> than

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
conservative or slightly more than

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.920 
conservative or slightly more than
conservative<00:04:13.760> but<00:04:14.150> you<00:04:14.269> can't<00:04:14.540> be<00:04:14.690> too

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
conservative but you can't be too

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.979 
conservative but you can't be too
aggressive<00:04:15.400> so<00:04:16.400> it's<00:04:16.849> a<00:04:17.209> lot<00:04:17.510> of<00:04:17.599> times<00:04:17.780> with

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
aggressive so it's a lot of times with

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.060 
aggressive so it's a lot of times with
patients<00:04:18.440> like<00:04:18.560> yourself

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
patients like yourself

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.670 
patients like yourself
I<00:04:19.160> would<00:04:19.430> do<00:04:19.549> a<00:04:19.579> combination<00:04:19.970> if<00:04:20.510> it's<00:04:21.229> the

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
I would do a combination if it's the

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.370 
I would do a combination if it's the
textural<00:04:22.310> issue<00:04:22.550> of<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.479> skin<00:04:23.750> quality<00:04:24.020> as

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
textural issue of the skin quality as

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.129 
textural issue of the skin quality as
part<00:04:24.710> of<00:04:24.800> this<00:04:24.949> I<00:04:25.160> would<00:04:25.940> do<00:04:26.120> a<00:04:26.360> conservative

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
part of this I would do a conservative

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.159 
part of this I would do a conservative
removal<00:04:27.590> of<00:04:27.680> skin<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:28.220> I<00:04:28.820> would<00:04:28.970> do

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
removal of skin and I would do

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.620 
removal of skin and I would do
fractional<00:04:30.169> co2<00:04:30.349> laser<00:04:31.090> this<00:04:32.090> way<00:04:32.300> we<00:04:32.510> address

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
fractional co2 laser this way we address

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.990 
fractional co2 laser this way we address
both<00:04:33.260> and<00:04:33.650> I<00:04:34.130> would<00:04:34.280> take<00:04:34.460> out<00:04:34.580> that<00:04:34.789> a<00:04:34.820> little

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
both and I would take out that a little

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.060 
both and I would take out that a little
bit<00:04:35.090> of<00:04:35.180> fat<00:04:35.389> pocket<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.080> you<00:04:36.530> get<00:04:36.740> a<00:04:36.770> nice

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
bit of fat pocket and you get a nice

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.270 
bit of fat pocket and you get a nice
smooth<00:04:37.669> contour<00:04:38.360> I<00:04:38.599> think<00:04:39.440> sometimes<00:04:39.919> we<00:04:40.099> have

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
smooth contour I think sometimes we have

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.800 
smooth contour I think sometimes we have
to<00:04:40.400> look<00:04:40.610> at<00:04:40.789> ourselves<00:04:40.970> from<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.539> big

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
to look at ourselves from the big

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.529 
to look at ourselves from the big
picture<00:04:42.349> rather<00:04:42.949> than<00:04:43.160> just<00:04:43.340> focus<00:04:44.240> in<00:04:44.360> on

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
picture rather than just focus in on

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:47.860 
picture rather than just focus in on
little<00:04:44.840> details<00:04:45.409> and<00:04:45.760> get<00:04:46.760> a<00:04:46.820> sense<00:04:47.210> of<00:04:47.450> what

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
little details and get a sense of what

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.559 
little details and get a sense of what
does<00:04:48.050> your<00:04:48.260> face<00:04:48.560> look<00:04:49.490> like<00:04:49.520> in

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 
does your face look like in

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:52.209 
does your face look like in
terms<00:04:50.779> of<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.199> appearance<00:04:51.499> that<00:04:51.770> you<00:04:51.979> want<00:04:52.159> to

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:52.219 
terms of the appearance that you want to

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:54.489 
terms of the appearance that you want to
project<00:04:52.759> and<00:04:53.029> use<00:04:53.659> that<00:04:53.960> as<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.139> measure

00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:54.499 
project and use that as a measure

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.219 
project and use that as a measure
instead<00:04:55.399> of<00:04:55.520> isolating<00:04:55.759> just<00:04:56.539> on<00:04:56.719> the<00:04:57.050> eyes

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
instead of isolating just on the eyes

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.189 
instead of isolating just on the eyes
alone<00:04:57.949> because<00:04:58.699> it's<00:04:58.939> it's<00:04:59.270> in<00:04:59.449> context<00:05:00.080> when

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
alone because it's it's in context when

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.109 
alone because it's it's in context when
people<00:05:00.469> see<00:05:00.709> you<00:05:00.889> they're<00:05:01.520> looking<00:05:01.879> at<00:05:01.969> the

00:05:02.109 --> 00:05:02.119 
people see you they're looking at the

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:04.149 
people see you they're looking at the
whole<00:05:02.300> picture<00:05:02.659> and<00:05:03.050> if<00:05:03.469> your<00:05:03.589> eyes<00:05:03.800> look

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
whole picture and if your eyes look

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.149 
whole picture and if your eyes look
brighter<00:05:04.610> and<00:05:04.789> more<00:05:05.149> open<00:05:05.599> then<00:05:06.349> that

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:07.159 
brighter and more open then that

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:09.909 
brighter and more open then that
certainly<00:05:07.610> won't<00:05:07.849> make<00:05:08.360> me<00:05:08.539> too<00:05:08.809> bulging<00:05:09.319> so

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
certainly won't make me too bulging so

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.089 
certainly won't make me too bulging so
again<00:05:10.219> meet<00:05:10.849> with<00:05:10.879> a<00:05:11.059> qualified<00:05:12.099> specialist

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
again meet with a qualified specialist

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.909 
again meet with a qualified specialist
and<00:05:13.599> learn<00:05:14.599> about<00:05:14.749> your<00:05:15.020> options<00:05:15.080> and<00:05:15.709> get<00:05:15.889> a

and learn about your options and get a

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.779 
and learn about your options and get a
sense<00:05:16.369> of<00:05:16.610> what<00:05:17.240> you<00:05:17.899> can<00:05:18.169> expect<00:05:18.800> from<00:05:19.490> a

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
sense of what you can expect from a

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.600 
sense of what you can expect from a
procedure<00:05:20.360> like<00:05:20.689> a<00:05:21.349> little<00:05:21.979> upper<00:05:22.249> eyelid

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
procedure like a little upper eyelid

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.299 
procedure like a little upper eyelid
surgery<00:05:23.029> conservative<00:05:23.749> and<00:05:24.309> combination

00:05:25.299 --> 00:05:25.309 
surgery conservative and combination

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:27.820 
surgery conservative and combination
with<00:05:25.459> co2<00:05:25.939> laser<00:05:26.360> but<00:05:27.169> I<00:05:27.199> probably<00:05:27.589> would

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
with co2 laser but I probably would

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.799 
with co2 laser but I probably would
advise<00:05:28.309> against<00:05:28.819> doing<00:05:28.879> just<00:05:29.389> the<00:05:29.539> laser

00:05:29.799 --> 00:05:29.809 
advise against doing just the laser

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:33.790 
advise against doing just the laser
alone<00:05:30.610> again<00:05:31.610> this<00:05:31.759> is<00:05:31.909> all<00:05:32.059> based<00:05:32.839> on<00:05:32.990> just

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
alone again this is all based on just

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.609 
alone again this is all based on just
the<00:05:33.949> photos<00:05:34.159> and<00:05:34.610> not<00:05:34.819> a<00:05:35.029> physical<00:05:35.300> exam<00:05:35.930> so<00:05:36.589> I

00:05:36.609 --> 00:05:36.619 
the photos and not a physical exam so I

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:38.649 
the photos and not a physical exam so I
hope<00:05:36.949> that<00:05:37.159> was<00:05:37.279> helpful<00:05:37.309> and<00:05:37.879> thank<00:05:38.509> you<00:05:38.599> for

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
hope that was helpful and thank you for

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.349 
hope that was helpful and thank you for
