oh there's one on the top I kind of like
the<00:02:08.459> thing<00:02:08.670> you're<00:02:08.789> building<00:02:09.179> it's<00:02:09.869> cool

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
the thing you're building it's cool

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.630 
the thing you're building it's cool
looking<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.590> looks<00:02:10.739> like<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.920> should<00:02:11.190> go

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
looking it looks like it should go

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.260 
looking it looks like it should go
sideways<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.239> walk<00:02:12.420> up<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.690> down

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
big buildings to clean windows I think

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.860

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
that's what it does it's probably its

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.820 
that's what it does it's probably its
