00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
at the bottom your doll's hair can

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.400 
at the bottom your doll's hair can
either<00:02:06.380> flip<00:02:06.619> in<00:02:06.829> or<00:02:07.520> flip<00:02:07.729> out<00:02:08.050> out<00:02:09.050> of<00:02:09.229> all

either flip in or flip out out of all

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.190 
either flip in or flip out out of all
the<00:02:09.739> doll<00:02:09.950> hair<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.670> i<00:02:10.700> have<00:02:11.200> experimented

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
the doll hair that i have experimented

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.430 
the doll hair that i have experimented
with<00:02:12.349> this<00:02:13.310> type<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.819> hair<00:02:14.300> is<00:02:14.510> really<00:02:15.170> the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
with this type of hair is really the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.050 
with this type of hair is really the
easiest<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:16.040> maintain<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:16.640> if<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.910> have<00:02:17.030> a

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
easiest to maintain so if you have a

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.990 
easiest to maintain so if you have a
younger<00:02:17.390> daughter<00:02:17.780> or<00:02:18.400> whoever<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.640> want<00:02:19.849> to

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
younger daughter or whoever you want to

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.720 
younger daughter or whoever you want to
have<00:02:20.209> give<00:02:20.959> a<00:02:20.989> doll<00:02:21.230> or<00:02:21.410> if<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.980> are<00:02:22.010> younger<00:02:22.400> i

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
have give a doll or if you are younger i

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.059 
have give a doll or if you are younger i
think<00:02:23.209> this<00:02:23.330> is<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.660> easiest<00:02:24.019> type<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:24.890> doll

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
think this is the easiest type of doll

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.490 
think this is the easiest type of doll
hair<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.489> manage<00:02:25.850> and<00:02:25.880> it's<00:02:26.480> just<00:02:26.930> really<00:02:27.230> easy

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
hair to manage and it's just really easy

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.600 
hair to manage and it's just really easy
so<00:02:28.430> once<00:02:28.730> again<00:02:28.880> you're<00:02:29.299> going<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.720> need<00:02:30.610> the

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
so once again you're going to need the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.150 
so once again you're going to need the
wire<00:02:31.760> bristle<00:02:32.150> brush<00:02:32.330> always<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.140> just<00:02:33.170> brush

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
wire bristle brush always and just brush

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.550 
wire bristle brush always and just brush
it<00:02:34.220> like<00:02:34.790> whenever<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.569> gets<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:36.049> little<00:02:36.350> bit

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
it like whenever it gets a little bit

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.220 
it like whenever it gets a little bit
tangled<00:02:36.830> you're<00:02:37.730> going<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.239> need<00:02:38.660> the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
tangled you're going to need the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.830 
tangled you're going to need the
spritzer<00:02:39.920> because<00:02:40.400> that's<00:02:41.440> what<00:02:42.440> we<00:02:42.530> do<00:02:43.840> so

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840
