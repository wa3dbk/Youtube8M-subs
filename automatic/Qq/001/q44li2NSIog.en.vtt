 Of course we live with the ingredients 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.780

 we have 120 grams of heidi takes 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.680
 this fresh blueberries because the 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.240
 tastes best when they are warm 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.460
 then they will be like jam 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.310
 then I have 20 grams of protein here 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.860
 Get cookies cream taste for seasoning 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.840
 namely, once and butter vanilla aroma 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.420
 as a lot of vanilla and then I have 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.160
 here still my speculum spiced that 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:10.510
 the car consists of 10 19 cloves 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.010

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.800
 Spekulatius spice, I have again 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.640
 below I link you and then 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.630
 we still have 6 1 here 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.640
 the very first step before we 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:30.800
 Preheat oven to start and although I 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:35.420
 love this oven to 120 degrees above 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.600
 heat down then just next step 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.760
 Heat water in the kettle 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.230
 which we then flake to instant 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.670
 give 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.530
 I now have 20 km of protein powder 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.720
 given to the instant curls 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.370
 Here I have my hot water and now 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.410
 I give the required by purely 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.200
 I'll show you that I can now 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.730
 here no reported indication for it must 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.730
 just a nice breisach 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:10.770
 we also give our size 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:17.280
 sort the case with me three pipettes 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:20.260
 The press of flake drops does not drip 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:28.560
 Then we have a buttery vanilla aroma 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:28.560
 to find in the buck department then 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:52.180
 a good barber powder and then still 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:57.690
 speculum powder becomes the whole 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.690
 seduced that everything lies again after 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.970
 software of which is here again 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:11.820
 cool message we beat ours 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:11.820
 six egg whites stiff a hand mixer 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.569
 Let's go without it 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.090
 I have the sixth aigner completely 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.180
 city â€‹â€‹beaten and the third is up 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.800
 that are as far as you are doing this 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.810
 So can put it over her head was 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.080
 finished rutter the test is good 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.330
 This is how my mass looks like 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.130
 but would still be here 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.440
 Add a little water as you can see 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.840
 I feel that way because this is here 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.370
 then we want to like them under the 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.470
 fold in snow mass 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:05:02.340
 if it is too tight then we have one 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:05:04.380
 lump what this gives and the whole thing 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.710
 we live now, and my part here 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.710
 have 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.360
 that's just nothing white media is that 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.810
 really everything is mixed nicely then 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.760
 if snowflakes are still in it 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.140
 the rise in the oven and then you can 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.940
 do it at a certain point 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.420
 overflow and explode 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.070
 that's why I mix it with mine 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.550
 fresh is good and right and thin 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.760
 went 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:41.330
 through explosions burns believes 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:44.400
 I do not really feel very well 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:51.150
 Now we are still talking about our blueberries 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:53.370
 Do not break Monday carefully 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.690
 Now I have a silicone mold here 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.150
 not presented today 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.490
 Animals reported here immediately taken and 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.290
 as you can the cake she just 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.890
 protect does not stick 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:12.350
 in its solid form cycler 100 will 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:12.350
 and therefore silicone mold now here 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:19.670
 but gorgeous and that we give here 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:22.040
 now for almost 40 minutes in a very long time 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:27.770
 the oven just at low level there 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:30.220
 Everything through value must also do and 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.220
 highlight 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.449
 so 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:45.920

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.120
 at the beginning I have already started 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:53.750
 used to perfect but 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:57.950

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:59.200
 It looks like that and we let it go 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.780
 just cool down 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.880
 a film over it and in the fridge 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.720
