inside of OneNote they use touch more
for<00:00:11.969> wonder<00:00:12.210> we<00:00:12.300> simply<00:00:12.719> create<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.410> touch

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
for wonder we simply create the touch

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.000 
for wonder we simply create the touch
mode<00:00:14.219> tab<00:00:14.490> inside<00:00:15.179> OneNote<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.320> then<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
mode tab inside OneNote and then the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.870 
mode tab inside OneNote and then the
control<00:00:17.539> panel<00:00:18.539> for<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> touch<00:00:19.800> mode<00:00:20.039> will<00:00:20.699> show

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
control panel for a touch mode will show

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.080 
control panel for a touch mode will show
up<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.150> top<00:00:21.390> here<00:00:21.980> there<00:00:22.980> are<00:00:23.039> three<00:00:23.369> way<00:00:23.820> of

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
up on top here there are three way of

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.240 
up on top here there are three way of
input<00:00:24.510> chemical<00:00:24.869> structures<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.769> first<00:00:26.010> way

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
input chemical structures the first way

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.759 
input chemical structures the first way
is<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.550> just<00:00:27.210> simply<00:00:27.359> sketch<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.199> structure

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
is to just simply sketch the structure

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.110 
is to just simply sketch the structure
you<00:00:29.369> can<00:00:29.550> click<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.300> then<00:00:30.330> the

you can click this and then the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.639 
you can click this and then the
touchable<00:00:33.120> structure<00:00:33.719> editor<00:00:34.050> will<00:00:34.290> show<00:00:34.469> up

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
touchable structure editor will show up

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.400 
touchable structure editor will show up
and<00:00:35.059> this<00:00:36.059> structure<00:00:36.390> editor<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.870> optimized

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
and this structure editor is optimized

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.010 
and this structure editor is optimized
for<00:00:37.590> touch<00:00:37.800> devices<00:00:38.329> so<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.480> touch<00:00:39.719> devices

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
for touch devices so on touch devices

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.290 
for touch devices so on touch devices
you<00:00:40.649> can<00:00:40.800> simply<00:00:41.219> swipe<00:00:41.460> your<00:00:41.520> finger<00:00:41.879> down

and then the selection will show up and

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.350 
and then the selection will show up and
it's<00:00:47.070> also<00:00:47.250> backward<00:00:47.760> compatible<00:00:48.300> with

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
it's also backward compatible with

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.600 
it's also backward compatible with
traditionally<00:00:49.140> traditional<00:00:49.829> devices<00:00:50.129> as

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
traditionally traditional devices as

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.610

operations<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:54.180> let's<00:00:54.449> draw<00:00:54.660> our<00:00:54.840> structures

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
operations so let's draw our structures

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.420 
operations so let's draw our structures
you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.420> simply<00:00:57.690> enter<00:00:57.950> you<00:00:58.950> know

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
you can simply enter you know

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.210 
you can simply enter you know
and<00:01:00.760> you<00:01:01.510> struck<00:01:01.870> a<00:01:02.440> shortcut<00:01:03.010> on<00:01:03.160> the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
and you struck a shortcut on the

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.940 
and you struck a shortcut on the
keyboard<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:05.110> control<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.710> structure

structure<00:01:10.660> is<00:01:10.750> insert<00:01:11.200> into<00:01:12.010> OneNote<00:01:12.580> a

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
structure is insert into OneNote a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.240 
structure is insert into OneNote a
second<00:01:14.200> way<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:15.000> infrastructure<00:01:16.000> is<00:01:17.250> using

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
second way to infrastructure is using

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.270 
second way to infrastructure is using
this<00:01:18.369> text<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:19.000> structure<00:01:19.570> feature<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.950> if<00:01:21.160> you

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
this text to structure feature so if you

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.710 
this text to structure feature so if you
know<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:22.119> trade<00:01:22.780> name<00:01:23.050> or<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:24.280> OPEC<00:01:24.729> name<00:01:24.970> of<00:01:25.330> a

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
know the trade name or a OPEC name of a

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.980 
know the trade name or a OPEC name of a
chemical<00:01:26.080> or<00:01:26.560> at<00:01:26.800> work<00:01:27.130> or<00:01:27.970> even<00:01:28.540> corporate

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
chemical or at work or even corporate

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.650 
chemical or at work or even corporate
come<00:01:29.350> from<00:01:29.560> ID<00:01:29.770> of<00:01:30.340> caste<00:01:30.880> number<00:01:31.300> you<00:01:31.509> can

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
come from ID of caste number you can

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.469 
come from ID of caste number you can
input<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.080> so<00:01:32.649> for<00:01:33.369> example<00:01:33.759> you<00:01:33.820> can<00:01:34.000> enter

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
input that so for example you can enter

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.160 
input that so for example you can enter
a<00:01:34.509> divot<00:01:34.869> tool<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.979> then<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.840> don't<00:01:38.020> have<00:01:38.110> to

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
a divot tool and then you don't have to

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.560 
a divot tool and then you don't have to
join<00:01:38.470> a<00:01:38.619> lick<00:01:38.740> to<00:01:38.890> a<00:01:38.920> structure<00:01:39.399> it<00:01:40.180> basically

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
join a lick to a structure it basically

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.060 
join a lick to a structure it basically
you<00:01:40.869> know<00:01:40.990> convert<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.500> name<00:01:41.680> to<00:01:41.950> the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
you know convert the name to the

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
you know convert the name to the
structures<00:01:42.550> for<00:01:42.580> you

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
structures for you

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.499 
structures for you
and<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.619> third<00:01:44.950> way<00:01:45.190> to<00:01:45.220> input<00:01:45.820> structures

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
and the third way to input structures

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.090 
and the third way to input structures
actually<00:01:46.890> import<00:01:48.509> files<00:01:49.509> of<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.100> different

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
actually import files of a different

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.370 
actually import files of a different
chemical<00:01:51.460> file<00:01:51.640> formats<00:01:52.149> so<00:01:52.810> for<00:01:52.990> example

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
chemical file formats so for example

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.230 
chemical file formats so for example
here<00:01:53.619> I'm<00:01:53.740> gonna<00:01:53.890> important<00:01:54.490> chemical<00:01:54.880> files

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
here I'm gonna important chemical files

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.430 
here I'm gonna important chemical files
and<00:01:55.660> in<00:01:56.350> this<00:01:56.500> case<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:56.920> it<00:01:57.100> is<00:01:57.310> actually<00:01:57.850> in<00:01:57.970> a

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
and in this case is it is actually in a

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.149 
and in this case is it is actually in a
reactions

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
reactions

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.419 
reactions
I<00:02:01.219> can<00:02:01.579> just<00:02:01.729> just<00:02:01.909> simply<00:02:02.329> open<00:02:02.479> that<00:02:02.929> and

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
I can just just simply open that and

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.630 
I can just just simply open that and
click<00:02:04.429> open<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:05.569> and<00:02:05.960> then<00:02:06.229> you<00:02:06.590> know<00:02:06.649> then

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
click open so and then you know then

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.719 
click open so and then you know then
that<00:02:07.880> reaction<00:02:08.149> is<00:02:08.390> it's<00:02:08.780> important<00:02:09.349> and<00:02:10.310> from

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
that reaction is it's important and from

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.030 
that reaction is it's important and from
former<00:02:11.269> camp<00:02:11.480> camp<00:02:11.900> your<00:02:12.080> format<00:02:12.940> so<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.920> these

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
former camp camp your format so so these

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.280 
former camp camp your format so so these
are<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.250> three<00:02:16.459> different<00:02:16.580> ways<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:17.290> input

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
are the three different ways of input

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.580 
are the three different ways of input
structures<00:02:18.769> and<00:02:19.840> there's<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.900> other<00:02:21.230> feature

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
structures and there's a other feature
