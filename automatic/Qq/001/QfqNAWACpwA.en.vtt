00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.719
 hi friends I play today in 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.010
 will count two new game modes so 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.110
 for a new episode of rock goals 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.309
 usually so I test the contract mode 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.770
 who looks nice on the map 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.850
 dusty desert it's a big 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.699
 novelty is apparently he did 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.169
 still not appearing and we have indeed 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.890
 right here I tried to pony on him 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:29.609
 and I will play as an operator in 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.850
 using well and well I will not see at the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.770
 next part anyway because 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.350
 that I will play with the cw or whatever 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.690
 something like that we're already the sleeve 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.840
 cross on nine good it's not very serious 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.430
 it's like for the episode 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.940
 previous where I started in round 2 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.300
 out of 9 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.130
 so I was doing a rescue I 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.380
 think I play and that the police is 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.970
 badly chosen not yet making that one 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:59.250
 and not wanted 1085 government 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.720
 big I never have the day thanks 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.970
 in fashion and I've never seen videos 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.309
 of this game mode so it's a great 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:15.929
 novelty for me I do not know very very 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:18.530
 good everything is two gourmet days 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.530
 with this object 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.690
 and it's a nice advantage to have a 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.710
 Scope x 4 and I started in fashion 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.950
 shot of the balloon we loved that they 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.950
 through 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.840
 if I understood correctly, a vip saved 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.400
 but I do not know who 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.240
 does not know how it's marked on the 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.790
 date I tell you I know him 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:50.160
 absolutely nothing i do not know at all 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.640
 who knows how to recognize brief I you 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.070
 say nothing to this one 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.910
 it's me I marked it ok I say bah 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.380
 after the icon I know rain 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.229
 have seen and yes yes it does not stay 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.619
 all the time on the map makes it a 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.619
 enemy there 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.330
 Persian game because my team does I 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.720
 think well but everyone is safe 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.610
 crowd 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.750
 it's gone I believe that six days I 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.750
 am going to donate jose 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.659
 the infiltrate goes underneath as sajoo 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.659
 true no door 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:44.810
 finally I have the advantage not go 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.079
 but he was there yes there is a friend just 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:53.540
 there I want it to be meant ping 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:56.319
 but I know when he was there that I 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.319
 seen a witness 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:07.420
 he can not be found it's not him 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:09.950
 he liked that good knife 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.069
 first part very nice I like 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.390
 contract personally already what they 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.459
 already try more interesting than 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.569
 the other game mode rescue I'm 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.030
 more skillful rescue but where should 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.810
 save hostages 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.799
 it's a little this rescue finally brief 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.750
 it's more interesting because at least 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.000
 you need that's your goal that's it 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.290
 your your goal is since 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.790
 years while in rescue it's from 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.239
 save a vip that nobody does in 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.620
 make widnes quickly fast quickly fast 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:38.959
 no no i do not want it's still not 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.639
 that no I did not want what I 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.440
 take the hero of 933 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.560
 in the end I think it will not be 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.190
 all a specific episode 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.940
 I just can not learn 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.410
 I know I want to test the card 556 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.720
 limit then I galley 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.720
 the game starts or really so 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:09.939
 snipers ok there it's dangerous you 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.720
 can have it finally just in full auto 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:14.450
 because I pass you half healthy 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.579
 to be able to kill an enemy there is 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.870
 put ok a year and a half ago it's good 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.669
 bigard gaza by the appearance and the 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.289
 disarticulate I do not know who was called 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:29.210
 eagles dia then my part is 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.250
 perfect for now we win well 4 1 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:36.830
 so here I choose quickly made my soul 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:39.410
 tek tek the carson 56 and I put a 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.660
 handle I wanted a code I wanted a 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.360
 code because I have him what I like to 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.039
 grip and I do not know we'll see 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:51.110
 way after I do not believe that I 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:57.919
 I had bontempi gets it something 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:05:00.190
 here but the attention on the brands 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.190
 enemies 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.879
 so there is still some it's not about 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.930
 the roof so it'll be complicated 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.930
 maybe trying to get around son is 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:21.199
 for example over here yes I think there 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.470
 he is wearing just right it's good 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.470
 he supported 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:52.720
 eat 500 points on it is good so 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:58.900
 I was not the weird old magpies on 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:06:00.099
 is still still 1.5 no picture so 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.110
 that's good I like this game mode 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:06.550
 it's nice ah it's already finished for me 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.080
 it's over it will be a very episode 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.470
 fast for those who wanted to see fast 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.379
 does it well ben that bah I think that 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.449

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:21.210
