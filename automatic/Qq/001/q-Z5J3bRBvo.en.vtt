00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.050 
plant a tree it's a good idea to get to
know<00:04:07.590> where<00:04:07.739> your<00:04:07.860> tree<00:04:08.099> is<00:04:08.220> from<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:08.760> then<00:04:08.910> do

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
know where your tree is from and then do

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.340 
know where your tree is from and then do
your<00:04:09.180> best<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.569> provide<00:04:09.810> those<00:04:10.049> conditions

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.719

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
the planting depth for your tree is

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.000 
the planting depth for your tree is
critical<00:04:18.299> always<00:04:18.870> dig<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.260> hole<00:04:19.410> twice<00:04:19.769> as

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
critical always dig the hole twice as

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.279 
critical always dig the hole twice as
wide<00:04:20.160> as<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.489> pot<00:04:20.699> itself<00:04:21.150> but<00:04:21.570> never<00:04:21.840> deeper
