00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.129
 hello everyone I'm schleck order and good 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:11.650
 today after uploading the 104 I bring the 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:14.719
 105 and directly good as is logical 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.510
 and well this time that's not like 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.920
 last time I think it's very simple 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.070
 good you go to the link of the left the 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.450
 description you download the file 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.850
 and it will come out is to close it unzip 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:32.090
 and they will come out in these three files 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:36.190
 of these two files because now it's like 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.190
 we always light the bable 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:49.860
 in the play comes out this is typical of playing 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.860
 then we go to the maple manager 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.350
 we give right button and we give to 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.350
 execute as an administrator 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.129
 and then this tab will open 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.839
 we have to have these two little ones 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.229
 selected and then simply you 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.229
 we give to 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.210
 we give him and the garden will appear yes that is 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.240
 and we give him to play 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.450
 while we wait to undo the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.450
 egg 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.310
 well 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.210
 d 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.090
 maybe he has some more option but 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.159
 always the previous one I did not upload it because 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.690
 I had a lot of problems 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.940
 for funds and to make it work 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.250
 well and I did not have time to look at me the 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.560
 true so I preferred to wait for the 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.789
 next to see if it 's easier and that's what 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.490
 that has been so I do not know I do not know how much 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.820
 time is 105 but I hope not 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.820
 much 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.780
 the game opens 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.630
 I will update as always 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.090
 I imagine although I have this because sometimes 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.440
 the patch is going all can take for 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.440
 ass I hope not 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.230
 and we have it but about the game 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.230
 we enter 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.700
 Regarding if something else 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.680
 all this do with the antivirus 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.150
 deactivated and good I have but if you have 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.150
 antivirus deactivate it 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.799
 because if it will not detect it as a virus 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.750
 of the s program to inject and you do not see it 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.060
 that does not carry a virus 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.430
 simply that they are programs not 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.820
 signed with which windows the state 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.820
 common 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.250
 we entered 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.379
 but you did not hear the sound very loud 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.379
 of the game 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:16.069
 so then we start and this is 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.230
 for as it says it says it for auto 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.440
 attack that we tell you to leave it 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:26.010
 doing and this serves for monkeys are the 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.140
 hacks itself for example this 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.030
 that you can attack good and put it like that 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.530
 of good on top they put all this 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.620
 example makes you take things from 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.450
 faster ground this there is not 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.379
 let's say you can jump unlimitedly 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.379
 as you can see 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.990
 mango with computer consternation 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.940
 do not 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.090
 As you can see it worked a tad with 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.040
 the computer and it's not the great wonder 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.799
 in the century 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.599
 After, for example, the usual ones 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:01.590
 the good mother that do not you 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:03.540
 touch for a few that you do not 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.930
 they play basically although in the end you 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.930
 they end up taking 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:13.440
 after 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.440
 Typical of these is to attack 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.850
 i 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.920
 without doing anything 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.559
 then well I do not know if there are many is 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.659
 question of going trying others for 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:41.009
 example that does not come out that the 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:41.009
 numbers above 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:51.380
 the new animation animation good to go 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.470
 testing is a matter of trying and 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.220
 you will tell me any problem problem 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.220
 comment on it 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.990
 it can not be solved but what 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:02.550
 I will try 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.260
 so I hope you liked the 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.260
 video and until next time
