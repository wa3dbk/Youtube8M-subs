00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:13.339
 it seems good to me and so far 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.390
 in a special statement for this election 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.269
 channel n 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:22.220
 Carlos Santana ties the first team's physical trainer the papal entourage 

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:28.170
 yemenia listen to 70 as carlos tevez and gonzalo bulls friends teacher games 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.739
 talk about what physical preparation is a physical education 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.490
 how can you name 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.130
 you can mention it must in many ways p 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.760
 arias physics ariel conditional conditional preparation but 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.670
 physical preparation a physical training within what is the scope 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.070
 of high performance 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.860
 inside me everything that causes the pedagogical would be physical education 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.820
 as something 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.560
 more general but within the soccer physical preparation or dimension 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.880
 physical is the most correct 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.880
 10 by punch special photo 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.560
 guti brings peace 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.190
 and it is very important the physical dimension of part of a whole 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.340
 that everything is in the game the celestial the essence of the game of soccer 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.290
 not in that sense 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.050
 the priorities of the physical area are first the elevation that optimize the 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.930
 Player performance 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.140
 then look for the sporting longevity this is that which Thursday more amount of 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.320
 years old 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.080
 possible in his career 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.520
 i do not 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.980
 get away from injury rates 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.710
 avoid through proper preventive preparation 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.600
 that the player is in this process of high training 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.150
 performance that is aggressive in itself 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.969
 extend to more the least amount of sion is possible 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.009
 These three characteristics are the most important in the area 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.849
 and this way we prepare the players how a study is carried out 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.150
 the teacher sector 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.020
 because I imagine cápac 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.250
 ortín you need people 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.640
 to qualities 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.640
 As you observe, it is the work and how it is imposed by the players 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.600
 and when we have important preparation deadlines two three years of 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.509
 continuity between a team 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.989
 we can establish a profile of our players 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.989
 per cent always at the beginning of the season cc oo a valuation 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.260
 p we take out the neuromuscular profiles this is from explosive strength 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.829
 speed aerobic profiles endurance capacity capacity 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.049
 aerobic power aerobic potential 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.049
 to tica and gatica 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.100
 this was the possible to express 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.729
 efortes short and intense pits 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:44.439
 and short, intense effort repeated over the 90 minutes, all that 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.189
 we establish through diagnostic evaluations we take the real ones 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.410
 individual abilities in other players 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.570
 each player has a certain capacity area and apart that ability 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.610
 we elaborate a training plan that allows us percent 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:00.699
 to elaborate 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:03.699
 the real charges for everyone in the gym 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:09.189
 each has its charge its repetition and its series at the origin of the aspect 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.179
 aerobic 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:13.550
 to the performance group that all work for different times 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.250
 or for extinct accusations 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.010
 so it's good that the way to optimize this performance is first 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.410
 taking it out of our players' real capacity individually so 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.150
 able to make a custom part plan that allows to optimize the 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.989
 performance of them 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.789
 not so close 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:33.379
 this holiday season 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.379
 the preparation each of them 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.659
 this question efe 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.699
 state 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:41.560
 stressed 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.189
 nation 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.179
 she accepted salazar 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:51.569
 the heroic roteta to sing does not appear in the resistance network is true 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.079
 Buenos Aires is true that in a certain way the truth some years ago the 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.180
 strength training methodology 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.479
 It was very far from what functional training is 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:04.689
 efe and the specific force that it uses best within the field of play 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.549
 this of Tehran 12 20 30 years that started with the hard work 

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:13.459
 Terán worked very well from weightlifting very well bar apparatus machines 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.609
 efe and that I did not have a direct transfer over 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.500
 of the player's movements the speed with which to execute the 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.500
 movements and actions of the player i 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.189
 does not have much to do with functionality 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.680
 within the match before training 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.480
 and the actions of the game 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.820
 so that when he trained if a few years ago the player feels for 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.289
 bad people a certain way of garzon that the judge was clumsy or hardened 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.850
 in the light of new research and of asthma in this start and antas 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.650
 of training and ideal dempsey research and new knowledge 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.469
 does not allow was going to hit having advanced as to what 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:05:00.099
 by the way we do not go down and general strength perimeter the transfer is the 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.389
 speed if the player's actions 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.880
 and also processed the force actions within the field of play 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.029
 that the player performs the matches these are 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:13.789
 slow down and re-accelerate skip changes 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:19.219
 p fall and accelerate again accelerations of 5 10 meters p the auction 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.860
 the power of the auction launches 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.740
 p him the rival condal struggle 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.789
 all expressions of strength 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.849
 that imply a specific training 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.779
 of those same actions that as I say a few years ago have nothing to do with 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:35.449
 this form of force pressure 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.999
 but now, in the light of new research, we can work 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.129
 functionally correct 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:46.750
 so that the player not only is not clumsy or jogo has josé vera 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.000
 hardened his actions but also 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.120
 optimistic that ability strength 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.120
 that allows you to be no stronger faster 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.750
 First segal the balls to avoid a goal, first balls for 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:59.740
 specify a goal 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.639
 jump higher and win 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.689
 percent and being able to change direction by finishing off with great power all are 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:06.830
 expressions of force 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.150
 that if they are well trained by the performance of the player and the cd team 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.639
 increased 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.879
 teacher for children or youth can play soccer 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.259
 why it is so important is the physical preparation 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:23.319
 six know him 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:27.119
 yes as I just told you that the physical aria a 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:29.770
 it is a part of a whole 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.199
 so the player's performance goes through 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:35.669
 physical preparation technical preparation tactical equipment 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:37.280
 the psychological preparation 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.930
 that are highly linked inti and in a way 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:46.150
 that enters more in this way we look for a hundred globally 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.729
 efe physical preparation 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:52.349
 and it's very important for children because mine has phases of development and face 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:53.360
 sensible 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.490
 from being able to take advantage of the aerobic capacity 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.939
 resistance the speed capability 

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:04.189
 percent success if you pass that sensitive phase 

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:08.569
 let's say you miss the train so we have ages of your own 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:12.349
 you have to work at 6 to seven of the eight years you have to work at 10 

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:16.199
 and 12 years you have to work after puberty after which the child 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:20.839
 it is successful of the st tora the enormous ones that allows us to improve in the works 

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:24.169
 and progress in strength work so that 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:26.639
 efe with children is worked in a way 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.449
 and after puberty we can when they are teenagers and young people 

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:34.509
 work in another way but there is a sensitive phase and we must take advantage of that phase 

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:39.389
 sensitive from 6 years old where that speed capacity that ability 

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:43.339
 agility that ability to go a little bit by working the resistance 

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:48.359
 is going to lay the foundations for a better soccer future plane player is not only 

00:07:48.359 --> 00:07:49.339
 kick a ball 

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:50.940
 not monoambient mind 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.509
 p can not be seen employed 

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:56.069
 this these capacity of turns dimensions 

00:07:56.069 --> 00:08:00.320
 you can not see one more one plus one plus one but they would be sold hatched 

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.900
 and work on their new leader
