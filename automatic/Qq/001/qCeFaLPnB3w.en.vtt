to<00:00:19.270> sketch<00:00:19.660> this<00:00:20.439> happens<00:00:20.949> because<00:00:21.130> we<00:00:21.460> are

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
to sketch this happens because we are

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.060 
to sketch this happens because we are
all<00:00:21.609> used<00:00:22.180> to<00:00:22.390> draw<00:00:22.570> some<00:00:22.810> things<00:00:22.840> and<00:00:23.320> we<00:00:23.920> do

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
all used to draw some things and we do

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.160 
all used to draw some things and we do
this<00:00:24.220> automatically<00:00:25.090> but<00:00:25.630> when<00:00:25.840> we<00:00:25.990> have

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
this automatically but when we have

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.200 
this automatically but when we have
something<00:00:26.590> you<00:00:26.800> to<00:00:27.039> draw<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:27.550> hand<00:00:27.760> we'll<00:00:27.939> try

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
something you to draw the hand we'll try

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.779 
something you to draw the hand we'll try
to<00:00:28.269> avoid<00:00:28.510> loosing<00:00:29.019> and<00:00:29.500> she<00:00:30.160> will<00:00:30.310> have<00:00:30.580> a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
to avoid loosing and she will have a

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.410 
to avoid loosing and she will have a
freewheeling<00:00:31.240> of<00:00:31.510> herself<00:00:32.050> at<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.969> end<00:00:34.120> the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
freewheeling of herself at the end the

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.450 
freewheeling of herself at the end the
drawing<00:00:34.870> will<00:00:35.079> not<00:00:35.260> be<00:00:35.410> considered<00:00:36.010> as<00:00:36.190> an

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
drawing will not be considered as an

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.190 
drawing will not be considered as an
improvement<00:00:36.850> because<00:00:37.510> instead<00:00:37.840> of<00:00:37.989> learning

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
improvement because instead of learning

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.650 
improvement because instead of learning
the<00:00:38.410> things<00:00:38.800> you<00:00:39.309> will<00:00:39.430> avoid<00:00:39.790> them<00:00:40.059> and<00:00:40.239> you

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
the things you will avoid them and you

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.260 
the things you will avoid them and you
will<00:00:40.809> draw<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:41.079> things<00:00:41.440> you<00:00:41.620> are<00:00:41.710> used<00:00:42.270> this

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
will draw the things you are used this

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.819 
will draw the things you are used this
happens<00:00:43.719> and<00:00:43.930> you<00:00:44.079> will<00:00:44.230> see<00:00:44.410> how<00:00:44.559> difficult

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
happens and you will see how difficult

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.130 
happens and you will see how difficult
is<00:00:45.280> to<00:00:45.309> resist<00:00:45.850> the<00:00:46.059> temptation<00:00:46.600> of<00:00:46.690> drawing

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
is to resist the temptation of drawing

is to resist the temptation of drawing
things<00:00:47.410> did<00:00:48.070> you<00:00:48.100> know<00:00:48.430> by<00:00:48.610> heart<00:00:48.879> so<00:00:49.260> stand

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
things did you know by heart so stand

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.170 
things did you know by heart so stand
carefully<00:00:50.829> and<00:00:51.039> try<00:00:51.250> to<00:00:51.340> draw<00:00:51.700> new<00:00:51.910> things

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
carefully and try to draw new things

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.319 
carefully and try to draw new things
each<00:00:52.390> day<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.890> shoe<00:00:54.070> we<00:00:54.219> draw<00:00:54.430> here<00:00:54.789> is<00:00:55.000> a

did<00:01:08.080> it<00:01:08.200> correctly<00:01:08.680> you<00:01:08.979> can<00:01:09.159> use<00:01:09.310> pressure<00:01:09.610> to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
did it correctly you can use pressure to

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.160 
did it correctly you can use pressure to
obtain<00:01:10.060> darker<00:01:10.630> lines
