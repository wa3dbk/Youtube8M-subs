the<00:00:48.149> read<00:00:48.390> would<00:00:48.690> go<00:00:48.870> from<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.230> stick<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the read would go from a stick to the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.500 
the read would go from a stick to the

then we would get the ball completed and

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.720 
then we would get the ball completed and
work<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.789> quarterback<00:00:54.180> speed<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.750> vision

work the quarterback speed and vision

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.790 
work the quarterback speed and vision
the<00:00:56.730> next<00:00:57.090> one<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.809> progression<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.530> well

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the next one in the progression is well

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.369 
the next one in the progression is well
a<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.850> day<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.480> particular<00:01:00.600> would<00:01:01.140> be<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
a that day in particular would be the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.920 
a that day in particular would be the
concept<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.949> Mills<00:01:02.219> Mills<00:01:03.059> were<00:01:03.300> working<00:01:03.690> one

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
concept of Mills Mills were working one

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.920 
concept of Mills Mills were working one
to<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.710> tight<00:01:04.979> end<00:01:05.010> we're<00:01:05.880> working<00:01:06.270> two<00:01:06.570> to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
to the tight end we're working two to

to the tight end we're working two to
the<00:01:07.049> X<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> hook<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.130> then<00:01:08.700> we're<00:01:09.659> working

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the X on a hook and then we're working

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.520 
the X on a hook and then we're working
three<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> back<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.220> check<00:01:11.460> first<00:01:12.530> in

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
behind on the quarterback as you can see

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.539 
behind on the quarterback as you can see
in<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.780> picture<00:01:24.960> right<00:01:25.290> here<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.310> coach

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
in this picture right here and the coach

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.859 
in this picture right here and the coach
would<00:01:26.759> indicate<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.450> 1<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:28.170> 2<00:01:28.820> or<00:01:29.820> 3<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:30.750> his

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
would indicate a 1 a 2 or 3 with his

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.219 
would indicate a 1 a 2 or 3 with his
hands<00:01:31.350> if<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.400> gives<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.790> 1<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.630> first<00:01:33.930> guy<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
hands if it gives a 1 the first guy the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.170 
hands if it gives a 1 the first guy the
number-one<00:01:34.860> receiver<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.759> read<00:01:35.939> would

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
number-one receiver in the read would

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.359 
number-one receiver in the read would
stick<00:01:36.390> his<00:01:36.509> hands<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:37.020> immediately<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
stick his hands up immediately so the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.789 
stick his hands up immediately so the
quarterback<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:38.970> timeout<00:01:39.210> properly<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.770> next

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
quarterback in timeout properly the next

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.980 
quarterback in timeout properly the next
example<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> coach<00:01:42.090> puts<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.479> number<00:01:42.750> 2

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
example is the coach puts the number 2

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.530 
example is the coach puts the number 2
up<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.890> now<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.159> quarterback<00:01:44.729> comes<00:01:45.240> back

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
up so now the quarterback comes back

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.109 
up so now the quarterback comes back
drops<00:01:46.259> back<00:01:46.500> looks<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.979> see<00:01:47.220> if<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.579> number<00:01:47.880> 1

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
drops back looks to see if the number 1

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.270 
drops back looks to see if the number 1
is<00:01:48.270> open<00:01:48.630> number<00:01:49.110> one<00:01:49.409> does<00:01:49.619> not<00:01:49.770> flash<00:01:50.100> his

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
is open number one does not flash his

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.190 
is open number one does not flash his
hand<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.909> assumption<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.390> he's<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:51.750> open

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
hand so the assumption is he's not open

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.160 
hand so the assumption is he's not open
so<00:01:52.680> then<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.979> quarterback<00:01:53.310> finds<00:01:53.790> himself

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
so then the quarterback finds himself

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.209 
so then the quarterback finds himself
number<00:01:55.170> two<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.009> progression<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:58.799> final
