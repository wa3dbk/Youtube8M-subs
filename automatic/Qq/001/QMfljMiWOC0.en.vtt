00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello guys how are you welcome to the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.589
 tenth episode of rock your lori and in 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.210
 I want to comment on this chapter 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.070
 good things first thing you'll see me 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.980
 playing a couple of matches with the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.530
 released you and my impressions these 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.580
 have tried both the regular letter 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:24.420
 as the toti is that sincerely 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.820
 the totti book I do not think it deserves so much 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.740
 the penalty in speed I do not notice it for 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.850
 be of the average general rise 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.150
 about is from 89 to 96 that is pretty and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.970
 speed I think it's 82 that of the 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.519
 blue but they do not really notice so 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.740
 except I do not notice it maybe force will 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.690
 I can notice a little more 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.760
 but I do not think it's worth it 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.700
 honestly to me with the normal book I 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.520
 worth and surplus and other good things 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.960
 I wanted to comment in this episode to 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.570
 as the matches go by 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.340
 you will see four ya ya have already seen 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.550
 how did the first one put that great goal 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.550
 ibra 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.270
 good you know that there has been enough 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:13.520
 time frame between episode 9 and 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:16.190
 this tenth and sincerely we are already 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.270
 end of figure 14 this August 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.510
 that's good, people are already going up 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.730
 predictions and all types of templates 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:31.060
 for fifa 15 to me personally is a 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:34.090
 thing that does not interest me besides are like 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.310
 it's not filling content I do not see it a 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.380
 little or ephemeral does not make much sense 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.600
 when they do not stop being 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.100
 predictions and things that like then not 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.080
 surely they are not met but it was good 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.140
 weird weird you would see that in my 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.049
 channel but I do not know what to do with the 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.850
 Sincerely, I do not feel like it either 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.560
 a lot and to play the fifa I already have it 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.610
 pretty trite always comes a 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.459
 moment this August or September that 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.399
 Well, you're already bored of the fifa 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.750
 especially if it's a delivery how are you 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.209
 like these last two years that you do not 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.090
 they love me I do not think that neither you nor 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.920
 to me this this fifa 13-14 we have 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.510
 come to really fill 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.310
 and then it is already saturated there is no 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.560
 many ideas there is not much desire to 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.930
 play either of what if you want 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.160
 finish the series in a more decent way 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.850
 and I wanted to ask you opinion to see 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.800
 what do you think about what you think as if you have 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.440
 some idea of ​​how to finish this series in 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.630
 a round shape 12 episodes like 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:47.690
 a lot 2 to finish it and I do not know I have 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.970
 some idea and such but certainly not 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.460
 I will continue for example 10 chapters 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.740
 more they are signing up gold I do not know how little to 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.740
 little because lover that I do not have no desire 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.620
 I do not think that we do not want either 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.000
 see so much content and I already know 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.890
 that time I have quite limited 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.960
 so I prefer to use it well and 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.020
 do something that you like to finish the series 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.420
 in a way as I say round and good I do not know 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.610
 tell me to see what happens to you in 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.680
 general the truth that I liked 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.830
 a lot to do this series I do not know what 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.990
 you will think about the 15 year series 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.550
 previous where good was something 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.800
 different because it started with bronzes 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.010
 but serving an expensive type player 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.900
 pound was going to go climbing climbing if you 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:38.150
 like this concept or that of fifa 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:42.520
 fifa 2013 you also comment on that for 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.340
 possible series in the future 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.630
 but well I think what I like 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.140
 is that it is with pound that is one of my 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.080
 Preferred players and usually the same 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.290
 so you play when you make a 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.560
 template with him during during the fifa 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.800
 of shift but you do not get it 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.120
 take a lot or at least that 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.980
 is what happens to me now playing 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.100
 so many matches with him the truth that is 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.240
 that you get a lot of performance and see 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.980
 of what he is capable of not especially 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.440
 player of these characteristics that 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.930
 I can do practically everything because it is 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.430
 more or less quickly you can do skills 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.070
 can finish off head to paste from 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.900
 out everything here is this goal with the sun 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.820
 and you will see I really like this repetition 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.400
 good in general of the anec being the 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.140
 fifa game 14 in textile what I most 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.320
 convinces are the repetitions the truth 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.360
 that are very good television is a 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.980
 thing they told what they talked to 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.690
 the televisions and others to see how 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.190
 they did the whole subject the repetitions and 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.520
 it's very accomplished, you know that the 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.849
 gameplay if you follow me on twitter 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.560
 I have my reservations because I do not know I do not know 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.819
 it seems rather slower harder to 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.699
 do skill especially when I'm 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:53.409
 playing this series that is a lot to do 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.810
 skill and try to get me good trees 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:58.389
 costs since the gameplay is more 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.650
 slow or so is it to me gives me gives me 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.870
 that feeling about the generation 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.819
 above I do not know if it's very nice 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.449
 well you know that I have a series of 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:09.639
 of problems but good for that too 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.490
 I'm so looking forward to this 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:15.759
 fifa 15 and good in principle eye care 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.639
 here because I stop it because you are going to see a 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:20.830
 Goal kick that not much seen in my 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.560
 channel let's go you do not know I'm pretty 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.530
 bad throwing faults and bodies 4.1 me 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:30.720
 I'm glad since you have to teach it that fifa 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:34.180
 15 comes I hope that with a renewed look 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.919
 know new features that we 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.139
 have heard in certain aspects that 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:42.699
 have corrected the whole subject d 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:45.810
 of women's centers that many 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:49.960
 things not all the things that surely 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.729
 will not satisfy 100% because never 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.080
 some change that everyone likes, I've already 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:56.150
 done many times but 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.060
 I hope it's a more complete game than 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.860
 maybe it's more similar in feelings to 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.139
 the sensations that you had when 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.030
 you played fifa12 it was like super 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:08.090
 funny of yes it is true 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.949
 that it was a much more arcade game 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:14.090
 but good, after all, be a 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:17.139
 game that satisfies us all and that does not 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:20.680
 is to come 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:22.509
 with a renewed look with something that we 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.499
 hook that the end is a good game 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:28.419
 and you like to play and nothing smaller one 

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:30.099
 little mix here I know I have not commented 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:32.439
 a lot of matches but good you have 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:35.259
 seen the goals there were some pretty 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:37.419
 Decent tell me everything you think 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.520
 all your opinions ideas in the 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:43.439
 comments see you soon nothing more 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.439
 thank you all, see you later
