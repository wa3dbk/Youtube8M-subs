00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
think it is but not too old but about

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.240 
think it is but not too old but about
Apple<00:00:40.660> maybe<00:00:40.840> possibly<00:00:41.410> releasing<00:00:41.860> a<00:00:41.890> macbook

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
Apple maybe possibly releasing a macbook

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.790 
Apple maybe possibly releasing a macbook
touch<00:00:42.489> I<00:00:42.820> wouldn't<00:00:43.540> up<00:00:43.720> china<00:00:44.020> or<00:00:44.260> macbook

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
touch I wouldn't up china or macbook

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.110 
touch I wouldn't up china or macbook
such<00:00:44.980> as<00:00:45.100> one<00:00:45.280> of<00:00:45.309> millions<00:00:45.489> of<00:00:45.730> heard<00:00:45.940> her

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
such as one of millions of heard her

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.000 
such as one of millions of heard her
i've<00:00:46.780> also<00:00:47.020> heard<00:00:47.320> Mac<00:00:47.739> tablet<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:48.550> I<00:00:48.940> tablet

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080
