00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.710
 Among the questions this time is the summer Bridge Asked well that the guitar course for beginners today 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.910
 Well 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:18.360
 Well it is in the video but I'm playing the time of the acoustic guitar 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:23.730
 There are quite a lot of questions asking if it's okay to listen to it at the station 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:25.200
 I would like to open up a bit angry about that and I'll say from the conclusion 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.160
 No problem 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:37.780
 There in with nitrous classical guitar Well I electric guitar is that your existing guitar now 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:43.600
 Please be assured that there is no problem even if you practice with that guitar 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:47.480
 8 4 match fit of tuning in electric guitar want Ereki 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:53.270
 It's a totally together the Tteyuu sound to match the maxim 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.390
 The way to hold down Guitar Ford is completely the same , so I am conscious of the guitar chord of my video 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.390
 The 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:04.720
 Video for people who are new to guitars 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:07.960
 Please rest assured that even if you practice with your guitar while watching with it, it's a problem at all 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:13.630
 Just for the sake of those who buy a guitar 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:19.250
 Meeting in the pin and the acoustic guitar I want to try a little commentary also to I mean what is the difference between Te but this now 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:22.570
 It's an editor, it's a start type, but if you don't pass this to an amplifier 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.570
 It sounds like skin 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.280
 Woman Murai 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.490
 I always play acoustic guitar 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.390
 of power 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:46.100
 I 'm playing in the way I put it, but there is only this kind of small sound 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.100
 Do you think that if you look at the same way, you will understand the difference ? 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.920
 It will completely 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:12.630
 Person One buy Well Eddie machine claiming 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:16.069
 At the same time amp guitar amps You have to buy such things 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.460
 How well i listen 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:23.330
 There is no sound like listening in the area 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:26.050
 A little behind the amp bar 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.050
 of 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.930
 Great 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.930
 me 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.030
 Good 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:51.560
 I think that a sound that I often listened finally came out 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.560
 That 's how you like Electric 2's 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.350
 Referred to as the first not passed through the amplifier 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.460
 It can not be helped 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:10.340
 Although that action code code is called a shield 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:13.280
 Because it passes through the amplifier in the shield connection Silver no Nao three of the shield amp 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.170
 Please attach there 9 because there is no sound 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:23.220
 Well, it is now 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:29.760
 If you connect a small effector from Kelp to that here and connect headphones to it now 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:31.600
 Because there is something that sounds like that through an amplifier that sounds like an amplifier 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.370
 8 That's it 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:42.340
 If you can't buy an amp, you might be able to buy and practice that 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:46.750
 There because that way to know the Tteyuu acoustic guitar and electric is completely different is Well coming out sound 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:54.400
 Just be careful and it's how you play 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:55.150
 There is no problem at all in how to play , so even if there is no worst amp, you can practice the guitar 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.360
 I will 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.530
 Guitar chord 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.880
 You can remember how to use fingers and so on 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.250
 8 well 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:13.280
 Even if you do n't have the money to spend on a dark wind amp 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:16.579
 Even if you have only electric guitar and classical guitar, you can practice the guitar enough 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.450
 So I think I would be relieved there 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.829
 In such a way, a trial 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.129
 Oh dear 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:30.100
 Even if there was only that guitar at home 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:33.160
 It is a problem at all to have you practice while watching that my video, so 8 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:37.260
 Everyone, please try to start the guitar 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.260
 This time, directly below Thank you looks like
