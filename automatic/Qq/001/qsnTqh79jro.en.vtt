you get an idea of how different parts
of<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> car<00:00:57.149> laid<00:00:57.449> out<00:00:57.629> spaced<00:00:58.500> out<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.980> fit

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
of the car laid out spaced out and fit

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.680 
of the car laid out spaced out and fit
together<00:00:59.520> all<00:00:59.730> right<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.000> look<00:01:00.329> here's<00:01:00.570> our

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690

headlights<00:01:03.229> grille<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.650> think<00:01:05.400> there's<00:01:05.580> like<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
headlights grille I think there's like a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.510 
headlights grille I think there's like a
air<00:01:06.360> vent<00:01:06.689> there<00:01:06.930> or<00:01:07.080> something<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:08.280> now<00:01:08.369> we're

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
air vent there or something so now we're

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.010 
air vent there or something so now we're
gonna<00:01:08.610> move<00:01:08.850> out<00:01:09.030> our<00:01:09.180> picture

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
gonna move out our picture

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.660 
gonna move out our picture
boom<00:01:10.680> all<00:01:10.920> right<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.159> we've<00:01:11.280> got<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> pretty

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
boom all right so we've got a pretty

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.730 
boom all right so we've got a pretty
good<00:01:11.820> idea<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:12.930> fill<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> blanks<00:01:13.680> here

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
good idea we can fill in the blanks here

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.140 
good idea we can fill in the blanks here
of<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:16.110> car<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.500> stuff<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:17.939> was<00:01:18.119> a

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
of the car and stuff but if this was a

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.399 
of the car and stuff but if this was a
full-size<00:01:18.570> car<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.900> could<00:01:19.020> really<00:01:19.170> get<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
full-size car you could really get a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.770 
full-size car you could really get a
sense<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:20.130> here's<00:01:20.729> where<00:01:21.090> here's

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
sense as to like here's where here's

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.210 
sense as to like here's where here's
what<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.990> general<00:01:22.320> outline<00:01:22.680> would<00:01:22.890> look<00:01:23.040> like

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
what the general outline would look like

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.830 
what the general outline would look like
and<00:01:23.520> actually<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.210> great<00:01:24.360> thing<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.720> do

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
and actually this is a great thing to do

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.969 
and actually this is a great thing to do
too<00:01:24.990> if<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.229> want<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.439> begin<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.710> try<00:01:25.920> to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
too if you want to begin to try to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.550 
too if you want to begin to try to
reproduce<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.450> colors<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.049> shading<00:01:28.409> and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
reproduce the colors and the shading and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.469 
reproduce the colors and the shading and
stuff<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:29.159> okay<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> trace<00:01:29.909> something<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
stuff it's okay to trace something and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.149 
stuff it's okay to trace something and
then<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.259> now<00:01:31.290> obviously<00:01:31.829> I'm<00:01:31.979> getting

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
then do it now obviously I'm getting

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.789 
then do it now obviously I'm getting
some<00:01:32.310> serious<00:01:32.520> smudge<00:01:33.060> here<00:01:33.090> from<00:01:34.020> my<00:01:34.170> Vic<00:01:34.439> 10

like this how does the car how does the

which I do which I love but for most
cars<00:02:39.400> it's<00:02:40.390> all<00:02:40.600> about<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.440> flow<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.100> the

cars it's all about the flow and the

lines that start at the beginning and go

lines that start at the beginning and go
somewhere<00:02:44.230> else<00:02:44.530> all<00:02:44.770> right

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.880 
imagine a wine bottle like a wine bottle
is<00:02:47.830> more<00:02:48.040> like<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.250> car<00:02:48.610> than<00:02:49.240> most<00:02:49.770> that's<00:02:50.770> how

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
is more like a car than most that's how

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.740 
is more like a car than most that's how
you<00:02:50.950> want<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.220> start<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:51.610> by<00:02:51.700> mimicking<00:02:52.270> maybe

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
you want to start is by mimicking maybe

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.480 
you want to start is by mimicking maybe
like<00:02:52.990> a<00:02:53.020> wine<00:02:53.320> bottle<00:02:53.590> because<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.160> lot<00:02:54.460> of

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
like a wine bottle because a lot of

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.070 
like a wine bottle because a lot of
those<00:02:54.700> shapes<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.210> contours<00:02:55.360> that<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:55.990> would

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
those shapes and contours that you would

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.920 
those shapes and contours that you would
experience<00:02:56.700> on<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.760> wine<00:02:58.000> bottle<00:02:58.240> also<00:02:58.570> look

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
experience on a wine bottle also look

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.800 
experience on a wine bottle also look
really<00:02:59.290> awesome<00:02:59.470> on<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.310> car<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.330> you<00:03:01.390> can<00:03:01.630> see

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
really awesome on a car so you can see

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.550 
really awesome on a car so you can see
here<00:03:02.140> we've<00:03:02.740> got<00:03:02.770> some<00:03:03.870> just<00:03:04.870> wine<00:03:05.140> bottle

here we've got some just wine bottle
type<00:03:05.800> of<00:03:05.950> shapes<00:03:06.220> but<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:08.020> kind<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.350> look<00:03:08.530> that

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
type of shapes but the kind of look that

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.530 
type of shapes but the kind of look that
we're<00:03:08.860> getting<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.850> stuff<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.300> we<00:03:10.390> could

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
we're getting the stuff that we could

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:20.240 
we're getting the stuff that we could
easily<00:03:10.840> put<00:03:11.350> into<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:11.860> really<00:03:12.160> cool<00:03:12.780> car<00:03:13.780> design

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.680 

all<00:03:21.250> right<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:21.550> check<00:03:21.580> that<00:03:21.760> out<00:03:21.940> it's<00:03:22.450> kind<00:03:22.660> of

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
all right so check that out it's kind of

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.720 
all right so check that out it's kind of
a<00:03:22.810> cool<00:03:23.020> design<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.250> look<00:03:24.370> for<00:03:24.520> inspiration

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
a cool design and look for inspiration

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.640 
a cool design and look for inspiration
in<00:03:25.120> anything<00:03:25.420> it's<00:03:25.720> it's<00:03:25.930> it's<00:03:26.230> less<00:03:26.470> about

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
in anything it's it's it's less about

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.010 
in anything it's it's it's less about
the<00:03:26.800> Oh<00:03:27.040> each<00:03:27.550> individual<00:03:28.270> piece<00:03:28.510> of<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.810> car

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
the Oh each individual piece of the car

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.949 
the Oh each individual piece of the car
like<00:03:29.230> here's<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:30.040> window<00:03:30.760> that<00:03:31.420> is<00:03:31.630> a<00:03:31.750> window

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
like here's a window that is a window

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.630 
like here's a window that is a window
here<00:03:32.620> is<00:03:32.830> a<00:03:33.270> headlight<00:03:34.290> isn't<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:35.590> cool

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
here is a headlight isn't that cool

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.130 
here is a headlight isn't that cool
it's<00:03:37.030> less<00:03:37.150> about<00:03:37.270> each<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.720> individual

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
it's less about each of the individual

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.199 
it's less about each of the individual
pieces<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:38.680> more<00:03:38.980> about<00:03:39.190> how<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.459> entire<00:03:39.850> car

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
pieces and more about how the entire car

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.630 
pieces and more about how the entire car
flows<00:03:41.080> together<00:03:41.320> with<00:03:41.709> lines<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.400> that's

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
flows together with lines and that's

design of a car and how the pieces fit

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.180 
design of a car and how the pieces fit
together<00:03:52.959> than<00:03:53.380> if<00:03:53.500> you<00:03:53.590> just<00:03:53.620> sat<00:03:53.950> there<00:03:54.160> and

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
together than if you just sat there and

drew rear-window tailpipe taillight you

drew rear-window tailpipe taillight you
know<00:03:57.940> that's<00:03:58.209> not<00:03:58.390> going<00:03:58.600> to<00:03:58.660> help<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:58.959> this

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
know that's not going to help you this

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.930

is what's going to help you and then

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.240 
is what's going to help you and then
once<00:04:01.300> you<00:04:01.420> begin<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.720> start<00:04:02.050> with<00:04:02.890> the<00:04:03.010> lines

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
once you begin to start with the lines

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.670 
once you begin to start with the lines
then<00:04:04.000> worried<00:04:04.209> about<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.600> shading<00:04:05.020> and<00:04:05.170> the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
then worried about the shading and the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.729 
then worried about the shading and the
rendering<00:04:05.920> and<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.400> color<00:04:07.410> will<00:04:08.410> throw<00:04:08.590> on<00:04:08.709> a

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
rendering and the color will throw on a

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.580 
rendering and the color will throw on a
little<00:04:08.980> bit<00:04:09.130> here<00:04:09.160> just<00:04:09.550> to<00:04:10.140> spruce<00:04:11.140> up<00:04:11.380> this

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
little bit here just to spruce up this

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.910 
little bit here just to spruce up this
quick<00:04:12.310> sketch<00:04:12.610> that<00:04:12.790> we<00:04:12.940> did<00:04:13.500> this<00:04:14.500> was<00:04:14.560> a<00:04:14.709> real

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
quick sketch that we did this was a real

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.670 
quick sketch that we did this was a real
car<00:04:15.130> I'd<00:04:15.250> call<00:04:15.610> it<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.730> wine<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.630> wino<00:04:16.870> 600

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
car I'd call it the wine the wino 600

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.270 
car I'd call it the wine the wino 600
what<00:04:18.430> do<00:04:18.519> you<00:04:18.580> think<00:04:19.769> horrible<00:04:20.769> idea

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
what do you think horrible idea

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.250 
what do you think horrible idea
all<00:04:21.609> right<00:04:21.729> anyway<00:04:22.150> we'll<00:04:22.870> call<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.140> we'll

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
all right anyway we'll call it we'll

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:47.939 
all right anyway we'll call it we'll
make<00:04:23.350> that<00:04:23.530> a<00:04:23.560> Ferrari

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.379 

alright<00:04:48.949> so<00:04:49.219> there's<00:04:49.400> a<00:04:49.460> sketchy<00:04:49.819> car<00:04:50.150> that<00:04:50.300> we

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
alright so there's a sketchy car that we

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:51.730 
alright so there's a sketchy car that we
did<00:04:50.569> just<00:04:50.599> give<00:04:50.900> him<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.050> fuel<00:04:51.259> for<00:04:51.439> the<00:04:51.530> lines

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
did just give him the fuel for the lines

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.860 
did just give him the fuel for the lines
that's<00:04:52.580> another<00:04:52.879> great<00:04:53.090> way<00:04:53.240> to<00:04:53.270> practice<00:04:53.509> if

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
that's another great way to practice if

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.899 
that's another great way to practice if
you're<00:04:53.960> tracing<00:04:54.229> don't<00:04:55.069> just<00:04:55.250> trace<00:04:55.490> to<00:04:55.669> copy

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:55.909 
you're tracing don't just trace to copy

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:57.760 
you're tracing don't just trace to copy
trace<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:56.479> get<00:04:56.599> the<00:04:56.719> feel<00:04:56.930> for<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.199> lines<00:04:57.440> and

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
trace to get the feel for the lines and

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.180 
trace to get the feel for the lines and
you'll<00:04:58.069> be<00:04:58.190> in<00:04:58.280> good<00:04:58.430> shape<00:04:58.490> all<00:04:59.030> right
