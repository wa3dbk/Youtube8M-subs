micro<00:00:06.439> sim<00:00:06.680> cutter<00:00:06.979> I<00:00:07.370> just<00:00:07.670> picked<00:00:07.939> this<00:00:08.090> up

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
micro sim cutter I just picked this up

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.470 
micro sim cutter I just picked this up
from<00:00:08.330> the<00:00:08.660> Wanchai<00:00:09.460> computer<00:00:10.460> mall<00:00:10.700> here<00:00:11.360> in

dollars<00:00:14.780> which<00:00:15.140> is<00:00:15.369> right<00:00:16.369> about<00:00:16.580> 10<00:00:16.910> us<00:00:17.330> I

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
dollars which is right about 10 us I

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.919 
dollars which is right about 10 us I
imagine<00:00:18.289> you<00:00:18.349> could<00:00:18.470> possibly<00:00:18.680> get<00:00:19.039> a<00:00:19.099> cheaper

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:19.929 
imagine you could possibly get a cheaper

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.630 
imagine you could possibly get a cheaper
depending<00:00:20.929> in<00:00:21.230> where<00:00:21.890> you<00:00:22.070> actually<00:00:22.220> buy<00:00:22.579> it

depending in where you actually buy it

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.370 
depending in where you actually buy it
now<00:00:22.939> the<00:00:22.999> reason<00:00:23.359> why<00:00:23.630> I<00:00:23.689> got<00:00:23.929> this<00:00:24.079> much

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
now the reason why I got this much

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.479 
now the reason why I got this much
person<00:00:24.829> card<00:00:25.699> cover<00:00:26.060> is<00:00:26.419> that<00:00:26.689> you<00:00:26.929> know<00:00:27.489> more

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:28.489 
person card cover is that you know more

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.370 
person card cover is that you know more
and<00:00:28.579> more<00:00:28.699> devices<00:00:28.970> these<00:00:29.449> days<00:00:29.509> seem<00:00:30.140> to<00:00:30.169> be

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
and more devices these days seem to be

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.650 
and more devices these days seem to be
popping<00:00:31.249> up<00:00:31.369> with<00:00:31.579> a<00:00:31.609> micro<00:00:32.029> sim<00:00:32.210> and<00:00:32.450> it's<00:00:32.599> a

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
popping up with a micro sim and it's a

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.569 
popping up with a micro sim and it's a
bit<00:00:32.780> of<00:00:32.899> a<00:00:32.989> pain<00:00:33.230> to<00:00:33.500> go<00:00:33.620> back<00:00:33.860> to<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.010> telcos

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
bit of a pain to go back to the telcos

bit of a pain to go back to the telcos
just<00:00:35.449> recharge<00:00:35.870> your<00:00:35.989> cards<00:00:37.000> not<00:00:38.000> only<00:00:38.149> that

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
just recharge your cards not only that

while traveling as well you want to pick
up<00:00:40.789> a<00:00:40.940> local<00:00:41.300> sim<00:00:41.660> card<00:00:42.789> especially<00:00:43.789> in

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
up a local sim card especially in

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.330 
up a local sim card especially in
markets<00:00:44.929> for<00:00:45.079> micro<00:00:45.379> sim<00:00:45.559> isn't<00:00:45.829> popular<00:00:46.010> it's

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
markets for micro sim isn't popular it's

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.139 
markets for micro sim isn't popular it's
very<00:00:46.550> hard<00:00:46.760> to<00:00:46.820> get<00:00:47.030> them<00:00:47.210> in<00:00:47.359> the<00:00:47.449> prepay<00:00:47.960> and

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
very hard to get them in the prepay and

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.959 
very hard to get them in the prepay and
format<00:00:50.149> so<00:00:50.539> micro<00:00:51.350> sim<00:00:51.559> for<00:00:51.800> prepaid<00:00:52.280> is

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
format so micro sim for prepaid is

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.369 
format so micro sim for prepaid is
always<00:00:53.300> going<00:00:53.449> to<00:00:53.570> be<00:00:53.600> a<00:00:53.690> challenge<00:00:53.929> so<00:00:54.260> this

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
always going to be a challenge so this

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:55.630 
always going to be a challenge so this
is<00:00:54.469> a<00:00:54.499> lot<00:00:54.620> about<00:00:54.739> a<00:00:54.890> little<00:00:55.070> thing<00:00:55.190> to

especially on this long travel the trips

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.680 
especially on this long travel the trips
where<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:03.559> might<00:01:04.220> be<00:01:04.630> shuttling<00:01:05.630> through

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
where you might be shuttling through

want to be on bill burrowing so anyway
as<00:01:11.570> you<00:01:11.660> can<00:01:11.780> see<00:01:12.050> the<00:01:12.260> directions<00:01:12.710> are<00:01:12.830> pretty

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
as you can see the directions are pretty

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.750 
as you can see the directions are pretty
straightforward<00:01:13.220> shove<00:01:14.120> the<00:01:14.980> card<00:01:15.980> in<00:01:16.400> and

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
straightforward shove the card in and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.550 
straightforward shove the card in and
then<00:01:17.350> smash<00:01:18.350> it<00:01:18.530> down<00:01:18.560> through<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.490> lever<00:01:19.670> um

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
then smash it down through the lever um

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.590 
then smash it down through the lever um
I'm<00:01:21.560> going<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:21.800> give<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:22.010> a<00:01:22.070> shot<00:01:22.220> right<00:01:22.490> now

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
I'm going to give it a shot right now

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.430 
I'm going to give it a shot right now
let's<00:01:23.600> see<00:01:23.720> how<00:01:23.810> it<00:01:23.840> goes<00:01:25.270> ok<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:26.330> I<00:01:26.570> have<00:01:26.870> here

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
let's see how it goes ok so I have here

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.370 
let's see how it goes ok so I have here
a<00:01:27.470> standard<00:01:28.010> sim<00:01:28.250> card<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:29.270> what's<00:01:29.960> supposed

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
a standard sim card and what's supposed

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.200 
a standard sim card and what's supposed
to<00:01:30.470> happen<00:01:30.590> is<00:01:31.160> that<00:01:31.430> it's<00:01:31.640> supposed<00:01:31.790> to<00:01:32.090> be

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
to happen is that it's supposed to be

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.700 
to happen is that it's supposed to be
slided<00:01:32.720> in<00:01:32.870> with<00:01:33.260> the<00:01:33.560> edge<00:01:33.920> facing<00:01:34.660> to<00:01:35.660> the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
slided in with the edge facing to the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.190 
slided in with the edge facing to the
upper<00:01:36.710> left<00:01:36.920> corner<00:01:37.390> into<00:01:38.390> that<00:01:38.600> little

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
upper left corner into that little

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.910 
upper left corner into that little
capsule<00:01:40.630> so<00:01:41.630> I<00:01:41.660> guess<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.470> best<00:01:42.650> way<00:01:42.860> to

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
capsule so I guess the best way to

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.980 
capsule so I guess the best way to
actually<00:01:43.430> find<00:01:44.390> you<00:01:44.630> this<00:01:44.840> is<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:46.700> slide<00:01:47.630> this

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
actually find you this is to slide this

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.610 
actually find you this is to slide this
down<00:01:49.330> slide<00:01:50.330> this<00:01:50.570> down<00:01:50.630> yet<00:01:51.200> left<00:01:51.500> the

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
down slide this down yet left the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.830 
down slide this down yet left the
direction<00:01:52.100> right<00:01:52.520> yeah<00:01:52.870> slide<00:01:53.870> it<00:01:54.050> down<00:01:54.320> and

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
direction right yeah slide it down and

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.860 
direction right yeah slide it down and
then<00:01:57.790> we<00:01:58.790> supposed<00:01:59.210> to<00:01:59.300> push<00:01:59.510> it<00:01:59.660> down<00:01:59.810> I

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
then we supposed to push it down I

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.930 
then we supposed to push it down I
believe<00:02:00.700> ok<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.000> squish<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:02.390> down<00:02:02.740> so<00:02:03.910> let<00:02:04.910> me

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
believe ok so squish it down so let me

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.340 
believe ok so squish it down so let me
use<00:02:05.120> my<00:02:05.300> right<00:02:05.420> hand<00:02:05.570> just<00:02:06.200> in<00:02:06.350> case<00:02:06.560> I

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
use my right hand just in case I

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:17.260 
use my right hand just in case I
this<00:02:07.619> up<00:02:08.060> okay<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:11.959> okay<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.950> was<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:15.380> and

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
this up okay so okay that was it and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.330 
this up okay so okay that was it and
voila<00:02:19.250> there<00:02:20.250> comes<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.640> micro<00:02:21.600> sim<00:02:21.810> card<00:02:22.340> now

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
voila there comes the micro sim card now

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.979 
voila there comes the micro sim card now
I'd<00:02:23.489> be<00:02:23.610> interesting<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.120> see<00:02:24.330> whether<00:02:24.630> this

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
I'd be interesting to see whether this

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.460 
I'd be interesting to see whether this
actually<00:02:25.530> fits<00:02:25.739> in<00:02:26.010> perfectly<00:02:26.580> with<00:02:27.470> for

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
actually fits in perfectly with for

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.130 
actually fits in perfectly with for
example<00:02:28.560> into<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.190> Apple<00:02:29.489> devices<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:30.930> let's

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
example into the Apple devices so let's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.590 
example into the Apple devices so let's
try<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.470> out<00:02:31.530> now<00:02:33.319> so<00:02:34.319> when<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.910> release<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
try that out now so when you release the

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.900 
try that out now so when you release the
lever<00:02:36.840> back<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.470> its<00:02:37.590> original<00:02:37.709> position<00:02:38.010> what

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
lever back to its original position what

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.550 
lever back to its original position what
actually<00:02:39.270> happens<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.200> will<00:02:40.350> get

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
actually happens is that you will get

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.660 
actually happens is that you will get
the<00:02:41.550> cutout<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.410> your<00:02:43.410> original<00:02:43.590> sim<00:02:44.069> card<00:02:44.340> now

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
the cutout of your original sim card now

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.030 
the cutout of your original sim card now
it's<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.970> good<00:02:45.090> thing<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.390> keep<00:02:45.540> this<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:46.830> that

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
it's a good thing to keep this so that

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.120 
it's a good thing to keep this so that
you<00:02:47.220> can<00:02:47.489> use<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:47.970> as<00:02:48.060> an<00:02:48.180> adapter<00:02:48.950> how<00:02:49.950> do<00:02:50.010> you

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
you can use it as an adapter how do you

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.840 
you can use it as an adapter how do you
said<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:51.260> mercy<00:02:52.260> kit<00:02:52.769> also<00:02:53.100> does<00:02:53.519> come

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
said that the mercy kit also does come

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.270 
said that the mercy kit also does come
with<00:02:54.090> two<00:02:54.390> adapters<00:02:55.200> as<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.680> can<00:02:55.830> see<00:02:56.040> there

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
with two adapters as you can see there

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.110 
with two adapters as you can see there
so<00:02:56.840> you<00:02:57.840> know<00:02:58.220> how<00:02:59.220> would<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.489> anyway<00:02:59.730> keep<00:02:59.910> it

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
so you know how would it anyway keep it

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.620 
so you know how would it anyway keep it
just<00:03:00.239> in<00:03:00.360> case<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:02.310> need<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.519> perfect<00:03:02.790> fit<00:03:03.269> from

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
just in case you need a perfect fit from

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.460 
just in case you need a perfect fit from
your<00:03:03.930> original<00:03:05.030> cut<00:03:06.030> out<00:03:06.180> over<00:03:06.630> there<00:03:06.810> so

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
your original cut out over there so

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.670 
your original cut out over there so
anyway<00:03:07.799> so<00:03:08.130> I<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.519> have<00:03:08.760> extracted<00:03:09.150> out<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:10.970> the

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
anyway so I I have extracted out the the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.810 
anyway so I I have extracted out the the
template<00:03:13.680> or<00:03:14.040> rather<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:15.030> tree<00:03:16.010> which<00:03:17.010> comes

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
template or rather the tree which comes

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.370 
template or rather the tree which comes
with<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.209> Apple<00:03:18.660> iPhone<00:03:19.970> 4s<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.510> let's<00:03:22.170> see

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
with the Apple iPhone 4s and let's see

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.440 
with the Apple iPhone 4s and let's see
now<00:03:22.590> whether<00:03:22.829> this<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.070> a<00:03:23.220> fit<00:03:23.519> now<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:23.880> hope<00:03:24.269> it

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
now whether this is a fit now I hope it

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.130 
now whether this is a fit now I hope it
is<00:03:24.570> a<00:03:24.600> fit<00:03:24.870> because<00:03:25.079> if<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.530> isn't<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:27.780> is<00:03:27.930> going

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
is a fit because if it isn't it is going

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:36.020 
is a fit because if it isn't it is going
to<00:03:28.230> be<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.850> shame<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:33.410> there<00:03:34.410> we<00:03:34.530> go<00:03:34.790> so<00:03:35.790> this

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
to be a shame and there we go so this

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.099 
to be a shame and there we go so this
has<00:03:36.450> actually<00:03:38.239> thought<00:03:39.239> itself<00:03:40.250> fitted<00:03:41.250> in

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
has actually thought itself fitted in

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.800 
has actually thought itself fitted in
probably<00:03:43.109> not<00:03:43.560> as<00:03:43.829> ideal<00:03:44.220> but<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:44.910> think<00:03:45.239> there

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
probably not as ideal but I think there

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.990 
probably not as ideal but I think there
is<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:45.959> way<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.230> make<00:03:46.680> King<00:03:47.190> sure<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.540> this

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
is a way to make King sure that this

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.740 
is a way to make King sure that this
goes<00:03:51.000> in<00:03:51.350> now<00:03:52.350> it<00:03:52.560> looks<00:03:52.709> fine<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.370> me<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:53.880> so

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
goes in now it looks fine to me and so

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.099 
goes in now it looks fine to me and so
shows<00:03:54.959> that<00:03:55.140> it<00:03:55.260> works<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:56.420> so<00:03:57.420> you<00:03:58.079> know

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
shows that it works and so you know

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.860 
shows that it works and so you know
instead<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.100> if<00:03:59.790> you're<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.030> guy<00:04:00.209> who<00:04:00.269> has<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.570> lot

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
instead of if you're a guy who has a lot

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.309 
instead of if you're a guy who has a lot
of<00:04:00.930> mobile<00:04:01.650> devices<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:03.109> occasionally<00:04:04.109> needs

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
of mobile devices and occasionally needs

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.940 
of mobile devices and occasionally needs
to<00:04:04.470> cut<00:04:04.680> sim<00:04:05.609> cards<00:04:06.000> instead<00:04:06.239> of<00:04:06.650> wasting<00:04:07.650> your

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
to cut sim cards instead of wasting your

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.380 
to cut sim cards instead of wasting your
money<00:04:08.040> trying<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.430> get<00:04:08.549> someone<00:04:08.850> else<00:04:09.000> cut<00:04:09.269> it

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
money trying to get someone else cut it

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.500 
money trying to get someone else cut it
for<00:04:09.630> you<00:04:09.870> it's<00:04:10.319> probably<00:04:10.739> better<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.510> you

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
for you it's probably better that you

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.289 
for you it's probably better that you
get<00:04:12.660> one<00:04:12.810> of<00:04:12.930> these<00:04:13.700> cheers<00:04:14.700> I<00:04:14.880> hope<00:04:15.030> this<00:04:15.180> has

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
get one of these cheers I hope this has

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.459 
get one of these cheers I hope this has
been<00:04:15.329> useful<00:04:15.989> for<00:04:16.590> you<00:04:16.739> bye
