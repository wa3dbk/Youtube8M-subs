think it's okay for our kids to

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.019 
think it's okay for our kids to
understand<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.529> sometimes<00:00:20.460> they<00:00:20.760> will<00:00:20.880> like

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
foods and sometimes they won't but the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.439 
foods and sometimes they won't but the
important<00:00:23.430> thing<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.699> they<00:00:24.029> try<00:00:24.420> it

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
important thing is that they try it

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.380 
important thing is that they try it
before<00:00:24.990> they<00:00:25.350> condemn<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.010> right<00:00:26.550> well<00:00:26.939> with
