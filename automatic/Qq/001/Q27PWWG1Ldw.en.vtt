00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.410
 The first assignment for the riders was one 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.050
 team race over 120 round six 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.359
 scoring classifications and points 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.939
 there in the motto that had to be in particular 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.340
 happen by terpstra and keisse 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.349
 on the men of flanderine debt collection who 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.960
 you had race 109 points together 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.270

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.870
 Round that bonus round would be one on equal 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.770

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.290
 and of course those friends have themselves 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.899
 van flanderijn himself equator residential task 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.070
 that niki terpstra and that iljo keisse 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:53.039

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.000

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.399
 photo 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.699
 And that means they are at that time 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.829
 very nice how things I had we done 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.960
 begin a Danish apostasy one 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.439
 phenomenon not seen before here 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.619
 Rotterdam with almost ten laps there 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.210
 the winner is already known and that means 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.420
 that the men from the beginning 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.430
 give gas to those after ten laps 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.840
 don't have the milk as the winner 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.240
 need to continue for the next 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.159
 places of honor Wim Stroetinga knew what he was 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.900
 he could already do two the friesian 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.790
 flats and the men in white and red 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.320
 blue van pop that I already after him 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.560
 wonderful victory 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.509
 So he won the Danish Elimination than 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.549
 also have a second important course 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.700
 in 50 minutes 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.280
 plus 10 the lap in it were the top 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.619
 team of course again 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.100
 first drove back around by men 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.130
 such as morkov and rasmussen through the caele 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.280
 and the buyst by terpstra and his buddy 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.320
 emperor but also the world champion 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.420
 were not left out in this 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.299
 match came in extremis 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.149
 connecting mouth and leather and torres 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.430
 but also very beautiful during the 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.810
 contest the men were from roompot 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.509
 holidays 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.090
 that means credit from seven houses 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.730
 that we have five teams 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.970
 knock the lock on the needle 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.330
 deployed and emperor was looking forward to it 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.120
 he seemed on the way to victory but 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.500
 the chest and the boiler that had it 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.989
 of course other plans 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.250
 first we also saw that the 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.629
 world champion came to pick up at you 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.819
 the peloton 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.870
 so his names also put him that round in the 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.090
 final 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.180
 and then get to the final sprint and then 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.650
 indeed the boss who bangs 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.530
 Jan and everyone about that 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.079
 and took the win from that means 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.630
 they position their leaders in it 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.540
 ranking have been improved by the 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.870
 victory this Tuesday at 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.019
 Wednesday, of course, the question is who 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.720
 out of 3 because the situation at the moment 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.579
 we are in charge of the buyst and the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.410
 kettle with leon times 3 and again the points 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.319
 keisse en on only twelve points 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.239
 terpstra and with the 200 no one third 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.079
 point we have a round backlog 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.680
 the danes rasmussen and morkov which of the 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.450
 3 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.209
 and so on that keisse and terpstra 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.889
 like him in her sleep and homage 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.799
 then they come to be third 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:24.500
 consecutive time on the honors list 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.730
 achievement that was previously due to pains and there 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.730
 was then realized
