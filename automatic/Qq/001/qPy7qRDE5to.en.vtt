now<00:05:43.580> let's<00:05:43.760> drop<00:05:43.970> the<00:05:44.120> top<00:05:44.300> of<00:05:44.330> this<00:05:44.510> Beamer

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
now let's drop the top of this Beamer

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.900 
now let's drop the top of this Beamer
and<00:05:45.050> see<00:05:46.040> what<00:05:46.160> it<00:05:46.250> looks<00:05:46.280> like<00:05:46.580> with<00:05:46.730> the<00:05:46.790> top

now<00:05:48.650> it's<00:05:48.800> dis<00:05:48.950> latched<00:05:49.220> so<00:05:49.760> it<00:05:49.850> should<00:05:50.330> easily

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
now it's dis latched so it should easily

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:57.250 
now it's dis latched so it should easily
go<00:05:51.500> up<00:05:51.770> there<00:05:52.460> you<00:05:52.490> go<00:05:52.730> just<00:05:52.970> push<00:05:53.120> away<00:05:56.260> this

nothing beats the other sound and

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.340 
nothing beats the other sound and
smoothness<00:06:44.150> his<00:06:44.480> car<00:06:44.690> will<00:06:44.840> pack<00:06:45.050> a<00:06:45.080> punch

I<00:07:16.320> think<00:07:17.070> this<00:07:17.190> tack<00:07:17.370> is<00:07:17.490> a<00:07:17.520> little<00:07:17.730> bit

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:17.850 
I think this tack is a little bit

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.260 
I think this tack is a little bit
sensitive

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.270

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:54.990 
car I do consider it a classic for the

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.060 
car I do consider it a classic for the
reason<00:07:55.230> that<00:07:55.260> you<00:07:55.380> just<00:07:55.590> don't<00:07:55.740> find<00:07:55.920> them
