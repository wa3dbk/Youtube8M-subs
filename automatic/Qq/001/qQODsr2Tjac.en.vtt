00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the block there's reversal block matchup

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.100 
the block there's reversal block matchup
is<00:01:29.759> very<00:01:29.970> volatile<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.750> really<00:01:30.960> go<00:01:31.079> either

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
is very volatile I can really go either

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.630 
is very volatile I can really go either

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
on how much jungle pressure you're

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.300

putting<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.200> Lane<00:01:34.380> because<00:01:35.009> as<00:01:35.159> here

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
putting on that Lane because as here

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.700 
putting on that Lane because as here
will<00:01:35.490> most<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.479> time<00:01:36.600> win<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> 1v1<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.619> if

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
will most of the time win the 1v1 but if

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.050 
will most of the time win the 1v1 but if
there's<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.920> lot<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.100> jungle<00:01:38.400> pressure<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
there's a lot of jungle pressure the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.700 
there's a lot of jungle pressure the
chains<00:01:39.360> on<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.320> really<00:01:40.470> hard<00:01:40.680> for

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
chains on is here it's really hard for

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.319 
chains on is here it's really hard for
me<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.920> get<00:01:40.979> away<00:01:41.100> from<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.400> gang<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.240> a

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
me to get away from the gang so it is a

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.700 
me to get away from the gang so it is a
very<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.869> bachelor<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.380> definitely<00:01:43.470> go

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
very it's a bachelor I can definitely go

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.230 
very it's a bachelor I can definitely go
either<00:01:43.829> way<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.340> feel<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.520> he<00:01:44.759> decided<00:01:45.180> to

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
either way and I feel like he decided to

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.429 
either way and I feel like he decided to
pick<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.509> skill<00:01:45.689> match<00:01:45.840> up<00:01:45.990> better<00:01:46.079> than<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
pick the skill match up better than the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.170 
pick the skill match up better than the
really<00:01:46.770> safecast<00:01:47.189> Olympic<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.790> as<00:01:48.000> you

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
really safecast Olympic and as you

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.639 
really safecast Olympic and as you
mentioned<00:01:48.299> there<00:01:48.750> was<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.020> little<00:01:49.380> bit<00:01:49.470> more

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
mentioned there was a little bit more

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.770 
mentioned there was a little bit more
focused<00:01:50.070> put<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> mid<00:01:50.520> lane<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:51.000> TSM<00:01:51.540> here

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
focused put on the mid lane for TSM here

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.539 
focused put on the mid lane for TSM here
so<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.049> brings<00:01:52.200> me<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.770> jungle<00:01:53.159> matchup

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
so that brings me to the jungle matchup

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.760 
so that brings me to the jungle matchup
and<00:01:53.729> although<00:01:53.939> Santorin<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.630> not<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.500> desk

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
and although Santorin is not on the desk

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.249 
and although Santorin is not on the desk
what<00:01:56.460> we<00:01:56.610> spoke<00:01:56.820> about<00:01:56.880> before<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.600> game<00:01:57.810> was

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
what we spoke about before the game was

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.050 
what we spoke about before the game was
the<00:01:58.380> fact<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.710> rush<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.369> Santorin<00:01:59.909> have

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
the fact that rush and Santorin have

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.670 
the fact that rush and Santorin have
extra<00:02:00.479> extraordinarily<00:02:00.990> different<00:02:01.439> play

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
extra extraordinarily different play

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.200 
extra extraordinarily different play
styles<00:02:01.710> but<00:02:02.130> they're<00:02:02.280> very<00:02:02.310> both<00:02:02.729> very<00:02:02.969> good

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
styles but they're very both very good

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.929 
styles but they're very both very good
at<00:02:03.299> what<00:02:03.450> they<00:02:03.570> do<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:05.340> know<00:02:05.430> how<00:02:05.700> do<00:02:05.759> you

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
at what they do so you know how do you

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.919 
at what they do so you know how do you
feel<00:02:06.450> Santorin<00:02:07.380> dealt<00:02:08.069> with<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:09.000> attempted

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
feel Santorin dealt with the attempted

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.589 
feel Santorin dealt with the attempted
pressure<00:02:10.259> by<00:02:10.770> rush<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.760> game<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.180> his<00:02:12.390> lease

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
pressure by rush this game on his lease

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.370 
pressure by rush this game on his lease
in

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
in

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.200 
in
I<00:02:13.560> actually<00:02:14.010> think<00:02:14.220> he<00:02:14.610> dealt<00:02:14.820> with<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:15.000> very

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
I actually think he dealt with a very

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.270 
I actually think he dealt with a very
well<00:02:15.390> Rex<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.870> just<00:02:16.140> another<00:02:16.770> really<00:02:17.010> strong

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
well Rex is just another really strong

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.380 
well Rex is just another really strong
really<00:02:17.400> game<00:02:17.640> jungling<00:02:17.910> like<00:02:18.060> these<00:02:18.210> hands

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
really game jungling like these hands

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.700 
really game jungling like these hands
there's<00:02:18.540> going<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.780> be<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.930> lot<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.170> small

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
there's going to be a lot of small

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.410 
there's going to be a lot of small
skirmishes<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.220> lot<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.520> fights<00:02:20.700> but<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:21.120> didn't

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
skirmishes a lot of fights but I didn't

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.730 
skirmishes a lot of fights but I didn't
really<00:02:21.540> feel<00:02:21.630> like<00:02:21.810> rush<00:02:22.110> was<00:02:22.290> really<00:02:22.470> seeking

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
really feel like rush was really seeking

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.380 
really feel like rush was really seeking
out<00:02:22.920> these<00:02:23.040> fights<00:02:23.310> at<00:02:23.460> least<00:02:23.610> not<00:02:24.060> around<00:02:24.150> my

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
out these fights at least not around my

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.700 
out these fights at least not around my
lane<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.810> wasn't<00:02:25.050> successful<00:02:25.440> any<00:02:25.590> well

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
lane and it wasn't successful any well

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.170 
lane and it wasn't successful any well
so<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:25.950> wasn't<00:02:26.220> really<00:02:26.340> feeling<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:26.970> pressure

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
so I wasn't really feeling the pressure

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.790 
so I wasn't really feeling the pressure
he<00:02:27.330> was<00:02:27.450> putting<00:02:27.630> out<00:02:27.750> compared<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.230> Rex<00:02:28.410> I<00:02:28.560> and

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
he was putting out compared to Rex I and

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.410 
he was putting out compared to Rex I and
that's<00:02:29.190> also<00:02:29.340> widely<00:02:29.580> seen<00:02:29.820> such<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.090> risky

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
that's also widely seen such a risky

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.240 
that's also widely seen such a risky
pick<00:02:30.510> as<00:02:30.660> if<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.840> don't<00:02:31.020> get<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.260> early<00:02:32.130> game

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.440 
pick as if you don't get that early game
advantage<00:02:32.460> so<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.820> don't<00:02:33.000> get<00:02:33.090> those<00:02:33.210> gangs

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
advantage so you don't get those gangs

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.940 
advantage so you don't get those gangs
off<00:02:33.630> he<00:02:33.780> doesn't<00:02:34.080> he's<00:02:34.440> not<00:02:34.590> nearly<00:02:34.770> strong

off he doesn't he's not nearly strong
later<00:02:35.310> in<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.430> game<00:02:35.550> alright<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.210> then<00:02:36.510> you

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
later in the game alright and then you

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.330 
later in the game alright and then you
guys<00:02:36.840> did<00:02:37.080> establish<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.560> pretty<00:02:37.830> decent<00:02:38.190> lead

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
guys did establish a pretty decent lead

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.790 
guys did establish a pretty decent lead
early<00:02:38.580> on<00:02:38.760> up<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.330> about<00:02:39.450> 56<00:02:40.110> k<00:02:40.380> through<00:02:40.680> the

game<00:02:44.850> is<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:45.920> due<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.370> know<00:02:47.490> just

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
game is this due to you know just

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.430 
game is this due to you know just
respect<00:02:48.240> given<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:48.990> power<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.380> the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
respect given to the power and the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.260 
respect given to the power and the
potential<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.100> team<00:02:50.250> impulse<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.730> climb<00:02:51.060> back

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
potential of team impulse to climb back

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.570 
potential of team impulse to climb back
into<00:02:51.570> it<00:02:51.750> because<00:02:51.900> we<00:02:52.080> saw<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:53.190> have<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.460> wait

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
into it because we saw you have to wait

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.710 
into it because we saw you have to wait
for<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.790> baron<00:02:54.180> have<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.450> wait<00:02:54.540> for<00:02:54.570> another

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
for a baron have to wait for another

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.600 
for a baron have to wait for another
bear<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.320> in<00:02:55.410> order<00:02:55.530> really<00:02:55.830> press<00:02:56.310> into<00:02:56.340> the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
bear and in order really press into the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.400 
bear and in order really press into the
base<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:57.030> feel<00:02:57.810> like<00:02:57.870> we<00:02:57.990> probably<00:02:58.080> could<00:02:58.380> have

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
base I feel like we probably could have

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.440 
base I feel like we probably could have
made<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.650> game<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:59.130> lot<00:02:59.340> cleaner<00:02:59.580> and<00:02:59.910> just

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
made that game a lot cleaner and just

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.650 
made that game a lot cleaner and just
like<00:03:01.820> foursome<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:02.910> situations<00:03:03.420> where<00:03:03.570> they

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
like foursome is situations where they

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.150 
like foursome is situations where they
had<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.930> respond<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.320> lot<00:03:04.440> more<00:03:04.560> because<00:03:04.860> we<00:03:05.010> put

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
had to respond a lot more because we put

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.770 
had to respond a lot more because we put
down<00:03:05.250> our<00:03:05.310> word<00:03:05.580> but<00:03:05.820> we<00:03:05.910> really<00:03:06.150> didn't<00:03:06.390> do

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
down our word but we really didn't do

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.000 
down our word but we really didn't do
anything<00:03:06.810> with<00:03:07.170> our<00:03:07.260> wards<00:03:07.500> we<00:03:07.590> just<00:03:07.770> let<00:03:07.860> them

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
anything with our wards we just let them

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.200 
anything with our wards we just let them
clear<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.490> then<00:03:08.610> we're<00:03:08.820> basically

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
clear it and then we're basically

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.330 
clear it and then we're basically
waiting<00:03:09.510> around<00:03:09.990> a<00:03:10.170> lot<00:03:10.320> instead<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.800> making

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
waiting around a lot instead of making

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.130 
waiting around a lot instead of making
aggressive<00:03:11.700> plays<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.420> feel<00:03:12.810> like<00:03:12.900> we<00:03:13.020> could

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
aggressive plays so I feel like we could

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.930 
aggressive plays so I feel like we could
have<00:03:13.170> been<00:03:13.740> more<00:03:13.860> aggressive<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.640> doing

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
have been more aggressive and doing

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.070 
have been more aggressive and doing
stuff<00:03:15.060> in<00:03:15.180> their<00:03:15.300> jungle<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.570> lot<00:03:15.660> more<00:03:15.810> I'm

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
stuff in their jungle a lot more I'm

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.750 
stuff in their jungle a lot more I'm

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
talking about cleaning things up I'm

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
different this summer split as opposed

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.560 
different this summer split as opposed
to<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.770> spring<00:03:29.100> split<00:03:29.310> which<00:03:29.580> was<00:03:29.910> touted<00:03:30.510> as

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
to the spring split which was touted as

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.720 
to the spring split which was touted as
the<00:03:30.630> split<00:03:31.050> you<00:03:31.140> guys<00:03:31.290> were<00:03:31.470> using<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:32.280> ramp<00:03:32.580> up

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
the split you guys were using to ramp up

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.000 
the split you guys were using to ramp up
to<00:03:32.910> international<00:03:33.540> international<00:03:34.290> play<00:03:34.650> York

to international international play York

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.040 
to international international play York
ssin<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.610> think<00:03:36.150> some<00:03:36.360> of<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.510> things<00:03:36.690> is<00:03:36.780> we

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
ssin I think some of the things is we

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.780 
ssin I think some of the things is we
need<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.260> respect<00:03:37.740> the<00:03:38.160> way<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.400> other<00:03:38.520> teams

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
need to respect the way the other teams

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.980 
need to respect the way the other teams
playing<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.210> way<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.360> other<00:03:39.510> regions<00:03:39.870> play

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
playing the way the other regions play

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.450 
playing the way the other regions play
because<00:03:40.230> we<00:03:40.350> were<00:03:40.470> very<00:03:40.740> set<00:03:41.040> in<00:03:41.070> stone<00:03:41.310> with

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
because we were very set in stone with

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.830 
because we were very set in stone with
our<00:03:41.550> own<00:03:41.670> place<00:03:41.910> talk<00:03:42.090> because<00:03:42.270> it<00:03:42.720> was

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
our own place talk because it was

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.060 
our own place talk because it was
working<00:03:43.050> for<00:03:43.140> us<00:03:43.230> in<00:03:43.380> scrims<00:03:43.620> even<00:03:43.890> against

working for us in scrims even against

working for us in scrims even against
the<00:03:44.160> team<00:03:44.310> ISM<00:03:44.550> at<00:03:44.700> Emma<00:03:45.030> Sylas<00:03:45.330> working<00:03:45.600> for

the team ISM at Emma Sylas working for

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.449 
the team ISM at Emma Sylas working for
us<00:03:45.810> in<00:03:45.930> an<00:03:46.020> a<00:03:46.140> so<00:03:46.560> we<00:03:46.650> had<00:03:46.740> a<00:03:46.770> very<00:03:46.920> set<00:03:47.160> play<00:03:47.310> saw

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
us in an a so we had a very set play saw

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.370 
us in an a so we had a very set play saw
that<00:03:47.550> we<00:03:47.670> thought<00:03:47.970> was<00:03:48.150> really<00:03:48.330> good<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:48.780> we

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
that we thought was really good and we

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.660 
that we thought was really good and we
feel<00:03:49.560> like<00:03:49.590> even<00:03:49.890> though<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.280> other<00:03:50.430> place<00:03:50.640> I

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
feel like even though the other place I

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.770 
feel like even though the other place I
was<00:03:50.850> working<00:03:51.060> for<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.209> other<00:03:51.330> teams<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.690> was

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
was working for the other teams it was

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.030 
was working for the other teams it was
really<00:03:52.020> something<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.380> we<00:03:52.500> were<00:03:52.680> gonna

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
really something that we were gonna

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.470 
really something that we were gonna
enforce<00:03:53.430> your<00:03:53.490> sauce<00:03:53.730> was<00:03:53.940> working<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:54.330> well

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
enforce your sauce was working so well

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.640 
enforce your sauce was working so well
but<00:03:54.690> I<00:03:54.750> think<00:03:54.990> we<00:03:55.050> need<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.320> be<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.470> lot<00:03:55.620> more

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
but I think we need to be a lot more

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.530 
but I think we need to be a lot more
respecting<00:03:56.610> of<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:57.000> other<00:03:57.120> teams<00:03:57.360> play

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
respecting of the other teams play

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.060 
respecting of the other teams play
styles<00:03:57.870> other<00:03:57.990> to<00:03:58.170> use<00:03:58.290> pics<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.740> see<00:03:58.950> how

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
styles other to use pics and see how

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.949 
styles other to use pics and see how
they<00:03:59.250> play<00:03:59.400> cuz<00:03:59.670> essentially<00:04:00.240> I<00:04:00.390> think<00:04:00.870> the

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
they play cuz essentially I think the

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.000 
they play cuz essentially I think the
way<00:04:01.050> they<00:04:01.230> played<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.530> game<00:04:01.680> was<00:04:01.800> better

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
way they played the game was better

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.010

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.320 
feel like a Lincoln pop out there were
pretty<00:04:55.500> similar<00:04:55.800> in<00:04:55.830> play<00:04:56.190> cells<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:56.759> I<00:04:57.060> think

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
pretty similar in play cells and I think

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.999 
pretty similar in play cells and I think
co<00:04:57.690> ji<00:04:57.870> has<00:04:57.960> always<00:04:58.169> been<00:04:58.319> a<00:04:58.379> strong<00:04:58.560> team<00:04:58.770> they

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.100 
co ji has always been a strong team they
just<00:04:59.190> seemed<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.580> falter<00:04:59.909> and<00:04:59.970> closing<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:01.020> the

just seemed to falter and closing to the

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
playoffs but honestly think they're the

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.510 
playoffs but honestly think they're the
same<00:05:03.930> strong<00:05:04.199> co<00:05:04.409> ji<00:05:04.620> and<00:05:04.889> they<00:05:05.310> have<00:05:05.490> a

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
similar play style and I still think

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:08.749 
similar play style and I still think
they're<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.680> same<00:05:07.800> co<00:05:07.979> ji<00:05:08.190> all<00:05:08.520> right<00:05:08.610> well
