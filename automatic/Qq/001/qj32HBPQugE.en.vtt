00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.170 
all now I'll tell you the Ultimate
Warrior<00:04:20.620> did<00:04:21.100> a<00:04:21.130> little<00:04:21.340> bit<00:04:21.430> of<00:04:21.519> work<00:04:21.699> here

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
Warrior did a little bit of work here

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.200 
Warrior did a little bit of work here
and<00:04:22.740> he's<00:04:23.740> definitely<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.370> legend<00:04:25.000> in<00:04:25.120> the

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
and he's definitely a legend in the

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.050 
and he's definitely a legend in the
world<00:04:25.330> of<00:04:25.570> WWE<00:04:25.810> maybe<00:04:26.800> not<00:04:27.039> the<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.789> most

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
world of WWE maybe not the the most

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.189 
world of WWE maybe not the the most
reliable<00:04:28.479> person<00:04:29.130> but<00:04:30.330> by<00:04:31.330> all<00:04:31.509> means<00:04:31.539> he<00:04:32.050> was

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
reliable person but by all means he was

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.189 
reliable person but by all means he was
an<00:04:32.320> intense<00:04:32.740> or<00:04:33.280> is<00:04:33.580> an<00:04:33.910> intense<00:04:34.330> guy<00:04:34.630> and<00:04:34.990> and

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
an intense or is an intense guy and and

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.560 
an intense or is an intense guy and and
I<00:04:35.620> think<00:04:35.830> that<00:04:36.009> some<00:04:36.280> warriors<00:04:36.820> you<00:04:37.180> know<00:04:37.300> they

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
I think that some warriors you know they

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.390 
I think that some warriors you know they
retreat<00:04:38.139> and<00:04:38.349> they<00:04:38.410> don't<00:04:38.650> need<00:04:38.770> to<00:04:38.949> be<00:04:39.099> out<00:04:39.280> in

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
retreat and they don't need to be out in

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.610 
retreat and they don't need to be out in
the<00:04:39.460> public<00:04:39.910> so<00:04:40.150> not<00:04:40.960> gonna<00:04:41.139> hold<00:04:41.289> anything

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
the public so not gonna hold anything

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.469 
the public so not gonna hold anything
against<00:04:42.160> him<00:04:42.370> but<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:42.639> really<00:04:43.000> like<00:04:43.180> some<00:04:43.449> of

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
against him but I really like some of

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.390 
against him but I really like some of
the<00:04:43.599> things<00:04:43.840> he<00:04:44.050> said<00:04:44.320> but<00:04:44.560> most<00:04:44.770> important

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
the things he said but most important

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.089 
the things he said but most important
it's<00:04:45.880> not<00:04:46.060> what<00:04:46.180> you<00:04:46.330> say<00:04:46.630> it's<00:04:46.900> what<00:04:47.740> you<00:04:47.800> do

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
it's not what you say it's what you do

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.950 
it's not what you say it's what you do
and<00:04:48.370> that's<00:04:48.460> what<00:04:48.699> I<00:04:48.729> like<00:04:48.940> about<00:04:49.120> this<00:04:49.389> gym<00:04:49.720> is

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
that there's not a lot of talk here it's

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.850 
that there's not a lot of talk here it's
people<00:04:52.690> coming<00:04:52.720> in<00:04:53.110> here<00:04:53.320> to<00:04:53.440> get<00:04:53.620> work<00:04:53.830> done

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860
