mispronouncing that I'm not a user of

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.109 
mispronouncing that I'm not a user of
that<00:00:22.109> operating<00:00:22.590> system<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> flavor<00:00:23.970> of

Linux and so just like Android you can

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.509 
Linux and so just like Android you can
run<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.720> through<00:00:27.750> Harry<00:00:28.109> XE<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.039> windows

I<00:01:47.399> wonder<00:01:47.820> how<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.000> hide<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.390> calendar<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
I wonder how you hide the calendar and I

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.480 
I wonder how you hide the calendar and I
don't<00:01:49.079> use<00:01:49.350> Ubuntu<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.009> I'm<00:01:50.070> not<00:01:50.159> really<00:01:50.310> sure

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
don't use Ubuntu so I'm not really sure

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.889 
don't use Ubuntu so I'm not really sure
how<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.670> do<00:01:50.790> these<00:01:50.909> things<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.600> I'll<00:01:51.659> go<00:01:51.750> back

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
how to do these things so I'll go back

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.480 
how to do these things so I'll go back
up<00:01:52.079> into<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.439> menu<00:01:52.680> up<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.130> upper<00:01:53.310> left

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
up into this menu up in the upper left

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.090 
up into this menu up in the upper left
corner<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.939> let's<00:01:54.630> go<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.930> off<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
corner and let's go to off this and the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.469 
corner and let's go to off this and the
word<00:01:56.280> processor<00:01:56.820> or<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> spreadsheet

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
word processor or the spreadsheet

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.959 
word processor or the spreadsheet
actually<00:01:58.189> it's<00:01:59.189> gonna<00:01:59.280> take<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> moment<00:01:59.790> but

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
actually it's gonna take a moment but

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.510 
actually it's gonna take a moment but
it's<00:02:00.119> gonna<00:02:00.210> launch<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:01.189> okay<00:02:02.189> here<00:02:02.399> we<00:02:02.490> have

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
it's gonna launch it okay here we have

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.039 
it's gonna launch it okay here we have
the<00:02:02.610> spreadsheet<00:02:03.210> program<00:02:03.600> let's<00:02:03.810> see<00:02:03.899> if<00:02:03.960> we

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the spreadsheet program let's see if we

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.340 
the spreadsheet program let's see if we
can<00:02:04.170> move<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.500> around<00:02:04.590> on<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.890> screen<00:02:06.350> looks

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
can move it around on the screen looks

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.630 
can move it around on the screen looks
like<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.560> can't<00:02:07.799> do<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.220> perhaps<00:02:08.369> I'm

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
like I can't do that but perhaps I'm

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.639 
like I can't do that but perhaps I'm
doing<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.030> command<00:02:09.330> wrong<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:10.050> can<00:02:10.289> tap

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
doing that command wrong we can tap

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.199 
doing that command wrong we can tap
along<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.310> spreadsheet<00:02:11.730> program<00:02:12.060> just

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
along in the spreadsheet program just

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.600 
along in the spreadsheet program just
like<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.420> could<00:02:12.569> do<00:02:12.660> in<00:02:12.780> Excel

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
like you could do in Excel

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.890 
like you could do in Excel
although<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.910> course<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.240> is<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.480> Ubuntu

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
although of course this is the Ubuntu

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.420 
although of course this is the Ubuntu
version<00:02:15.080> I'm<00:02:15.410> gonna<00:02:15.560> exit<00:02:15.860> out<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.100> and

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
version I'm gonna exit out of that and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.380 
version I'm gonna exit out of that and
see<00:02:16.970> what<00:02:17.240> else<00:02:17.420> we<00:02:17.660> have<00:02:19.060> forget<00:02:20.060> about<00:02:20.150> that

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
see what else we have forget about that

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.510 
see what else we have forget about that
see<00:02:20.780> what<00:02:20.930> else<00:02:21.050> we<00:02:21.230> have<00:02:21.260> in<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.890> menu<00:02:22.250> up

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
see what else we have in the menu up

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.680 
see what else we have in the menu up
here<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:24.200> we<00:02:24.320> can<00:02:24.440> go<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.590> settings<00:02:25.250> and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
here so we can go to settings and

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.420 
here so we can go to settings and
appearance<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:30.010> then<00:02:31.010> we<00:02:31.100> get<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.250> few

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
appearance and then we get a few

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.950 
appearance and then we get a few
settings<00:02:31.820> here<00:02:32.060> although<00:02:32.180> probably<00:02:32.600> many<00:02:32.810> of

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
settings here although probably many of

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.480 
settings here although probably many of
them<00:02:33.080> don't<00:02:33.320> work<00:02:33.680> because<00:02:33.860> we're<00:02:34.130> running<00:02:34.280> it

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
them don't work because we're running it

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.160 
them don't work because we're running it
on<00:02:34.580> a<00:02:34.610> device<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:35.120> really<00:02:35.300> wasn't<00:02:35.480> intended

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
on a device that really wasn't intended

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.780 
on a device that really wasn't intended
to<00:02:36.200> run<00:02:36.530> this<00:02:36.680> operating<00:02:37.220> system<00:02:37.550> so<00:02:37.670> we<00:02:37.730> can

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
to run this operating system so we can

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.970 
to run this operating system so we can
bounce<00:02:38.000> around<00:02:38.240> here<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:38.900> change<00:02:39.830> the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
bounce around here and change the

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.260 
bounce around here and change the
different<00:02:40.250> options<00:02:40.370> again<00:02:40.820> I'm<00:02:40.910> not<00:02:41.090> really

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
different options again I'm not really

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.930 
different options again I'm not really
sure<00:02:41.570> what<00:02:41.750> any<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:41.959> these<00:02:42.110> things<00:02:42.490> do<00:02:43.490> because

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
sure what any of these things do because

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.090 
sure what any of these things do because
I<00:02:44.180> don't<00:02:44.390> use<00:02:44.570> Ubuntu<00:02:44.750> but<00:02:45.500> if<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.770> do<00:02:45.890> use

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
I don't use Ubuntu but if you do use

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.280 
I don't use Ubuntu but if you do use
Ubuntu<00:02:46.340> then<00:02:46.940> you'll<00:02:47.630> probably<00:02:48.050> feel

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
Ubuntu then you'll probably feel

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.690 
Ubuntu then you'll probably feel
comfortable<00:02:48.830> on<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.010> in<00:02:49.220> this<00:02:49.400> environment

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
comfortable on this in this environment

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.970 
comfortable on this in this environment
I'll<00:02:50.240> post<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.570> link<00:02:50.600> on<00:02:50.810> pocketnow.com<00:02:51.260> on<00:02:51.800> how

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
I'll post a link on pocketnow.com on how

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.860 
I'll post a link on pocketnow.com on how
to<00:02:52.040> get<00:02:52.280> this<00:02:52.400> running<00:02:52.670> it's<00:02:53.060> very<00:02:53.330> easy<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.750> do

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
to get this running it's very easy to do

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.510 
to get this running it's very easy to do
you<00:02:53.900> load<00:02:54.230> all<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.530> files<00:02:54.709> onto<00:02:55.010> your<00:02:55.130> storage

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
you load all the files onto your storage

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.510 
you load all the files onto your storage
card<00:02:55.760> run<00:02:56.270> harity<00:02:56.660> XE<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.380> within<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:58.100> couple

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
card run harity XE and within a couple

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.490 
card run harity XE and within a couple
minutes<00:02:58.880> you've<00:02:59.239> got<00:02:59.270> you<00:02:59.900> want<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.230> running

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
minutes you've got you want to running

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.190 
minutes you've got you want to running
on<00:03:00.800> your<00:03:00.920> touch<00:03:01.100> pro2<00:03:01.450> with<00:03:02.450> keyboard<00:03:03.050> support

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
on your touch pro2 with keyboard support

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.750 
on your touch pro2 with keyboard support
so<00:03:03.560> pretty<00:03:03.890> cool<00:03:04.100> stuff<00:03:04.340> that's<00:03:05.300> it<00:03:05.510> for<00:03:05.660> now
