Today, I experienced the masala system. Rajni's Hindi movie "The Robot".

00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:30.430
I'm in a theater at Ikebukuro Tokyo. Masala system is that audience can make noise or dancing while watching a movie.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:35.330
Before screening, they get high.

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:50.830
He was explaining his menu.

00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:57.900
They are passionate.

00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:01.760
Curry

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:12.900
Indian

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:22.430
Dancing crazy lol

00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:31.200
"Can we dance while watching?" "Yes"

00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:39.200
Masala system is a method of screening in India.

00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:50.630
We audience can laugh out loud, dancing, or use a cracker.

00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:55.030
But that is not Indian theater. Tokyo!

00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:59.080
Showing

00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:16.330
It was very fun. I hope all other theaters will become so.

00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:27.160
We all feel sympathy. Because we danced and laughed in same place same time.

00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:39.700
I think it is similar to live.

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:50.430
Entertainment industry or content industry, it is necessary to experience this.

00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:57.400
I reported about the Masala system theater. Thank you.
