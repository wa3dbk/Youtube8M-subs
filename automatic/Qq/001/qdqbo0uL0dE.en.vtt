 and the razor never calls and wonders a thousand 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.150

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.510
 spent seven hundred nineteen 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:08.630
 kilometers forty three liters point six 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.450
 tenths of a liter turned out and I downloaded 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.900
 fuel calculator turned out average 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.310
 consumption 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:20.509
 look here is a distance of 700 16 kilometers 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:27.070
 I said 719 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:27.070
 I apologize now we immediately in volume 719 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:36.050
 seven hundred and nineteen kilometers 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:44.229
 Well, that's 40 3.6 liters fuel consumption 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:48.220
 average 6 whole 0.06 here I see I do not know 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.220
 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.500
 right now 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.690
 we set 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.679
 here she is 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.440
 liters per 100 kilometers comfortable 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:23.290
 calculator here is also calculated 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:25.730
 it means that fuel consumption is calculated 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.960
 distance amount of fuel total 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:37.030
 the amount of consumption is calculated like this 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:38.860
 fuel prices kill shows 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.190
 distance 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:47.210
 how much fuel will you get 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:50.540
 but I thought it did nâ€™t matter in the end 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.990
 it turns out she eats 6 liters 6 liters 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.890
 at run 2600 well, that is, only 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.890
 passed run-in
