changes<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.329> your<00:01:00.539> life<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.559> i<00:01:01.620> think<00:01:01.920> you're

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
changes in your life and i think you're

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.090 
changes in your life and i think you're
on<00:01:03.300> board<00:01:03.960> with<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.680> let's<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.010> look

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
on board with that so let's have a look

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:14.230 
on board with that so let's have a look
at<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:06.270> day<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.659> particular<00:01:10.610> okay

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.450 

so<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:14.990> first<00:01:15.170> card<00:01:15.470> is<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.710> tower<00:01:16.130> in

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
so the first card is the tower in

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.920 
so the first card is the tower in
reverse<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:17.119> tower<00:01:17.329> in<00:01:17.479> reverse<00:01:17.750> is

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
reverse and the tower in reverse is

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.889 
reverse and the tower in reverse is
really<00:01:18.200> a<00:01:18.229> good<00:01:18.470> sign<00:01:18.710> because<00:01:19.360> this<00:01:20.360> way<00:01:20.600> it's

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
really a good sign because this way it's

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.160 
really a good sign because this way it's
things<00:01:21.290> coming<00:01:21.409> undone<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:22.659> this<00:01:23.659> way<00:01:23.869> it's

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
things coming undone and this way it's

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.020 
things coming undone and this way it's
building<00:01:24.860> new<00:01:24.890> towers<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:25.610> creating<00:01:26.000> new

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
building new towers and creating new

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.240 
building new towers and creating new
structures<00:01:26.659> in<00:01:26.810> your<00:01:26.960> life<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:27.649> you<00:01:28.039> can

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
structures in your life so you can

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.380 
structures in your life so you can
expect<00:01:28.580> to<00:01:29.619> have<00:01:30.619> that<00:01:30.830> happen<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.490> now

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
expect to have that happen and now

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.120 
expect to have that happen and now
you're<00:01:32.570> building<00:01:32.960> something<00:01:32.990> new<00:01:33.439> that

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
you're building something new that

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.330 
you're building something new that
something<00:01:34.759> that's<00:01:34.939> been<00:01:35.119> in<00:01:35.240> your<00:01:35.270> life<00:01:35.420> for
