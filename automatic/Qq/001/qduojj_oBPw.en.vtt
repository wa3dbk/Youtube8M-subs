time you catch the basketball let's say

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.600 
time you catch the basketball let's say
you<00:00:22.430> catch<00:00:22.759> it<00:00:22.939> at<00:00:23.029> the<00:00:23.119> top<00:00:23.329> of<00:00:23.360> the<00:00:23.570> key<00:00:23.750> a

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
you catch it at the top of the key a

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.299 
you catch it at the top of the key a
standard<00:00:25.610> rule<00:00:25.820> is<00:00:26.060> in<00:00:26.919> offensive<00:00:27.919> basketball

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:28.309 
standard rule is in offensive basketball

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:29.830 
standard rule is in offensive basketball
you<00:00:28.669> always<00:00:29.059> catch<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:29.480> ball<00:00:29.660> with<00:00:29.779> the

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
you always catch the ball with the

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.260 
you always catch the ball with the
intent<00:00:30.259> to<00:00:30.349> score<00:00:30.950> that's<00:00:31.700> another<00:00:32.029> way<00:00:32.239> of

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
intent to score that's another way of

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.569 
intent to score that's another way of
telling<00:00:32.809> players<00:00:33.020> catch<00:00:33.860> it<00:00:34.070> in<00:00:34.190> triple

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
telling players catch it in triple

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.970 
telling players catch it in triple
threat<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:35.120> I<00:00:35.270> just<00:00:35.540> think<00:00:35.780> if<00:00:36.410> you<00:00:36.590> tell<00:00:36.830> them

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
threat and I just think if you tell them

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.430 
threat and I just think if you tell them
to<00:00:37.130> catch<00:00:37.310> it<00:00:37.600> with<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:38.720> intent<00:00:38.990> to<00:00:39.080> score

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
to catch it with the intent to score

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.810 
to catch it with the intent to score
they<00:00:39.650> like<00:00:39.830> that<00:00:40.040> better<00:00:40.280> because<00:00:40.580> they<00:00:40.700> all

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
they like that better because they all

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.730 
they like that better because they all
liked<00:00:41.060> they<00:00:41.480> all<00:00:41.600> like<00:00:41.750> to<00:00:41.900> score<00:00:42.170> think<00:00:42.590> their

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
liked they all like to score think their

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.100 
liked they all like to score think their
scores<00:00:43.100> so<00:00:43.670> his<00:00:43.850> posture<00:00:44.450> every<00:00:44.750> time<00:00:44.990> he

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
scores so his posture every time he

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.990 
scores so his posture every time he
catches<00:00:45.320> it<00:00:45.530> is<00:00:45.800> always<00:00:46.160> in<00:00:46.310> the<00:00:46.340> stands<00:00:46.670> bend

is is is in the shooting pocket is his

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.170 
is is is in the shooting pocket is his
chins<00:00:54.260> up<00:00:54.440> on<00:00:54.620> his<00:00:54.740> eyes<00:00:54.890> are<00:00:55.070> on<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.280> rim<00:00:55.460> okay

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
chins up on his eyes are on the rim okay

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.530 
chins up on his eyes are on the rim okay
so<00:00:56.239> we're<00:00:56.510> going<00:00:56.600> to<00:00:56.690> play<00:00:56.840> from<00:00:57.079> that<00:00:57.230> premise

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
so we're going to play from that premise

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.580 
so we're going to play from that premise
but<00:00:59.540> I<00:00:59.630> want<00:00:59.810> to<00:00:59.840> take<00:01:00.020> this<00:01:00.050> a<00:01:00.230> step<00:01:00.350> further

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
but I want to take this a step further

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.590 
but I want to take this a step further
and<00:01:00.950> I<00:01:01.100> think<00:01:01.400> this<00:01:01.550> is<00:01:01.610> crucial<00:01:02.270> and<00:01:02.420> I<00:01:02.540> it

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
and I think this is crucial and I it

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.689 
and I think this is crucial and I it
really<00:01:03.079> doesn't<00:01:03.530> matter<00:01:03.649> what<00:01:04.009> your<00:01:04.189> athletic

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
really doesn't matter what your athletic

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.480 
really doesn't matter what your athletic
ability<00:01:04.790> is<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:06.500> again<00:01:06.770> just<00:01:06.950> like<00:01:07.100> kind<00:01:07.399> of

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
ability is and again just like kind of

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.670 
ability is and again just like kind of
change<00:01:07.729> a<00:01:07.880> speed<00:01:08.150> and<00:01:08.300> direction<00:01:08.500> it's<00:01:09.500> just

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
change a speed and direction it's just

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.440 
change a speed and direction it's just
that<00:01:09.770> little<00:01:10.070> piece<00:01:10.460> of<00:01:10.490> your<00:01:10.790> game<00:01:11.030> if<00:01:11.300> you
