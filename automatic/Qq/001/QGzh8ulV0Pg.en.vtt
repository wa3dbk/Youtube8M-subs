but paying five dollars rather than

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.050 
but paying five dollars rather than
twenty-five<00:01:11.010> dollars<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> great<00:01:11.850> deal

flowers on it

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.760 
flowers on it
I<00:01:42.090> think<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.570> pattern<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.530> pretty

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
I think the pattern on this is so pretty

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.620 
I think the pattern on this is so pretty
and<00:01:44.040> also<00:01:44.189> has<00:01:44.399> ruffled<00:01:44.880> detailing<00:01:45.420> at<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
and also has ruffled detailing at the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.420 
and also has ruffled detailing at the
top<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.079> then<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.380> got<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.710> black<00:01:47.009> skater

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
top and then I got this black skater

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.609 
top and then I got this black skater
dress<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.210> think<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.509> very<00:01:48.630> simple<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.470> I

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
dress and I think it's very simple and I

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.350 
dress and I think it's very simple and I
could<00:01:49.770> probably<00:01:49.890> just<00:01:50.100> pair<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.640> flannel<00:01:51.240> or

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
could probably just pair a flannel or

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.670 
could probably just pair a flannel or
something<00:01:51.750> over<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.229> make<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.470> look<00:01:52.590> a

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
something over it to make it look a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.319 
something over it to make it look a
little<00:01:52.799> bit<00:01:52.979> more<00:01:53.100> edgy<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.640> was<00:01:54.000> lucky<00:01:54.210> enough

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
little bit more edgy I was lucky enough

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.539

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
just don't really like these because

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.589 
just don't really like these because
they<00:05:47.860> are<00:05:47.889> really<00:05:48.250> flimsy<00:05:48.940> I<00:05:49.120> put<00:05:49.360> them<00:05:49.479> on

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
once and didn't even wear them because

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.820 
once and didn't even wear them because
they<00:05:51.400> were<00:05:51.460> like<00:05:51.669> falling<00:05:52.029> off<00:05:52.210> my<00:05:52.240> feet<00:05:52.719> but<00:05:53.529> I
