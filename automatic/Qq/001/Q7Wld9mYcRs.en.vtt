has<00:00:29.730> been<00:00:29.760> one<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.900> most<00:00:30.990> rewarding

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
has been one of the most rewarding

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.060 
has been one of the most rewarding
experiences<00:00:33.140> you<00:00:34.140> know<00:00:34.200> going<00:00:34.469> into<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.829> I

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
experiences you know going into it I

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.799 
experiences you know going into it I
wasn't<00:00:35.370> turned<00:00:35.520> by<00:00:35.640> one<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.239> wanted<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.630> rush

wasn't turned by one if I wanted to rush
and<00:00:37.340> I<00:00:38.340> think<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.390> was<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.660> us<00:00:39.750> one<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.350> the
