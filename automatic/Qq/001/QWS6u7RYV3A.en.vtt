but it wasn't i wasn't really into it's
just<00:00:35.370> like<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:35.610> somebody<00:00:35.940> else<00:00:36.059> wouldn't<00:00:36.300> play

house actually the night it came out try
it<00:01:03.239> out<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.690> was<00:01:03.780> cool<00:01:03.960> at<00:01:04.110> first<00:01:04.140> cuz<00:01:04.470> we<00:01:04.620> were

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
it out it was cool at first cuz we were

like<00:01:04.890> getting<00:01:05.129> used<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:05.550> I<00:01:05.640> think<00:01:05.670> yeah

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
like getting used to what I think yeah

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.730 
like getting used to what I think yeah
it<00:01:06.360> does<00:01:06.630> make<00:01:06.780> things<00:01:06.810> easier<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.590> can

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
it does make things easier like you can

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.230 
it does make things easier like you can
like<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.220> win<00:01:08.370> a<00:01:08.400> little<00:01:08.610> bit<00:01:08.729> easier<00:01:08.880> at

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
like you can win a little bit easier at

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.219 
like you can win a little bit easier at
least<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.450> could<00:01:09.630> win<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> little<00:01:10.049> bit<00:01:10.140> easier

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
least I could win a little bit easier

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.050 
least I could win a little bit easier
and<00:01:10.530> there<00:01:11.009> was<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.159> smaller<00:01:11.399> gap<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
and there was a smaller gap of like a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.149 
and there was a smaller gap of like a
skill<00:01:12.360> gap<00:01:12.540> between<00:01:12.990> people<00:01:13.409> mostly<00:01:13.920> cuz<00:01:14.070> it

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
skill gap between people mostly cuz it

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.219 
skill gap between people mostly cuz it
was<00:01:14.250> new<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.630> progressed<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.140> we

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
was new but as it progressed like we

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.109 
was new but as it progressed like we
were<00:01:16.320> still<00:01:16.500> kind<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.950> let's<00:01:17.700> go<00:01:17.820> gap<00:01:17.969> was

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
were still kind of like let's go gap was

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.270 
were still kind of like let's go gap was
a<00:01:18.149> lot<00:01:18.329> smaller<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.560> was<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> little<00:01:19.920> easier

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
a lot smaller so it was a little easier

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.950 
a lot smaller so it was a little easier
to<00:01:20.310> play<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.000> wasn't<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.299> far<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:21.630> my<00:01:21.750> life

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
to play but it wasn't as far as my life

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.380 
to play but it wasn't as far as my life
what<00:01:22.770> was<00:01:22.860> different<00:01:23.009> about<00:01:23.189> brawl<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.789> made

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
what was different about brawl that made

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.090 
what was different about brawl that made
it<00:01:24.509> less<00:01:24.630> fun<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:25.020> less<00:01:25.140> competitive<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.770> melee

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100

the<00:02:00.500> FT<00:02:00.770> in<00:02:00.890> that<00:02:01.040> level<00:02:01.159> I<00:02:01.369> didn't<00:02:01.549> like<00:02:01.640> so

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
the FT in that level I didn't like so

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.700 
the FT in that level I didn't like so
much<00:02:01.880> because<00:02:02.150> of<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.360> hooks<00:02:03.140> on<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.439> edges

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
much because of the hooks on the edges

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.820 
much because of the hooks on the edges
it<00:02:03.860> was<00:02:04.070> hard<00:02:04.220> to<00:02:04.250> recover<00:02:04.869> but<00:02:05.869> overall<00:02:06.500> like

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
it was hard to recover but overall like

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.749 
it was hard to recover but overall like
some<00:02:07.009> of<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.159> levels<00:02:07.280> would<00:02:07.520> have<00:02:07.640> been

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
some of the levels would have been

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.219 
some of the levels would have been
really<00:02:07.880> cool<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.179> like<00:02:08.420> incorporate<00:02:08.899> or<00:02:09.050> love

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
try the the online play and what do you

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.930 
try the the online play and what do you
think<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:14.150> tried<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.200> online<00:02:15.230> play<00:02:15.940> it's

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
think I tried the online play it's

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.780 
think I tried the online play it's
really<00:02:17.060> laggy<00:02:17.980> really<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.310> just<00:02:19.400> wanted<00:02:19.730> to

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
really laggy really I just wanted to

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.370 
really laggy really I just wanted to
casually<00:02:20.270> play<00:02:20.450> but<00:02:20.630> either<00:02:20.900> way<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:21.170> was

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
casually play but either way it was

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.630 
casually play but either way it was
frustrating<00:02:21.980> because<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.400> couldn't

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
frustrating because you couldn't

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.340 
frustrating because you couldn't
necessarily<00:02:23.000> do<00:02:23.450> like<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.750> combos<00:02:24.080> or<00:02:24.110> moves

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
necessarily do like the combos or moves

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.870 
necessarily do like the combos or moves
you<00:02:24.440> wanted<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.709> do<00:02:24.830> because<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.400> lag<00:02:25.580> was<00:02:25.760> so

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
you wanted to do because the lag was so

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.240 
you wanted to do because the lag was so
bad<00:02:26.239> at<00:02:26.270> some<00:02:26.569> points<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:27.110> know<00:02:27.230> so<00:02:27.560> have<00:02:28.190> you

character of course play experience in
the<00:05:58.590> tournament<00:05:58.979> I<00:05:59.130> think<00:05:59.310> playing<00:05:59.550> against

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
the tournament I think playing against

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.070 
the tournament I think playing against
as<00:06:00.000> many<00:06:00.180> people<00:06:00.510> as<00:06:00.570> possible<00:06:00.690> because

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
as many people as possible because

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.740 
as many people as possible because
everybody<00:06:01.530> plays<00:06:01.830> differently<00:06:02.250> so<00:06:03.090> I<00:06:03.120> mean

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
everybody plays differently so I mean

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.360 
everybody plays differently so I mean
you<00:06:03.870> can<00:06:03.990> play<00:06:04.139> 100<00:06:04.470> foxes<00:06:04.949> and<00:06:04.979> you<00:06:05.190> have<00:06:05.310> to

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
you can play 100 foxes and you have to

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.649 
you can play 100 foxes and you have to
do<00:06:05.460> different<00:06:05.760> things<00:06:05.789> against<00:06:06.389> all<00:06:06.510> of<00:06:06.630> them

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:06.659 
do different things against all of them

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:07.790 
do different things against all of them
because<00:06:06.870> they're<00:06:07.139> all<00:06:07.260> going<00:06:07.409> to<00:06:07.500> be<00:06:07.590> a<00:06:07.620> little

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
because they're all going to be a little

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.370 
because they're all going to be a little
bit<00:06:07.889> different
