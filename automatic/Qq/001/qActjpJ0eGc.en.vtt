00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.189
 hello other days today renew to make a 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:14.030
 depurative broth 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.030
 I have here with the thin white 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.240
 we cut in half 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.329
 I prefer an onion because it can 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.630
 happen to make us an onion of those 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:28.480
 that sting and then it is castro dÃ­az or 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.380
 for dinner take this and arrest the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.380
 onion then 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.379
 on the big rock 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.879
 a twig of celery does not metal me five or 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.199
 six twigs opened because it was very 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:52.720
 strong one with a twig of pretty 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:55.329
 Migration refreshes the guts a lot 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.039
 of the same 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.039
 gave me for the little passion 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.960
 provide 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:09.240
 when it's 34 green beans 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.950
 to the arms 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:17.399
 an Apple 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.399
 and apple because they have social effects 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.690
 You can also put sheets of 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.520
 lettuce 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.390
 you do 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.390
 let's catch 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.170
 well as in the chips in those 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.710
 salads that you throw for example has 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.710
 so much salt 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.710
 very many 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.570
 so let's take this out of salt 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.920
 have no flavor to anything and blood to 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.039
 milling well well here we have water from 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.039
 bottle 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.410
 now as intermediates 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.410
 but now let's close 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:41.280
 some closed and we will be willing to 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:46.969
 the 20 minutes until then then 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.969
 when we will give you everything 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:58.480
 to go taking it yourself 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.599
 instead of tonight I eat myself 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.549
 a glass of this will satisfy us more and 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.849
 comes to many vitamins and goes to 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:09.700
 detoxify the excesses of these days 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:15.280
 summer 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.280
 in the broth the curative is applied 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.970
 so we have 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.410
 because it's going to be faster 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.110
 or superbly 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.770
 and it was very very refreshing 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:51.280
 if you want you can use only the broth of 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:55.740
 everything but I do it with intention 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.740
 for example the night 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.459
 of a magic our 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.890
 a glass of this then leaves 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:15.260
 it leaves you more whale 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.260
 let's give 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.030
 plus 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.030
 the millions 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.699
 we are going to have vitamins 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.699
 the flag mining 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:37.990
 and also we will be seeing if 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.990
 we put a lot of game 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.330
 good 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.460

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.650
 Now we'll go to 262 and we'll leave them 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.650
 a little bit we will go back 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.289
 but now he has just mounted 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.840

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.270

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:13.180
 refined 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:16.190

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:19.639

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.080

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:23.500
 you can have in life quietly 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.930
 three or four days he's going to count very 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:29.360
