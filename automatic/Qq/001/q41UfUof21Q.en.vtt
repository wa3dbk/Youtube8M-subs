to be 36 inches so I'm gonna mock this

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.740 
to be 36 inches so I'm gonna mock this
post<00:00:10.559> here<00:00:10.800> at<00:00:11.099> 36<00:00:11.820> inches<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.420> want<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.660> be

post here at 36 inches and I want to be

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.320 
post here at 36 inches and I want to be
right<00:00:12.960> in<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.200> center<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.910> over<00:00:14.910> here<00:00:14.940> I'm

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
right in the center of it over here I'm

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.650 
right in the center of it over here I'm
gonna<00:00:15.509> mark<00:00:15.809> 36<00:00:16.680> inches<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.359> be<00:00:18.359> in<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
gonna mark 36 inches and be in the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.550 
gonna mark 36 inches and be in the
center<00:00:19.020> again<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.800> right<00:00:20.670> there<00:00:21.410> okay<00:00:22.410> now

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
center again so right there okay now

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.830 
center again so right there okay now
it's<00:00:22.740> very<00:00:23.010> difficult<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.880> get<00:00:24.029> an<00:00:24.210> inside

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
it's very difficult to get an inside

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.259 
it's very difficult to get an inside
measurement<00:00:25.340> accurately<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.820> if<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.029> hold

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
measurement accurately so if you hold

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.660 
measurement accurately so if you hold
that<00:00:27.449> tape<00:00:27.720> there<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.710> go<00:00:28.890> like<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.400> I

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
that tape there and I go like this and I

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.609 
that tape there and I go like this and I
measure<00:00:29.910> I've<00:00:30.150> got<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.390> bend<00:00:30.660> my<00:00:30.869> tape<00:00:31.260> it's

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
measure I've got to bend my tape it's

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.959 
measure I've got to bend my tape it's
kind<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.949> difficult<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.430> read<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.820> exactly

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
kind of difficult to read it exactly

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.010 
kind of difficult to read it exactly
because<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.750> tape<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.350> curved<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> do

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
because the tape is curved so what I do

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.280 
because the tape is curved so what I do
is<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.440> take<00:00:37.710> two<00:00:38.070> sticks<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:39.239> fit<00:00:39.540> loosely<00:00:39.840> in

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
is I take two sticks that fit loosely in

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.310 
is I take two sticks that fit loosely in
the<00:00:40.410> opening<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.040> cut<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.059> ends<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> bevel

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the opening I cut the ends on a bevel

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.010 
the opening I cut the ends on a bevel
like<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.210> reverse<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.510> stick

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
like that I reverse the stick

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.459 
like that I reverse the stick
so<00:00:46.170> each<00:00:46.410> bevel<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.039> facing<00:00:47.550> out<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:48.140> then<00:00:49.140> take

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
so each bevel is facing out I then take

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.080 
so each bevel is facing out I then take
the<00:00:49.530> stick<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.280> hold<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.820> that

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the stick and I hold it on that

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.810 
the stick and I hold it on that
thirty-six<00:00:51.780> inch<00:00:52.020> mark<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:53.190> bring<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.550> over

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
thirty-six inch mark and I bring it over

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.729 
thirty-six inch mark and I bring it over
here<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.239> hold<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.989> thirty-six

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
here and I hold it on this thirty-six

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.220 
here and I hold it on this thirty-six
inch<00:00:55.980> mark<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.610> push<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.510> sticks<00:00:57.840> apart

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
inch mark I push the sticks apart

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.920 
inch mark I push the sticks apart
tightly<00:00:58.770> put<00:00:59.010> some<00:00:59.160> pressure<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.059> all

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
tightly put some pressure on it and all

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.229 
tightly put some pressure on it and all
I<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.440> put<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> line<00:01:01.949> anywhere<00:01:02.489> with<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> two

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
I do is I put a line anywhere with a two

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.620 
I do is I put a line anywhere with a two
sticks<00:01:03.570> meet<00:01:04.339> now<00:01:05.339> we're<00:01:05.549> ready<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.820> transfer

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.890 
it on the handrail I'm going to mark the
end<00:01:17.030> right<00:01:18.030> there<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.479> center<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
end right there in the center of the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.350 
end right there in the center of the
railing<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:19.979> want<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.549> now<00:01:20.729> slide

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
railing what I want to do is now slide

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.620 
railing what I want to do is now slide
the<00:01:21.810> two<00:01:22.020> sticks<00:01:22.350> until<00:01:23.100> my<00:01:23.430> marks<00:01:23.939> line<00:01:24.390> up

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the two sticks until my marks line up

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.969 
the two sticks until my marks line up
just<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.439> that

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
just like that

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.490 
just like that
make<00:01:26.460> sure<00:01:26.610> I'm<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.970> position<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> center

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
make sure I'm on position of the center

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.350 
make sure I'm on position of the center
of<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> handrail<00:01:29.040> here<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.759> mark<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.180> end

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
of the handrail here and I mark the end

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.899 
of the handrail here and I mark the end
and<00:01:30.659> that's<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.799> length<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.340> our<00:01:32.430> handrail

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
and that's the length of our handrail

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.770 
and that's the length of our handrail
now<00:01:33.630> remember<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.670> handrail<00:01:35.670> cannot<00:01:36.240> be<00:01:36.509> cut

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
now remember a handrail cannot be cut

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.770 
now remember a handrail cannot be cut
square<00:01:37.380> because<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> round<00:01:38.549> column<00:01:39.180> to

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
square because we have a round column to

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.630 
square because we have a round column to
get<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> contour<00:01:40.680> or<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.009> radius<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
get the contour or the radius of the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.859 
get the contour or the radius of the
column<00:01:42.000> I'm<00:01:42.119> actually<00:01:42.270> going<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.570> use<00:01:42.720> this

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
column I'm actually going to use this

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.410 
column I'm actually going to use this
profile<00:01:43.530> jig<00:01:43.829> right<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.340> when<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:44.970> take<00:01:45.270> it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
profile jig right here when I take it

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.480 
profile jig right here when I take it
and<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.600> push<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.960> against<00:01:46.229> something<00:01:46.530> it'll

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
and I push it against something it'll

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.969 
and I push it against something it'll
follow<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.090> contour<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.710> gives

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
follow the contour of it and that gives

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.249 
follow the contour of it and that gives
me<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> radius<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.149> column<00:01:51.600> now<00:01:52.079> I'll

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
me the radius of the column now I'll

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.469 
me the radius of the column now I'll
just<00:01:52.439> transfer<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.340> curve<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> end<00:01:54.360> of

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
just transfer this curve to the end of

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.380 
just transfer this curve to the end of
the<00:01:54.540> handrail<00:01:55.520> now<00:01:56.520> we're<00:01:56.759> ready<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.969> cut<00:01:57.210> it

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.459 
rails
are<00:02:04.229> cut<00:02:05.060> now<00:02:06.060> our<00:02:06.329> balusters<00:02:06.960> are<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.380> to

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
are cut now our balusters are going to

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.800 
are cut now our balusters are going to
attach<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:08.009> railings<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.879> now<00:02:09.750> we

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
attach the railings like this now we

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.510 
attach the railings like this now we
could<00:02:10.080> toenail<00:02:10.649> into<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.069> side<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
could toenail into the side of the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.520 
could toenail into the side of the
balusters<00:02:12.120> but<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.810> would<00:02:12.930> be<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.080> hole<00:02:13.319> that

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
balusters but that would be a hole that

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.850 
balusters but that would be a hole that
you

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.830

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
the fill once you paint it so what I

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.320 
the fill once you paint it so what I
like<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.230> do<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.830> attach<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.610> balises<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.300> a

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
like to do is attach the balises to a

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.990 
like to do is attach the balises to a
thin<00:02:18.690> strip<00:02:18.960> of<00:02:19.110> wood<00:02:19.320> like<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:20.000> screwing

the<00:02:47.460> first<00:02:47.790> thing<00:02:47.970> we<00:02:48.150> need<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.360> know<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.900> that

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
the first thing we need to know is that

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.720 
the first thing we need to know is that
the<00:02:49.200> building<00:02:49.650> code<00:02:49.860> requires<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.460> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
the building code requires that the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.300 
the building code requires that the
space<00:02:51.060> between<00:02:51.090> our<00:02:51.720> balusters<00:02:52.530> cannot

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
space between our balusters cannot

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.970 
space between our balusters cannot
exceed<00:02:53.760> four<00:02:54.180> inches<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:54.780> what<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.440> do<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.890> I
