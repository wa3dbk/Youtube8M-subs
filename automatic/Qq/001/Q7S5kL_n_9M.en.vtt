 The 80s more and more the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.320
 cows through 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.450
 the dressage world cup is the fault of the cows 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.070

 difficult lessons in poets 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.210
 order dominate for nectar 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.850
 home game 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.709
 and again and again one of the 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.080
 classic training maxime is 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.390
 straightens a horse straight and righteous 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.550
 moving forward on the daily training 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.280
 green waldhof is good to watch 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.569
 Just so Karin Rehbein says keep the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.569
 horses have fun at work 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.099
 and you have a motivated horse 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:32.239
 real partner can shine 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.239
 she discovered 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.330
 who many good horses from the equestrian 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.980

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.690
 just the look for the potential 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.540
 of a future dressage horse 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.450
 How should the ideal 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.370

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:24.940
 how should the ideal horse procure 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:27.560
 its a little bit apart 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.569
 move step trot gallop should 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.980
 to wear everything so much 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.090
 you can teach a bit 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.780
 galloping should be good and 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.780
