obviously<00:01:05.800> and<00:01:06.070> since<00:01:06.640> it's<00:01:06.850> probably<00:01:07.360> next

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
obviously and since it's probably next

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.719 
obviously and since it's probably next
to<00:01:07.810> impossible<00:01:08.110> to<00:01:08.560> find<00:01:08.800> a<00:01:09.040> rock<00:01:09.310> that's

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729

perfectly<00:01:10.600> spherical<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:13.080> looked<00:01:14.080> online<00:01:14.260> that

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
perfectly spherical I looked online that

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.890 
perfectly spherical I looked online that
if<00:01:15.430> they're<00:01:15.610> kind<00:01:15.820> of<00:01:15.880> pricey<00:01:15.940> online<00:01:16.750> these

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
if they're kind of pricey online these

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.810 
if they're kind of pricey online these

saved it but it came in handy i was able

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.410 
saved it but it came in handy i was able
to<00:01:57.690> make<00:01:58.690> myself<00:01:58.990> a<00:01:59.580> monkey's<00:02:00.580> fist<00:02:00.850> out<00:02:01.120> of<00:02:01.270> it

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
to make myself a monkey's fist out of it

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.930 
to make myself a monkey's fist out of it
and<00:02:02.370> um<00:02:03.370> I<00:02:05.040> didn't<00:02:06.040> know<00:02:06.160> I<00:02:06.190> wasn't<00:02:06.610> sure

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
and um I didn't know I wasn't sure

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.419 
and um I didn't know I wasn't sure
because<00:02:07.150> I<00:02:07.330> measured<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.990> whole<00:02:08.590> ball<00:02:08.950> itself

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
because I measured the whole ball itself

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.149 
because I measured the whole ball itself
and<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:09.879> was<00:02:10.060> about<00:02:11.129> seven<00:02:12.129> a<00:02:12.220> spinach<00:02:12.849> and

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
and it was about seven a spinach and

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.619 
and it was about seven a spinach and
most<00:02:15.159> of<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:16.150> balls<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.349> people<00:02:18.190> are<00:02:18.280> using

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
most of the balls that people are using

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.330 
most of the balls that people are using
for<00:02:19.629> around<00:02:20.019> this<00:02:20.200> size<00:02:20.470> is<00:02:20.740> like<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:20.950> three

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
for around this size is like a three

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.300 
for around this size is like a three
quarter<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:22.230> think<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.350> next<00:02:23.650> one<00:02:23.830> up<00:02:24.069> is

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
quarter I think the next one up is

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.870 
quarter I think the next one up is
actually

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
actually

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.090 
actually
inch<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.570> I<00:02:25.600> wasn't<00:02:26.200> sure<00:02:26.500> which<00:02:27.160> how<00:02:27.910> many

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
inch so I wasn't sure which how many

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.980 
inch so I wasn't sure which how many
wraps<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.520> do<00:02:31.710> so<00:02:32.710> I<00:02:33.060> since<00:02:34.060> it's<00:02:34.270> coated<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.900> a

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
wraps to do so I since it's coated in a

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.990 
wraps to do so I since it's coated in a
rubber<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.590> ball<00:02:35.830> on<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.430> bottom<00:02:36.760> of<00:02:36.910> the

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
rubber the ball on the bottom of the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.550 
rubber the ball on the bottom of the
mouth<00:02:37.180> if<00:02:37.450> you<00:02:37.480> twist<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.020> thing<00:02:38.260> when<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
mouth if you twist the thing when the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.410 
mouth if you twist the thing when the
ball<00:02:38.740> falls<00:02:38.980> out<00:02:39.990> its<00:02:40.990> rubber<00:02:41.350> coated<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:43.390> I

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
ball falls out its rubber coated so I

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.750 
ball falls out its rubber coated so I
took<00:02:43.810> this<00:02:44.320> and<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:45.820> poked<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:47.560> wherever<00:02:48.460> it

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
took this and I poked it and wherever it

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.330 
took this and I poked it and wherever it
stopped<00:02:49.240> I<00:02:49.480> just<00:02:49.720> put<00:02:49.900> my<00:02:50.080> thumb<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.680> then<00:02:51.250> I

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
stopped I just put my thumb and then I

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.070 
stopped I just put my thumb and then I
measured<00:02:51.730> how<00:02:51.910> much<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.540> was<00:02:52.630> about<00:02:52.750> an

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
measured how much and it was about an

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.350 
measured how much and it was about an
eighth<00:02:53.290> inch<00:02:54.960> on<00:02:55.960> either<00:02:56.140> side<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:57.580> i<00:02:58.030> was<00:02:58.180> able

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
eighth inch on either side so i was able

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.220 
eighth inch on either side so i was able
to<00:02:58.540> just<00:02:58.660> do<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.970> three<00:03:01.240> quarter<00:03:03.450> from<00:03:04.450> anyway

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
to just do the three quarter from anyway

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.410 
to just do the three quarter from anyway
worked<00:03:05.740> out<00:03:05.980> well<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.220> just<00:03:06.610> did<00:03:06.820> it<00:03:06.850> I<00:03:07.120> did<00:03:07.150> it

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
worked out well I just did it I did it

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.570 
worked out well I just did it I did it
the<00:03:07.720> way<00:03:07.900> some<00:03:08.710> people<00:03:09.010> do<00:03:09.160> where<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.400> only

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
the way some people do where you only

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.540 
the way some people do where you only
have<00:03:09.850> one<00:03:10.240> strand<00:03:10.930> coming<00:03:11.320> out<00:03:11.470> I<00:03:11.710> think<00:03:12.430> I

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
have one strand coming out I think I

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.970 
have one strand coming out I think I
might<00:03:12.760> switch<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:13.540> up<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:13.930> do<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.530> in<00:03:14.800> the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
might switch it up and do it in the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.260 
might switch it up and do it in the
center<00:03:15.400> of<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.790> line<00:03:16.000> so<00:03:16.540> that<00:03:16.570> I<00:03:16.720> have<00:03:17.070> to

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
center of the line so that I have to

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.570 
center of the line so that I have to
working<00:03:19.270> ends<00:03:19.600> that<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.810> could<00:03:20.050> use<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:20.680> unless

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
working ends that I could use and unless

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.870 
working ends that I could use and unless
sure<00:03:21.790> I'm<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:23.080> can<00:03:23.230> redo<00:03:23.590> them<00:03:23.880> but

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
sure I'm that you can redo them but

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.380 
sure I'm that you can redo them but
anyway<00:03:25.180> that's<00:03:25.630> that<00:03:26.070> so<00:03:27.070> yeah<00:03:27.280> we<00:03:27.670> can<00:03:27.850> use<00:03:27.880> a

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
anyway that's that so yeah we can use a

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.440 
anyway that's that so yeah we can use a
ball<00:03:28.990> from<00:03:29.320> an<00:03:29.470> old<00:03:29.620> mouth<00:03:29.850> most<00:03:30.850> people<00:03:31.330> have

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
ball from an old mouth most people have

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.960 
ball from an old mouth most people have
one<00:03:31.720> lying<00:03:31.960> around<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:33.100> won't<00:03:33.340> break<00:03:33.910> the

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
one lying around and it won't break the

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.660 
one lying around and it won't break the
mouse<00:03:34.420> either<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.080> just<00:03:35.110> won't<00:03:35.680> have<00:03:35.920> a<00:03:35.950> it

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
mouse either it just won't have a it

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.910 
mouse either it just won't have a it
won't<00:03:36.910> work<00:03:37.120> you<00:03:37.990> can<00:03:38.230> always<00:03:38.320> take<00:03:38.710> it<00:03:38.770> back

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
won't work you can always take it back

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.380 
won't work you can always take it back
out<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:39.370> put<00:03:39.520> it<00:03:39.610> back<00:03:39.700> in<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:39.940> mouth<00:03:40.120> but
