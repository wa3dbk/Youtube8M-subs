00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.420
 now you will learn to elaborate the nigiri the 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.969
 rice ball with the fish of 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.140
 over to elaborate the nigiri we are going to 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.139
 need a bowl with a 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:20.369
 some water 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.250
 and a squirt of vinegar to work the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.949
 rice that does not stick our hands and does not 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.329
 remove the concentration of vinegar 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.669
 we are going to need the illicit 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.430
 fish those that we have cut the 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.350
 processes for this purpose and a little bit of 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.540
 Wasabi we're not going to put it on 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.430
 with a rosette on the cutting board 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.990
 once the ingredients are reviewed 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.760
 to start by choosing the steak 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.610
 fish that we want to use let's 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.070
 catch the salmon filet and we're going to 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.450
 hold by clamping between the finger 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.050
 index the heart of our hand 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.970
 left 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.250
 if we are right-handed and the steak that 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.260
 rest in the palm of our hand 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.210
 let's take the finger to paint what are we going 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.309
 to wet, let's take a little bit of 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.230
 wasabi and we will fix the steak and 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.150
 this form will help us later if it were 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.490
 a kind of cement glue to which 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.140
 look at the fish ball with the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.630
 free hand we moisten again 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.270
 slightly the hand we are going to take a 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.490
 rice ball of the size of our 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.950
 mouth that does not from our hand and we're going to 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.270
 tighten by turning and tightening and turning 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.509
 press and turn and we're going to get 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.360
 have a croquette or pellet 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.340
 consistent now we fix the fillet of 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.740
 fish we help each other with our hands and a 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.700
 Once it is fixed we put it on the 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.289
 plate 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.570
 let's repeat again from the 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.850
 principle let's catch now tuna 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.549
 we take a fish fillet 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.640
 the finger to paint we went through the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.250
 wasabi and the mode of this element is not 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.869
 moisten moss lightly hand 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.229
 let's grab another little ball remember 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.480
 size of our mouth not of our 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.970
 hand 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.560
 rotate tighten rotate tighten up 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.410
 get the croquette when the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.420
 we have set the filet and we help each other 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.690
 of the fingers and place it on the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.690
 plate 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.790
 we usually soy dipping the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.200
 go and follow is a dish that is 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.860
 specifically to eat almost for the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.930
 street is a mouthful snack of that yes 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.700
 we wet it in soy so we should not 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.230
 Do not wet it on the part of the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.300
 rice this to the Japanese makes them 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.130
 very funny because of wetting something 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.739
 we would leave the fish we would have to 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.739
 spin it soaked soybeans and eat it 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.880
 they are curiosities and with this we have already 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.380
 learned to make them nigiris in the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.940
 next chapter what are we going to 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.330
 to learn is to make the rich tartar of 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.330
 tuna and salmon
