 I would like to comment on what I think would be a supplement to the knowledge of those people . 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:38.379
 In the first place , it is a story that what to eat is 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:43.970
 If it says plainly, there is no drawing yes 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:48.350
 Honestly no more than I think, for example I think not personally

 Referred to as the android in you'll ne Well it There are two types to say that the smartphone That's also the 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.320

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.940

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.930
 As long as it is too long to explain from os itself 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.570
 There will be wishes best regards 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.409
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:12.610
 There are two android smartphone and iphone but 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.410
 The thing that proved this individually is the android tablet ipad 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.740
 Is it 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:22.150
 I think there are a lot of people who know ipad 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.560
 Well, I thing that ipad trade name of the tablet apple company has issued a 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.920
 Occasionally a generic term for tablets is ipad 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:32.000
 I Neiru grandma somehow to how to use the door like a sound 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.320
 As it is naan ipad is a brand name to the last, so there is no feeling there 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.250
 Please 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:42.020
 That's kind of like a kiss in a so-called stapler 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:46.759
 Is the general name of the servlet that android is mounted because labor On the other hand and are wear and 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.909
 I &amp; there but though there Well a lot to say and tablet mounted 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.890
 For example, Google 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:56.729
 nexus 7 and then atto taboo issued by docomo 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.840
 The other arrows tab also Well kindle something also Well 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.140
 Besides the amazon, the Chinese tab which has become very popular recently 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.900
 Although there are targets made in China, etc. 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.940
 Long story short tablet part other than the ipad was all &amp; lead 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.860
 It is fine even if you think 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.850
 It is called a palette pc if there another kind also just say tablet 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.310
 It is a thing 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:26.920
 This is a pc shaped like eating it looks like other &amp; tablets 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:29.600
 However, the contents are personal computers, but there are various types in a strict sense but 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.070
 It is live to such an extent 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:39.140
 So what is the difference between the tablet terminal and tablet pc other than os 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:43.230
 But this is totally different depending on who you use 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:47.640
 It is not possible to use different mos, so the error is different. 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.210
 Honest difference if it is the form of Matara video's cowardly Toka web browsing but not 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.040
 I can not help 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:59.290
 Next, I would like to explain what tablets can do 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:02.950
 However, it is not a tablet pc but only those who eat and terminal that we will open this time 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:08.200
 A little thank you so as not to be misunderstood because 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:12.550
 Though it's a thing that can tablet This would be split and can not be anything truly 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:18.370
 There are few things that can be done compared with the personal computer, but still the end user 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:19.480
 If you want to do something you can do most things, so let's say something like 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.940
 It is 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:27.770
 Well, for example, cherry blossoms are less to the station or something like that 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.600
 I'm not really good at it, but once in a while tablet makes videos or songs, or by force 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:34.190
 There is also an app, but 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.030
 Thus the question is when to is not good not good functionality but still also compared to the PC 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.920
 By saying 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:42.930
 So the things to do in the tablet and Ata Toka is the assertion of web browsing and video 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.840
 Turtle it from and by the e-book Innovation game 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.360
 It will be nice 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.740
 goo 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:55.170
 Then I think that it is such a good thing as knowledge so very close ratio is 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:59.880
 Tablet is oriented Well to such a person when purchased in the latter part lasts only sequel 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:05.350
 Or maybe it's a knack for how to choose a tablet 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:10.090
 I think I Well comment two when there is a matter that we would like to and consultation that you want to ask other 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:16.530
 As you write a gmail address to those who do or who explain the video 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.530
 Thank you please So your watch by shaking the mail from there
