 [Music] 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.980
 good evening and welcome to this course 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.900
 legendary solo road that made us 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.610
 dreaming for hours in front of 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.220
 players have faced our program according to 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.960
 embossing brief all those pieces that we 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.550
 have made us want to play and who are we 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.560
 still makes you want to grab our 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.210
 guitar day after day that's what I 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.730
 offers to study in my current 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.470
 on wii music what are you already a 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.120
 old hard offers with envy 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.970
 to learn new techniques or 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.710
 a very small beginner aspiring the 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.930
 legend of rock'n roll I propose you 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.840
 a great journey through the history of 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.730
 rock from the 50s to today johnny 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.170
 cash at the queens of the stone age in 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.300
 obviously passing through the 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.990
 essential pink floyd guns'n'roses 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.950
 and ac dc 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.950
 [Music] 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.950
 and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.660
 the rescue objectives are 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.350
 relatively simple to start with 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.060
 to please 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.340
 the basic idea is that from 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.350
 ultra known pieces they are basically 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.850
 the pieces that everyone wants 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.960
 to play we will study very many 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.759
 different techniques 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.830
 many gaming approaches 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.430
 different each of his pieces and 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.830
 fully husked so normally 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.830
 if you follow the steps and 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.830
 do not go too fast 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:36.750
 should progress fairly quickly very 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.300
 important for someone who wants to play 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.970
 of rock is to know how to listen to 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.460
 other musicians and stall themselves on for that 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.009
 I prepared you five years the bins 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.560
 two goals for the playbacks of a 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.479
 well had to stall with the battery and 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.150
 so snacks the battery know 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.210
 place in front of the battery 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.310
 the battery on the battery brief do not 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.290
 speed up when a sick and hovasse 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.590
 lose in relation to time and so 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.290
 after 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.970
 and then on the other hand well listened to the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.550
 technical guitar or bass and 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.640
 analyze how 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.270
 their complete line of yours even 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.249
 additional harmonic information 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.249
 [Music] 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.670
 I also wanted to allow you to create 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.080
 your own songs 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.020
 the ideal is still that you 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.310
 even manage to write a page 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.970
 extra in the big story 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.280
 rock 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.760
 So from these pieces see what 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.180
 who walks to see which angle arad are 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.460
 used and why and how in 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.160
 your game it can be recovered and 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.580
 integrated transform and customized 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.709
 know that you can at any time 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.000
 send me videos of you a 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.360
 preferably between 1 degree of the guitar 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.230
 and audio recordings of wolves 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.300
 the same via the interface of the site 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.910
 and then my mailbox stays at your 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.610
 provision for questions of 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.040
 anxiety and then since help and 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.080
 your course for suggestions of 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.150
 pieces you would like to see appear 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.980
 among the next meeting town 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.300
 here I think everything is said he stays 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.430
 more than to take in hand and to 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.300
 start playing again 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.740
 that's how it happens and 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:34.699
 encourages to bet Libyan 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:34.699
