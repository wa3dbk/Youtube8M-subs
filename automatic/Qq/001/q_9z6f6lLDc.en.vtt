00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 My love, how are you? I'm here today. 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.240
 give a hint super fast even the tip is 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.190
 for who in shoes and what hurts there 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.130
 back sabino no heel 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.690
 so I have this problem on my foot 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.289
 But this problem of my shoes I 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.660
 tale 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.789
 but I know it 's time you try 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.039
 they are great wonderful, just there I 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.140
 I will walk with them and I feel that he 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.529
 is catching there is in the back of the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.330
 shoe then I stay in that kind thing 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.510
 I can not not want to throw a shoe 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.710
 out knowing why I bought it is because 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.020
 I do not like it 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.149
 so I 'm not going, I 'm not going to help out. 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.010
 I 'll want to use it and if you suffer 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.239
 this problem is just to continue 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.239
 watching the video that goes a tip 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.070
 super cool in me, it's good to be here 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.620
 You will need a piece of pvc that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.030
 You can buy it at stationery in 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.910
 any double-sided tape stationery 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.980
 scissors a shoe that's hurting you 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.359
 and in my case I took a template 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.949
 Also, I'll explain to you. 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.380
 girls here I got a little piece of 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.260
 pvc well a rectangle that I had me 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.110
 and I had this mold that in the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.210
 It's true, I bought pay type in the twenty 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.720
 on it and the first time I used the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.119
 shoe he took off and the pair is here 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.640
 he fell on the street and got lost forever 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.890
 but how I stayed with this one I go 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.570
 use it as god but you do not need 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.759
 if you can simply agree to the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.780
 rectangle zinho fulfilled more or less 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.579
 here are some 57 centimeters 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.790
 here I did a mold I just passed one 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.680
 pencil and I'll do the other one here for you 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.119
 see how easy it is and do not need strength 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.119
 Let's do it. 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.210
 and ready template ready you can 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.700
 simply pick up a piece of 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:11.039
 cardboard room need not be anything 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:13.799
 pretty straight forward ready but here I did I 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.870
 cut both with the mold was so 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.519
 You not have to be anything pretty straight forward such 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.560
 that no one will even see 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.690
 shoe and this one I cut 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.870
 rectangles with two 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.750
 fingers as you look at him cutting then 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.410
 Now to glue on the shoe, you go. 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.480
 take the double-sided tape and I'll do the 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.000
 next you will guide me that the size 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.099
 if possible do not lean too much on the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:46.310
 What are you doing, and you 're going? 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:46.310
 simply mig here a piece 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:03:00.520
 a little lower than that achieved by the 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:13.690
 people cut and ready and now you go 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:18.640
 do this for everyone and now the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:21.870
 most difficult of all is to get the 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.870
 behind 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:32.010
 now let's go back with the scissors and take 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.930
 the tip that you and what you are taking 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.460
 the back plastic 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.370
 Now you'll get the fact that you 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.110
 hurting and going by this color I came here 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.570
 down if you made the mold if you 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.130
 did so do not forget to fold and the 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.380
 tail ok 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.230
 and in that case the same thing you will 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.910
 bend a little and you can not stay 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.080
 taking and putting because that glue 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.970
 super sensitive 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.800
 so you have to see more or less 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.800
 here you will put and paste in the 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.660
 first try 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.940
 if you do the area does not have both 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.140
 problem if you mess up there will be a 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.510
 little more complicated because you go 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.590
 have to remove the ribbon again and do 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.650
 all over again and paste and pick up another 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.930
 piece of tape and peg and it's 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.600
 very complicated to do this and this one 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.270
 It's the first one stayed the way it's legal is that 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.590
 when you put it on and you can not see 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:31.080
 after placing this one of a 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:33.270
 good tight and both sneakers 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.220
 and I promise I will not 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.770
 hurt another event doing just that 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.080
 without the double sided glue and gave nothing 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.970
 Right because I put here and then I 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.060
 I looked down and it was 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.710
 up then without the double-sided tape help 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.870
 also 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.670
 but it is 100% sure that it will be 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.160
 the opponent and it will not do anything 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.090
 so that's right I hope you 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.290
 have enjoyed 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.780
 a tip super fast, then this is it 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.970
 was with the super easy and beyond everything 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.340
 they first had as I told 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.150
 I have you covered and silicone in the store 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.070
 same type of mara in there and me 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.130
 I guess I think in a real 20 type in 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.280
 Father, people are not worth it because he 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:20.850
 loses glue and never saw him again 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.040
 I've never seen anything like this in my life so this 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.140
 The tip that it comes up has the 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.310
 The face you're going to buy is tape. 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.840
 double side 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.630
 Just the following you are going to spend 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.630
 five rirs there $ 10 I do not know how much I'm going 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.940
 spend 10 reais and you will have 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:38.470
 I was going to make a living for them without them. 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.210
 they will power do everything shoes 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.580
 buy in your life for sure you will 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.350
 to be able to wear a hat, then go 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.720
 overcome the penalty then ends up getting super 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.940
 cheap I think its use that is one of the 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.420
 ten cents of ribbon to make a 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.860
 shoe with less until not made then 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.830
 is super viable for any type of 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.530
 pocket for anyone for any 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.660
 Well, then I hope you have 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.280
 liked my loves and symbols liked 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.410
 Do not forget to stay here at 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.590
 Down to me, you're not registered. 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:11.370
 on the channel a super kiss and 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.370
 until the next video
