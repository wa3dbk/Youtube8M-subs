monkeys that come out that steal your
perks<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.359> basically<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.930> got<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.140> master<00:00:25.560> now

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
perks so basically I got this master now

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.650 
perks so basically I got this master now
like<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.039> monkeys<00:00:26.340> will<00:00:26.490> never<00:00:27.390> take<00:00:27.630> my

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
like the monkeys will never take my

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.570 
like the monkeys will never take my
perks<00:00:27.990> again<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.439> think<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.160> here<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
perks again I think this here is the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.479 
perks again I think this here is the
first<00:00:29.939> time<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.980> second<00:00:32.340> time

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
first time that the is the second time

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.520 
first time that the is the second time
that<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.930> monkeys<00:00:33.930> came<00:00:34.079> maybe<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
that the monkeys came maybe it's the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.190 
that the monkeys came maybe it's the
first<00:00:34.739> time<00:00:34.890> not<00:00:35.160> sure

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
first time not sure

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.889 
first time not sure
but<00:00:37.200> uh<00:00:37.550> pretty<00:00:38.550> much<00:00:38.670> now<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.600> just<00:00:39.750> go<00:00:39.840> to

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
but uh pretty much now is you just go to

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.750 
but uh pretty much now is you just go to
the<00:00:40.110> machines<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.649> want<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.890> protect<00:00:41.219> so

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the machines that you want to protect so

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.850 
the machines that you want to protect so
if<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.879> got<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.149> four<00:00:42.390> people<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.960> probably

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
if you got like four people you probably

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.500 
if you got like four people you probably
swear<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> go<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> Juggernog<00:00:45.120> sleight<00:00:45.480> of

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
swear to go to the Juggernog sleight of

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.619 
swear to go to the Juggernog sleight of
hand<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.020> quick<00:00:46.350> revive<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.390> you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.539> only

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
hand and quick revive and you can only

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.020 
hand and quick revive and you can only
you<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:49.590> use<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> one<00:00:50.460> person<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.879> cover

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
you can just use a one person to cover

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.160 
you can just use a one person to cover
each<00:00:51.120> machine<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.510> mean<00:00:51.719> they're<00:00:51.840> pretty<00:00:52.020> easy

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
each machine I mean they're pretty easy

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.170 
each machine I mean they're pretty easy
to<00:00:52.320> take<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.149> they're<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> total

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
to take and they're like a total

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.970 
to take and they're like a total
misconception<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.899> trailer<00:00:58.320> showed

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
misconception like the trailer showed

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.069 
misconception like the trailer showed
for<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.789> map<00:01:00.000> pack<00:01:00.210> release<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.780> look<00:01:00.930> like<00:01:01.050> a

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
for the map pack release it look like a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.319 
for the map pack release it look like a
lot<00:01:01.320> bigger<00:01:01.530> these<00:01:02.129> are<00:01:02.250> just<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.550> freaking

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
lot bigger these are just like freaking

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.820 
lot bigger these are just like freaking
the<00:01:03.420> littlest<00:01:03.780> tiniest<00:01:03.840> monkeys<00:01:04.500> are<00:01:04.619> seen

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the littlest tiniest monkeys are seen

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.899 
the littlest tiniest monkeys are seen
but<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.070> can<00:01:05.189> see<00:01:05.280> they're<00:01:05.460> already<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
but you can see they're already on the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.969 
but you can see they're already on the
machine<00:01:06.180> they're<00:01:06.420> taking<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.470> perks<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
machine they're taking the perks and the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.670 
machine they're taking the perks and the
machines<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.700> only<00:01:08.820> take<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.030> much<00:01:09.240> damage

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
machines can only take so much damage

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.140 
machines can only take so much damage
but<00:01:10.680> uh<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.340> my<00:01:11.430> first<00:01:11.640> time<00:01:11.760> playing<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
but uh this is my first time playing the

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.410 
but uh this is my first time playing the
game<00:01:12.180> really<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.619> don't<00:01:13.920> know<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.240> maps<00:01:15.240> all

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
game really so I don't know the maps all

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.820 
game really so I don't know the maps all
that<00:01:15.540> well<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.840> played<00:01:16.110> at<00:01:16.229> one<00:01:16.350> time<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.590> own

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that well I played at one time I own

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.679 
that well I played at one time I own
just<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.220> shade<00:01:17.970> with<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.119> early<00:01:18.390> boards

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
just the shade with the early boards

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.539 
just the shade with the early boards
look<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.259> I'll<00:01:19.409> probably<00:01:19.470> post<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.979> video<00:01:20.340> up

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
look like I'll probably post a video up

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.260 
look like I'll probably post a video up
on<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:22.220> but<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> had<00:01:23.430> never<00:01:23.580> no<00:01:24.000> idea

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
on there that but I had never no idea

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.730 
on there that but I had never no idea
waiter<00:01:24.479> maps<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.990> now<00:01:25.049> my<00:01:25.200> map<00:01:25.350> knowledge<00:01:25.530> is

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
waiter maps and now my map knowledge is

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.020 
waiter maps and now my map knowledge is
pretty<00:01:25.950> much<00:01:26.130> better<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.700> know<00:01:26.759> how<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> get

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
pretty much better and I know how to get

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.819 
pretty much better and I know how to get
to<00:01:27.090> these<00:01:27.240> machines<00:01:27.420> real<00:01:27.750> fast<00:01:27.990> they<00:01:28.680> should

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
to these machines real fast they should

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.469 
to these machines real fast they should
probably<00:01:29.009> never<00:01:29.220> steal<00:01:29.670> my<00:01:29.790> perks<00:01:30.000> again<00:01:30.270> if<00:01:30.390> I

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
probably never steal my perks again if I

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.539 
probably never steal my perks again if I
have<00:01:30.630> decent<00:01:31.079> weapons<00:01:31.350> they're<00:01:32.070> small<00:01:32.310> still

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
have decent weapons they're small still

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.310 
have decent weapons they're small still
hard<00:01:32.850> hit<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.240> other<00:01:33.570> not<00:01:33.750> they're<00:01:33.900> easy<00:01:34.020> kill

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
hard hit but other not they're easy kill

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.780 
hard hit but other not they're easy kill
and<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.860> thought<00:01:34.979> he<00:01:35.130> was<00:01:35.250> dead<00:01:35.460> right<00:01:35.670> there

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
and I thought he was dead right there

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.310 
and I thought he was dead right there
but<00:01:36.000> they<00:01:36.090> got<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.360> two<00:01:36.570> hits<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.930> him<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.200> he

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
but they got like two hits in him so he

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.359 
but they got like two hits in him so he

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
all it takes to protect them a lot of

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.170 
all it takes to protect them a lot of
time<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.469> know<00:02:01.619> but<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> pretty<00:02:02.640> easy<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.000> kill

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
time you know but a pretty easy to kill

and you shouldn't lose your perks but uh
there's<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.180> mistake<00:02:06.990> by<00:02:07.140> me<00:02:07.290> not

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
there's just the mistake by me not

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.020 
there's just the mistake by me not
having<00:02:07.829> map<00:02:08.069> knowledge<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.610> getting<00:02:08.910> there

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
having map knowledge and getting there

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.149 
having map knowledge and getting there
in<00:02:09.149> time<00:02:09.330> and

in time and

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.690 
in time and
I<00:02:10.189> think<00:02:10.909> that<00:02:11.030> last<00:02:11.180> monkey<00:02:11.569> was<00:02:11.720> dead<00:02:11.930> but<00:02:12.439> uh

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
I think that last monkey was dead but uh

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.429 
I think that last monkey was dead but uh

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
and real easy to handle not much to it

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.089 
and real easy to handle not much to it
