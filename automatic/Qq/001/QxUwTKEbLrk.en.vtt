00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.670
 A beautiful good day and that 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.250
 Today I want my little report 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.830
 about the busecker times and that is what I have 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:20.400
 Here my old and my new one 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.699
 car the new commissioner why me 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:28.470
 bought new and the old 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.390
 liposchek the cuban sorry the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.470
 is just too late for me 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.440
 jump 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.010
 with the acoustic signals to 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.199
 example i have a quadcopter and 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.019
 when the battery was almost empty has the 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.769
 Under control of the regulator and he started 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.409
 to land 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.809
 and he always just showed it out 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:51.150
 everything ok no problem 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:56.070
 So I just have some new ones 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:01:01.080
 bought so coming off now the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.900
 this is already here with is with 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.479
 Display was the complete high number 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.570
 indicating from the battery and each one 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.640
 single cell and jesus a little 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.090
 blitzer in it but if the victory 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.850
 well believe less and the advantage 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.080
 the lover is driving a taste here 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.360
 but I'll show you that at the time 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.360
 finally now with 1 4 it 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.750
 look like that 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:42.170
 a bit dense far jump though 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:50.780
 see the voltage completely 16 14 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:52.690
 tele2 z3 z4 is like a present 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.070
 that's why I promised pretty much 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.759
 and then you can do that up here at the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:19.340
 button set and that the voltage 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:21.200
 moore gibson is supposed to model three out of 27 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.480
 Seems different from or 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.440
 regulates differently then you can 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.930
 adjust the beautiful fit or hope 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.650
 The brecht was happy with everything 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.650
 clearly
