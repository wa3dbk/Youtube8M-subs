forward<00:00:49.260> within<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.620> tunnel<00:00:50.030> then<00:00:51.030> one<00:00:51.149> of

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
forward within the tunnel then one of

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.180 
forward within the tunnel then one of
the<00:00:51.300> home<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.510> also<00:00:52.079> had<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> little<00:00:52.559> lower<00:00:52.829> jaw

being two mil polycarbonate makes it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.589 
being two mil polycarbonate makes it
really<00:01:40.410> strong<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:42.060> other<00:01:42.209> good<00:01:42.330> thing<00:01:42.390> is

00:01:42.589 --> 00:01:42.599 
really strong the other good thing is

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:44.870 
really strong the other good thing is
you<00:01:43.200> get<00:01:43.349> exceptional<00:01:43.800> peripheral<00:01:44.550> vision

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
you get exceptional peripheral vision

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.580 
you get exceptional peripheral vision
with<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.149> style<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.509> Iser<00:01:45.720> there's<00:01:46.410> no

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
with this style of Iser there's no

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.949 
with this style of Iser there's no
frames<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.399> block<00:01:47.880> out<00:01:48.090> any<00:01:48.330> of<00:01:48.450> your<00:01:48.660> vision

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
frames to block out any of your vision

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:52.010 
frames to block out any of your vision
it's<00:01:49.470> very<00:01:49.709> easy<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.250> handles<00:01:51.020> you

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
it's very easy to see handles you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.960 
it's very easy to see handles you
reserve<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.069> route<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.429> cutaway<00:01:54.239> handle<00:01:54.330> and

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
reserve in route and cutaway handle and

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.130 
reserve in route and cutaway handle and
so<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.090> other<00:01:57.209> thing<00:01:57.239> about<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.750> helmet

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
so the other thing about this helmet

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.260 
so the other thing about this helmet
been<00:01:58.860> carbon<00:01:59.280> fiber<00:01:59.489> and<00:01:59.729> only<00:01:59.880> weighing<00:02:00.090> a

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
been carbon fiber and only weighing a

during freefall or in the wind tunnel

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.750 
during freefall or in the wind tunnel
we've<00:02:13.500> even<00:02:13.650> put<00:02:13.770> some<00:02:14.070> small<00:02:14.340> vents<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
we've even put some small vents in the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.680 
we've even put some small vents in the
back<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.270> helmet

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
back of the helmet

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.200 
back of the helmet
it<00:02:16.050> allows<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.680> little<00:02:17.220> bit<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.430> ventilation<00:02:17.910> to

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
it allows a little bit of ventilation to

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.050 
it allows a little bit of ventilation to
occur<00:02:18.510> when<00:02:19.050> in<00:02:19.170> use<00:02:19.440> which<00:02:20.160> basically<00:02:20.400> you

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
occur when in use which basically you

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.910 
occur when in use which basically you
know<00:02:21.210> wintertime<00:02:21.750> summertime<00:02:22.080> you're

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
know wintertime summertime you're

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.230 
know wintertime summertime you're
spending<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.310> lot<00:02:23.460> of<00:02:23.490> time<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.970> wind<00:02:24.180> tunnel

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
spending a lot of time in a wind tunnel

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.360 
spending a lot of time in a wind tunnel
and<00:02:24.630> they<00:02:25.200> could<00:02:25.410> be<00:02:25.530> in<00:02:25.620> there<00:02:25.770> for<00:02:25.920> up<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.220> an

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
and they could be in there for up to an

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.300 
and they could be in there for up to an
hour<00:02:26.520> or<00:02:26.820> two<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.330> though<00:02:27.960> it's<00:02:28.140> nice<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.650> have

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
hour or two and though it's nice to have

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.740 
hour or two and though it's nice to have
a<00:02:29.370> little<00:02:29.430> bit<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.760> ventilation<00:02:30.270> so<00:02:30.600> you're

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
a little bit of ventilation so you're

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.710 
a little bit of ventilation so you're
not<00:02:30.810> sweating<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:31.380> much<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:32.100> your<00:02:32.250> helmet<00:02:32.720> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
not sweating so much in your helmet the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.630 
not sweating so much in your helmet the
other<00:02:33.870> cool<00:02:34.020> thing<00:02:34.080> about<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.590> design<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
other cool thing about the design is the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.300 
other cool thing about the design is the
visor<00:02:35.880> mechanism<00:02:36.510> put<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.470> lot<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.650> research

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
visor mechanism put a lot of research

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.890 
visor mechanism put a lot of research
your<00:02:38.580> energy<00:02:38.970> into<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.330> design<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.660> this

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
your energy into the design of this

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.600 
your energy into the design of this
