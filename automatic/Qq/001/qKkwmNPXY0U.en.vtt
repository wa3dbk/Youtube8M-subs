going to give you guys my final thoughts
on<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.270> hyperduck<00:01:46.840> 2013

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
on the hyperduck 2013

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.080 
on the hyperduck 2013
firstly<00:01:48.190> let's<00:01:48.460> start<00:01:48.700> off<00:01:48.790> with<00:01:48.940> the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
firstly let's start off with the

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.120 
firstly let's start off with the
traction<00:01:49.390> as<00:01:49.780> you<00:01:50.200> can<00:01:50.380> see<00:01:50.530> here<00:01:50.770> we<00:01:50.979> have

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
traction as you can see here we have

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.880 
traction as you can see here we have
lateral<00:01:51.850> traction<00:01:52.540> of<00:01:52.750> pattern<00:01:53.170> which<00:01:53.740> is

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
lateral traction of pattern which is

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.310 
lateral traction of pattern which is
good<00:01:54.130> on<00:01:54.670> lateral<00:01:55.240> movements<00:01:55.690> you<00:01:55.990> know<00:01:56.140> it's

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
good on lateral movements you know it's

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.870 
good on lateral movements you know it's
stuck<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.680> the<00:01:56.770> floor<00:01:56.950> great

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
stuck to the floor great

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.370 
stuck to the floor great
herringbone<00:01:58.270> has<00:01:58.690> always<00:01:58.930> been<00:01:59.200> my<00:01:59.350> favorite

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
herringbone has always been my favorite

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.070 
herringbone has always been my favorite
I'm<00:01:59.860> going<00:02:00.040> to<00:02:00.130> say<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.850> traction<00:02:01.420> is<00:02:01.600> good

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
I'm going to say the traction is good

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.400 
I'm going to say the traction is good
outside<00:02:02.740> as<00:02:02.979> well<00:02:03.190> it<00:02:03.520> won't<00:02:04.000> burn<00:02:04.570> down<00:02:04.900> real

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
outside as well it won't burn down real

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.590 
outside as well it won't burn down real
fast<00:02:05.770> but<00:02:06.580> it'll<00:02:06.880> probably<00:02:07.000> burn<00:02:07.360> now<00:02:07.540> you

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
fast but it'll probably burn now you

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.719 
fast but it'll probably burn now you
know<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.259> normal<00:02:08.649> rate<00:02:08.860> for<00:02:09.100> any<00:02:09.340> type<00:02:09.550> of

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
know the normal rate for any type of

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.550 
know the normal rate for any type of

the gym you're sticking like glue use
upper<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.160> used<00:02:15.459> on<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.730> materials<00:02:16.300> of<00:02:16.630> the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
upper is used on the materials of the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.960 
upper is used on the materials of the
same<00:02:17.290> normal<00:02:17.590> aspects<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.340> find<00:02:18.700> on<00:02:18.940> the

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
same normal aspects that you find on the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.060 
same normal aspects that you find on the
majority<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.540> these<00:02:19.840> models<00:02:20.380> here<00:02:20.500> lately<00:02:20.770> I

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
majority of these models here lately I

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.070 
majority of these models here lately I
like<00:02:21.190> this<00:02:21.700> material<00:02:21.970> because<00:02:22.660> it's<00:02:22.870> one<00:02:23.050> of

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
like this material because it's one of

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.860 
like this material because it's one of
those<00:02:23.350> materials<00:02:23.590> which<00:02:24.459> loosens<00:02:24.820> over<00:02:25.630> time

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
those materials which loosens over time

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.080 
those materials which loosens over time
you<00:02:26.080> know<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.290> break<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.860> in<00:02:27.070> which<00:02:27.610> is<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.790> very

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
you know you break it in which is a very

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.610 
you know you break it in which is a very
short<00:02:28.330> break<00:02:28.570> in<00:02:28.750> time<00:02:28.959> I'm<00:02:29.230> gonna<00:02:29.410> say

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620
