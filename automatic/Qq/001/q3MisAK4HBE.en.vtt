00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:11.879 
now one of the other things I mentioned

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.160 
now one of the other things I mentioned
is<00:00:12.600> the<00:00:13.200> ability<00:00:13.500> to

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
is the ability to

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.530 
is the ability to
have<00:00:15.350> the<00:00:15.920> models<00:00:16.280> at<00:00:16.550> your<00:00:16.790> fingertips<00:00:17.330> out

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540 
have the models at your fingertips out

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.910 
have the models at your fingertips out
in<00:00:17.600> the<00:00:17.750> field<00:00:18.050> and<00:00:18.320> so<00:00:18.440> what<00:00:18.560> you're<00:00:18.680> seeing

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
in the field and so what you're seeing

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.900 
in the field and so what you're seeing
here<00:00:19.040> is<00:00:19.400> the<00:00:20.180> same<00:00:20.390> models<00:00:20.840> loaded<00:00:21.529> up<00:00:21.680> on<00:00:22.670> the

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
here is the same models loaded up on the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.350 
here is the same models loaded up on the
iPad<00:00:23.920> for<00:00:24.920> reference<00:00:25.369> out<00:00:25.580> in<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:25.790> field<00:00:26.060> and

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
iPad for reference out in the field and

so you can do things like stand on the

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.019 
so you can do things like stand on the
roadway<00:00:29.000> maybe<00:00:29.360> and<00:00:29.660> show<00:00:30.230> your<00:00:30.830> owner<00:00:31.220> what

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
roadway maybe and show your owner what

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.430 
roadway maybe and show your owner what
the<00:00:32.180> building's<00:00:32.510> going<00:00:32.570> to<00:00:32.720> look<00:00:32.840> like<00:00:32.989> on<00:00:33.290> the

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
the building's going to look like on the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.680 
the building's going to look like on the
site<00:00:33.680> or<00:00:34.190> even<00:00:34.400> go<00:00:34.550> into<00:00:34.879> a<00:00:34.910> mechanical<00:00:35.570> room
