00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.780

off<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.729> black<00:01:35.909> shoe<00:01:37.130> in<00:01:38.130> deciding<00:01:38.640> whether

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
off the black shoe in deciding whether

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.640 
off the black shoe in deciding whether
or<00:01:38.850> not<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.000> get<00:01:39.210> these<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.509> kind<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.810> had<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.170> I

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
or not to get these I kind of had to I

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.649 
or not to get these I kind of had to I
had<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.040> pick<00:01:41.189> between<00:01:41.220> these<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.090> he<00:01:42.540> has<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
had to pick between these and he has a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.539 
had to pick between these and he has a
pair<00:01:42.930> that's<00:01:43.200> mostly<00:01:43.649> white<00:01:43.979> with<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.460> little

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
pair that's mostly white with a little

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.179 
pair that's mostly white with a little
bit<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.880> black<00:01:45.119> trim<00:01:45.590> but<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.770> end<00:01:46.890> I

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
bit of black trim but in the end I

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.200 
bit of black trim but in the end I
decided<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.299> better<00:01:48.479> way<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.659> go

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
decided this is the better way to go

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.010 
decided this is the better way to go
mostly<00:01:51.210> because<00:01:51.329> i<00:01:51.450> think<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.689> white<00:01:51.840> ones

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
mostly because i think the white ones

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.560 
mostly because i think the white ones
would<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.259> gotten<00:01:52.409> kind<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:53.030> dirty<00:01:54.030> faster

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
would have gotten kind of dirty faster

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.350 
would have gotten kind of dirty faster
and<00:01:55.380> i<00:01:55.680> really<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.310> black<00:01:56.820> soul<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.329> a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
and i really like the black soul is a

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.740 
and i really like the black soul is a
real<00:01:57.600> selling<00:01:57.930> point<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.350> one<00:01:58.530> for<00:01:58.740> me

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
real selling point on this one for me

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
real selling point on this one for me
we'll<00:02:00.750> take<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.930> look<00:02:01.049> at<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.259> insole<00:02:01.560> real

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
we'll take a look at the insole real

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.929 
we'll take a look at the insole real
quick<00:02:02.420> black<00:02:03.420> leather<00:02:03.689> stacked<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.259> seoul<00:02:04.939> and

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
quick black leather stacked in seoul and

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.969 
quick black leather stacked in seoul and
people<00:02:06.840> don't<00:02:06.899> talk<00:02:07.079> about<00:02:07.229> these<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:07.619> but

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
people don't talk about these but but

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.770 
people don't talk about these but but
geo<00:02:08.190> baskets<00:02:08.610> do<00:02:08.729> kind<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.030> actually<00:02:09.300> break<00:02:09.569> in

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
geo baskets do kind of actually break in

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.720 
geo baskets do kind of actually break in
as<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.770> wear<00:02:10.979> them<00:02:11.099> because<00:02:11.250> you're<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
as you wear them because you're the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.280 
as you wear them because you're the
insole<00:02:12.120> will<00:02:12.270> mold<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.599> your<00:02:12.690> foot

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290

as<00:02:13.349> well<00:02:13.829> kind<00:02:14.189> of<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:15.120> part<00:02:15.360> will

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
as well kind of like the this part will

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.699 
as well kind of like the this part will
get<00:02:15.599> tighter<00:02:15.840> as<00:02:16.049> you<00:02:16.140> pull<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.409> laces

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
get tighter as you pull the laces

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.190 
get tighter as you pull the laces
tighter<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.189> have<00:02:17.640> them<00:02:17.790> lace<00:02:17.969> it's<00:02:18.930> kind<00:02:19.079> of<00:02:19.109> a

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
tighter I have them lace it's kind of a

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.599 
tighter I have them lace it's kind of a
gap<00:02:19.439> at<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.709> bottom<00:02:19.799> of<00:02:20.069> laces<00:02:20.400> that's

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
gap at the bottom of laces that's

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.390 
gap at the bottom of laces that's
typical<00:02:21.060> on<00:02:21.209> both<00:02:21.390> my<00:02:21.540> pears<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:22.890> kind<00:02:23.219> of<00:02:23.310> like

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
typical on both my pears I kind of like

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.069 
typical on both my pears I kind of like
it<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:23.819> then<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.239> support<00:02:24.569> is<00:02:24.659> tighter<00:02:24.900> up

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
it and then the support is tighter up

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.530 
it and then the support is tighter up
here<00:02:25.290> in<00:02:25.409> the<00:02:25.500> shoe<00:02:25.709> I'm<00:02:26.400> going<00:02:26.609> to<00:02:26.700> show<00:02:26.849> you<00:02:26.909> a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
here in the shoe I'm going to show you a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.559 
here in the shoe I'm going to show you a
comparison<00:02:28.099> against<00:02:29.099> my<00:02:29.299> classic<00:02:30.299> pair<00:02:30.480> of

comparison against my classic pair of
geo<00:02:30.720> baskets<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.349> then<00:02:32.159> we'll<00:02:32.280> look<00:02:32.400> at<00:02:32.549> some

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
geo baskets and then we'll look at some

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:53.630 
geo baskets and then we'll look at some
pears<00:02:32.939> on<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.750> feet

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.910 

as<00:02:54.640> always<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.840> geo<00:02:56.050> baskets<00:02:56.470> have<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.710> side

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
as always the geo baskets have the side

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.400 
as always the geo baskets have the side
zip<00:02:57.280> which<00:02:58.090> makes<00:02:58.300> them<00:02:58.450> way<00:02:58.720> easier<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.230> put

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
zip which makes them way easier to put

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.740 
zip which makes them way easier to put
on<00:02:59.560> than<00:03:00.250> many<00:03:00.610> other<00:03:00.790> shoes<00:03:01.030> including<00:03:01.330> the

here's kind of the on foot review part
I'm<00:03:27.680> wearing<00:03:27.950> shorts<00:03:28.220> because<00:03:28.310> i'm<00:03:28.460> going

I'm wearing shorts because i'm going
running<00:03:28.790> but<00:03:29.060> as<00:03:29.150> you<00:03:29.210> can<00:03:29.300> see<00:03:29.510> same<00:03:30.500> stacked

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
running but as you can see same stacked

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.340 
running but as you can see same stacked
height<00:03:31.540> same<00:03:32.540> length<00:03:32.780> i<00:03:32.930> went<00:03:33.110> and<00:03:33.200> measured

height same length i went and measured

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.730 
height same length i went and measured
these<00:03:33.590> against<00:03:33.950> my<00:03:34.040> 2014<00:03:35.170> fall<00:03:36.170> winters<00:03:36.530> and

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
these against my 2014 fall winters and

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.770 
these against my 2014 fall winters and
they're<00:03:36.830> exactly<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.250> same<00:03:37.340> proportions<00:03:38.090> no

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
they're exactly the same proportions no

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.730 
they're exactly the same proportions no
difference<00:03:39.170> there<00:03:41.500> there<00:03:42.500> might<00:03:42.710> be

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
difference there there might be

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.020 
difference there there might be
differences<00:03:43.160> between<00:03:43.340> some<00:03:43.670> of<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.820> years

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
differences between some of the years

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.400 
differences between some of the years
but<00:03:44.270> but<00:03:44.720> not<00:03:44.870> at<00:03:45.110> least<00:03:45.230> in<00:03:45.470> 2014<00:03:46.040> versus<00:03:46.580> 2015

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
but but not at least in 2014 versus 2015

but but not at least in 2014 versus 2015
Holloway<00:03:48.410> proportions<00:03:49.100> that's<00:03:50.060> all<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.300> same

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
Holloway proportions that's all the same

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.410 
Holloway proportions that's all the same
I<00:03:50.720> think<00:03:51.440> there<00:03:51.560> may<00:03:51.590> have<00:03:51.800> been<00:03:51.860> a<00:03:51.980> black<00:03:52.420> base

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
I think there may have been a black base

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.320 
I think there may have been a black base
one<00:03:53.750> in<00:03:54.050> 2014<00:03:54.920> at<00:03:55.040> some<00:03:55.220> point<00:03:55.460> but<00:03:56.030> this<00:03:56.210> is

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
one in 2014 at some point but this is

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.490 
one in 2014 at some point but this is
the<00:03:56.420> first<00:03:56.450> time<00:03:56.750> it<00:03:56.900> really<00:03:56.930> hit<00:03:57.260> hard<00:03:59.410> and<00:04:00.410> I

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
the first time it really hit hard and I

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:23.040 
the first time it really hit hard and I
like<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.800> look

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.870 

here's<00:04:24.050> a<00:04:24.110> shot<00:04:24.350> of<00:04:24.380> my<00:04:24.590> geo<00:04:25.009> baskets<00:04:25.490> side<00:04:25.699> by

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
here's a shot of my geo baskets side by

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.240 
here's a shot of my geo baskets side by
side<00:04:26.090> so<00:04:26.840> on<00:04:27.229> the<00:04:27.380> left<00:04:27.590> you<00:04:27.949> have<00:04:28.070> my<00:04:28.190> original

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
side so on the left you have my original

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.400 
side so on the left you have my original
black<00:04:28.850> and<00:04:29.180> milk<00:04:29.449> these<00:04:29.900> are<00:04:30.080> kind<00:04:30.229> of<00:04:30.289> a

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
black and milk these are kind of a

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.529 
black and milk these are kind of a
quintessential<00:04:31.009> I<00:04:31.340> think<00:04:31.940> arguably<00:04:32.210> they

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
quintessential I think arguably they

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.370 
quintessential I think arguably they
called<00:04:32.780> them<00:04:32.960> from<00:04:33.139> fall<00:04:33.380> winter<00:04:34.240> 2014<00:04:35.380> but

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
called them from fall winter 2014 but
