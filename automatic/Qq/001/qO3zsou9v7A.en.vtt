a bunch of them off cypress trees so

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.900 
a bunch of them off cypress trees so
thought<00:00:10.860> maybe<00:00:11.130> we'd<00:00:11.280> give<00:00:11.429> it<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.550> try<00:00:11.759> out

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
the way you can let that weight hold the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.540 
the way you can let that weight hold the
bait<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.690> place<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.410> just<00:00:20.039> give<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.430> little

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
bait in place and just give it a little

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.810 
bait in place and just give it a little
bit<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.820> subtle<00:00:21.150> action<00:00:22.250> by<00:00:23.250> moving<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.670> line

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
get pressure on the wait until you're

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.250

ready<00:00:26.849> for<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.269> bait<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.660> move<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
ready for the bait to move out of the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:44.530

it's<00:01:03.480> funny<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.110> always<00:01:04.830> thought<00:01:05.130> of<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.370> drop

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
it's funny I always thought of that drop

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.570 
it's funny I always thought of that drop
shot<00:01:06.410> as<00:01:07.410> a<00:01:08.090> bait<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.390> deep<00:01:09.720> clear<00:01:10.050> Lake's

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580

pilings<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.650> trees<00:01:14.040> oh<00:01:15.500> but<00:01:16.500> tall<00:01:16.860> hi<00:01:17.729> today<00:01:18.030> I

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
pilings and trees oh but tall hi today I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.770 
pilings and trees oh but tall hi today I
figured<00:01:18.720> out<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:20.030> you<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.300> catch<00:01:21.450> them<00:01:21.540> chou

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
figured out that you can catch them chou

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.249 
figured out that you can catch them chou
on<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.910> it's<00:01:23.910> interesting<00:01:24.240> tells<00:01:25.050> us<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
on it and it's interesting tells us a

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.100 
on it and it's interesting tells us a
couple<00:01:25.440> of<00:01:25.590> different<00:01:25.860> things<00:01:26.070> first<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.790> all

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
couple of different things first of all

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.270 
couple of different things first of all
preconceived<00:01:28.110> notions<00:01:28.590> tend<00:01:28.830> to<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> little

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
preconceived notions tend to be a little

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.190 
preconceived notions tend to be a little
dangerous<00:01:29.550> we<00:01:30.300> think<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.750> only<00:01:30.900> catch

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
dangerous we think we can only catch

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.990 
dangerous we think we can only catch
them<00:01:31.350> one<00:01:31.500> way<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.890> bait<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:32.880> never

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
them one way on the bait so we never

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.680 
them one way on the bait so we never
tried<00:01:33.300> any<00:01:33.570> other<00:01:33.780> way<00:01:34.820> second<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.880> all<00:01:35.970> who

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
tried any other way second of all who

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.240 
tried any other way second of all who
always<00:01:36.869> need<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.259> experimenting<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.040> try

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
always need to be experimenting and try

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.310 
always need to be experimenting and try
something<00:01:38.520> need<00:01:38.820> we're<00:01:39.660> bad<00:01:39.840> about<00:01:40.080> saying

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
something need we're bad about saying

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.870 
something need we're bad about saying
that<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:40.770> bass<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.250> aren't<00:01:41.490> biting<00:01:41.670> today

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
that the bass just aren't biting today

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.249 
that the bass just aren't biting today
but<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> truth<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.660> they're<00:01:42.960> biting

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
but the truth is they're biting

somewhere<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.130> matter<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.399> figuring

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
somewhere it's just a matter of figuring

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.600 
somewhere it's just a matter of figuring
out<00:01:44.759> how<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:44.970> catch<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:46.039> but<00:01:47.039> brother<00:01:47.250> talking

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
out how to catch on but brother talking

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.780 
out how to catch on but brother talking
about<00:01:47.819> it<00:01:47.910> I'm<00:01:47.940> gonna<00:01:48.210> go<00:01:48.270> get<00:01:48.420> some<00:01:48.630> more
