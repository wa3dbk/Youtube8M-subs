00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.820
 to learn how to make this coffee in cream 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.210
 or coffee cream we're going to need 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.550
 this is optional that are more melon already 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.140
 I tell them it's optional if they like what they're going 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.930
 to add to that you will also need 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.450
 white sugar or integrate that 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.710
 you still need you like coffee 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:36.890
 instant hot milk a good bowl 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:40.690
 and a spoonful of good metal we're going to 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.970
 proceed to make this delicious coffee 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.320
 good cream let's go 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.320
 to start 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:58.410
 and then we're going to add two teaspoons 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.410
 coffee instant coffee 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.759
 and now once we have both 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.799
 ingredients we are going to add a 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.549
 teaspoon one or two teaspoons 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.420
 milk 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.420
 very hot 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.880
 and once we add those teaspoons 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.860
 of milk let's start to beat this 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.950
 coffee let's start mixing 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.320
 integrate sugar with milk and 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.619
 other and good once we achieve a 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.590
 texture a little pasty more or less than 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:37.729
 We're going to add one more teaspoon 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.590
 of hot milk one or two depending 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.860
 as you see it if you see it very very 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.170
 dry and in this case the coffee absorbed 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.360
 a lot of sugar then add one 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.539
 teaspoon more sugar but I'm telling you 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.070
 that is optional if you want 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.570
 they can continue beating only that they are going to 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.750
 give a little more work then 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.020
 that's why I added him 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.260
 As I told you, we beat you with a lot of love 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.170
 a lot of love and when we get that texture 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.080
 a little doughy we're going to add a 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.390
 more teaspoon of hot milk 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.450
 preferably and we start again 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.150
 to beat until little by little 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.209
 dough goes diluted and becomes 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.970
 more or less as in cream as what 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.090
 they are watching there and good when he is in 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.270
 that point at that cream-type point and 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.570
 pasta then our coffee would be ready 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.510
 coffee smoothie cream and what we would proceed 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.600
 is to add well hot milk 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.450
 so that this begins to be integrated and 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.430
 get well very creamy this way already 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.680
 would be ready our coffee cream already 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.440
 we could have a snack or a drink when 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.540
 we want but as I am a greedy and 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.960
 If you are also greedy as I go 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.020
 to add more melon 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.740
 well let's start the most melo and go 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.600
 to add diced I 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.120
 approximately I add 5 more melon 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.520
 as in account they are big that's why they 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.130
 I say a good bowl since the most melon 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.470
 it starts to melt and it's going to go up 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.440
 little foam coffee cream 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.720
 then we are adding and we go with the 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.420
 metal spoon let's press the 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.970
 more I wolf in the cafe and we are giving 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.270
 round and round until the most melon 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.700
 dissolves in the coffee and once 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.310
 that dissolves the result that goes to 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.580
 to stay is definitely much more 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.010
 creamy yet of what the 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.830
 coffee cream just as you can see there it 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.370
 dilutes and absorbs all the 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.130
 milk and when finished, we could 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.140
 enjoy this delicious cream coffee or 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.960
 coffee beaten as you prefer 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.870
 call it I'm going to add it with a 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.840
 biscuit in this case but if you 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.060
 they want with that is more than enough 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.810
 and well that's all super simple 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.670
 do 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.590
 As you can see, you can do it yourselves 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.290
 without a machine you just need a little 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.270
 of love, love and patience and that's it 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.160
 ready in our cream coffee if you have 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.650
 liked to rate this video if it has 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.209
 It seemed interesting to share it and 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.880
 tell me down there that has 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:21.489
 seemed to send them a very big kiss and 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.489
 see you in the next video bay 

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:42.209
