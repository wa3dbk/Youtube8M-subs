00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.539 
popping for me is as if you're taking a
space<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.470> making<00:03:06.470> people<00:03:06.650> notice<00:03:07.220> what's<00:03:07.459> in

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
space and making people notice what's in

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.740 
space and making people notice what's in
between<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.970> space<00:03:08.349> technically<00:03:09.349> it's<00:03:09.620> about

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
between the space technically it's about

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.190 
between the space technically it's about
illusions<00:03:13.060> but<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.209> can<00:03:14.360> date<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:14.810> back<00:03:15.049> to

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
illusions but you can date it back to

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.289 
illusions but you can date it back to
the<00:03:15.290> robot<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:17.540> robot<00:03:17.569> which<00:03:18.049> is<00:03:18.319> kind<00:03:18.980> of

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
the robot the robot which is kind of

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.059 
the robot the robot which is kind of
feed<00:03:20.299> some<00:03:20.659> of<00:03:20.780> our<00:03:20.930> even<00:03:21.319> techniques<00:03:21.709> like

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
feed some of our even techniques like

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.690 
feed some of our even techniques like
hitting<00:03:22.700> you<00:03:23.390> know<00:03:23.569> like<00:03:23.870> strobing<00:03:24.829> or<00:03:25.280> dime

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
hitting you know like strobing or dime

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.970 
hitting you know like strobing or dime
stopping<00:03:26.209> all<00:03:26.359> those<00:03:26.540> things<00:03:26.840> that<00:03:27.109> give<00:03:27.769> off

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
stopping all those things that give off

00:03:27.980 --> 00:04:11.090 
stopping all those things that give off
the<00:03:28.220> illusion<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:28.909> the<00:03:29.000> texture

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.670 

and<00:04:12.470> we<00:04:13.470> all<00:04:13.650> just<00:04:13.950> have<00:04:14.250> these<00:04:14.460> similar

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
and we all just have these similar

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.740 
and we all just have these similar
dances<00:04:16.680> but<00:04:17.250> we<00:04:17.370> all<00:04:17.520> move<00:04:17.760> different<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:18.450> I

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
dances but we all move different and I

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.960 
dances but we all move different and I
think<00:04:18.959> that's<00:04:19.110> what<00:04:19.230> draws<00:04:19.470> me<00:04:19.770> to<00:04:20.700> things

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
think that's what draws me to things

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:29.190 
think that's what draws me to things
like<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.360> is<00:04:21.660> because<00:04:21.890> there's<00:04:22.890> diversity

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.399 

my<00:04:29.890> name<00:04:30.100> is<00:04:30.250> Ming<00:04:30.550> kookaburra

such a great experience that

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.959 
such a great experience that
collaborating<00:05:07.169> with<00:05:07.289> the<00:05:07.469> ballet<00:05:07.710> in<00:05:08.159> hip<00:05:08.940> hop

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:08.969 
collaborating with the ballet in hip hop

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:28.180 
collaborating with the ballet in hip hop
on<00:05:09.780> the<00:05:10.199> baseball<00:05:10.650> field<00:05:11.300> that's<00:05:12.300> great

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.530 

I<00:06:18.810> think<00:06:19.530> very<00:06:19.740> few<00:06:19.860> people<00:06:20.370> get<00:06:21.030> to<00:06:21.090> Lincoln

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
I think very few people get to Lincoln

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.070 
I think very few people get to Lincoln
Center<00:06:21.570> or<00:06:22.850> an<00:06:23.850> opera<00:06:24.150> house<00:06:24.330> to<00:06:24.780> see<00:06:24.960> the

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080
