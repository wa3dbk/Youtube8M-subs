program<00:00:03.179> release<00:00:03.689> video<00:00:04.069> today<00:00:05.069> we<00:00:05.520> will<00:00:05.759> have

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
program release video today we will have

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.160 
program release video today we will have
the<00:00:07.140> program<00:00:07.740> for<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:08.610> design<00:00:09.150> here

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
the program for this design here

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.450 
the program for this design here
this<00:00:10.710> design<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.480> by<00:00:12.530> period<00:00:13.530> man<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.250> you

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
this design is by period man and you

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.550 
this design is by period man and you
have<00:00:14.580> seen<00:00:14.880> it<00:00:14.910> already<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.630> two<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.139> my<00:00:16.350> other

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
have seen it already in two of my other

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.359 
have seen it already in two of my other
videos<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.990> well<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.140> result<00:00:19.619> from<00:00:20.189> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
videos and well the result from the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.179 
videos and well the result from the
program<00:00:20.789> won't<00:00:21.060> look<00:00:21.510> exactly<00:00:21.900> like<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.859> one

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
program won't look exactly like this one

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.670 
program won't look exactly like this one
it's<00:00:23.880> more<00:00:24.289> like<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.949> one<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:27.260> for<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.439> to

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
it's more like this one and for this to

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.580 
it's more like this one and for this to
demonstrate<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.900> to<00:00:30.900> see<00:00:31.140> there<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
demonstrate it and to see there the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.170 
demonstrate it and to see there the
pastebin<00:00:32.070> get<00:00:32.430> command

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
pastebin get command

I<00:00:33.290> prepared<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.640> turtle<00:00:35.640> already<00:00:36.260> here<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
I prepared a turtle already here in the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.020 
I prepared a turtle already here in the
back<00:00:38.600> and<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:40.320> will<00:00:40.379> show<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.739> how<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.070> download

back and I will show you how to download

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.139 
back and I will show you how to download
and<00:00:42.570> use<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.500> program<00:00:44.809> area<00:00:46.910> here's<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
and use the program area here's the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.540 
and use the program area here's the
turtle

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.300 

well<00:00:51.180> first<00:00:51.810> we<00:00:52.050> refuel<00:00:52.650> it<00:00:53.300> with<00:00:54.300> fuel<00:00:54.600> all

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310 
well first we refuel it with fuel all

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.360 
well first we refuel it with fuel all
that<00:00:56.310> was<00:00:56.460> already<00:00:56.820> some<00:00:57.150> fuel<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.630> it<00:00:58.220> then<00:00:59.220> we

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
that was already some fuel in it then we

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.770 
that was already some fuel in it then we
have<00:00:59.490> to<00:00:59.760> paste<00:01:00.660> bin<00:01:00.960> get<00:01:01.470> the<00:01:02.540> program

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
have to paste bin get the program

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.770 
have to paste bin get the program
I<00:01:05.120> still<00:01:06.120> get<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:08.729> ID<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.680> capital<00:01:10.680> F<00:01:10.860> H

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
I still get and the ID is capital F H

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:19.460 
I still get and the ID is capital F H
lowercase<00:01:12.780> W<00:01:13.940> seven<00:01:14.940> six<00:01:15.540> capital<00:01:16.470> u<00:01:17.540> H<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:19.110> P

lowercase W seven six capital u H and P

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.130 
lowercase W seven six capital u H and P
and<00:01:19.770> then<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.369> program<00:01:20.910> name<00:01:21.290> build<00:01:22.880> town

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
and then the program name build town

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.440 
and then the program name build town
house<00:01:27.470> okay<00:01:28.470> everything<00:01:29.190> is<00:01:29.310> okay<00:01:29.580> now<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.149> can

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
house okay everything is okay now we can

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.219 
house okay everything is okay now we can
execute<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.320> builds<00:01:31.860> town<00:01:32.130> house<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.960> so<00:01:33.960> we

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
execute this builds town house and so we

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.960 
execute this builds town house and so we
do<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:35.330> build<00:01:37.850> town<00:01:38.850> house<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.850> here<00:01:41.850> we've

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
do it build town house and here we've

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.270 
do it build town house and here we've
got<00:01:42.149> the<00:01:42.300> overview<00:01:42.750> which<00:01:43.170> material<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.070> put

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
got the overview which material to put

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.530 
got the overview which material to put
in<00:01:44.550> which<00:01:44.759> turtle<00:01:45.330> slot<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:47.490> materials<00:01:48.119> here
