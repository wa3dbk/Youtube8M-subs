00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:10.260

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.260
 who had it folk guitar 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.860
 or the bar and 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:28.040
 for the skin one could rather use 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:34.850
 this kind of agreement the only major with 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:38.420
 the inch that blocks the rope 2006 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.340
 in the scores you see an agreement 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.739
 of saulcy these sites rather to play in 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.510
 this position there each of them as 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.510
 samantha sixte 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.880
 me like that 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.770
 everyone like that where manouche allah 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.960
 like that 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.910
 we also play the rope alone 6 9 these 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.910
 king gypsy swing chords 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.200
 the reversal it would be the low ground 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.820
 if the agreement that is very often used 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.410
 as in this sentence of joseph 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.800
 reinhart if this suite of agreements that 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.800
 find her 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.930
 who can serve you for a 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.930
 introduction of a piece in soil 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.880
 I wanted to show you some little ones 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.970
 shots on the main G string 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.050
 some small shots typical gypsy 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.480
 first what you need to work 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.630
 obviously it's the arpeggio so the notes 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:06.280
 which form G major rope 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:08.649
 it's the bar and a lot of sentences 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:16.330
 like that gypsy that are directly 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:18.040
 modeled on the agreement we can make 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.030
 apologies nature you are at a half tone 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.030
 below the note of the agreement 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.560
 that's a quote from charlot schmidt 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.620
 we can also do a nature apology 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.240
 with a note above the note of 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.240
 the ground arpeggio 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:13.310
 I show you a plan there without sound 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:16.239
 blouse combines these two simple ideas 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.239
 in django 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.730
 to you to place his sentences in your 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:32.519
 chorus to improvise in G major 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.269
 you used the G major scale 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.269
 whoever says 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.440
 often there begins this range on the 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.400
 fifth is the mode of mick solidien 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.110
 so at the beginning of re we find a lot 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.260
 phrases like that in style 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.260
 manouche 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.970
 I show you a plan there tchavolo 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.970
 schmitt 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.200
 a plan that use the empty cords 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.200
 or another plane the django 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:26.870
 I'm going to play that sentence 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:28.129
 with another fingering admits transpose 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.240
 in another tone for example in 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.240
 so flat this same sentence 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.260
 we can also give a consonance 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.720
 blues to vary a little bit it's up to 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.320
 to say that we will play with a cheek and there 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.060
 it was major we will play the seventh 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:51.050
 woman respect instead of playing a piece 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.350
 major if we will play a third 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.350
 minors 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.110
 B-flat 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.810
 it's up to you to work out his plans and 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.810
 to put them back in your chorus
