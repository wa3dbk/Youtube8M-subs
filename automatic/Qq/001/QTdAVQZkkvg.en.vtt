highest ones are maybe last I might go

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.030

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
chances of it happening are just pretty

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.649 
chances of it happening are just pretty
much<00:01:49.170> slim<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.649> none<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.130> if<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.180> do<00:01:51.329> get<00:01:51.509> it

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
much slim to none and if you do get it

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.649 
much slim to none and if you do get it
you're<00:01:52.649> not<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.610> you're<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.149> most<00:01:54.329> amazing

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
you're not that you're the most amazing

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.080 
you're not that you're the most amazing
player<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.530> are<00:01:55.799> good<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.399> certain<00:01:56.729> extent

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
player you are good to a certain extent

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.330 
player you are good to a certain extent
it's<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.380> have<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.920> certain

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
it's just you have to have the certain

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.580 
it's just you have to have the certain
things<00:01:59.520> going<00:01:59.880> right<00:02:00.030> for<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.540> my<00:02:01.350> luck

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
things going right for you and my luck

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.620 
things going right for you and my luck
with<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.860> game<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.310> not<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.850> great<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.180> if<00:02:03.509> i

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
with this game is not that great so if i

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.740 
with this game is not that great so if i
ever<00:02:03.810> did<00:02:04.369> try<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.520> go<00:02:05.579> from<00:02:05.820> 0<00:02:05.939> lab<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.540> would

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
ever did try and go from 0 lab it would

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.359 
ever did try and go from 0 lab it would
probably<00:02:07.049> be<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.439> day<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.649> my<00:02:07.920> brain<00:02:08.129> has

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
probably be the day that my brain has

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.729 
probably be the day that my brain has
aneurysm<00:02:09.030> i'm<00:02:09.569> not<00:02:09.720> even<00:02:09.780> i'm<00:02:10.170> not<00:02:10.229> even<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.590> lot

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
aneurysm i'm not even i'm not even a lot

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.320 
aneurysm i'm not even i'm not even a lot
i'm<00:02:10.890> not<00:02:11.009> even<00:02:11.069> gonna<00:02:11.190> joke<00:02:11.760> about<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.030> but<00:02:12.150> i

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
i'm not even gonna joke about it but i

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.730 
i'm not even gonna joke about it but i
probably<00:02:12.959> would<00:02:13.200> if<00:02:13.230> i<00:02:13.410> actually

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
probably would if i actually

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.190 
probably would if i actually
went<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.010> tried<00:02:14.280> for<00:02:14.340> one<00:02:14.610> but<00:02:15.180> anyway<00:02:15.420> like<00:02:16.110> I

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
went and tried for one but anyway like I

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.170 
went and tried for one but anyway like I
said<00:02:16.230> it's<00:02:17.010> going<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.250> be<00:02:17.310> live<00:02:17.580> commentaries

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
said it's going to be live commentaries

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.630 
said it's going to be live commentaries
until<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.540> hit<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.900> certain<00:02:19.140> kill<00:02:19.410> streak<00:02:19.650> so

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
until I hit a certain kill streak so

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.070 
until I hit a certain kill streak so
after<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:21.030> hit<00:02:21.240> let's<00:02:21.510> say<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.690> get<00:02:21.960> the

after I hit let's say I get the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.500 
after I hit let's say I get the
juggernaut<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.710> probably<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.820> don't<00:02:24.330> really

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
juggernaut and probably I don't really

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.640 
juggernaut and probably I don't really
know<00:02:24.690> how<00:02:24.720> many<00:02:25.020> games<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:25.470> going<00:02:25.590> to

take me to get but however many games it

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.230 
take me to get but however many games it
takes<00:02:28.080> me<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.290> get<00:02:28.410> maybe<00:02:28.620> i'll<00:02:29.130> get<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:29.910> kill

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
gonna do that and there's a big reason

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.890

why<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.280> want<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.640> get<00:02:50.850> this<00:02:51.180> high<00:02:51.390> kill<00:02:51.630> streak

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
why I want to get this high kill streak

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.890 
why I want to get this high kill streak
and<00:02:52.080> it's<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:53.090> something<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.630> lot<00:02:54.690> of

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
and it's a something that a lot of

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.200 
and it's a something that a lot of
people<00:02:54.990> don't<00:02:55.470> really<00:02:55.680> think<00:02:56.400> about<00:02:56.550> will

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
people don't really think about will

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.770 
people don't really think about will
well<00:02:58.170> let<00:02:58.590> me<00:02:58.680> rephrase<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.430> when<00:03:00.360> you<00:03:00.510> set

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
well let me rephrase that when you set

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.290 
well let me rephrase that when you set
yourself<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.500> get<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.770> certain<00:03:02.250> killstreak<00:03:02.730> you

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
yourself to get a certain killstreak you

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.960 
yourself to get a certain killstreak you
generally<00:03:03.930> play<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.170> lot<00:03:04.440> better<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.970> that's

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
generally play a lot better and that's

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.030 
generally play a lot better and that's
just<00:03:06.120> saying<00:03:06.510> with<00:03:06.750> like<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.020> mediocre<00:03:07.470> size

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
just saying with like a mediocre size

blow<00:03:13.890> 20<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.610> generally<00:03:15.570> find<00:03:15.750> myself<00:03:16.020> playing

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
blow 20 I generally find myself playing

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.080 
blow 20 I generally find myself playing
a<00:03:16.710> whole<00:03:16.980> lot<00:03:17.250> better<00:03:17.460> when<00:03:17.670> I'm<00:03:17.790> trying<00:03:17.970> to

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
that's why I became a better search

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.860 
that's why I became a better search
