00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:32.760
 Hello everyone today we have repair bumper 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:36.210
 hyundai solaris I already like that thing bumper 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:39.989
 with the same side noticed tell me how 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.350
 magnet all these repair places next 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.629
 once it arrives there oh well in 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.610
 there is a crack on the bumper 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.280
 symmetrically so good he's here 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.409
 scattered him a little bit here 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.050
 here he split that is in this 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:01.260
 place all opened as simple now 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.960
 in place all tucked that first thing 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.270
 will need to do will need to be here in 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.530
 Drill at the end of the crack 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.530
 so that he does not crawl further 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.030
 it also needs to be done here 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.740
 he ripped off all the attachments they also need 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.420
 will be 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.080
 solder they were there like you at all 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.480
 glued 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.220
 which is very strange to me because 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.440
 fog like it should tight 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.820
 keep but there everything is like you very very 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.090
 in Chinese 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.500
 okay first we solder here 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:46.900
 we establish that is the integrity of this 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:51.630
 places then creeping everything 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:54.280
 mounts for fog 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.650
 Well, respectively, sanding all 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.710
 places are all stars that is these very 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.160
 a lot of stars appeared 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.720
 they gave cracks almost everywhere 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.570
 where are these not the smallest of them 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.840
 almost imperceptible that is but them in 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.830
 anyway you need to remove primed by 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.880
 it is not necessary because it is all the same 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:23.410
 it is necessary to get out once 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:26.730
 for plastic and so did a hole 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.340
 where we needed to be drilled 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.870
 now proceed to the soldering process I myself 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.550
 I will not show it because it is very 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:39.340
 uncomfortable me to become it yet no hold 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:44.280
 I will only say one thing about the device 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.830
 boss plastic is not jarred when you will 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.860
 simply solder the net which is not written 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:54.340
 plastic leads there are using something 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.090
 others are not just a net 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.100
 focus on that side and nothing 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.120
 bad luck and of course 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:07.620
 do not overheat to let you say so 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.620
 already boiling plastic did not start 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.140
 how the net was soldered 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.890
 returned to the place of attachment 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.780
 I return in such a way that is old 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.450
 mount here in them is such 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.569
 the feeling that they were on the edge 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.310
 but some very thin legs here 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.819
 now they are just just Lena 90 of 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.900
 mounts all extinct 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:38.930
 protivotumanok worth exactly relative 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:42.299
 2 everything can go to grinding and 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.150
 so bumper oshkurili and where were 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.000
 the cobweb too smoked 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:51.989
 This is our place of soldering, that is, from the inside 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.419
 us the grid here is just like plastic with 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.040
 plastic mix everything here a little bit 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.689
 putty just here at this place 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.419
 there is 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:03.569
 dimples and potholes up here too 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:06.169
 the most here is a little bit 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.400
 putty in these places and basically everything 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:11.689
 I apologize that I'm not showing up the process 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.030
 me somewhere there is a video how to solder a bumper 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:17.729
 just now camera on camera 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.440
 until i was born but sure 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.570
 think of something I will show 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.610
 full process 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.580
 here now we putty after what 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:33.030
 pass for 40 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:34.560
 all transitions smooth to us on 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.639
 ground nothing appeared no 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.639
 the ladder was not
