00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.490
 money but the show still been 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.260
 shot by a colleague 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.880
 the formula was just a little different 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.170

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.790

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.960
 recovered my camera she effortlessly for 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.070
 an appetite while waiting this week on 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.510

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.460
 classy that music can sometimes 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.600
 be deadly and that ponies are 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.370

 tom boonen a strange is ugly but 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.260
 it is frankly violence a 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.180
 Thai pissed in her mouth a 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.589
 it was nice maybe I never 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.530
 also but I looked at a map 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.509
 there are rivers la la la la and la 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.399
 brief from anywhere near you can you 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.290
 have it short you are short pigs 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.759
 I stop to say briefly the only reason 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.630
 logical would be jellyfish bites I 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.770
 saw them in friends 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.240
 but the children and the times of you the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.740
 to say there is never a jellyfish in Moscow 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.390
 as there has never been Santa Claus this is 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.530
 a lie from your parents of 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.149
 government or a big 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.950
 however to explain their acts 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.509
 urinary there are clues that cheated a 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.360
 tracksuit of any beauty 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.580
 grandma's shoes and her wii that he 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.899
 gets tired while he is pissing on his skate 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.740
 he is completely and definitively 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.600
 end and it's the law of alcohol all 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.070
 to be under the influence of drunkenness 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.020
 good ideas even if it's wrong and I 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.050
 I'm going to dance the stove and I've bawled 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.580
 July 9th it's good but doing 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.080
 podcast if you have not vomited from 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.580
 disgust following this video is good 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.580
 but I see the second tour

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.319
 this clip was released two weeks ago 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.640
 carrying it he was even going to 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.740
 rot that boy band years 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.120
 90 with the only difference that these kids 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.560
 have no hairs are made up like 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.670
 looting and haircuts 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.150
 worthy of the most beautiful sauerkraut 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.530
 German 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.300
 and like all the boys band 2 finds 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.340
 the usual heads the chief who is 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.260
 beautiful and white another more exotic 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.310
 to respect the diversity quota and 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.670
 another that looks like a tire 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.140
 Recommended 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.790
 because even ugly people can 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.650
 to type fallow deer thanks to the popularity 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.300
 what a beautiful message and believe that a 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.709
 day we are if I can not you 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.959
 you must remember that the name of the clip 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.000
 it's facebook official a thesis 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.400
 complex on social networks and 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.900
 the impact on our generation is the 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.130
 kids are just selling sex to 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.050
 girls who have just had their rule 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.470
 and it must pay a lot of moral 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.660
 all this the five young effeminate men 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.489
 who dance together you are sure that 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.780
 it's their lady bar thing you want 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.160
 that I say that how at their age of 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.600
 playing Pokemon I was not driving 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.160
 cars and I was not dancing on a 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.160
 basketball court as a power enders 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.860
 but if for a minimum of effort I can 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.060
 make me a maximum of tune i found 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.319
 the solution to round up my ends of 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.970
 months instead of making porn 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:18.989
 amateur in the babillot card the 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:22.410
 legal representative because if you want 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:26.489

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.340

 facebook 10 pm baby love baby doll with 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.910
 this clip i am targeting the public 17 10 years 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:47.069
 deadline for you girls I 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:48.360
 added ponies in the show did not 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.560
 you do not make the girl is healthy 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.910
 and save and live wonderfully 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.660
 in fact I do not know anything at all I know 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.220
 just that she took a year to 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.630
 help in the mouth yes I specify that 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.920
 for the author of the video this yellow thing 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.299
 is a pony but we just saw a 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.160
 Russian who is washing with their anthem 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.480
 then the logic in all this but 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.910
 let's imagine for a moment that the man at the 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.680
 mustache aka sergeant garcia had 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.790
 swung the pony on his buddy you 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.269
 think the video would have made 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.890
 sensation 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.359
 noro wholesale because small 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.190
 girls make the buzz be it in the 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.810
 video games movies or videos on 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.400
 internet I do not think we're talking about 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.329
 same videos and then everyone comes 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.680
 take care of the little girl 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.450
 pony people if we had balanced 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.200
 the little girl on the pony that would have 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.030
 changed something 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.560
 and if we had swung a little girl 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.030
 on a little girl what is 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.740
 would be spent in our biggest 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.610
 finally it's a slow motion video 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.850
 who gives us the answer 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.380
 Until then it's just the beer 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.889
 Sergeant Garcia is completely and 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.940
 definitely for and that teaches him the 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.900
 a little dirty kid's life 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.650
 Besides, it's the moment we 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.650
 also learn something 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.679
 hi guys I wanted to know 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.839
 why dogs always attack 

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:49.789
 the fluff for successful as soon as this problem 

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:52.069
 we must understand the origin of 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.020
 hostility do you know the proverb when 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:55.429
 there will be more room in hell the 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.559
 morgues will return to earth 

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:59.240
 for several decades the souls of 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:00.889
 criminals and bandits are reincarnated 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.050
 in the stuffed animals we know 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.729
 in their innocent form and they get 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.499
 wake up at night and get organized for 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.809
 to overthrow humanity in chaos 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:10.969
 thankfully my dogs thanks to their 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:11.330
 sixth canine sense protects us from this 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:13.939
 scourge 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.800
 proud and loyal they defend them 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:17.719
 in a secret fight against evil 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.779
