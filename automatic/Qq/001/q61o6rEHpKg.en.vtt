I<00:04:13.410> don't<00:04:14.100> think<00:04:14.190> magic<00:04:14.549> flying<00:04:14.880> gear<00:04:15.060> is<00:04:15.120> going

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
I don't think magic flying gear is going

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.240 
I don't think magic flying gear is going
to<00:04:15.359> be<00:04:15.449> the<00:04:15.630> same<00:04:15.900> as<00:04:16.169> it<00:04:16.290> was<00:04:16.410> in<00:04:16.440> d2<00:04:16.829> I<00:04:16.889> think

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
to be the same as it was in d2 I think

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.920 
to be the same as it was in d2 I think
they're<00:04:17.340> going<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:17.549> lie

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
they're going to lie

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.870 
they're going to lie
mellow<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:19.170> back<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.380> bit<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.890> just<00:04:20.010> have<00:04:20.220> magic

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
mellow it back a bit and just have magic

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.960 
mellow it back a bit and just have magic
line<00:04:21.030> be<00:04:21.209> like<00:04:21.390> uh<00:04:21.620> like<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.680> secondary<00:04:23.250> sort<00:04:23.880> of

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
line be like uh like a secondary sort of

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.570 
line be like uh like a secondary sort of
stat<00:04:24.870> that<00:04:24.900> if<00:04:25.320> it's<00:04:25.560> on<00:04:25.710> gear<00:04:26.010> it's<00:04:26.160> good<00:04:26.340> but

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
stat that if it's on gear it's good but

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.490 
stat that if it's on gear it's good but
it's<00:04:26.640> not<00:04:26.790> gonna<00:04:27.000> be<00:04:27.180> like<00:04:27.210> specific<00:04:28.140> magic

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
it's not gonna be like specific magic

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.870 
it's not gonna be like specific magic
flying<00:04:28.710> gear<00:04:28.980> I<00:04:29.100> could<00:04:29.280> be<00:04:29.400> completely<00:04:29.550> wrong

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
flying gear I could be completely wrong

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.660 
flying gear I could be completely wrong
but<00:04:30.390> that<00:04:30.960> would<00:04:31.290> be<00:04:31.320> you<00:04:31.950> know<00:04:32.040> my<00:04:32.220> idea<00:04:32.580> of

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
but that would be you know my idea of

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.760 
but that would be you know my idea of
how<00:04:32.820> they<00:04:32.940> fix<00:04:33.540> this<00:04:33.660> in<00:04:33.840> like<00:04:33.960> tone<00:04:34.290> down<00:04:34.530> the

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
how they fix this in like tone down the

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.100 
how they fix this in like tone down the
magic<00:04:35.100> find<00:04:35.360> but<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:36.540> it's<00:04:36.720> not<00:04:36.870> going<00:04:37.020> to

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
magic find but so it's not going to

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.480 
magic find but so it's not going to
matter<00:04:37.200> if<00:04:37.470> your<00:04:37.560> plan<00:04:37.740> with<00:04:37.860> friends<00:04:38.130> anyways

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
matter if your plan with friends anyways

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.130 
matter if your plan with friends anyways
as<00:04:38.730> long<00:04:38.880> as<00:04:39.030> you're<00:04:39.120> able<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.540> clear<00:04:39.990> the

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
as long as you're able to clear the

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.040 
as long as you're able to clear the

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
content the guy who potentially could be

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.750 
content the guy who potentially could be
stacking<00:04:43.620> magic<00:04:43.950> wand<00:04:44.160> you<00:04:44.400> know<00:04:44.520> would<00:04:44.670> be

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
stacking magic wand you know would be

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.190 
stacking magic wand you know would be
getting<00:04:45.030> items<00:04:45.210> for<00:04:45.600> you<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:45.930> your<00:04:46.020> in<00:04:46.170> your

friends anyways I can only see this
being<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.780> problem<00:04:48.810> in<00:04:49.290> like<00:04:49.440> public<00:04:49.860> games<00:04:50.070> or

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
something if you know the items were a

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.070 
something if you know the items were a
bit<00:04:53.220> extreme<00:04:53.550> like<00:04:53.790> they<00:04:53.910> were<00:04:54.000> in<00:04:54.150> d2<00:04:54.480> so

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
bit extreme like they were in d2 so

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.200 
bit extreme like they were in d2 so
something<00:04:55.500> to<00:04:55.650> see<00:04:56.220> how<00:04:56.340> that<00:04:56.520> pans<00:04:56.730> out<00:04:57.000> when

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
something to see how that pans out when

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.560 
something to see how that pans out when
the<00:04:57.300> game<00:04:57.450> goes<00:04:57.720> live<00:04:58.320> and<00:04:58.890> the<00:04:59.700> second<00:05:00.060> topic

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
the game goes live and the second topic

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.770 
the game goes live and the second topic
I<00:05:01.080> thought<00:05:01.560> was<00:05:01.680> interesting<00:05:01.830> was<00:05:02.780> the

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
I thought was interesting was the

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.070 
I thought was interesting was the
evolution<00:05:04.500> of<00:05:04.740> how<00:05:05.400> sort<00:05:06.390> of<00:05:06.480> internet<00:05:06.900> games

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
evolution of how sort of internet games

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.210 
evolution of how sort of internet games
have<00:05:07.490> come<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.640> be<00:05:08.850> as<00:05:09.120> of<00:05:09.720> recent<00:05:10.110> this<00:05:10.920> sort

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
have come to be as of recent this sort

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.850 
have come to be as of recent this sort
of<00:05:11.340> started<00:05:11.940> for<00:05:12.450> me<00:05:12.480> I<00:05:12.930> noticed<00:05:13.200> it<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:13.650> first

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
of started for me I noticed it the first

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.270 
of started for me I noticed it the first
game<00:05:13.980> I<00:05:14.070> noticed<00:05:14.370> it<00:05:14.520> is<00:05:14.840> was<00:05:15.840> in<00:05:16.020> umm<00:05:16.230> Danah<00:05:16.740> 42

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
game I noticed it is was in umm Danah 42

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.370 
game I noticed it is was in umm Danah 42
and<00:05:18.950> what<00:05:19.950> I<00:05:20.160> noticed<00:05:20.700> was<00:05:20.850> games<00:05:21.690> before<00:05:21.960> this

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
and what I noticed was games before this

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.140 
and what I noticed was games before this
I<00:05:22.620> mean<00:05:22.740> this<00:05:22.800> might<00:05:23.370> not<00:05:23.520> be<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.700> first<00:05:23.910> game

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
I mean this might not be the first game

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.570 
I mean this might not be the first game
that<00:05:24.180> I<00:05:24.300> ever<00:05:24.360> did<00:05:24.570> this<00:05:24.690> but<00:05:25.280> it<00:05:26.280> was<00:05:26.460> the

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
that I ever did this but it was the

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.160 
that I ever did this but it was the
biggest<00:05:26.730> game<00:05:27.090> that<00:05:27.270> I<00:05:27.330> had<00:05:27.540> played<00:05:27.810> that<00:05:27.990> had

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
biggest game that I had played that had

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.710 
biggest game that I had played that had
bad<00:05:28.350> done<00:05:28.650> this<00:05:28.940> where<00:05:29.940> you<00:05:30.450> plan<00:05:30.690> a

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
starts getting latency problems they

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.520 
starts getting latency problems they
start<00:05:35.460> timing<00:05:36.210> out<00:05:36.450> or<00:05:36.690> whatever<00:05:36.960> the<00:05:37.350> whole

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
gonna have if you're going to implement

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.840 
gonna have if you're going to implement
something<00:06:19.920> like<00:06:20.100> this<00:06:20.520> with<00:06:21.450> in<00:06:21.600> diablo<00:06:21.990> 3<00:06:22.350> i

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
something like this with in diablo 3 i

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.030 
something like this with in diablo 3 i
thought<00:06:23.850> it<00:06:24.030> would<00:06:24.390> be<00:06:24.540> really<00:06:24.810> annoying<00:06:25.320> for

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
thought it would be really annoying for

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.879 
thought it would be really annoying for
you<00:06:26.430> know<00:06:26.520> like<00:06:26.700> the<00:06:26.790> normal<00:06:27.030> game

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:27.889 
you know like the normal game

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:31.929 
you know like the normal game
and<00:06:27.979> arena<00:06:29.229> but<00:06:30.229> when<00:06:30.800> it<00:06:30.889> comes<00:06:31.129> to<00:06:31.430> the

00:06:31.929 --> 00:06:31.939 
and arena but when it comes to the

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:33.640 
and arena but when it comes to the
hardcore<00:06:32.479> mode<00:06:32.719> I<00:06:33.050> think<00:06:33.349> it<00:06:33.469> could<00:06:33.620> really

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
hardcore mode I think it could really

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.540 
hardcore mode I think it could really
add<00:06:34.129> like<00:06:34.610> a<00:06:34.639> nice<00:06:35.139> way<00:06:36.139> to<00:06:36.169> sort<00:06:36.919> of<00:06:37.039> stop<00:06:37.520> the

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
add like a nice way to sort of stop the

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.399 
add like a nice way to sort of stop the
technical<00:06:38.360> problems<00:06:38.779> that<00:06:39.080> that<00:06:39.289> you

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:39.409 
technical problems that that you

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:41.290 
technical problems that that you
encounter<00:06:39.830> with<00:06:39.979> hardcore<00:06:40.219> where<00:06:40.639> your

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
encounter with hardcore where your

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.450 
encounter with hardcore where your
computer<00:06:41.659> would<00:06:41.870> shut<00:06:42.080> down<00:06:42.110> or<00:06:42.710> your<00:06:43.219> power

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:46.939 
control that would end up killing your

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.700

character it'd be nice to have something
like<00:06:48.830> this<00:06:48.979> in<00:06:49.400> place<00:06:50.240> so<00:06:50.569> that<00:06:50.599> the<00:06:50.870> game

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
like this in place so that the game

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.629 
like this in place so that the game
pauses<00:06:51.379> when<00:06:51.860> it<00:06:52.069> stopped<00:06:52.310> seeing<00:06:52.550> a
