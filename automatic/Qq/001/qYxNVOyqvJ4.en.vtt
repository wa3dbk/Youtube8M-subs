00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.960
 You're going to stay, this part is going to get there. 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.679
 It's going to be a difficult week here. 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.429
 it will get simpler and there are many 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.940
 children 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:17.200
 there is one that is not having a 4 there you 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.590

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:39.850
 so the beauty of the stops here a 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.959
 stack that should be a positive business 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.640
 Then you 'll fit in because that's how it is. 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.370
 know which positive for the negative 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.739
 There you will not have it here. 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.079
 Positive negative, you're going to fit in. 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.430
 so it's not just to see what's next. 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:03:00.370
 academic year 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:03.010

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.209
 to fit in 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.670
 we're going to make the following pay a wire 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.190
 black and box here I went but here 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:25.590
 ready is ready and that the control and 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.590
 I'll need a little something here 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:34.170
 Let me do it here, I got it. 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:36.700
 making love in usual business 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.650
 in a box here 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.790
 is to make a little pressure that is 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:49.019
 be able to fit right and ready to 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:53.519
 following the USB cable and control here 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:56.950
 You go there and on your pc or notebook do 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:00.310
 and it will fit the day 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.440
 hence guys 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.680
 this is not not working because 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.349
 This kid is a customer doing this. 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.660
 but I 'll try again because it leaves 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:22.030
 geek that is an axis try to listen to 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:28.229
 do not be very happy do not stress 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.229
 be the positive and the negative 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.040
 move from what you think it is 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.530
 The wrong side, but let me give you a 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.349
 adjusted in team and I'm sure 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:53.719
 I made a little puddle a little 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:05:00.189
 pressure so I guess now it will 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:05:00.189
 work as you have here behind 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.250

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.900
 break that we can fit 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.569
 Right, because we 're talking here. 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.530
 deconcentrate everything so let's give a 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.490

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.650
