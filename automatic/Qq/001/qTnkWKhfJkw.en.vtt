00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.490 

I<00:00:18.070> guess<00:00:18.789> we<00:00:19.000> didn't<00:00:19.240> need<00:00:19.270> to<00:00:19.840> do<00:00:20.199> that<00:00:20.230> I

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
I guess we didn't need to do that I

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.779 
I guess we didn't need to do that I
guess<00:00:20.710> we<00:00:20.859> can<00:00:21.039> just<00:00:21.070> do<00:00:21.369> it<00:00:21.490> from<00:00:21.670> that

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
guess we can just do it from that

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.999 
guess we can just do it from that

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
again what you must have wedged at least

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.880 
again what you must have wedged at least
that<00:00:31.570> is<00:00:31.599> a<00:00:31.840> big<00:00:32.500> number<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:35.110> could<00:00:35.379> only<00:00:35.530> have

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
that is a big number it could only have

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.920 
that is a big number it could only have
been<00:00:35.920> moved<00:00:36.339> by<00:00:36.640> a<00:00:36.670> super<00:00:37.150> powerful<00:00:37.480> human

five<00:00:42.820> six<00:00:43.269> wards<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.920> will<00:00:45.220> be<00:00:45.339> difficult<00:00:45.579> to

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
five six wards it will be difficult to

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000 
five six wards it will be difficult to
locate<00:00:46.239> because<00:00:46.989> it<00:00:47.260> looks<00:00:47.500> just<00:00:47.589> like<00:00:47.890> a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010

because<00:01:13.690> i'm<00:01:13.869> not<00:01:14.020> writing<00:01:14.229> video<00:01:14.860> stuff<00:01:15.220> I

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
because i'm not writing video stuff I

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.460 
because i'm not writing video stuff I
better<00:01:15.550> write<00:01:15.789> it<00:01:15.850> at<00:01:16.720> some<00:01:16.990> point<00:01:17.259> when<00:01:17.380> I'm

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
better write it at some point when I'm

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.020 
better write it at some point when I'm
doing<00:01:17.590> more<00:01:17.770> video<00:01:18.130> stuff<00:01:18.460> because<00:01:18.729> then<00:01:18.880> they

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
doing more video stuff because then they

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.999 
doing more video stuff because then they

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.170 
but if you're watching me from the start
I<00:01:30.540> guess<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.900> wouldn't<00:01:31.080> really<00:01:31.200> matter<00:01:31.350> but

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180
