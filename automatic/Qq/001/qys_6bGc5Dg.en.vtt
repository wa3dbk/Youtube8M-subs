the glove a little bit better so I'm

going<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.420> shout<00:00:24.600> out<00:00:24.720> where<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:24.930> pull<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
going to shout out where I pull the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.349 
going to shout out where I pull the
sound<00:00:25.619> there's<00:00:25.920> one<00:00:26.160> velcro<00:00:26.609> strap<00:00:26.880> here<00:00:27.210> and

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
sound there's one velcro strap here and

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.429 
sound there's one velcro strap here and
there's<00:00:28.080> also<00:00:28.230> smaller<00:00:28.890> one<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.400> here<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.439> you

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
there's also smaller one in here and you

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.010 
there's also smaller one in here and you
could<00:00:31.619> take<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.189> smaller<00:00:32.489> one<00:00:32.610> out<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.329> you

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
could take the smaller one out and you

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.110 
could take the smaller one out and you
know<00:00:34.140> drive<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.469> glove<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.370> put<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.000> on

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
know drive the glove and and put it on

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.580 
know drive the glove and and put it on
but<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.480> think<00:00:36.570> for<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> most<00:00:37.230> part<00:00:37.320> you're

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
but I think for the most part you're

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.990 
but I think for the most part you're
going<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.800> want<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.010> keep<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.399> here<00:00:38.640> because

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
going to want to keep this here because

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.100 
going to want to keep this here because
it's<00:00:39.120> going<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.360> be<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> little<00:00:39.600> bit<00:00:39.780> hard<00:00:39.960> to

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
it's going to be a little bit hard to

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.130 
it's going to be a little bit hard to
kinda<00:00:40.440> go<00:00:40.649> back<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.040> forth<00:00:41.219> with<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:42.020> one<00:00:43.020> of

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
kinda go back and forth with it one of

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.400 
kinda go back and forth with it one of
the<00:00:43.230> drawbacks<00:00:43.469> for<00:00:43.829> me<00:00:43.980> with<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.539> system

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the drawbacks for me with this system

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.049 
the drawbacks for me with this system
with<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.070> know<00:00:47.190> most<00:00:47.340> people<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:47.879> these

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
with that you know most people get these

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.299 
with that you know most people get these
gloves<00:00:48.500> you<00:00:49.500> know<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.829> fasten<00:00:50.219> them

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
gloves you know to fasten them

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.790 
gloves you know to fasten them
themselves<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.360> because<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.050> velcro

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
themselves but because of this velcro

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.170 
themselves but because of this velcro
strap<00:00:53.219> being<00:00:53.460> smaller

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
strap being smaller

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.479 
strap being smaller
it<00:00:54.390> sits<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.930> tighter<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:56.129> harder<00:00:56.460> to

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it sits on tighter and it's harder to

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.360 
it sits on tighter and it's harder to
get<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:56.789> hand<00:00:57.270> inside<00:00:58.010> because<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.129> have

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
get your hand inside because you have

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.069 
get your hand inside because you have
hand<00:01:00.000> wraps<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.390> especially<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.930> have

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
hand wraps on especially if you have

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.380 
hand wraps on especially if you have
another<00:01:01.350> glove<00:01:01.820> you're<00:01:02.820> trying<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.270> this

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
another glove you're trying to do this

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.729 
another glove you're trying to do this
yourself<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.899> could<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> little<00:01:04.530> bit<00:01:04.650> of

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
yourself that could be a little bit of

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.080 
yourself that could be a little bit of
nuisance<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.549> could<00:01:05.700> get<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> little

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
nuisance so it could get a little

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.429 
nuisance so it could get a little
annoying<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.630> not<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> deal-breaker<00:01:07.049> it

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
annoying but it's not a deal-breaker it

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.190 
annoying but it's not a deal-breaker it
does<00:01:07.619> offer<00:01:08.360> great<00:01:09.360> wrist<00:01:09.689> support<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.140> it

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
does offer great wrist support and it

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.080 
does offer great wrist support and it
does<00:01:10.409> stay<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.680> but<00:01:11.100> if<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.760> know<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:11.939> this

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
does stay on but if you know if this

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.120 
does stay on but if you know if this
thing<00:01:12.330> comes<00:01:12.510> loose<00:01:12.869> you'll<00:01:13.409> get<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.619> dangle

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
thing comes loose you'll get a dangle

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.090 
thing comes loose you'll get a dangle
regardless<00:01:15.170> getting<00:01:16.170> into<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> construction

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
regardless getting into the construction

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.370 
regardless getting into the construction
of<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> glove<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.759> well<00:01:17.939> as<00:01:18.090> very<00:01:19.460> well<00:01:20.460> me

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
of the glove as well as very well me

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.109 
of the glove as well as very well me
it's<00:01:22.380> up<00:01:22.560> there<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.830> quality<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.310> think<00:01:23.400> all

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
it's up there in quality I think all

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.570 
it's up there in quality I think all
other<00:01:24.540> construction<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.950> think<00:01:26.220> this

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
other construction it's I think this

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.190 
other construction it's I think this
love<00:01:26.759> makes<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> great<00:01:27.450> sparring<00:01:27.960> level

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
love makes for a great sparring level

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.950 
love makes for a great sparring level
it's<00:01:28.950> got<00:01:29.130> three<00:01:29.460> about<00:01:30.119> three<00:01:30.180> inches<00:01:30.750> of

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
it's got three about three inches of

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.740 
it's got three about three inches of
padding<00:01:31.619> here<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.400> mean<00:01:32.909> if<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.270> use<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.540> on<00:01:33.720> a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
padding here I mean if you use this on a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.310 
padding here I mean if you use this on a
bag

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
bag

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.899 
bag
I<00:01:34.350> think<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> padding<00:01:35.280> will<00:01:35.460> wear<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.820> a

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
I think the padding will wear in a

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.030 
I think the padding will wear in a
little<00:01:36.150> bit<00:01:36.329> but<00:01:36.720> overall<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.409> think<00:01:37.590> they're

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
little bit but overall I think they're

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.010 
little bit but overall I think they're
very<00:01:38.070> well<00:01:38.460> padded<00:01:38.700> what<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:39.600> about<00:01:39.810> it

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
very well padded what I like about it

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.560 
very well padded what I like about it
especially<00:01:40.110> if<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.650> hand<00:01:40.950> wraps<00:01:41.159> on

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
especially if you have hand wraps on

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.569 
especially if you have hand wraps on
this<00:01:42.570> area<00:01:43.259> kind<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.710> stick<00:01:43.950> will<00:01:44.130> stick<00:01:44.399> out<00:01:44.520> a

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
this area kind of stick will stick out a

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.999 
this area kind of stick will stick out a
little<00:01:44.670> bit<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.560> hand<00:01:46.560> wraps<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
little bit because of the hand wraps and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.370 
little bit because of the hand wraps and
the<00:01:47.220> thumb<00:01:47.460> area<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.119> pre-curved<00:01:48.689> making

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the thumb area here is pre-curved making

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.980 
the thumb area here is pre-curved making
it<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.740> more<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.100> natural<00:01:50.280> fist<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.840> can

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
it for more of a natural fist you can

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.359 
it for more of a natural fist you can
make<00:01:52.110> more<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.439> natural<00:01:52.590> fist<00:01:53.040> with<00:01:53.220> this

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
make more of a natural fist with this

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.600 
make more of a natural fist with this
glove<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.000> which<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.750> very<00:01:55.439> much<00:01:55.610> this

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
glove and which I like very much this

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.789 
glove and which I like very much this
padding<00:01:57.119> going<00:01:57.750> all<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.170> way<00:01:58.200> down<00:01:58.290> here<00:01:58.770> so

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
padding going all the way down here so

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.480 
padding going all the way down here so
it<00:01:59.100> makes<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.549> kind<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.469> a<00:02:01.469> little<00:02:01.950> harder<00:02:02.340> to

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
it makes you kind of a little harder to

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.889 
it makes you kind of a little harder to
open<00:02:02.579> up<00:02:02.820> your<00:02:02.939> palms<00:02:03.180> but<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.390> think<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.750> once

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
open up your palms but I think that once

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.240 
open up your palms but I think that once
you<00:02:03.930> break<00:02:04.200> them<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> little<00:02:04.829> bit<00:02:05.040> more

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
you break them in a little bit more

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.350 
you break them in a little bit more
it'll<00:02:05.579> be<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.790> lot<00:02:05.969> easier<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.509> glove<00:02:06.810> is

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
it'll be a lot easier this glove is

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.870 
it'll be a lot easier this glove is
not<00:02:08.140> for<00:02:08.320> medium<00:02:08.710> hands<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.370> works<00:02:09.670> for

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
not for medium hands it works for

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.400 
not for medium hands it works for
smaller<00:02:10.180> hands<00:02:10.420> as<00:02:10.570> well<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.050> for<00:02:11.260> large

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
smaller hands as well and for large

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.930 
smaller hands as well and for large
hands<00:02:11.680> but<00:02:11.890> I<00:02:11.920> think<00:02:12.160> that<00:02:12.310> after<00:02:12.580> some<00:02:12.760> use

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
hands but I think that after some use

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.030 
hands but I think that after some use
it's<00:02:13.450> going<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.750> break<00:02:13.960> in<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.500> get<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.860> little

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
it's going to break in and get a little

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.680 
it's going to break in and get a little
bit<00:02:15.250> more<00:02:15.430> wider<00:02:15.700> because<00:02:15.940> it's<00:02:16.210> leather<00:02:16.390> so

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
bit more wider because it's leather so

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.300 
bit more wider because it's leather so
it's<00:02:16.810> going<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:16.960> stretch<00:02:17.200> out<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:18.160> could

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
it's going to stretch out and it could

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.890 
it's going to stretch out and it could
be<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.460> plus<00:02:18.760> or<00:02:18.880> it<00:02:18.970> could<00:02:19.090> be<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.210> minus<00:02:19.570> depend

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
be a plus or it could be a minus depend

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.250 
be a plus or it could be a minus depend
upon<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.770> size<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:21.160> your<00:02:21.340> hands<00:02:22.230> overall<00:02:23.230> I

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
upon the size of your hands overall I

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.020 
upon the size of your hands overall I
think<00:02:23.440> this<00:02:23.710> glove<00:02:24.040> is<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.280> pretty<00:02:24.640> good<00:02:24.820> glove

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
think this glove is a pretty good glove

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.760 
think this glove is a pretty good glove
I<00:02:25.210> have<00:02:25.360> used<00:02:25.630> this<00:02:25.780> in<00:02:25.960> sparring<00:02:26.260> several

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
I have used this in sparring several

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.950 
I have used this in sparring several
times<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.760> gives<00:02:27.970> great<00:02:28.150> hand<00:02:28.540> protection

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
times and it gives great hand protection

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.420 
times and it gives great hand protection
you<00:02:29.230> could<00:02:29.350> also<00:02:29.470> use<00:02:29.710> this<00:02:29.830> on<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.040> bag<00:02:30.250> as

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
you could also use this on the bag as

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.400 
you could also use this on the bag as
well<00:02:30.580> as<00:02:30.760> some<00:02:30.910> pad<00:02:31.240> work<00:02:31.510> will<00:02:32.020> provide<00:02:32.200> a

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
well as some pad work will provide a

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.050 
well as some pad work will provide a
great<00:02:32.740> amount<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.070> cushion<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:33.670> great<00:02:33.820> amount

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
great amount of cushion and great amount

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.420 
great amount of cushion and great amount
of<00:02:34.120> hand<00:02:34.420> protection<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.740> wrist<00:02:35.950> support<00:02:36.280> is

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
of hand protection the wrist support is

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.540 
of hand protection the wrist support is
really<00:02:36.760> good<00:02:37.410> while<00:02:38.410> being<00:02:38.650> flexible<00:02:39.100> as<00:02:39.370> well

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
really good while being flexible as well

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.740 
really good while being flexible as well
it<00:02:40.150> can<00:02:40.300> make<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.480> really<00:02:40.720> good<00:02:40.990> fist<00:02:41.610> but

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
it can make a really good fist but

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.030 
it can make a really good fist but
another<00:02:43.750> drawback<00:02:44.050> that<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.440> noticed<00:02:44.890> was<00:02:45.010> that

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
another drawback that I noticed was that

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.390 
another drawback that I noticed was that
in<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.670> left<00:02:45.910> hand<00:02:46.210> side<00:02:46.330> glove<00:02:47.190> they<00:02:48.190> used

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
in the left hand side glove they used

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.850 
in the left hand side glove they used
the<00:02:49.030> inner<00:02:49.240> material<00:02:49.480> for<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.170> glove<00:02:50.410> which<00:02:50.710> I

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
the inner material for the glove which I

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.700 
the inner material for the glove which I
will<00:02:51.010> show<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.280> now<00:02:52.140> I'll<00:02:53.140> show<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.680> on

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
will show you now I'll show it to you on

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.760 
will show you now I'll show it to you on
the<00:02:53.860> right<00:02:54.040> hand<00:02:54.870> this<00:02:55.870> material<00:02:56.500> here

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
the right hand this material here

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.230 
the right hand this material here
hopefully<00:02:57.190> I'll<00:02:57.280> be<00:02:57.310> able<00:02:57.520> to<00:02:57.640> get<00:02:57.880> this<00:02:58.030> out

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
hopefully I'll be able to get this out

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.170 
hopefully I'll be able to get this out
easier<00:02:59.940> just<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:01.060> small<00:03:02.670> velcro

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
easier just a small velcro

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.370 
easier just a small velcro
okay<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.630> material<00:03:05.080> of<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.380> glove<00:03:05.590> here<00:03:07.380> it's

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
okay the material of the glove here it's

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.290 
okay the material of the glove here it's
a<00:03:08.650> little<00:03:08.890> scrunched<00:03:09.340> up<00:03:09.490> and<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:09.940> think<00:03:10.180> they

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
a little scrunched up and I think they

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.270 
a little scrunched up and I think they
overused<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:11.110> in<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.470> left<00:03:11.650> hand<00:03:11.770> glove<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.250> I

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
overused it in the left hand glove and I

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.440 
overused it in the left hand glove and I
guess<00:03:12.459> sometimes<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:13.030> sort<00:03:13.239> of<00:03:13.270> thing

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
guess sometimes that sort of thing

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.830 
guess sometimes that sort of thing
happens<00:03:14.220> where<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.640> materials<00:03:16.300> bunched<00:03:16.660> up

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
happens where the materials bunched up

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.350 
happens where the materials bunched up
making<00:03:17.350> it<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.530> little<00:03:17.650> bit<00:03:17.770> harder<00:03:18.340> for<00:03:18.520> you<00:03:19.120> to

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
making it a little bit harder for you to

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.240 
making it a little bit harder for you to
get<00:03:19.900> access<00:03:20.140> you<00:03:20.500> have<00:03:20.530> to<00:03:20.650> kind<00:03:20.890> of<00:03:20.950> fight

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
get access you have to kind of fight

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.890 
get access you have to kind of fight
through<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.580> material<00:03:22.060> to<00:03:22.209> fully<00:03:22.480> get<00:03:22.690> your

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
know it's not the best but it's not the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.949 
know it's not the best but it's not the
worst<00:04:18.579> by<00:04:18.850> far<00:04:18.880> I<00:04:19.180> think<00:04:19.329> this<00:04:19.600> is<00:04:19.690> a<00:04:19.720> pretty

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
worst by far I think this is a pretty

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.800 
worst by far I think this is a pretty
good<00:04:20.139> quality<00:04:20.530> go<00:04:20.650> overall<00:04:21.389> like<00:04:22.389> I<00:04:22.509> said<00:04:22.690> the

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
good quality go overall like I said the

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.960 
good quality go overall like I said the
leather<00:04:22.990> is<00:04:23.229> nice<00:04:23.560> and<00:04:23.830> soft<00:04:24.070> but<00:04:24.310> it's<00:04:24.639> not

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
leather is nice and soft but it's not

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.060 
leather is nice and soft but it's not
super<00:04:25.330> high<00:04:25.720> quality<00:04:26.289> leather<00:04:26.470> I<00:04:26.620> don't<00:04:26.860> think

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
super high quality leather I don't think

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.520 
super high quality leather I don't think
but<00:04:28.000> it's<00:04:28.120> also<00:04:28.300> not<00:04:28.599> the<00:04:28.870> worst<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.289> think

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
but it's also not the worst I think

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.960 
but it's also not the worst I think
