00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
first of all you're going to want to

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.230 
first of all you're going to want to
have<00:01:08.259> a<00:01:08.289> fast<00:01:08.680> enough<00:01:08.979> memory<00:01:09.310> card<00:01:09.550> typically

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
have a fast enough memory card typically

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.749 
have a fast enough memory card typically
memory<00:01:11.170> cards<00:01:11.470> are<00:01:11.590> have<00:01:11.920> different<00:01:12.130> speed

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
memory cards are have different speed

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.999 
memory cards are have different speed
settings<00:01:12.789> for<00:01:13.390> them<00:01:13.509> for<00:01:14.229> basic<00:01:14.649> use<00:01:14.830> you

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
settings for them for basic use you

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.469 
settings for them for basic use you
might<00:01:15.130> have<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.369> lower<00:01:15.550> end<00:01:15.789> cheaper<00:01:16.149> models

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
might have the lower end cheaper models

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.480 
might have the lower end cheaper models
but<00:01:17.140> for<00:01:17.320> shooting<00:01:17.560> video<00:01:17.860> you<00:01:17.950> need<00:01:18.250> to<00:01:18.340> have

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
but for shooting video you need to have

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.520 
but for shooting video you need to have
a<00:01:18.520> high<00:01:18.820> enough<00:01:19.030> speed<00:01:19.390> memory<00:01:19.600> card<00:01:19.960> so<00:01:20.500> that

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
a high enough speed memory card so that

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.160 
a high enough speed memory card so that
it<00:01:20.830> can<00:01:20.979> write<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.820> bitrate<00:01:22.270> of<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.810> video<00:01:23.080> to

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
it can write the bitrate of the video to

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.350 
it can write the bitrate of the video to
the<00:01:23.470> card<00:01:23.710> fast<00:01:24.340> enough<00:01:24.670> if<00:01:24.820> it's<00:01:24.970> too<00:01:25.149> slow

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
the card fast enough if it's too slow

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.999 
the card fast enough if it's too slow
you're<00:01:26.110> going<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.289> find<00:01:26.500> that<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.710> video<00:01:26.920> is

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
you're going to find that the video is

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.529 
you're going to find that the video is
going<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.190> cut<00:01:27.399> out<00:01:27.550> and<00:01:27.789> you're<00:01:28.390> going<00:01:28.509> to

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
going to cut out and you're going to

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.930 
going to cut out and you're going to
have<00:01:29.099> artifacting<00:01:30.099> and<00:01:30.250> it's<00:01:30.340> just<00:01:30.490> it's<00:01:30.759> not

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
have artifacting and it's just it's not

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.520 
have artifacting and it's just it's not
going<00:01:31.090> to<00:01:31.149> work<00:01:31.330> so<00:01:31.569> you<00:01:31.899> want<00:01:32.110> to<00:01:32.170> have<00:01:32.259> a<00:01:32.289> fast

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
enough memory card and you're going to

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.240 
enough memory card and you're going to
want<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.149> have<00:01:34.270> lots<00:01:34.509> of<00:01:34.690> memory<00:01:34.959> cards

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
want to have lots of memory cards

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.169 
want to have lots of memory cards
because<00:01:36.250> you're<00:01:36.399> going<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.580> find<00:01:36.789> that<00:01:37.000> you're

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
because you're going to find that you're

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:39.990 
because you're going to find that you're
at<00:01:37.390> 12<00:01:37.630> minutes<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:38.170> HD<00:01:38.920> video<00:01:39.069> is<00:01:39.490> equivalent

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
at 12 minutes of HD video is equivalent

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.969 
at 12 minutes of HD video is equivalent
of<00:01:40.090> 4<00:01:40.300> gig<00:01:40.569> and<00:01:41.560> if<00:01:41.649> you're<00:01:41.739> going<00:01:41.830> to<00:01:41.920> be

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
recording lots of time you're going to

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.100 
recording lots of time you're going to
burn<00:01:44.679> up<00:01:44.830> memory<00:01:45.130> fast<00:01:45.550> so<00:01:46.060> have<00:01:46.599> plenty<00:01:47.020> of

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
burn up memory fast so have plenty of

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.740 
burn up memory fast so have plenty of

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
memory cards have fast enough memory

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.109 
memory cards have fast enough memory
cards<00:01:50.050> and<00:01:50.950> then<00:01:51.069> of<00:01:51.310> course<00:01:51.640> that<00:01:52.000> would

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
is because on Canon batteries they have

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.390 
is because on Canon batteries they have
