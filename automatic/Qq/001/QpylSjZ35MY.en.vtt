00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
lose more than five or six times in a

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.259 
lose more than five or six times in a
row<00:02:33.680> should<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.830> win<00:02:35.010> on<00:02:35.099> a<00:02:35.190> bet<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:36.030> start

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
row should you win on a bet just start

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.020 
row should you win on a bet just start
over<00:02:36.569> from<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.870> beginning<00:02:37.610> this<00:02:38.610> trick<00:02:38.879> is

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
over from the beginning this trick is

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.580 
over from the beginning this trick is
highly<00:02:39.840> reliable<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.440> again<00:02:41.129> entirely<00:02:41.940> legal

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
highly reliable and again entirely legal

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.190 
highly reliable and again entirely legal
so<00:02:43.590> let's<00:02:43.769> repeat<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.390> place<00:02:45.390> 1<00:02:45.780> euro<00:02:45.930> in

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
so let's repeat this place 1 euro in
