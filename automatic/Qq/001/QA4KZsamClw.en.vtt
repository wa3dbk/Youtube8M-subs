00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.870
 the third moment is up to the spouse says that 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.330
 with beer goes great gym hi with 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.269
 you dynistor piy is a school of tourism 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.400
 most recently I told 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.890
 freeze-dried meat is now another 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.920
 meat product that just breaks 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.800
 imagination is shorter jerky in 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.050
 principle with dried meat tourists went 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.900
 Well, for a long time there had to 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.320
 see it yourself i will tell 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.120
 that several attempts to pour meat into 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.030
 my childhood failed there 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.190
 worms were got 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.950
 Probably as tomusido 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.190
 despite all the gauze in general deal is 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.410
 quite difficult here the manufacturer 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:55.949
 which actually makes meat for 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:58.440
 Supermarket checkout area made 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.039
 made it in a convenient package and made 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.600
 a large assortment of meat there 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:07.650
 horse meat beef lenin chicken in general 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.470
 do not take everything into account 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.950
 called earlier missouri convenience 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.290
 packaging and the amount of moisture in this meat 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.720
 allows you to use success in 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.630
 hike let's start with packing 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.570
 look she's so tight with it 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:30.110
 allows you to re- do and close 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:36.180
 flew inside 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:38.220
 and you can use the meat well, part 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.049
 so here is a piece of meat to get and all 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.590
 the rest is closed now as for 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.110
 the meat itself is such here 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.899
 dried slices as you can see the moisture in them 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.590
 there is no spouse pulls his paws 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.649
 to them their charm is as follows 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:59.640
 what can slice itself be like this 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.610
 straight piece so biting off now I'll 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.869
 talk with your mouth full pardon and can be 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:11.650
 throw this slice into porridge or soup 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:16.460
 there will be sodden but there will be porridge with 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.680
 along with the meat as for the price it is in 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.920
 Basically reasonable, I will not say that it is there 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.260
 complete freebie or something else, but 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.080
 recount to dry meat until if 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.200
 compare let's say there with stew or 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.550
 sausage then the price is quite reasonable 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.670
 here is a package there 50 thunder is worth a little 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.570
 more at retail 100 rubles that is for 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.390
 kilogram dried dry meat we 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.760
 we get a price of about 2000 well on my 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.970
 look here let it not scare you 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.760
 very reasonable because the shrinkage of such 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.240
 meat goes 3-4 times that is if you 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.250
 even just took a dry nice piece 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.850
 meat for 400 rubas 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.270
 they would have dried it 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.160
 there for the price well I would become for the price of 1600 a 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.210
 Here if still put up 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.470
 and well make it comfortable there guaranteed 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.990
 stored for a long time 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.200
 then in my opinion the price is there in 2000 for 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.330
 kilogram of meat is very reasonable list 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.550
 once again all the chips of this meat is this 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.310
 that you can just eat like that second 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.810
 moment convenient packaging third moment 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.050
 reasonable price 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.080
 well, and probably the fourth most important for 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.410
 hikes this small content in it 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.950
 moisture there almost any kind 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.959
 freeze-dried meat contains 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.600
 somewhere the same amount of moisture as 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.790
 Here in this Galina ball in general is very 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.970
 profitable by weight much there at times 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.040
 more profitable than stew all on this blitz 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.200
 Obzorchik tales about tasty meat 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.260
 finish because it's time to eat with 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.690
 you were a dynistor drink straight from a hike 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.510
 from the Crimea while Vasilisa is sleeping and her parents 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.130
 strangling meat until soon bye 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.130
 bon appetit by the way all 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:14.860
 finally took a picture and you can eat i 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.860
 it is direct here and so at a piece by the collector 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.500
 good going 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:29.790
 we are so salty 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.790
 just with food and drink is very good 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:34.989
 By the way, consider when preparing what 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:37.619
 salty enough for us less salt 

00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:37.619
 to help
