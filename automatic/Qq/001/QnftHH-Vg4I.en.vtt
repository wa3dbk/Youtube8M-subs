10 good Dave once if you thought of the
cool<00:00:38.070> man<00:00:38.370> oh<00:00:38.750> yeah<00:00:40.309> thing<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.610> all<00:00:42.210> that

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
cool man oh yeah thing is all that

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.200 
cool man oh yeah thing is all that
transpired<00:00:42.930> I<00:00:43.559> was<00:00:44.489> doing<00:00:44.760> such<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> good<00:00:45.149> job

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
transpired I was doing such a good job

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.209 
transpired I was doing such a good job
of<00:00:45.450> being<00:00:45.840> careful<00:00:46.320> about<00:00:46.500> my<00:00:46.680> jumps<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.190> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
of being careful about my jumps in the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.350 
of being careful about my jumps in the
last<00:00:47.489> one

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.960 

underwater<00:00:53.320> so<00:00:53.650> Mega<00:00:53.860> Man's<00:00:54.100> jumping<00:00:54.550> ability

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
underwater so Mega Man's jumping ability

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.940 
underwater so Mega Man's jumping ability
is<00:00:55.150> enhanced<00:00:55.960> when<00:00:56.080> I'm<00:00:56.200> breeze<00:00:56.410> under<00:00:56.770> there

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
is enhanced when I'm breeze under there

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.840 
is enhanced when I'm breeze under there
and<00:00:57.190> I<00:00:58.030> think<00:00:58.270> I<00:00:58.950> think<00:00:59.950> this<00:01:00.070> is<00:01:00.190> unusually

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
and I think I think this is unusually

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.850 
and I think I think this is unusually
good<00:01:01.030> water<00:01:01.330> jumping<00:01:01.780> even<00:01:02.050> for<00:01:02.260> mega<00:01:02.500> man<00:01:02.770> I

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
good water jumping even for mega man I

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.350 
good water jumping even for mega man I
don't<00:01:05.860> remember<00:01:05.980> maybe<00:01:06.670> he<00:01:06.940> could<00:01:07.150> get<00:01:07.330> back

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
don't remember maybe he could get back

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.420 
don't remember maybe he could get back
on<00:01:07.630> tight<00:01:10.320> truthfully<00:01:11.320> Mega<00:01:11.560> Man<00:01:11.770> 3<00:01:12.160> which<00:01:12.400> is

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
on tight truthfully Mega Man 3 which is

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.850 
on tight truthfully Mega Man 3 which is
the<00:01:12.640> last<00:01:12.850> one<00:01:13.030> I<00:01:13.060> played<00:01:13.300> a<00:01:13.330> bunch<00:01:13.860> doesn't

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
act doesn't have that much in terms of

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.430 
act doesn't have that much in terms of
crazy<00:01:17.650> underwater<00:01:18.190> seconds<00:01:18.729> there's<00:01:19.000> maybe

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
crazy underwater seconds there's maybe

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.219 
crazy underwater seconds there's maybe
there's<00:01:20.440> one<00:01:20.620> bit<00:01:20.800> in<00:01:20.920> gemini<00:01:21.310> man<00:01:21.520> in<00:01:21.640> stage

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
there's one bit in gemini man in stage

some of that invincibility says the look

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.550 
some of that invincibility says the look
of<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.330> flip-top<00:01:54.600> second<00:01:55.290> yeah

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
of a flip-top second yeah

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.880 
of a flip-top second yeah
I'll<00:01:58.369> take<00:01:58.579> it<00:01:59.320> wonder<00:02:00.320> if<00:02:00.350> I<00:02:00.470> can<00:02:00.530> get<00:02:00.710> more

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
I'll take it wonder if I can get more

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.010 
I'll take it wonder if I can get more
than<00:02:01.100> nine<00:02:01.280> lives

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
than nine lives

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.349 
than nine lives
they<00:02:03.590> have<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:03.770> zero<00:02:04.159> digit<00:02:04.520> there<00:02:04.549> but<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.090> don't

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
they have a zero digit there but I don't

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:11.500 
they have a zero digit there but I don't
think<00:02:05.450> you<00:02:05.600> can<00:02:10.330> sometimes<00:02:11.330> you'll

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
think you can sometimes you'll

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.240 
think you can sometimes you'll
accidentally<00:02:11.930> cross<00:02:12.230> back<00:02:12.500> over<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.980> squad

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
accidentally cross back over the squad

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.699 
accidentally cross back over the squad
point<00:02:13.550> from<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.819> enemy<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.440> bad<00:02:15.440> things

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
point from the enemy and bad things

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.470 
point from the enemy and bad things
happen<00:02:16.160> but<00:02:16.280> that's<00:02:16.430> more<00:02:16.580> of<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.760> megaman<00:02:17.180> 2

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
happen but that's more of a megaman 2

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:27.750 
happen but that's more of a megaman 2
issue<00:02:25.150> well<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.209> suppose<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.660> could<00:02:26.690> grab<00:02:27.049> it<00:02:27.080> I

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
issue well I suppose I could grab it I

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.339 
issue well I suppose I could grab it I
was<00:02:28.760> really<00:02:28.970> hard<00:02:29.299> for<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.599> would<00:02:29.900> take<00:02:30.080> a<00:02:30.110> hit

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
was really hard for I would take a hit

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.180 
was really hard for I would take a hit
grab<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.799> one<00:02:30.980> up<00:02:32.680> experience<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.799> benefit

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
grab the one up experience the benefit

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:41.530
