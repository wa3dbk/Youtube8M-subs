 600 g of cherries 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.160
 100 ml cherry juice

 a 10 gr 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.400
 and for the decor we'll need a few cherries 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.420
 I'll beat the eggs with a mixer 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.300
 I will add sugar 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.636
 and we will beat them until 

00:00:58.636 --> 00:00:59.760
 will double their volume 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.580
 and will open up 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.820
 I will add the lemon breed 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.480
 vanilla 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.340
 and I will add gradually from the oil until I finish it 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.660
 I will add flour 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.260
 I will scratch it 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.640
 in order not to clot 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.080
 I put the cherries in a bigger bowl and I will wallpaper them with flour 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.260
 put the mixture in the tray 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.080
 after which I will add the flour cherries 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.940
 I will use a tray 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.280
 with dimensions of 40/27 cm 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.920
 which I anointed with butter and I taped it with baking paper 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.600
 I'll put the tray in the pre-sintered oven at 180C for 20 minutes 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.960
 after which I will lower the oven temperature 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.760
 to 150 gr 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.176
 and I will leave the cake 

00:02:35.176 --> 00:02:37.001
 for another 10 minutes 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.880
 I will moisturize the gelatin with the cherry juice and I will mix very well 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.340
 I put a saucepan on the fire 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.580
 in which I put the cherries with the sugar 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.540
 and I will leave it until the sugar melts and gets to the boiling point 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.480
 I let the content cool down a bit 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.907
 he is still warm 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:10.929
 and now I'll incorporate gelatine 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.080
 I took the cake from the oven 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.500
 I let the cake cool for 10 minutes and now I'll put the jelly layer 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.640
 we will decorate the cherry cake 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.980
 we will let it cool 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.420
 after which it can be cut and served 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.760
