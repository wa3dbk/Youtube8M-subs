00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.970 
blushes if I can speak I was going to
get<00:02:16.400> one<00:02:16.700> of<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.290> mineralized<00:02:18.290> skin<00:02:18.530> finishes

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
get one of the mineralized skin finishes

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.730 
get one of the mineralized skin finishes
but<00:02:19.310> they<00:02:20.300> don't<00:02:20.569> appeal<00:02:20.959> to<00:02:20.990> me<00:02:21.230> these<00:02:21.440> ones

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
but they don't appeal to me these ones

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.490 
but they don't appeal to me these ones
they<00:02:21.950> look<00:02:22.160> really<00:02:22.520> messy<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.209> just<00:02:24.200> not<00:02:24.350> very

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
they look really messy and just not very

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.330 
they look really messy and just not very
nice<00:02:24.770> in<00:02:25.069> my<00:02:25.100> opinion<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:27.410> yeah<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.800> blush

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
nice in my opinion so yeah the blush

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.760 
nice in my opinion so yeah the blush
that<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.610> got<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:28.970> 14<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:33.260> looks<00:02:33.410> like<00:02:33.500> this

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
that I got is 14 and it looks like this

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.360 
that I got is 14 and it looks like this
and<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:34.850> really<00:02:35.090> is<00:02:35.330> different<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:36.020> other

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
and it really is different to other

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.500 
and it really is different to other
mineralized<00:02:37.370> blushes<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.180> I've<00:02:38.270> got

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
mineralized blushes that I've got

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.360 
mineralized blushes that I've got
because<00:02:38.810> there's<00:02:39.080> no<00:02:39.290> sparkle<00:02:39.980> in<00:02:40.070> it<00:02:40.190> really

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
because there's no sparkle in it really

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.690 
because there's no sparkle in it really
I<00:02:41.440> think<00:02:42.440> I've<00:02:42.560> got<00:02:42.590> quite<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:43.010> nice<00:02:43.220> one<00:02:43.489> here

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
I think I've got quite a nice one here

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.850 
I think I've got quite a nice one here
actually<00:02:44.110> because<00:02:45.110> we've<00:02:45.380> mineralized

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
actually because we've mineralized

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.600 
actually because we've mineralized
products<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.790> can<00:02:46.910> look<00:02:47.090> at<00:02:47.209> one<00:02:47.390> in<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:49.040> shop

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
products you can look at one in the shop

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.210 
products you can look at one in the shop
and<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.810> one<00:02:50.930> that<00:02:51.050> you<00:02:51.140> get<00:02:51.410> probably<00:02:52.010> going

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
and the one that you get probably going

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.330 
and the one that you get probably going
to<00:02:52.280> be<00:02:52.370> different<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.980> quite<00:02:54.980> like<00:02:55.130> this<00:02:55.280> one

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
to be different so I quite like this one

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.430 
to be different so I quite like this one
I'll<00:02:55.970> do<00:02:56.090> another<00:02:56.209> swatch<00:02:58.930> so<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.140> is<00:03:00.230> that

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
I'll do another swatch so that is that

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.500 
I'll do another swatch so that is that
color<00:03:03.280> it's<00:03:04.280> quite<00:03:04.489> nice<00:03:04.670> swatched<00:03:05.209> on<00:03:05.420> the

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
color it's quite nice swatched on the

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.310 
color it's quite nice swatched on the
skin<00:03:05.720> as<00:03:05.840> well<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.700> really<00:03:07.700> like<00:03:07.820> that<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.360> like

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
skin as well I really like that I like

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.110 
skin as well I really like that I like
the<00:03:09.440> fact<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:09.709> it's<00:03:09.830> got<00:03:09.980> just<00:03:10.580> a<00:03:10.760> tiny

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
the fact that it's got just a tiny

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.360 
the fact that it's got just a tiny
little<00:03:11.360> shimmer<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:12.140> it's<00:03:12.440> not<00:03:12.709> like<00:03:13.130> the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
little shimmer to it it's not like the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.759 
little shimmer to it it's not like the
chunks<00:03:13.850> of<00:03:14.030> glitter<00:03:14.360> like<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.470> other<00:03:15.620> ones

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
chunks of glitter like the other ones

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.009 
chunks of glitter like the other ones
have<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.250> love<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.360> chunks<00:03:17.600> of<00:03:17.690> litter<00:03:17.930> that

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
have I love the chunks of litter that

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.259 
have I love the chunks of litter that
are<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.470> other<00:03:18.590> ones<00:03:18.799> but<00:03:19.180> quite<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.209> few

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
are in the other ones but quite a few

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.580 
are in the other ones but quite a few
people<00:03:20.630> don't<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.860> I<00:03:21.950> really<00:03:22.190> like<00:03:22.370> that<00:03:22.549> and

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
people don't and I really like that and

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.569 
people don't and I really like that and
then<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.829> last<00:03:24.920> product<00:03:25.160> that<00:03:25.340> I<00:03:25.370> got
