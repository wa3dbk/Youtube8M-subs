pretty even so far there doesn't seems

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.070 
pretty even so far there doesn't seems

christian because he's representing me
at<00:03:27.870> first<00:03:28.170> i<00:03:28.319> thought<00:03:28.349> you<00:03:28.650> were<00:03:28.769> going<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.069> say

at first i thought you were going to say

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.330 
at first i thought you were going to say
it's<00:03:29.459> going<00:03:30.209> it's<00:03:30.599> look<00:03:30.840> easy<00:03:31.349> so<00:03:32.099> they<00:03:32.280> were

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
it's going it's look easy so they were

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.740 
it's going it's look easy so they were
saying<00:03:32.580> okay<00:03:32.700> then<00:03:33.150> you<00:03:33.269> could<00:03:33.450> have<00:03:33.540> play

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
saying okay then you could have play

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.710 
saying okay then you could have play
even<00:03:34.019> even<00:03:34.379> video

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.890 

so<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.560> first<00:03:40.250> stop<00:03:40.520> is<00:03:40.640> almost<00:03:40.880> over<00:03:41.300> I<00:03:41.480> want

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
so the first stop is almost over I want

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.680 
so the first stop is almost over I want
to<00:03:41.960> see<00:03:42.170> one<00:03:42.770> of<00:03:42.890> you<00:03:42.940> score<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.180> he's<00:03:44.360> one<00:03:44.600> of

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
to see one of you score and he's one of

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.100 
to see one of you score and he's one of
you<00:03:44.840> um<00:03:45.080> I<00:03:46.030> think<00:03:47.030> in<00:03:47.480> order<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:47.810> do<00:03:47.930> that

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
you um I think in order to do that

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.480 
you um I think in order to do that
without<00:03:48.530> someone<00:03:48.950> would<00:03:49.070> have<00:03:49.190> to<00:03:49.340> get<00:03:49.460> a

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
without someone would have to get a

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.510 
without someone would have to get a
little<00:03:49.640> bit<00:03:49.850> worst<00:03:50.090> of<00:03:50.240> the<00:03:50.330> game<00:03:50.800> or<00:03:51.800> someone

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
little bit worst of the game or someone

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.700 
little bit worst of the game or someone
