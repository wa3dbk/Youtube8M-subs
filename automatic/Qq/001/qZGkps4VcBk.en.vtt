00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
the web I saw everyone use aluminum like

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.250 
the web I saw everyone use aluminum like
some<00:00:29.849> kind<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.210> meadow<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:31.050> make<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.820> skis<00:00:33.260> but

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
some kind of meadow to make the skis but

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.280 
some kind of meadow to make the skis but
I<00:00:34.500> don't<00:00:34.800> know<00:00:34.920> where<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.309> idea<00:00:35.690> came<00:00:36.690> from<00:00:36.750> I

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
I don't know where the idea came from I

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.670 
I don't know where the idea came from I
use<00:00:38.100> Dollar<00:00:38.640> Tree<00:00:38.790> from<00:00:39.780> board<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.320> make<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
use Dollar Tree from board to make the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.389 
use Dollar Tree from board to make the
skis<00:00:42.020> because<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.170> live<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.739> Canada

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
skis because I live in Canada

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.910 
skis because I live in Canada
i<00:00:44.430> buy<00:00:44.820> these<00:00:45.210> foam<00:00:45.870> boards<00:00:46.289> from<00:00:46.530> Dollarama

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
i buy these foam boards from Dollarama

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.189 
i buy these foam boards from Dollarama
so<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:50.430> cut<00:00:51.329> out<00:00:51.360> around<00:00:52.699> 29<00:00:53.699> centimeters

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
so I just cut out around 29 centimeters

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.470 
so I just cut out around 29 centimeters
length<00:00:55.280> for<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> skis<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:58.910> around<00:00:59.910> seven

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
length for the skis and around seven

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.429 
length for the skis and around seven
point<00:01:00.690> five<00:01:00.960> centimeters<00:01:01.820> with<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.439> 2.5

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
point five centimeters with so 2.5

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.109 
point five centimeters with so 2.5
inches<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.689> let's<00:01:06.689> see<00:01:07.049> around<00:01:09.530> 12<00:01:10.530> inches

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
inches and let's see around 12 inches

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.520 
inches and let's see around 12 inches
further<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:14.030> around<00:01:15.030> 10<00:01:15.299> inches<00:01:15.600> 25

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
further and around 10 inches 25

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.289 
further and around 10 inches 25
centimeters<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.790> from<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> end<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.560> here<00:01:19.830> I

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
centimeters up from the end to here I

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.359 
centimeters up from the end to here I
cut<00:01:21.299> one<00:01:21.930> line<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:24.000> babble<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.369> bevel

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
cut one line and I babble it a bevel

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.160 
cut one line and I babble it a bevel
tiny<00:01:26.640> bit<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:28.140> do<00:01:28.340> it<00:01:29.340> three<00:01:30.180> times<00:01:30.210> one<00:01:30.930> at

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
tiny bit and I do it three times one at

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.240 
tiny bit and I do it three times one at
25<00:01:31.650> centimeter<00:01:32.130> by<00:01:32.430> twenty<00:01:32.970> five<00:01:33.920> point<00:01:34.920> five

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
25 centimeter by twenty five point five

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.410 
25 centimeter by twenty five point five
centimeters<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.180> wide<00:01:36.619> 26<00:01:37.640> centimeters<00:01:38.640> from

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
centimeters and wide 26 centimeters from

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.969 
centimeters and wide 26 centimeters from
the<00:01:40.520> bat<00:01:41.520> right<00:01:42.090> here<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.990> that's<00:01:45.990> how<00:01:46.950> I

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the bat right here so and that's how I

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.539 
the bat right here so and that's how I
make<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> curve<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.710> need<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:51.259> like

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
make a curve and we need to do is like

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.940 
make a curve and we need to do is like
it<00:01:53.549> doesn't<00:01:53.759> matter<00:01:54.060> what<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.509> use<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.560> used<00:01:55.860> to

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
it doesn't matter what you use I used to

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.069 
it doesn't matter what you use I used to
I<00:01:56.159> would<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.810> use<00:01:59.719> popsicle<00:02:00.719> sticks

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
I would you can just use popsicle sticks

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.539 
I would you can just use popsicle sticks
like<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.579> make<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.909> stronger<00:02:03.950> like<00:02:04.950> yeah

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
like to so make it stronger like yeah

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.490 
like to so make it stronger like yeah
that's<00:02:05.880> basically<00:02:06.060> yeah<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.659> just<00:02:07.110> drill<00:02:07.469> a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
that's basically yeah you just drill a

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
that's basically yeah you just drill a
hole<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.450> right<00:02:09.450> here<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.860> can<00:02:11.009> put

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
hole in it right here and so you can put

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.400 
hole in it right here and so you can put
the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.530 
the
landing<00:02:12.860> gear<00:02:13.040> strut<00:02:13.460> in<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:15.380> glue

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
landing gear strut in that and a glue

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.470 
landing gear strut in that and a glue
elastic<00:02:17.540> band<00:02:18.040> like<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.070> cut<00:02:19.460> it<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.790> measure

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
elastic band like I cut it and measure

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.330 
elastic band like I cut it and measure
you<00:02:21.290> don't<00:02:21.500> worry<00:02:21.620> need<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:22.010> measure<00:02:22.190> the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
you don't worry need to measure the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.140 
you don't worry need to measure the
length<00:02:22.790> just<00:02:23.780> like<00:02:24.050> approximate<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.100> I<00:02:25.880> drill

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
length just like approximate and I drill

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.320 
length just like approximate and I drill
a<00:02:26.180> hole<00:02:26.420> here<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.930> use<00:02:27.710> hot<00:02:27.980> glue<00:02:28.150> glue<00:02:29.150> it

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
a hole here and use hot glue glue it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.230 
a hole here and use hot glue glue it
right<00:02:30.170> here<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.730> that's<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:32.110> for<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.290> back

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
right here and that's it for the back

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.070 
right here and that's it for the back
ski<00:02:35.240> I<00:02:35.660> use<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.500> popsicle<00:02:37.070> stick<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:38.080> same

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
ski I use a popsicle stick and same

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.590 
ski I use a popsicle stick and same
thing<00:02:40.210> so<00:02:41.210> it's<00:02:41.480> around<00:02:42.640> 12<00:02:43.640> centimeters<00:02:44.330> from

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
thing so it's around 12 centimeters from

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.940 
thing so it's around 12 centimeters from
here<00:02:45.460> to<00:02:46.460> like<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.900> foam<00:02:48.110> board<00:02:48.350> it's<00:02:48.620> 12

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
here to like the foam board it's 12

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.040 
here to like the foam board it's 12
centimeters<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:51.280> from<00:02:52.280> here<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.850> here<00:02:53.150> it's

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
centimeters and from here to here it's

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.380 
centimeters and from here to here it's
nice<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.740> meters<00:02:55.160> like<00:02:55.880> cut<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:57.680> line<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.150> can

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
nice and meters like cut a line so I can

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.990 
nice and meters like cut a line so I can
bevel<00:02:59.870> it<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:01.270> did<00:03:02.270> it<00:03:02.420> at<00:03:03.490> nine<00:03:04.490> centimeter

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
bevel it I did it at nine centimeter

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.100 
bevel it I did it at nine centimeter
nine<00:03:05.330> point<00:03:05.540> five<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:06.080> ten<00:03:06.620> centimeters<00:03:08.110> and

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
nine point five and ten centimeters and

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.000 
nine point five and ten centimeters and
the<00:03:09.470> width<00:03:09.830> is<00:03:10.190> let's<00:03:11.060> see<00:03:11.300> I<00:03:11.600> think<00:03:11.740> 2.5<00:03:12.740> I

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
the width is let's see I think 2.5 I

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.450 
the width is let's see I think 2.5 I
mean<00:03:13.310> be<00:03:13.730> point<00:03:14.030> five<00:03:14.180> centimeter<00:03:15.100> and<00:03:16.100> I<00:03:16.220> just

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
mean be point five centimeter and I just
