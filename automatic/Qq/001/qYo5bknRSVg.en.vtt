00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
quite some time for foundation

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.789 
quite some time for foundation
application<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.870> really<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.500> how<00:01:04.680> it

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
application and I really like how it

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.950

know<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.500> little<00:01:07.619> bit<00:01:07.740> rough<00:01:08.070> that

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
know that it's a little bit rough that

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.120 
know that it's a little bit rough that
it<00:01:08.549> can<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:09.200> what<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.290> gets<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.560> foundation<00:01:11.040> on

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
it can be what it gets the foundation on

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.340 
it can be what it gets the foundation on
it<00:01:11.280> kind<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.909> separates<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.570> causes<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.140> be

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
it kind of separates and causes it to be

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.899 
it kind of separates and causes it to be
a<00:01:13.380> little<00:01:13.530> bit<00:01:13.680> rough<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.189> skin<00:01:14.490> which<00:01:14.760> if

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
a little bit rough on the skin which if

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.510 
a little bit rough on the skin which if
you<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.090> sensitive<00:01:15.630> skin<00:01:15.659> or<00:01:16.110> dry<00:01:16.920> skin<00:01:16.950> you

don't<00:01:17.700> want<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.090> happen<00:01:18.270> because<00:01:18.450> it'll

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
don't want that to happen because it'll

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.370 
don't want that to happen because it'll
cause<00:01:18.900> more<00:01:18.930> flaking<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.390> people<00:01:21.960> had<00:01:22.049> told<00:01:22.229> me

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.050 
that this was the replacement brush for
that<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:25.590> kept<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.250> thinking<00:01:26.729> about<00:01:26.820> it

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
that and I kept just thinking about it

and<00:01:27.150> thinking<00:01:27.330> about<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.689> didn't<00:01:28.049> want<00:01:28.229> to

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
and thinking about it I didn't want to

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.999 
and thinking about it I didn't want to
order<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.860> didn't<00:01:29.280> know<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.970> would

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
order it and I didn't know if I would

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.149 
order it and I didn't know if I would
replace<00:01:32.009> if<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.700> would<00:01:32.790> replace<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:33.540> so

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159

impressed<00:01:55.799> with<00:01:56.009> how<00:01:56.159> soft<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.540> very

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
impressed with how soft it is it is very

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.240 
impressed with how soft it is it is very
dense<00:01:58.200> very<00:01:58.619> similar<00:01:59.420> the<00:02:00.560> 518<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> little

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
dense very similar the 518 is a little

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.359 
dense very similar the 518 is a little
bit<00:02:02.369> more<00:02:02.759> soft<00:02:03.119> or<00:02:03.899> pliable<00:02:04.649> whereas<00:02:05.219> this

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
bit more soft or pliable whereas this

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.850 
bit more soft or pliable whereas this
new<00:02:05.579> one<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.880> little<00:02:06.060> bit<00:02:06.149> more<00:02:06.299> dense<00:02:06.649> it<00:02:07.649> is

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
new one is a little bit more dense it is

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.490 
new one is a little bit more dense it is
definitely<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.369> softer<00:02:09.239> brush<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:10.170> when<00:02:10.319> you're

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
definitely a softer brush so when you're

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.830 
definitely a softer brush so when you're
applying<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.849> definitely<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.330> softer

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
applying it is definitely a softer

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.820 
applying it is definitely a softer
feeling<00:02:13.230> burst

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
feeling burst

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.210 
feeling burst
it<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.160> not<00:02:14.370> quite<00:02:14.730> as<00:02:14.910> hokey<00:02:15.900> as<00:02:16.220> sometimes

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
it is not quite as hokey as sometimes

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.470 
it is not quite as hokey as sometimes
that's<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.730> only<00:02:17.850> word<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.030> can<00:02:18.150> think<00:02:18.210> up<00:02:18.450> to

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
that's the only word I can think up to

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.410 
that's the only word I can think up to
explain<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.080> 5:18<00:02:19.650> can<00:02:19.860> be<00:02:20.120> des<00:02:21.120> implied

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
explain it the 5:18 can be des implied

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.720 
explain it the 5:18 can be des implied
foundation<00:02:21.930> very<00:02:22.170> nicely<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:23.130> has<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> longer

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
foundation very nicely it has a longer

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.150 
foundation very nicely it has a longer
handle<00:02:24.180> as<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:25.020> see<00:02:25.200> but<00:02:25.440> in<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.830> silver

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
handle as you can see but in a silver

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.820 
handle as you can see but in a silver
ferrule<00:02:26.520> instead<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.270> all<00:02:27.390> one-piece<00:02:27.960> one

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
ferrule instead of the all one-piece one

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.110 
ferrule instead of the all one-piece one
here<00:02:29.220> but<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.210> do<00:02:30.620> think<00:02:31.620> that<00:02:32.010> after<00:02:32.280> kind<00:02:33.030> of

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
here but I do think that after kind of

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.550 
here but I do think that after kind of
going<00:02:33.330> back<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.510> forth<00:02:33.780> about<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.110> this<00:02:34.320> is

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
going back and forth about this this is

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.340 
going back and forth about this this is
a<00:02:34.590> very<00:02:35.070> good<00:02:35.400> dupe<00:02:35.790> for<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:36.990> also<00:02:37.200> a

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
a very good dupe for that it is also a

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.980 
a very good dupe for that it is also a
little<00:02:37.620> bit<00:02:37.710> softer<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:38.450> if<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.660> or<00:02:39.810> somebody

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
little bit softer so if you or somebody

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.960 
little bit softer so if you or somebody
that<00:02:40.290> felt<00:02:40.500> as<00:02:40.650> if<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.800> 518<00:02:41.340> was<00:02:41.460> just<00:02:41.640> too<00:02:41.790> rough

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
that felt as if a 518 was just too rough

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.940 
that felt as if a 518 was just too rough
on<00:02:42.150> your<00:02:42.300> skin<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:43.170> might<00:02:43.380> be<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> good<00:02:43.770> option

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
on your skin this might be a good option

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.350 
on your skin this might be a good option
for<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.400> or<00:02:44.640> if<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.760> just<00:02:44.970> didn't<00:02:45.180> like<00:02:45.300> the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
for you or if you just didn't like the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.000 
for you or if you just didn't like the
way<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:45.570> applied<00:02:45.960> then<00:02:46.230> stick<00:02:46.470> with<00:02:46.500> something

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
way it applied then stick with something

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.400 
way it applied then stick with something
a<00:02:47.220> little<00:02:47.580> bit<00:02:47.790> softer<00:02:48.120> like<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.360> said<00:02:48.600> for<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.810> 55

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
a little bit softer like I said for a 55

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.060 
a little bit softer like I said for a 55
airbrush<00:02:49.950> brush<00:02:50.310> or<00:02:50.520> something<00:02:50.670> like<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:52.070> so

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
airbrush brush or something like that so

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.320 
airbrush brush or something like that so
it<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:54.660> very<00:02:55.230> very<00:02:55.800> very<00:02:56.340> similar<00:02:56.790> brush<00:02:57.120> and

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
it is a very very very similar brush and

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.840 
it is a very very very similar brush and
I<00:02:57.390> will<00:02:57.570> post<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:58.050> link<00:02:58.080> on<00:02:58.440> my<00:02:58.470> blog<00:02:58.700> for<00:02:59.700> the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
to get a hold of it and we're

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.810 
to get a hold of it and we're
considering<00:03:08.100> this<00:03:08.220> one<00:03:08.400> but<00:03:08.550> you<00:03:08.640> weren't

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
considering this one but you weren't

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.970 
considering this one but you weren't
sure<00:03:09.060> if<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.270> was<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.570> same<00:03:09.750> it<00:03:10.230> does<00:03:10.590> end<00:03:10.890> up

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
sure if it was the same it does end up

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.650 
sure if it was the same it does end up
giving<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.490> same<00:03:11.730> end<00:03:11.970> result<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.510> is

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
giving you the same end result it is

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.570 
giving you the same end result it is
just<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.959> little<00:03:13.290> bit<00:03:13.440> more<00:03:13.680> dense<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.459> is

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
just a little bit more dense and it is

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.060 
just a little bit more dense and it is
just<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:14.970> little<00:03:15.270> bit<00:03:15.390> softer<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.500> hope<00:03:16.950> this

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
just a little bit softer so I hope this

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.410 
just a little bit softer so I hope this
