00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:12.290
 Look at the height of your computer display 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.290
 Now the screen is almost frontal 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.850
 My performance or height and of this much but is 160 centimeters'm kinda 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.400
 I 'm raising the screen 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:28.780
 It is about 10 centimeters so to 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:33.010
 Alternative when doing personal computer 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:38.230
 I'm going to look a little lower 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:41.030
 De' I'm erase this city and is screen 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.860
 I'm passing by now but I am normal 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.610
 And it is placed on a desk 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.530
 This little 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.810
 It becomes a form that turns up, but such an angle is normal 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.280
 When hitting a computer 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.070
 What are you seeing? 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.110
 It is the picture that is reflected later 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.400
 The fluorescent light of the ceiling is reflected 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.400
 In this state 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.610
 If you are using a computer 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.750
 In doing this state that TsuriKon fluorescent lamp is the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.840
 We are not doing much a personal computer 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.950
 For example, voice a 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.950
 Something and the root 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.400
 Eyes tired even Karato is not doing much at such a feeling 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.750
 So to look at 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.920
 Please have me fit 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.000
 At the height of my eyes 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:40.500
 I am fit to know a little doing this under 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.500
 If you get to do PC 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.520
 In the eyes doing this 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.510
 Try to determine the angle to see if does not contain properly it is Toka light of a fluorescent lamp and flame or Toka window 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:01.390
 Please give me 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:01.390
 It seems that there is irregular reflection of the light that I have had eye fatigue when I was using a PC .
