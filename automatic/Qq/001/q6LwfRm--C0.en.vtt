00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
recently and I thought that I would

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.260 
recently and I thought that I would
share<00:00:22.080> an<00:00:22.440> unboxing<00:00:24.350> flight<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:26.120> review<00:00:27.120> with

that I use for my iPhone and last but
not<00:00:49.500> least<00:00:50.210> we've<00:00:51.210> got<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.510> hot<00:00:51.870> air<00:00:52.079> balloon

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 
not least we've got the hot air balloon

not least we've got the hot air balloon
itself<00:00:52.860> which<00:00:53.220> is<00:00:53.399> essentially<00:00:54.920> coaxial

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.420 

all<00:03:06.660> right<00:03:06.960> so<00:03:07.290> now<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.770> got<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.160> see

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
all right so now that you got to see

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.990 
all right so now that you got to see
that<00:03:09.380> this<00:03:10.380> unique<00:03:10.830> flying<00:03:11.280> machine<00:03:11.730> in

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
that this unique flying machine in

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.660 
that this unique flying machine in
action<00:03:12.740> I'm<00:03:13.740> going<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:14.070> kind<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.310> do<00:03:14.460> a<00:03:14.490> little

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
action I'm going to kind of do a little

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.790 
action I'm going to kind of do a little
review<00:03:15.150> breakdown<00:03:15.750> it's<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.470> little<00:03:16.680> bit

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
review breakdown it's a little bit

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.900 
review breakdown it's a little bit
different<00:03:17.010> than<00:03:17.280> what<00:03:17.430> I've<00:03:17.520> done<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:17.820> the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
different than what I've done in the

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
different than what I've done in the
past<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:20.700> first<00:03:20.940> thing<00:03:21.150> you'll<00:03:21.300> notice<00:03:21.480> that

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
past the first thing you'll notice that

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.730 
past the first thing you'll notice that
this<00:03:22.140> says<00:03:22.710> is<00:03:23.330> it's<00:03:24.330> for<00:03:24.540> ages<00:03:25.130> 8<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.190> up

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
this says is it's for ages 8 and up

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.720 
this says is it's for ages 8 and up
now<00:03:29.810> I've<00:03:30.810> been<00:03:31.050> flying<00:03:31.320> RC<00:03:31.830> for<00:03:32.130> almost<00:03:32.400> three

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
now I've been flying RC for almost three

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.140 
now I've been flying RC for almost three
years<00:03:32.760> now<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.860> while<00:03:34.860> I<00:03:34.890> am<00:03:35.280> certainly<00:03:36.030> not

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
years now and while I am certainly not

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.050 
years now and while I am certainly not
someone<00:03:36.960> that<00:03:36.990> could<00:03:37.650> fly<00:03:38.130> in<00:03:38.190> competitions

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
someone that could fly in competitions

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.570 
someone that could fly in competitions
or<00:03:39.810> get<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.200> sponsorship<00:03:40.800> or<00:03:41.130> anything<00:03:41.340> like

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
or get a sponsorship or anything like

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.660 
or get a sponsorship or anything like
that<00:03:42.170> I'm<00:03:43.170> certainly<00:03:43.650> capable<00:03:43.890> of<00:03:44.310> keeping

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
that I'm certainly capable of keeping

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
that I'm certainly capable of keeping
something<00:03:44.880> in<00:03:45.210> the<00:03:45.360> air<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.780> doing<00:03:46.620> all<00:03:46.740> right

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
something in the air and doing all right

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.520 
something in the air and doing all right
with<00:03:48.690> this<00:03:50.180> it<00:03:51.180> looks<00:03:51.450> super<00:03:51.660> cool<00:03:52.050> when<00:03:52.350> it's

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
with this it looks super cool when it's

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.490 
with this it looks super cool when it's
it's<00:03:53.040> floating<00:03:53.490> there<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:54.810> I'm<00:03:54.930> spinning<00:03:55.230> it

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
it's floating there and I'm spinning it

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.830 
it's floating there and I'm spinning it
around<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.040> everything<00:03:56.430> but<00:03:57.330> it's<00:03:57.480> certainly

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
around and everything but it's certainly

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.830 
around and everything but it's certainly
a<00:03:57.930> challenge<00:03:58.500> now<00:03:58.830> it's<00:03:59.790> almost<00:04:00.090> like<00:04:00.510> it

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
a challenge now it's almost like it

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
a challenge now it's almost like it
would<00:04:00.990> be<00:04:01.020> flying<00:04:01.560> mode<00:04:02.160> 1<00:04:03.170> instead<00:04:04.170> of<00:04:04.230> mode<00:04:04.530> 2

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
would be flying mode 1 instead of mode 2

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.140 
would be flying mode 1 instead of mode 2
like<00:04:05.700> most<00:04:05.970> but<00:04:06.390> most<00:04:06.720> RC<00:04:07.590> stuff<00:04:07.920> is<00:04:08.190> in<00:04:08.820> North

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
like most but most RC stuff is in North

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.449 
like most but most RC stuff is in North
America

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
America

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:17.930 
America
the<00:04:11.459> other<00:04:11.670> thing<00:04:12.620> is<00:04:16.250> that<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:17.400> can't<00:04:17.640> really

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
the other thing is that you can't really

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.550 
the other thing is that you can't really
fly<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.299> outside<00:04:18.690> because<00:04:18.959> it's<00:04:19.230> got<00:04:19.440> the

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
fly it outside because it's got the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.750 
fly it outside because it's got the
infrared<00:04:21.710> definitely<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.800> positives<00:04:23.400> are

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
infrared definitely the positives are

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.040 
infrared definitely the positives are
the<00:04:24.180> light<00:04:25.430> little<00:04:26.430> lights<00:04:26.700> on<00:04:26.940> it<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.240> that's

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
the light little lights on it and that's

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.020 
the light little lights on it and that's
why<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:28.290> broke<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:28.920> down<00:04:28.950> into<00:04:29.520> two<00:04:29.730> different

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
why I broke it down into two different

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.140 
why I broke it down into two different
things<00:04:30.540> where<00:04:31.340> you<00:04:32.340> got<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.670> see<00:04:32.820> a<00:04:32.850> fly<00:04:33.120> a

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
things where you got to see a fly a

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.790 
things where you got to see a fly a
little<00:04:33.360> bit<00:04:33.600> with<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.840> light<00:04:34.050> on<00:04:34.290> in<00:04:34.560> the

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
little bit with the light on in the

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.420 
little bit with the light on in the
hallway<00:04:35.250> and<00:04:36.320> that's<00:04:37.320> why<00:04:37.530> I<00:04:37.560> backed<00:04:37.980> off<00:04:38.190> the

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
hallway and that's why I backed off the

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.350 
hallway and that's why I backed off the
light<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:42.140> that<00:04:43.140> way<00:04:43.260> you<00:04:43.350> could<00:04:43.500> see<00:04:44.360> how

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
light and that way you could see how

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.450 
light and that way you could see how
cool<00:04:45.570> it<00:04:45.630> looked<00:04:45.990> how<00:04:46.169> alien<00:04:46.830> it<00:04:47.040> looked<00:04:47.280> in

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
cool it looked how alien it looked in

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.430 
cool it looked how alien it looked in
the<00:04:47.580> sky<00:04:49.130> and<00:04:50.130> that's<00:04:50.910> really<00:04:51.360> about<00:04:51.630> it<00:04:52.110> I

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
the sky and that's really about it I

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.260
