00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.949
 teachers room to our good advice 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:28.439
 teacher listening for students 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:30.090

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.440
 a not handling you are not there either

 so and then you do not sell liters 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.379
 most important thing is getting enough sleep 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.450
 so you sleep then you prepare everything 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.850
 nicely placed in boxes 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.219
 so sleep is the most important malan 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.210
 the space yes i have a tip if you phase 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.800

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:57.780
 choose to sweetest song you can go 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:01:00.629

 the best can walk around 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.330
 my ideal typical move for half an hour 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.939
 per day in a sport that goes very far 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.470
 it makes no sense to have your texts 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.390
 read and reread 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.270
 keep this you have to prepare study 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.310
 does the among the 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.840
 use the 4 pieces for afterwards 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.000
 schematise and then have yourself 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.079
 continue to be really on the basis of you 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.479
 experience life and a photo every morning 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.759
 So I guess I half past six received 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.780
 At six o'clock we start studying the window 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.189

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.369

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.069

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:06.000
