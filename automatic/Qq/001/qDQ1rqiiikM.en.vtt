00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
feel like it's being close to a whole

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.400 
feel like it's being close to a whole
year<00:01:29.140> ago<00:01:29.429> which<00:01:30.429> is<00:01:30.459> crazy<00:01:31.179> because<00:01:31.630> I<00:01:32.140> feel

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
year ago which is crazy because I feel

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.719 
year ago which is crazy because I feel
like<00:01:32.440> this<00:01:32.709> set<00:01:32.890> you<00:01:33.009> know<00:01:33.130> just<00:01:33.310> came<00:01:33.520> out

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
reverse plasmas just because I've

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.780 
reverse plasmas just because I've
like<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.170> reverse<00:04:27.320> pattern<00:04:27.770> that<00:04:28.490> they<00:04:28.640> did

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790
