of course there's always the big
telephoto<00:00:13.980> lens<00:00:14.309> then<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.880> can<00:00:15.059> get<00:00:15.179> them

telephoto lens then you can get them

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.930 
telephoto lens then you can get them
stabilized<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.350> not<00:00:16.529> stabilized<00:00:17.160> my<00:00:17.670> advice

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
stabilized and not stabilized my advice

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.310 
stabilized and not stabilized my advice
would<00:00:18.150> be<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.300> if<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.690> can<00:00:18.810> find<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.140> lens

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
would be that if you can find a lens

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.230 
would be that if you can find a lens
that's<00:00:19.470> image<00:00:19.740> stabilized<00:00:20.340> I'd<00:00:20.880> spend<00:00:21.180> a

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
that's image stabilized I'd spend a

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.189 
that's image stabilized I'd spend a
little<00:00:21.359> extra<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.810> do<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.050> remember

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
little extra to do it remember

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.380 
little extra to do it remember
stabilization<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.160> technology<00:00:23.430> that

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
stabilization is that technology that

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.910 
stabilization is that technology that
allows<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.900> know<00:00:24.990> if<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.230> Zig<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.560> little<00:00:25.800> bit

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
allows you know if you Zig a little bit

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.890 
allows you know if you Zig a little bit
exacts<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.699> little<00:00:26.910> bit<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.630> gives<00:00:27.720> you

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
exacts a little bit so it gives you

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.380 
exacts a little bit so it gives you
sharper<00:00:28.560> pictures<00:00:28.920> at<00:00:29.099> lower<00:00:29.519> shutter<00:00:30.029> speeds

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
sharper pictures at lower shutter speeds

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.970 
sharper pictures at lower shutter speeds
that's<00:00:30.900> real<00:00:31.080> important<00:00:31.500> with<00:00:31.619> telephoto

that's real important with telephoto

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.139 
that's real important with telephoto
lenses<00:00:32.309> because<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.669> don't<00:00:32.820> have<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.969> lot<00:00:33.120> of
