little summary about each one and why i
like<00:00:11.070> it<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.340> why<00:00:11.429> i<00:00:11.460> use<00:00:11.670> it<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.870> first<00:00:13.080> gun

sponsored with a couple times so i love
it<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.279> game<00:00:23.430> i<00:00:23.490> love<00:00:23.760> using<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.060> heartbeat

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
it on this game i love using a heartbeat

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.620 
it on this game i love using a heartbeat
sensor<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.050> holographic<00:00:25.920> sight<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.640> think

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
sensor and the holographic sight I think

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.939 
sensor and the holographic sight I think
they're<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.779> best<00:00:27.960> attachments<00:00:28.560> for<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
they're the best attachments for the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.349 
they're the best attachments for the
holographic<00:00:29.310> sight<00:00:29.609> gives<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> little<00:00:30.240> bit

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
holographic sight gives you a little bit

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.080 
holographic sight gives you a little bit
more<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:31.199> looks<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.830> me<00:00:31.910> different<00:00:32.910> than<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
more it looks to me different than the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.060 
more it looks to me different than the
red<00:00:33.239> dot<00:00:33.480> but<00:00:33.870> still<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.469> seems<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:34.890> it's<00:00:35.040> a

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
red dot but still it seems like it's a

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.590 
red dot but still it seems like it's a
little<00:00:35.250> bigger<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.120> heartbeat<00:00:36.420> sensor

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
little bigger and the heartbeat sensor

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.510 
little bigger and the heartbeat sensor
is<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.020> course<00:00:37.200> pretty<00:00:37.800> much<00:00:37.829> like<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> constant

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
is of course pretty much like a constant

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.270 
is of course pretty much like a constant
UAV<00:00:39.079> the<00:00:40.079> only<00:00:40.230> other<00:00:40.379> attachments<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.190> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
UAV the only other attachments that I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.860 
UAV the only other attachments that I
use<00:00:41.489> with<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.790> until<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.969> get<00:00:42.149> each<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.420> these<00:00:42.540> is

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
use with it until I get each of these is

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.590 
use with it until I get each of these is
a<00:00:42.899> silencer<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.219> red<00:00:44.370> dot<00:00:44.550> sight<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
a silencer and the red dot sight in the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.090 
a silencer and the red dot sight in the
only<00:00:45.750> reason<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.020> use<00:00:46.050> those<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.649> cause<00:00:46.829> both<00:00:47.070> of

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
only reason I use those is cause both of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.799 
only reason I use those is cause both of
them<00:00:47.280> end<00:00:47.489> up<00:00:47.579> getting<00:00:47.820> me<00:00:47.879> my<00:00:48.030> hollow<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.629> my

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
them end up getting me my hollow and my

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.650 
them end up getting me my hollow and my
heart<00:00:49.050> beat<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.789> all<00:00:51.000> four<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.329> those<00:00:51.449> are

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
heart beat so but all four of those are

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.660 
heart beat so but all four of those are
really<00:00:51.809> good<00:00:51.899> any<00:00:52.500> attachments<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> m16

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
really good any attachments on the m16

only because i don't have to worry about
my<00:01:01.020> attachments<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.609> m16s<00:01:03.180> awesome<00:01:03.960> weapon

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
my attachments the m16s awesome weapon

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.950 
my attachments the m16s awesome weapon
very<00:01:04.619> good<00:01:04.830> accuracy<00:01:05.280> long<00:01:05.700> range<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.510> medium

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
very good accuracy long range and medium

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.980 
very good accuracy long range and medium
range<00:01:07.250> I<00:01:08.250> wouldn't<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.360> pretty<00:01:09.689> good<00:01:09.840> from

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
range I wouldn't it's pretty good from

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.890 
range I wouldn't it's pretty good from
the<00:01:10.140> hip<00:01:10.260> up<00:01:10.439> close<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:11.130> always<00:01:11.400> consistent

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
the hip up close not always consistent

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.960 
the hip up close not always consistent
so<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.830> an<00:01:13.920> assault<00:01:14.250> rifle<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.850> to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
so because it's an assault rifle and to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.580 
so because it's an assault rifle and to
me<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.210> almost<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> sniper<00:01:15.960> now<00:01:16.500> we're

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
me it's almost like a sniper now we're

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.620 
me it's almost like a sniper now we're
going<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.770> check<00:01:16.890> out<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.130> scar-h<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:18.360> scar-h

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
going to check out the scar-h the scar-h

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.420 
going to check out the scar-h the scar-h
is<00:01:18.990> one<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.350> few<00:01:19.560> weapons<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.310> get

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
is one of the few weapons that you get

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.039 
is one of the few weapons that you get
to<00:01:20.520> start<00:01:20.700> off<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:21.090> its<00:01:21.299> really<00:01:21.509> good<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.930> my

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
to start off with its really good in my

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.399 
to start off with its really good in my
opinion<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:23.640> fire<00:01:23.909> rate<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.299> kind<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.810> low<00:01:25.080> but

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
opinion the fire rate is kind of low but

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.590 
opinion the fire rate is kind of low but
it<00:01:25.500> makes<00:01:25.680> up<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.430> its<00:01:26.610> accuracy<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
it makes up for it in its accuracy and

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.740 
it makes up for it in its accuracy and
it's<00:01:27.840> damaged<00:01:28.549> so<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> definitely<00:01:30.060> use<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
it's damaged so I definitely use the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.960 
it's damaged so I definitely use the
scar<00:01:31.049> as<00:01:31.560> soon<00:01:31.799> as<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.979> start<00:01:32.340> I've<00:01:32.549> tried<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
scar as soon as I start I've tried the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.390 
scar as soon as I start I've tried the
m4a1<00:01:33.600> I've<00:01:33.780> tried<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> famous<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.650> me<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
m4a1 I've tried the famous to me the
