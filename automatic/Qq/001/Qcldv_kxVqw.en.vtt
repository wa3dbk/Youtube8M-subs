00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
started in sneakers in general just

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.090 
started in sneakers in general just
trying<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> collect<00:01:10.409> him<00:01:10.560> at<00:01:10.619> least<00:01:10.770> trying<00:01:11.040> to

hell<00:01:18.720> not<00:01:19.140> one<00:01:19.560> shoe<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.770> every<00:01:19.920> color<00:01:20.070> one

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
hell not one shoe in every color one

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.460 
hell not one shoe in every color one
shoe<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.880> every<00:01:21.119> numeric<00:01:21.570> series<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.439> you

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
shoe of every numeric series but you

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.749 
shoe of every numeric series but you
would<00:01:22.680> every<00:01:22.860> color<00:01:23.070> would<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.430> ludicrous

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
would every color would be ludicrous

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.190 
would every color would be ludicrous
because<00:01:24.150> there's<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.390> many<00:01:24.479> different<00:01:25.140> ones

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
because there's so many different ones

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.289

I<00:02:13.739> guess<00:02:14.069> first<00:02:14.280> these<00:02:14.879> ones<00:02:15.060> are<00:02:15.150> up<00:02:15.359> first

I guess first these ones are up first

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.410 
I guess first these ones are up first
because<00:02:16.379> they're<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:17.159> closest<00:02:17.730> but<00:02:18.239> these

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
because they're the closest but these

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.110 
because they're the closest but these
ones<00:02:18.599> are<00:02:18.750> called<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.170> LeBron<00:02:19.829> 25<00:02:20.489> fives<00:02:20.849> and

just<00:02:31.769> from<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> traction<00:02:32.489> on<00:02:32.579> these<00:02:32.700> things

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
just from the traction on these things

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.179 
just from the traction on these things
it<00:02:33.060> looks<00:02:33.090> like<00:02:33.389> these<00:02:33.510> are<00:02:33.569> an<00:02:33.810> outdoor

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189

basketball shoe you know LeBron has
multiple<00:02:38.189> lines<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.639> this<00:02:38.730> was<00:02:38.909> like<00:02:39.120> one<00:02:39.329> of

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
multiple lines and this was like one of

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.000 
multiple lines and this was like one of
the<00:02:39.480> first<00:02:39.629> ones<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:39.930> thought<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.469> kind<00:02:40.889> of

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
the first ones I thought that kind of

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.530 
the first ones I thought that kind of
segregated<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.639> lines<00:02:41.849> it<00:02:42.060> wasn't<00:02:42.329> one<00:02:42.510> of

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
segregated the lines it wasn't one of

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.330 
segregated the lines it wasn't one of
the<00:02:42.750> signature<00:02:43.230> ones<00:02:43.439> came<00:02:43.920> out<00:02:44.069> around<00:02:44.250> the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
the signature ones came out around the

generation LeBrons and you can see has

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.569 
generation LeBrons and you can see has
11<00:03:57.599> 523<00:03:58.349> that's<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.620> first<00:03:58.859> day<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.310> he

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
11 523 that's the first day that he

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.610 
11 523 that's the first day that he
played<00:03:59.819> a<00:04:00.030> game<00:04:00.540> in<00:04:00.659> the<00:04:00.750> NBA

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
played a game in the NBA

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.439 
played a game in the NBA
it<00:04:02.159> was<00:04:02.280> those<00:04:02.430> first<00:04:02.579> game<00:04:02.819> I<00:04:02.849> think<00:04:03.180> that's

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
it was those first game I think that's

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.479 
it was those first game I think that's
what<00:04:03.569> they<00:04:03.629> call<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.870> first<00:04:03.959> games<00:04:04.229> but<00:04:05.129> it

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
what they call the first games but it

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.009 
what they call the first games but it
was<00:04:05.609> a<00:04:05.639> very<00:04:05.790> first<00:04:06.090> signature<00:04:06.449> shoe<00:04:06.689> that<00:04:06.870> he

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
was a very first signature shoe that he

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.020 
was a very first signature shoe that he
had<00:04:07.199> and<00:04:07.470> actually<00:04:08.159> on<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.340> box<00:04:08.519> it<00:04:08.729> doesn't<00:04:08.970> I

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
had and actually on the box it doesn't I

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.309 
had and actually on the box it doesn't I
wish<00:04:09.180> I<00:04:09.269> could<00:04:09.419> find<00:04:09.599> the<00:04:09.750> damn<00:04:09.870> box<00:04:10.079> no<00:04:10.290> I

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
wish I could find the damn box no I

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.960 
wish I could find the damn box no I
think<00:04:10.470> it's<00:04:10.680> buried<00:04:11.009> down<00:04:11.129> in<00:04:11.189> here<00:04:11.519> is<00:04:11.879> the

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
think it's buried down in here is the

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.360 
think it's buried down in here is the
very<00:04:12.150> first<00:04:12.359> pair<00:04:13.049> of<00:04:13.620> LeBrons<00:04:13.919> but<00:04:14.159> it

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
very first pair of LeBrons but it

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.559 
very first pair of LeBrons but it
doesn't<00:04:14.639> it<00:04:14.759> didn't<00:04:14.939> actually<00:04:15.030> have<00:04:15.269> LeBrons

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
doesn't it didn't actually have LeBrons

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.039 
doesn't it didn't actually have LeBrons
