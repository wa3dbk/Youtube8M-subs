00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.690
 third generation of toyota rav4 and a 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.130
 completely new project capable of 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.019
 relaunch a model that has already had 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.280
 an extraordinary success 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.410
 the DNA is that of the previous one 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.809
 version but the bodywork has changed 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.180
 the headlights are smaller the sides are 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:24.750
 more muscular and the rear pillar is 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:27.210
 more marked the new rav4 has become 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.279
 even bigger not too much though how much 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.289
 enough anyway to make space 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.210
 to the cockpit without it will do 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.809
 become too bulky and less 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.210
 manageable 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.989
 the lucky Japanese saga is 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.969
 elongated about 15 centimeters but 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.460
 above all it has become wider now 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.950
 which hosted behind the vote 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.500
 more comfortable less significant the increase 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.910
 load capacity of the boot 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.180
 who kept more or less the same 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.079
 size of the previous version 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.059
 taking advantage of the possibility of 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.109
 slide back seat approx 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.879
 16 centimeters 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.530
 the loading volume flush with the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.690
 hatbox was measured in ours 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.570
 testing center with the ball technique 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.390
 from standstill in about 500 li more or less the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.010
 same capacity as the old office in 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.260
 However, in case of need it is possible 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.970
 knock down the rear seats by getting 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.850
 a large loading floor and a volume 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.850
 maximum 1469 start 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.700
 just pull the two big legs on 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.480
 sides of the trunk 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.160
 first one and then the other to break down 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.170
 the rear seatbacks to have so 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.480
 a practically perfect load plan 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.270
 without having to lift the seat or remove 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:42.370
 the headrests an easy maneuver 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.570
 very fast and above all not automatic 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.430
 the choice is a novelty instead 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.980
 probably imposed by the anchorage 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.180
 outside of the heavy spare wheel of 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.640
 have a hinged door 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.880
 the old man had it laterally 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.880
 template 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.240
 no problem if there is so much around 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.100
 space but if you have to move in 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.470
 restricted areas to load and unload 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.840
 bulky size objects can 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.210
 become an inconvenience to eliminate the 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.600
 uneasiness perhaps it would have been enough to foresee 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.250
 an eye with a separate opening one 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.560
 nice comfort and the key instead 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.690
 electronics inserted in the remote control 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.730
 just keep it in your pocket to unlock 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.910
 the locks and start the engine with a 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.910
 finger 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.320
 as soon as it has taken place one feels immediately 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.180
 really comfortable easy to adjust the 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.830
 immediate driving position 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.660
 identification of the main commands 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.110
 of the piece the display of the navigator 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.110
 satellite 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.260
 it takes a few kilometers to 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.230
 realize that the new engine 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.780
 2.2 and 136 horsepower turbodiesel e 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.340
 particularly brilliant injection of 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.230
 power obviously improved 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.910
 performance but it is above all the 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.960
 Operating pleasantness to 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.740
 to emerge 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.240
 available below rather 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.460
 exuberant when you sink your foot 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.870
 on the accelerator the place four 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.060
 cylinders with variable geometry turbo 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.160
 has the only limit to raise a little too much 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.200
 the tone of the voice but never 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.020
 really annoy and direct it 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.330
 electrically assisted steering 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.460
 less sporty the 6-speed gearbox subject 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:19.110
 some resistance in use fast but 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.820
 always pleasing it follows 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.680
 nice road behavior but 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.390
 especially reliable favored by a 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.190
 permanent all-wheel drive system 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.990
 which distributes the couple on the four 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.970
 wheels depending on the type of bottom 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.420
 through a central location to of 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.420
 stimuli 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.270
 with optimal adhesion the traction is 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.040
 all concentrated in front comes 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.140
 automatically transferred also behind 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.820
 up to a maximum of 45 percent 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.500
 when you need to have the maximum 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.680
 traction on all four wheels 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.900
 for example that on a dirt road the wheels 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.870
 in front they start skating the couple 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.520
 traces of silencing progressively come 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.500
 on the most difficult terrain in off-road vehicles 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.180
 by pressing a button on the dashboard yes 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.190
 can take advantage of the pressure block 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.040
 central for maximum traction 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.230
 it is evident however that the rav4 does not have one 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.580
 off-road vocation and neither is it 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.640
 equipped to face steps 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:25.840
 too demanding among others of one 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.840
 not even the masses return 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.669
 however, it has a lot of device 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.009
 useful that allows you to restart 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.410
 smoothly uphill and take to 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.330
 put the brake on for a few seconds 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.100
 ram 4 does not retreat even after you are 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.820
 removed the foot from the pedal to switch to 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.820
 that of the accelerator 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.070
 the most important innovation however 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.970
 concerns road behavior 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.050
 managing in an integrated way e 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.360
 the insertion of the four wheels 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.650
 driving stability control e 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.750
 electric power steering 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.699
 Japanese technicians have succeeded in 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.280
 secure the new ara 4 a 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.280
 sincere behavior without surprises 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.160
 on the bottom like this where the wheels 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.300
 they have different grips on both sides 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.730
 any other car engaged in 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.580
 braking or accelerating would have the 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.620
 trend overwhelms the integrated system 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.110
 toyota instead detects the skid and 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.940
 intervenes to counter it by acting on 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.010
 engine power on the distribution 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.020
 of the torque between the two axes and the four 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.110
 wheels also through the control of 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.980
 stability is not only favored as well 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.910
 the necessary correction with the joke 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.470
 particular in the case of a decided one 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.030
 crush of the tail 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.190
 in addition to the transfer of the couple to the 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.810
 front end to contain the phenomenon here 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.970
 don't even apply more to a servant 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.830
 assistance to help the driver to 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.520
 import an effect count angle 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.520
 correct 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.650
 this sort of autopilot ready 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.510
 to intervene in the most situations 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.940
 sad that makes driving already rather 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.940
 pleasure also very very safe 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.260
 we conclude with the main ones 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.990
 performance the new relationship with the turbo 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.010
 diesel from 136 horses enter the black a 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.860
 100 kilometers per hour 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:38.530
 the only second meters resumes from 70 to 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.780
 120 per hour in just over 15 and runs 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.000
 on average no less than 13 km with a 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.660
 liter of diesel therefore deserves the 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.660
 top marks 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:53.569
 therefore raf 4 has grown under everyone 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.590
 the points of view including the price 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:56.990
 obviously but less than expected 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.550
 considering the richness of content e 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.110
 then we remove it with conviction 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:04.900
 this check the basic version 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.900
 of attack costs about 28 thousand euros
