admirable<00:01:32.880> how<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.390> portrays<00:01:33.840> games<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.439> a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
admirable how it portrays games in a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950 
admirable how it portrays games in a
positive<00:01:35.100> was<00:01:35.369> still<00:01:35.640> realistic<00:01:36.390> light<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
positive was still realistic light and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.810 
positive was still realistic light and
that<00:01:37.439> sometimes<00:01:37.680> they<00:01:38.130> are<00:01:38.250> not<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.610> real

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
that sometimes they are not the real

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.420 
that sometimes they are not the real
enemy<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.900> world<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> small

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
enemy in this world just the small

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.789 
enemy in this world just the small
details<00:01:41.970> such<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.299> her<00:01:42.570> copying<00:01:43.049> artwork<00:01:43.590> from

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
details such as her copying artwork from

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.859 
details such as her copying artwork from
a<00:01:43.979> gaming<00:01:44.399> manual<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.270> there<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.600> was<00:01:45.720> just

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
a gaming manual but there it was just

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.510 
a gaming manual but there it was just
something<00:01:46.020> what<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.229> used<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.799> do<00:01:46.920> all<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> time

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
something what I used to do all the time

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.330 
something what I used to do all the time
or<00:01:47.820> showing<00:01:48.390> how<00:01:48.689> she<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:49.229> do<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.799> math<00:01:50.009> work

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
or showing how she can do the math work

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.910 
or showing how she can do the math work
so<00:01:50.850> she<00:01:50.909> isn't<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.479> dumb<00:01:51.720> child<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.500> only<00:01:52.710> when

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
so she isn't a dumb child it's only when

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.740 
so she isn't a dumb child it's only when
she<00:01:53.070> has<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.310> terrible<00:01:53.820> broken<00:01:54.540> home

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
she has the terrible broken home

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.929 
she has the terrible broken home
background<00:01:55.350> noise<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:56.130> she<00:01:56.280> starts<00:01:56.640> getting

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
background noise that she starts getting

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.749 
background noise that she starts getting
stuff<00:01:57.240> wrong<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.869> also<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> end<00:01:58.979> she

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
stuff wrong and also in the end she

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.719 
stuff wrong and also in the end she
really<00:02:00.119> doesn't<00:02:00.479> win<00:02:00.930> okay<00:02:01.409> she<00:02:01.560> kind<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.399> does
