00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
in this video I'm going to show you

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.390 
in this video I'm going to show you
three<00:00:09.690> moves<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.320> can<00:00:10.500> learn<00:00:10.650> pretty<00:00:10.980> quickly

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
three moves you can learn pretty quickly

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.280 
three moves you can learn pretty quickly
so<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:12.179> don't<00:00:12.269> have<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.719> stand<00:00:13.019> around

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
so you don't have to stand around

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.230 
so you don't have to stand around
looking<00:00:13.769> like<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.309> don't<00:00:14.490> know<00:00:14.610> what<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:15.030> do

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
looking like you don't know what to do

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.810 
looking like you don't know what to do
with<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.690> music<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.350> first<00:00:16.650> move<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.520> step

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
with the music so first move is the step

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.490 
with the music so first move is the step
touch<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.779> back<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.230> looks<00:00:19.439> like<00:00:19.590> this

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.529 

it's<00:00:25.500> pretty<00:00:25.650> simple<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:27.119> move<00:00:27.359> is

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
it's pretty simple so this move is

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.660 
it's pretty simple so this move is
actually<00:00:27.930> composed<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.680> two<00:00:29.099> different

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
actually composed of two different

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.150 
actually composed of two different
things<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.539> bounce<00:00:31.109> which<00:00:31.590> looks<00:00:31.859> like<00:00:31.920> this

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
things the bounce which looks like this

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.620 
things the bounce which looks like this
up<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.850> up<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.809> up<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.710> up<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:36.149> apparent

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
up and up and up and up and the apparent

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.430 
up and up and up and up and the apparent
step<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.829> back<00:00:38.010> step<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.450> back<00:00:39.629> step

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
step to the back step to the back step

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.670 
step to the back step to the back step
to<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> back<00:00:41.190> step<00:00:42.059> through<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.719> back<00:00:42.899> okay

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
to the back step through the back okay

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.910 
to the back step through the back okay
so<00:00:44.250> let's<00:00:44.520> do<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.300> bounce<00:00:45.840> first<00:00:46.289> what<00:00:46.770> you're

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
so let's do the bounce first what you're

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.139 
so let's do the bounce first what you're
going<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.550> you're<00:00:47.700> going<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.879> bend<00:00:48.090> your

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
going to do is you're going to bend your

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.720 
going to do is you're going to bend your
knees<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.190> every<00:00:50.190> time<00:00:50.219> when<00:00:50.700> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
knees like this and every time when I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.420 
knees like this and every time when I
count<00:00:51.120> two<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.449> one<00:00:51.860> we're<00:00:52.860> going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> extend

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
count two the one we're going to extend

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.229 
count two the one we're going to extend
up<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.940> then<00:00:54.750> down<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.410> then<00:00:55.469> two<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.149> it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
up and then down and then two so it

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.369 
up and then down and then two so it
looks<00:00:57.390> like<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.829> one<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.100> two<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.300> one<00:01:00.930> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
looks like this one and two and one and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.549 
looks like this one and two and one and
two<00:01:02.250> all<00:01:02.760> right<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.329> basically<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:04.049> each<00:01:04.260> count

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
two all right so basically to each count

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.410 
two all right so basically to each count
we're<00:01:04.860> going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.040> stand<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.430> one<00:01:06.030> more<00:01:06.210> time

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
we're going to stand up one more time

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.460 
we're going to stand up one more time
starting<00:01:07.260> from<00:01:07.409> here<00:01:07.590> five<00:01:08.430> six<00:01:09.140> seven<00:01:10.140> eight

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
starting from here five six seven eight

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.010 
starting from here five six seven eight
one<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.549> two<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.689> one<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.710> two<00:01:14.670> alright<00:01:15.540> so

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
one and two and one and two alright so

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.800 
one and two and one and two alright so
that's<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.950> balance<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.939> second<00:01:18.420> part<00:01:18.659> to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
that's the balance the second part to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.560 
that's the balance the second part to
this<00:01:19.049> move<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.070> actual<00:01:20.520> step<00:01:20.880> we're<00:01:21.420> going

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
this move is the actual step we're going

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.020 
this move is the actual step we're going
to<00:01:21.630> step<00:01:21.869> one<00:01:22.290> side<00:01:22.560> we're<00:01:23.460> going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> put<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
to step one side we're going to put the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.690 
to step one side we're going to put the
other<00:01:24.060> foot<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.080> back<00:01:25.280> step<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.580> other

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
other foot to the back step to the other

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.870 
other foot to the back step to the other
side<00:01:26.970> foot<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.500> back<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.400> let's<00:01:29.430> try<00:01:29.820> this

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
side foot to the back so let's try this

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
one two and one two putting the two

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.280 
one two and one two putting the two
together<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.880> go<00:01:42.000> we're<00:01:42.750> going<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.960> start

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
together here we go we're going to start

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.899 
together here we go we're going to start
a<00:01:43.470> little<00:01:43.649> bit<00:01:43.860> lower<00:01:44.040> we're<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> go

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
a little bit lower we're going to go

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.450 
a little bit lower we're going to go
step<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.710> step<00:01:46.820> bounce<00:01:47.820> em<00:01:48.149> fast<00:01:49.130> bounce<00:01:50.130> and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
step and step bounce em fast bounce and

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.889 
step and step bounce em fast bounce and
bounce<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.479> bounce<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:52.590> that's<00:01:53.460> alright<00:01:54.450> so

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
bounce and bounce and that's alright so

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.120 
bounce and bounce and that's alright so
let's<00:01:55.110> do<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> little<00:01:55.500> bit<00:01:55.649> quicker

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
let's do it a little bit quicker

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.950 
let's do it a little bit quicker
five<00:01:56.490> six<00:01:57.259> seven<00:01:58.259> eight<00:01:58.560> one<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.640> two<00:01:59.899> one<00:02:00.899> and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
five six seven eight one and two one and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.289 
five six seven eight one and two one and
two<00:02:01.430> one<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.490> two

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
two one and two

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.639 
two one and two
and<00:02:03.539> one<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.289> two<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:06.000> step<00:02:06.750> touch<00:02:06.960> through

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
and one and two so step touch through

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.499 
and one and two so step touch through
the<00:02:07.770> back<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.340> second<00:02:08.700> move<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
the back so the second move is the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:17.000 
the back so the second move is the
shoulder<00:02:09.929> pop<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.349> looks<00:02:10.440> like<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:16.010> alright

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
shoulder pop it looks like this alright

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.460 
shoulder pop it looks like this alright
it's<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.670> pretty<00:02:17.910> funky<00:02:18.269> movement<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.080> it's

it's a pretty funky movement and it's
pretty<00:02:19.769> simple<00:02:20.190> we're<00:02:20.879> going<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.090> get<00:02:21.209> started

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
pretty simple we're going to get started

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
post up to different elements the lean

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:34.520 
post up to different elements the lean
