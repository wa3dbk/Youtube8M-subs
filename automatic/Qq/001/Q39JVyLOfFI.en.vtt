00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.320
 good morning this is the weather forecast for 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.119
 Friday, November 30 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.240
 it has finally snowed in the 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.040
 Austria and which could also be to 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.240
 other areas in the open that had 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.920
 had a snowball 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.570
 and so yesterday it was finally the neighbors 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.730
 of course much has been there for a long time 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.869
 have as many as that on the side 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.960
 seen 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.140
 walk a little too much after this is will 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.900
 in the steel we see the full 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.420
 del toro beautiful white and that started in 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.050
 yesterday he hit from a sailor 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.790
 precipitation towards the north 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.690
 yesterday, there wants to remain anonymous 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.390
 snowing and it is also born with 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.960
 only a few less there 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.520
 centimeters he came Monday and that 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.950
 I already indicated that the differences were whole 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.330
 very large between the areas 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.740
 act 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.780
 on this is for example the gargellen 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.670
 Thunder of the not even on such 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.460
 great distance from a scarf off and on 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.299
 was on 50 device significantly more 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.189
 snow 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.020
 generally we can say the further after 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.210
 the east the less snow there is 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.590
 and that is also what we have 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.909
 indicated 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.880
 heretofore us 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.909
 weather reports then just a moment back 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.409
 to that black dot where we start this one 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.120
 had a week left 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.820
 it came under snow expectation 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.860
 card back here we see nice and tasty 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.450
 which was very near crazy now 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.840
 why naturally wonder what none 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.969
 in terms of images in terms of snowfall and 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.490
 after good the images speak for themselves 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:46.549
 think this is very important to do something 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.859
 more than 2000 meters high and thick 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.810
 get some snow and that black student union 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:53.450
 yes not to see that is about on van 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.130
 4,000 meters projected 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.689
 so I think that model is very nice in the 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.819
 sat with more than a meter of snow 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.310
 at that height 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:04.270
 this is also 4 is 9 plus gotten 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.080
 this is also instructive , a lot of snow 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.720
 and this is not yesterday and has been taken 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.970
 photo that is from sunday and i have this one 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.160
 brought to life for pure sake 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.930
 comparison to show what 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.690
 important in cases this is one 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.900
 approach all possibilities 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.090
 to almost would say good but this is 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.239
 So to come to yesterday 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.540
 and if you really skipping then yes we see 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.099
 clear the difference and they leave 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.440
 do put some work to it one and all 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.849
 Order to turn the lights on 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.100
 company can go next weekend me 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.959
 wants not so much to Sunday and 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.150
 then have to deal with a new one 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.880
 low-pressure area you get through Denmark 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.389
 sink your ass and that comes in the role of 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.670
 Sunday again some snow from entering 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:59.209
 to speak to us with one or I do n't think so 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.660
 it will be very much true one 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.389
 surprise can be in the salon 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.160
 and the earth, for in the wake of the 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.200
 Lower area you could be confidential 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.970
 inside and that takes care of it 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.890
 I think it snows a lot 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.560
 places in the Ardennes eifel 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.000
 such a country goes without just a white 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.560
 to hear 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.800
 don't think more than ten centimeters 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.900
 nevertheless it is a nice start 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.510
 the cambuur goes gives the arrow 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.950
 our eyes must now focus on running 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.900
 in this low-pressure area 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.970
 and that will start again next week 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.590
 to hear a lot of snow there 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.450
 convinced 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.980
 because this is a collar from Tuesday then 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.870
 we see the low-pressure areas in the neighborhood 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.480
 from denmark and with a 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.090
 northwestern current blow that 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.280
 humid air again to help and that 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.569
 probably goes mainly in the French 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:53.239
 and give a big white gun a lot of snow 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.250
 thick half meter think is possible 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.860
 but maybe and so much more 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.420
 I think the suction cup and this case some 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.579
 get less and some austria 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.440
 that remains to wait for the 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.720
 seems not particularly focused on 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.980
 the french and swiss alps for that is 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.840
 actually already 2 days so just goes 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.519
 wait then some shifted hear that 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.799
 I yesterday also indicated because it is 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.539
 about gone but it looks so whole 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.539
 good for beginning next week too
