00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
the second quarter to this also is your

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.310 
the second quarter to this also is your
fall<00:01:33.740> off<00:01:34.450> you<00:01:35.450> can<00:01:35.660> go<00:01:35.810> all<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.110> way<00:01:36.140> up<00:01:36.290> to

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
fall off you can go all the way up to

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.050 
fall off you can go all the way up to
these<00:01:36.560> rocks<00:01:36.860> here<00:01:37.160> but<00:01:37.520> then<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:37.850> got<00:01:38.030> to

point and then once you get here you can

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.070 
point and then once you get here you can
walk<00:01:46.460> a<00:01:46.490> little<00:01:46.790> bit<00:01:46.940> but<00:01:47.600> then<00:01:47.840> you're<00:01:47.990> going

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
to have to jump across this point over

00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:01.550 
to have to jump across this point over
to<00:01:52.280> this<00:01:52.759> point<00:01:53.030> here

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.010 

and<00:02:02.130> once<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.520> get<00:02:02.670> here<00:02:03.000> that's<00:02:03.540> as<00:02:03.750> far<00:02:03.960> as
