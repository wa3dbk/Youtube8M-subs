wario<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.200> way<00:02:43.650> more<00:02:44.010> prominent<00:02:44.730> he's<00:02:44.970> way

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
wario is way more prominent he's way

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.640 
wario is way more prominent he's way
more<00:02:45.390> popular<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.380> he<00:02:46.460> actually<00:02:47.460> is<00:02:48.470> has<00:02:49.470> his

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
more popular and he actually is has his

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.880 
more popular and he actually is has his
own<00:02:49.830> actual<00:02:50.490> series<00:02:51.270> other<00:02:51.600> than<00:02:51.890> Mario's

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
own actual series other than Mario's

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.260 
own actual series other than Mario's
apart<00:02:53.370> from<00:02:53.580> Mario<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.210> it<00:02:54.510> makes<00:02:55.290> sense<00:02:55.500> that

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
apart from Mario so it makes sense that

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.830 
apart from Mario so it makes sense that
he<00:02:57.270> goes<00:02:57.840> with<00:02:58.230> Wario<00:02:58.890> then<00:02:59.370> waluigi<00:03:00.360> waluigi

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
he goes with Wario then waluigi waluigi

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.730 
he goes with Wario then waluigi waluigi

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
was just created to be a clone basically

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.020 
was just created to be a clone basically
of<00:03:04.980> Wario<00:03:05.960> for<00:03:06.960> the<00:03:07.530> equivalent<00:03:08.070> tiwari<00:03:08.910> Oh

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
well not that many times but it was

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.430 
well not that many times but it was
annoyingly<00:04:50.730> a<00:04:51.730> couple<00:04:52.690> of<00:04:52.780> times<00:04:52.930> because

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
annoyingly a couple of times because

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.590 
annoyingly a couple of times because
it's<00:04:53.890> just<00:04:54.010> a<00:04:54.280> weird<00:04:54.550> name<00:04:54.880> it's<00:04:55.210> hard<00:04:55.480> to

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
it's just a weird name it's hard to

it's just a weird name it's hard to
pronounce<00:04:56.160> but<00:04:57.160> that's<00:04:57.550> cool<00:04:57.820> it's<00:04:58.150> a<00:04:58.300> new

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
pronounce but that's cool it's a new

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.960 
pronounce but that's cool it's a new
character<00:04:58.810> electric-type<00:04:59.620> from<00:05:00.160> pokemon<00:05:00.700> X&amp;Y

character electric-type from pokemon X&amp;Y

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.350 
character electric-type from pokemon X&amp;Y
we're<00:05:01.330> getting<00:05:01.540> a<00:05:01.570> lot<00:05:01.750> of<00:05:01.810> pokemon<00:05:02.290> X&amp;Y

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360

Pokemon we have the new legendary from
pokemon<00:05:07.780> X&amp;Y<00:05:08.170> which<00:05:08.590> I<00:05:08.740> I<00:05:09.430> think<00:05:09.760> his<00:05:09.850> name<00:05:10.030> is

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
pokemon X&amp;Y which I I think his name is

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.880 
pokemon X&amp;Y which I I think his name is
xerneas<00:05:11.470> and<00:05:12.360> now<00:05:13.360> we<00:05:13.420> have<00:05:13.900> this<00:05:14.230> one<00:05:14.530> so

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
xerneas and now we have this one so

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.350 
xerneas and now we have this one so
that's<00:05:15.130> pretty<00:05:15.370> good<00:05:15.640> and<00:05:15.880> it<00:05:16.000> looks<00:05:16.180> like<00:05:16.330> a

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
that's pretty good and it looks like a

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.840 
that's pretty good and it looks like a
pretty<00:05:16.600> powerful<00:05:16.840> Pokemon<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:17.830> it<00:05:18.430> does<00:05:18.670> it's

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
pretty powerful Pokemon and it does it's

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.230 
pretty powerful Pokemon and it does it's
electric<00:05:19.360> tak<00:05:19.690> like<00:05:20.620> an<00:05:20.860> X<00:05:21.340> so<00:05:21.760> we'll<00:05:21.940> probably

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
electric tak like an X so we'll probably

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.340 
electric tak like an X so we'll probably
pre<00:05:22.770> probably<00:05:23.770> be<00:05:23.920> pretty<00:05:24.160> hard<00:05:24.520> to<00:05:24.690> dodge<00:05:25.690> so

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
pre probably be pretty hard to dodge so

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.550
