you<00:03:25.610> always<00:03:25.880> have<00:03:26.060> the<00:03:26.090> pressure<00:03:26.420> we<00:03:26.840> are<00:03:26.960> in

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
you always have the pressure we are in

then you if you don't have pressure

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.190 
then you if you don't have pressure
there<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:32.240> are<00:03:32.390> doing<00:03:32.569> something<00:03:32.840> wrong<00:03:35.200> if

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
there you are doing something wrong if

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.960

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
the right personality is a bit different

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.910 
the right personality is a bit different
you<00:03:38.209> know<00:03:38.360> Marcus<00:03:38.750> is<00:03:38.930> someone<00:03:39.410> who<00:03:39.620> may<00:03:39.890> be

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
you know Marcus is someone who may be

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.630 
you know Marcus is someone who may be
attack<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.920> Stefan<00:03:43.850> is<00:03:43.970> more<00:03:44.390> rider<00:03:45.080> where

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
attack and Stefan is more rider where

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.960 
attack and Stefan is more rider where
maybe<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.940> long<00:03:47.150> distance<00:03:47.770> is<00:03:48.770> more<00:03:49.250> regular

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
maybe the long distance is more regular

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.550 
maybe the long distance is more regular
I<00:03:51.880> think<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.120> biggest<00:03:53.720> of<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.350> most

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
I think the biggest of the most

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.800 
I think the biggest of the most
important<00:03:55.010> moment<00:03:55.280> will<00:03:55.459> be<00:03:55.640> in<00:03:55.700> kitap<00:03:56.060> on<00:03:56.450> the
