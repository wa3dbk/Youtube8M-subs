00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.470
 this work called le prix de la 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.810
 folds villas of life is one 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.810
 interpretation of the concept of crisis 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.170
 resent with marina lane to look for it with 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:54.710
 the man then that the curator spoke of 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.430
 how to give shape to the idea of ​​crisis then 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.170
 I thought the best way 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.809
 three-dimensional to see the crisis were 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.309
 the fold because the crisis is the 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.820
 change the crisis is an opportunity 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.910
 others not even an instrument of man 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.490
 to be able to progress and through 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:17.280
 criticism we find new roads and 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.890
 therefore being also the fold the cut 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.729
 the temporal space contraction one of the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.890
 themes that attract me 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.259
 conceptually I have thought to realize 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.070
 a work that was a set of folds 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.780
 then a personal event 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:39.170
 my mother's loss is very strong 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.330
 the truth last year and two years ago it 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.850
 will 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.140
 as the last last moment together 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.850
 my participation came from genre 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.850
 at the last biennial 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.680
 in short, he made me lean towards 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.860
 the idea of ​​creating a human figure of 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.689
 made a woman screaming that screams against 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.600
 the sky but it is not a cry of pain 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:12.040
 use of awareness because the scream 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.380
 and together with the fold the last moment 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.760
 of man to become aware of 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.050
 something once we have 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.170
 shouted once we are there 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.120
 let us vent we are walking and then we are 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.069
 realized that something changed not 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.760
 we have no other excuse no one else 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.069
 possibility if not that of 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.739
 start over and so this is a scream 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:37.400
 a scream that I hope is also a new one 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:50.420
 dozens compared to a moment of crisis 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:53.819
 the beginning a new beginning I arrived 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.160
 to an artistic journey through a 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.880
 reflection will take on a material that is 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.530
 the mirror 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.739
 I am also a non- training designer 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.590
 on presentation however I always have 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.830
 searched through the design of 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.110
 expressing messages years ago I have 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.330
 passionate about the mirror in fact 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.060
 the big expressive force of this 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.250
 matter that makes us participate in that 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.110
 that we see the mirror does not exist of 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.519
 for itself but exists in relation to that 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.799
 that is in front of himself and up 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.060
 this reflection I started at 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.739
 build an artistic path that has 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.610
 in the fold it has in anyway 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.580
 edge 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:45.670
 a form of sensitivity and very much 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:48.130
 close the idea is that my mirrors that 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.630
 then they are mirror-like works because 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.040
 the mirror something that belongs to 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.140
 daily mirroring work 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.080
 something that wants to reflect on 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.630
 everyday life are hints of 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.030
 reflection because they are born with the idea of 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.190
 communicate messages related to 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.650
 contemporary what we live to where 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.540
 we live what we do and things 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.480
 of which we do daily 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.770
 of which we may not always have this 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.299
 awareness of this presence and therefore 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.799
 are second wishes took me from 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.100
 mirror are hints of 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.720
 reflection that each of us must then 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.080
 complete then imply one 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.580
 participation imply an effort 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:32.880
 also of those who absorb the work and networks e 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.770
 see the object for the first time 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.810
 the idea that I like about the mirror is 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.230
 just this interaction for example ho 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.420
 done 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.840
 as like 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:51.120
 penultimate and the last work in a series 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:54.690
 of a collection of bound wall works 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.330
 to the world of the web where the figures i 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.810
 profiles of those who are i 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.980
 protagonists 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:05.620
 web function from steve jobs that are good 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.080
 mixed with the logos of the companies that 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.080
 they have created but carved into 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.210
 mirror tell us that without us 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.880
 all this would not have happened that 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.540
 we are part of their plan we are 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:23.490
 protagonists as they are of this 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.490
 contemporary expression of the network 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:35.220
 another significant work in mine 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.740
 artistic journey that somehow they 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:42.030
 refers to palazzo brizzi I miss the 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:45.420
 Italian-German headquarters refers me to the 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.980
 reflection on germany is a work 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.580
 I did for the use of the park of 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:55.470
 portofino la parsi calls we equal wall 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:58.500
 and it is basically reconstruction 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.900
 of a slice of a portion of 126 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.870
 berlin wall width to an extent 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:07.320
 real but also played with it here 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:11.490
 mirror ie mirror reproduced idea 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:14.310
 quite simple but also deep and 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:17.100
 that basically every one of us is the wall of 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.120
 this is the concept itself 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.729
 and I must say 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.599
 very impressive live because with 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:29.419
 its three meters and sixty tall 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:31.789
 from having us he puts us in front of us 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:34.669
 in front of ourselves and is on this 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:36.530
 relationship of the parts that I like 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:39.889
 to reason like to reason 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:43.039
 indeed it makes one think seeing seen the 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:45.860
 type of works that I propose 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:48.319
 I don't believe in the general sense carmen though 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.689
 there really are a number of factors 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:54.740
 elements that report that they are composed 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:57.139
 in the career and therefore this presence 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.750
 in this building with this institution 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:05.050
 in short, I hope it can be 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:05.050
 harbinger of interesting future projects
