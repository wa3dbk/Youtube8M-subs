was<00:04:09.269> there<00:04:09.540> but<00:04:09.569> i<00:04:09.810> still<00:04:10.049> think<00:04:10.230> he<00:04:10.470> ended<00:04:10.829> up

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
was there but i still think he ended up

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.130 
was there but i still think he ended up
coming<00:04:11.159> out<00:04:11.310> ahead<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:12.540> now<00:04:12.750> yea<00:04:12.989> though

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
coming out ahead and now yea though

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.149 
coming out ahead and now yea though
certainly<00:04:13.439> is<00:04:13.530> being<00:04:13.709> taken<00:04:13.859> up<00:04:14.010> by<00:04:14.069> the

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
certainly is being taken up by the

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.159 
certainly is being taken up by the
drones<00:04:14.489> but<00:04:15.120> uh<00:04:15.150> july<00:04:15.629> zurich<00:04:15.840> essentially

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
drones but uh july zurich essentially

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.390 
drones but uh july zurich essentially
had<00:04:16.289> to<00:04:16.350> stop<00:04:16.560> mining<00:04:16.829> and<00:04:17.039> i<00:04:17.070> think<00:04:17.280> that

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
had to stop mining and i think that

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.949 
had to stop mining and i think that
might<00:04:17.519> be<00:04:17.579> the<00:04:17.699> difference<00:04:18.060> here<00:04:18.120> so<00:04:18.630> i<00:04:18.660> think

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
might be the difference here so i think

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.390 
might be the difference here so i think
luxury<00:04:19.440> is<00:04:19.500> going<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.709> actually<00:04:19.829> come<00:04:20.100> out<00:04:20.130> as

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
luxury is going to actually come out as

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.949 
luxury is going to actually come out as
management<00:04:20.699> girl<00:04:20.910> Mabel<00:04:21.150> swap<00:04:21.449> reduce<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.900> the

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
management girl Mabel swap reduce to the

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.110 
management girl Mabel swap reduce to the
board<00:04:22.199> and<00:04:22.470> i<00:04:23.039> just<00:04:23.430> scourges<00:04:23.820> in<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.030> Air

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
board and i just scourges in the Air

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.939 
board and i just scourges in the Air
Force<00:04:24.150> wiser<00:04:24.720> gear<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.560> he's<00:04:25.650> got<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.889> be

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
Force wiser gear and he's got to be

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.950 
Force wiser gear and he's got to be
really<00:04:26.190> careful<00:04:26.220> with<00:04:26.610> them<00:04:26.820> he's<00:04:27.690> just

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
really careful with them he's just

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.080 
really careful with them he's just
sending<00:04:28.380> them<00:04:28.500> in<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:29.430> I<00:04:29.610> think<00:04:29.639> that<00:04:29.940> was<00:04:30.060> a

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
sending them in and I think that was a

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.279 
sending them in and I think that was a
mistake<00:04:30.210> because<00:04:30.449> yeah<00:04:30.780> looks<00:04:31.050> like<00:04:31.080> luck

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
mistake because yeah looks like luck

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:32.330 
mistake because yeah looks like luck
sure<00:04:31.410> he's<00:04:31.500> gonna<00:04:31.620> be<00:04:31.770> able<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.979> take<00:04:32.130> care<00:04:32.280> of

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
sure he's gonna be able to take care of

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.670 
sure he's gonna be able to take care of
him<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:33.389> I<00:04:33.539> think<00:04:33.750> that's<00:04:33.900> it<00:04:34.020> for<00:04:34.080> july<00:04:34.500> zerg

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
him and I think that's it for july zerg

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.499 
him and I think that's it for july zerg
actually<00:04:35.160> because<00:04:35.370> looks<00:04:36.240> like<00:04:36.360> he's

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
actually because looks like he's

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.810 
actually because looks like he's
bringing<00:04:36.750> up<00:04:36.810> that<00:04:36.960> drone<00:04:37.199> again<00:04:37.470> I<00:04:37.889> guess<00:04:38.669> I

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
bringing up that drone again I guess I

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.640 
bringing up that drone again I guess I
was<00:04:39.330> mistaken<00:04:39.449> before<00:04:39.900> I<00:04:40.050> guess<00:04:40.229> I<00:04:40.320> was<00:04:40.440> July

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
was mistaken before I guess I was July

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.710 
was mistaken before I guess I was July

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
misses on things and I probably a scout

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.810 
misses on things and I probably a scout
able<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:45.990> take<00:04:46.139> out<00:04:46.289> yeah<00:04:46.500> once<00:04:46.710> again<00:04:46.979> two

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.029 
out the spawning pool as you can see
nothing<00:04:51.690> left<00:04:52.020> that<00:04:52.110> you<00:04:52.259> laser<00:04:52.500> can<00:04:52.710> do<00:04:52.830> looks

like he's too just getting this John
line<00:04:54.960> picked<00:04:55.199> off<00:04:55.380> I'm<00:04:55.949> gonna<00:04:56.099> have<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.370> rely

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
line picked off I'm gonna have to rely

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.830 
line picked off I'm gonna have to rely
on<00:04:56.580> that<00:04:56.699> sport<00:04:57.000> calling<00:04:57.300> they<00:04:57.419> all<00:04:57.570> say<00:04:57.810> I

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
on that sport calling they all say I

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.879 
on that sport calling they all say I
don't<00:04:57.930> think<00:04:58.110> that's<00:04:58.169> going<00:04:58.349> to<00:04:58.409> do<00:04:58.500> them<00:04:58.680> take

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
don't think that's going to do them take

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.050 
don't think that's going to do them take
out<00:04:58.979> that<00:04:59.070> sparkle<00:04:59.430> on<00:04:59.520> here<00:04:59.729> and<00:04:59.789> take<00:04:59.940> out

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.000 
out that sparkle on here and take out
the<00:05:00.090> rest<00:05:00.300> digitizer<00:05:00.720> supply<00:05:01.169> take<00:05:01.770> out<00:05:01.919> his

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.530 
them honestly getting out Mike road
essentially<00:05:15.599> but

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
essentially but

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.090 
essentially but
not<00:05:16.840> really<00:05:17.140> creating<00:05:17.470> any<00:05:17.770> microt

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
not really creating any microt

whatsoever in my solo tree ended up
winning<00:05:21.340> looks<00:05:21.640> like<00:05:21.730> he's<00:05:21.880> going<00:05:21.970> to<00:05:22.090> take

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
winning looks like he's going to take

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.640 
winning looks like he's going to take
the<00:05:22.300> first<00:05:22.480> match<00:05:22.660> lizard<00:05:23.080> by<00:05:23.230> no<00:05:23.350> means<00:05:23.560> out

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
the first match lizard by no means out

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.960 
the first match lizard by no means out
of<00:05:23.710> it<00:05:23.890> he<00:05:23.980> still<00:05:24.190> has<00:05:24.280> a<00:05:24.310> lot<00:05:24.490> of<00:05:24.550> matches<00:05:24.700> to

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
of it he still has a lot of matches to

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.500 
of it he still has a lot of matches to
play<00:05:25.090> in<00:05:25.600> this<00:05:25.840> first<00:05:26.080> round<00:05:26.260> of<00:05:26.410> sea
