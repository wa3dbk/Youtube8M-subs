00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.540 
to mind to describe that this fish it's
got<00:02:48.630> our<00:02:48.900> lateral<00:02:49.200> bones<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.890> all<00:02:50.100> our<00:02:50.280> fish

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
got our lateral bones like all our fish

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.080 
got our lateral bones like all our fish
going<00:02:50.910> down<00:02:51.209> into<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.110> Philip<00:02:52.650> there<00:02:52.920> and

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.990 

tidying<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.360> up<00:02:57.630> we<00:02:58.560> can't<00:02:59.520> leave<00:02:59.760> these

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
tidying that up we can't leave these

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.259 
tidying that up we can't leave these
bends<00:03:00.360> in<00:03:00.600> now<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.470> can't<00:03:01.980> pull<00:03:02.430> these<00:03:02.640> Richard

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
bends in now I can't pull these Richard

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.509 
bends in now I can't pull these Richard
burns<00:03:03.690> out<00:03:03.870> with<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.590> sound<00:03:04.799> you<00:03:05.100> can<00:03:05.160> pull

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
burns out with the sound you can pull

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.410 
burns out with the sound you can pull
all<00:03:05.700> those<00:03:05.850> burns<00:03:06.209> out<00:03:07.790> become<00:03:08.790> this<00:03:09.030> fish<00:03:09.239> so

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
all those burns out become this fish so

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:19.140 
all those burns out become this fish so
that<00:03:09.450> when<00:03:09.810> we've<00:03:09.930> got<00:03:10.049> to<00:03:10.170> cut<00:03:10.380> them<00:03:10.560> out

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.170 

so<00:03:19.780> this<00:03:20.019> is<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.349> pie<00:03:20.590> scene<00:03:21.069> equivalent<00:03:21.970> of

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
so this is the pie scene equivalent of

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.589 
so this is the pie scene equivalent of
Wagyu<00:03:23.080> basically<00:03:23.830> it's<00:03:24.489> one<00:03:24.970> of<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.090> finest

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
Wagyu basically it's one of the finest

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.559 
Wagyu basically it's one of the finest
species<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.440> fish<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:27.580> this<00:03:28.000> is<00:03:28.120> where<00:03:28.360> you

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
species of fish and this is where you

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.190 
species of fish and this is where you
feel<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.080> stick<00:03:29.409> basically<00:03:29.709> as<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.519> can<00:03:30.549> tell

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
feel it stick basically as you can tell

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.259 
feel it stick basically as you can tell
that's<00:03:32.200> going<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.590> be<00:03:32.650> there<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:36.269> there

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
that's going to be there and there

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.960 
that's going to be there and there
that's<00:03:37.569> your<00:03:37.810> portion<00:03:38.230> meal<00:03:38.409> we<00:03:39.250> might<00:03:39.489> now<00:03:39.700> go

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
that's your portion meal we might now go

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.759 
that's your portion meal we might now go
and<00:03:40.150> cook<00:03:40.780> one<00:03:40.989> of<00:03:41.019> these<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.379> see<00:03:41.560> what<00:03:41.590> it
