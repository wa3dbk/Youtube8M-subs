00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.629 
over killing a certain type of accessory
I'm<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.019> decorator<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.130> work<00:00:11.309> with<00:00:11.460> what

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
I'm a decorator and I work with what

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.189 
I'm a decorator and I work with what
people<00:00:11.790> have<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.450> i<00:00:12.540> really<00:00:13.080> like<00:00:13.320> contrast<00:00:14.099> a

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
people have and i really like contrast a

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.970 
people have and i really like contrast a
lot<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.320> times<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.949> client<00:00:17.670> will<00:00:18.260> find<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.500> cell

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
lot of times a client will find a cell

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.720 
lot of times a client will find a cell
on<00:00:21.350> let's<00:00:22.350> say<00:00:22.500> blue<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.830> white<00:00:23.010> pottery<00:00:23.310> and

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
on let's say blue and white pottery and

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.000 
on let's say blue and white pottery and
so<00:00:24.269> instead<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.660> getting<00:00:24.869> one<00:00:25.260> great<00:00:25.650> piece

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
so instead of getting one great piece

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.980 
so instead of getting one great piece
they'll<00:00:26.400> get<00:00:26.640> eight<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.119> same<00:00:27.300> pieces<00:00:27.599> and

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
they'll get eight of the same pieces and

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.620 
they'll get eight of the same pieces and
so<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.529> just<00:00:28.830> all<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.519> sudden<00:00:29.910> too<00:00:30.420> many

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
so it's just all of a sudden too many

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.220 
so it's just all of a sudden too many
pieces<00:00:30.960> becomes<00:00:31.920> kind<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.940> overkill<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.989> it's

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
pieces becomes kind of overkill and it's

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.200 
pieces becomes kind of overkill and it's
not<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.800> exciting<00:00:35.160> anymore<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:35.910> it's

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
not so exciting anymore because it's

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.869 
not so exciting anymore because it's
boring<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:36.840> like<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.680> same<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.700> like

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
boring it's like the same it's like

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.639 
boring it's like the same it's like
furniture<00:00:39.149> sets<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.899> same<00:00:40.200> type<00:00:40.620> of

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
furniture sets the same type of

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.130 
furniture sets the same type of
furniture<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.700> seven<00:00:42.600> different<00:00:42.719> pieces

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
furniture in seven different pieces

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.920 
furniture in seven different pieces
after<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> wall<00:00:44.370> becomes<00:00:44.730> very<00:00:44.850> boring<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.690> what

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
after a wall becomes very boring so what

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.130 
after a wall becomes very boring so what
you<00:00:46.020> want<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:47.120> instead<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.270> duplicating

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
you want to do is instead of duplicating

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.920 
you want to do is instead of duplicating
instead<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.710> putting<00:00:49.980> all<00:00:50.280> your<00:00:50.930> brass

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930
