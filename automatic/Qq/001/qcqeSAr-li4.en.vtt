00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:06.710
 oliver polkamp for me it was from 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.210
 the beginning is clear 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.160
 who would win this competition yes we 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.169
 have played a lot through and I was 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.889
 it our approach actually so yes yes 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:14.360
 handsome that succeeded 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.559
 we may already have one first 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.530
 bit failed or walk out 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.450
 but yes all in all 500 no goals against 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.340
 pretty nice from the corners yes that is 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.500
 actually what we wanted I think and jelte 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.750
 memorial at the bottom of the two new ones 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.160
 yes yes and is offensive finally yes like 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.590
 we did open a little bit and open 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.850
 to be able to move forward and then succeed 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.809
 one time is a lot of fun 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.400
 of course 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.600
 who finally understood the concepts 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.060
 happens too little friend 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.470
 yourself at Rotterdam maybe too 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.700
 few employees with the Netherlands team 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.780
 actually getting better and 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.700
 is still a bit of a discovery for me 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.320
 because yes I really attack a movie there 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700
 the my own team so still a 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.470
 some getting used to but i really think so 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.149
 so unheard of fun and happy to be there 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.130
 once results in a goal yes 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.030
 even nice feeling about this and the 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.500
 first three games in the group stage 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.790
 a draw 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.040
 you actually see two wins 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.140
 an upward trend yes absolutely look 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.430
 first was turned his trick with a with 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.899
 a new team together I am myself 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.460
 new ones have four by four debutants 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.560
 and the new composition would be people 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.150
 stopped just as getting used to and 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.920
 what just shorten short preparation 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.479
 and you may have seen that first 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.560
 game were ok too, I think 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.979
 always much better than him and showed him 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.600
 name to stand a chance and the second was 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.100
 the first good been a lot better 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.659
 and second maybe had less 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.979
 and now the third was actually yes I think 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.930
 the whole west we have been better at 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.520
 violating and asking pointed to devote himself 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.990
 no less take the first road one 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.890
 sport who want my colleagues to smell you 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.930
 from ear to ear 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.340
 they call it there that I saw my 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.939
 idea still has not changed as 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.770
 beautiful 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.450
 no no yes I can't do much about it 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.159
 I really think it's all real 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.689
 incredibly beautiful here me on my own 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.700
 club then honor first that is first 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.100
 debit and then just nice and tasty 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.570
 nice and intense too, that's how I see it 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.880
 And well what is more beautiful I think 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.670
 most beautiful actually yes you can 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.900
 stop laughing now that what France 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.220
 what do you know about the team that they have 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.990
 zero points achieved and other farmers 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.210
 I all know what do you know about that 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.220
 team further he is thinking well out of 10,000 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.930
 little plays an old club so that 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.070
 know one and stay there 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.750
 we smoke I know them completely 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.310
 maybe not the boys already 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.020
 often more international matches played him like that 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.700
 know it but i think its zero point 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.140
 have had agree about me one 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.940
 win a competition and sanne that next 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.650
 high'll it is kind of the law 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.840
 shipping that really matters 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.800
 so very important to us so we go 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.690
 try to do the same thing 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.190
 today also have done to system 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.480
 actually and 0 times green and as one 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.760
 public winning opportunity as a bill through 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.650
 bizarre yes so a bit of a shock therefore 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.850
 is indicated in advance from the forests 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.710
 this that this is the most important lesson for 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.060
 You have to win this and you can see everything 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.500
 in cooling your child can focus on three law 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.730
 it doesn't actually train there 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.840
 and then the point is of course it is 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.620
 as the pole does well you 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.880
 of course a the 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.880
 on your easier opponent 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.590
 like now so my later system 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.030
 ah that's why I don't like it less 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.650
 the West really matters 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.950
 France you have the idea that you are really you 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.640
 card not specified 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.680
 hardly maybe very, very 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.240
 soon after three games 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.410
 I think that's a whole for that 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.270
 tournament and actually just one more 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.860
 This whole summer have even more even more 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.210
 training moments and then that too 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.200
 must must use to one 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.430
 business card issued 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.960
 i think i'm going a good way 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.220
 just fine so but I don't have to go there 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.170
 also walked next to my shoes 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.030
 for the same large container in a quarter 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.350
 nothing against flying out 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.550
 france and when we stand we stand whole 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.900
 otherwise I think 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.610
 but for you it is it is natural 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.080
 you're never became champion and 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.160
 at this there still this is women really one 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.630
 fantastic season 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.370
 yes that is why I am sure I will say so 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.780
 reign can't take all though were with 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.280
 laughter everything is fun actually it is 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.660
 fall from one to the other 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.160
 it is therefore really me a bit 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.959
 before we got there a really bad one 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.370
 westra feet almost arriving from me 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.040
 but no i hope it will go away for a while 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.290
 continues to have every three games 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.430
 I can do that and I hope it will be nice 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.719
 holidays 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.719
 good luck back france then go
