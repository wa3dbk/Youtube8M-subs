couple of orings that are inserted into

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.069 
couple of orings that are inserted into
the<00:00:40.230> cap<00:00:40.610> inside<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.820> cap<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.270> hold<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.660> snug

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
the cap inside the cap to hold it snug

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.330 
the cap inside the cap to hold it snug
so<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:44.219> won't<00:00:44.430> fall<00:00:44.820> off<00:00:45.980> inside<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.129> cap

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
so that it won't fall off inside the cap

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.940 
so that it won't fall off inside the cap
also<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> small<00:00:48.600> hole<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:49.170> holding<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> hex

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
also is a small hole for holding the hex

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.510 
also is a small hole for holding the hex
key<00:00:50.989> for<00:00:51.989> changing<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.620> needles<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.309> tool

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
key for changing the needles on the tool

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.180 
key for changing the needles on the tool
so<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.660> very<00:00:54.840> small<00:00:54.960> hex<00:00:55.469> key<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.010> very

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
so it's a very small hex key in a very

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.369 
so it's a very small hex key in a very
small<00:00:56.489> screw<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.539> doesn't<00:00:57.899> take<00:00:58.079> much<00:00:58.350> to

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
small screw but it doesn't take much to

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.029 
small screw but it doesn't take much to
hold<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.980> needle<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.579> place<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.170> insert<00:01:01.890> it

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
hold this needle in place so insert it

like<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.119> put<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.689> hammer<00:01:33.960> into<00:01:34.229> check<00:01:34.650> first

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
like to put the hammer into check first

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.510 
like to put the hammer into check first
so<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.939> would<00:01:36.210> play<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.500> hammer<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.130> put

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
so you would play the the hammer and put

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.789 
so you would play the the hammer and put
it<00:01:38.610> into<00:01:38.759> check<00:01:39.119> here<00:01:39.479> here's<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.290> back<00:01:40.470> check

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
it into check here here's the back check

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.520 
it into check here here's the back check
and<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:42.000> place<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.509> hammer<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.960> check<00:01:43.259> and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
and to place the hammer to check and

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.580 
and to place the hammer to check and
then<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.549> push<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.030> hammer<00:01:45.270> down<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.500> to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
then to push the hammer down and to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.330 
then to push the hammer down and to
voice<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.220> way<00:01:48.409> like<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.649> sugar<00:01:49.950> coder

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
voice it this way like the sugar coder

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.450 
voice it this way like the sugar coder
this<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.240> used<00:01:51.540> for<00:01:51.869> doing<00:01:52.229> shallow<00:01:52.890> needling

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
this is used for doing shallow needling

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.760 
this is used for doing shallow needling
and<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:54.030> course<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.509> hammer<00:01:54.780> will<00:01:55.049> push<00:01:55.320> sorry

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
and of course the hammer will push sorry

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.340 
and of course the hammer will push sorry
the<00:01:56.250> hammer<00:01:56.460> will<00:01:56.700> push<00:01:56.939> down<00:01:57.360> against<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
the hammer will push down against the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.440 
the hammer will push down against the
check<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.009> put<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.729> farther<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.210> farther

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
check and put it farther and farther

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.270 
check and put it farther and farther
into<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.810> check<00:02:01.079> until<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.680> more<00:02:01.890> stable

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
into a check until it's a more stable

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.840 
into a check until it's a more stable
surface<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:03.090> work<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.579> sugar

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
surface to work on so like the sugar

coder this technique typically works on

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.870 
coder this technique typically works on

hammer would come into contact with the
string<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:20.110> up<00:02:20.410> at<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.650> top<00:02:20.770> of<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.340> hammer<00:02:21.580> or

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
string so up at the top of the hammer or

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.330 
string so up at the top of the hammer or
the<00:02:21.910> apex<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.750> hammer<00:02:23.020> is<00:02:23.770> where<00:02:24.160> you

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
the apex of the hammer is where you

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.810 
the apex of the hammer is where you
would<00:02:24.490> do<00:02:24.700> but<00:02:25.060> most<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.780> your<00:02:26.520> needling<00:02:27.520> with

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
would do but most of your needling with

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.660 
would do but most of your needling with
a<00:02:28.120> sugar<00:02:28.900> coder<00:02:29.260> there's<00:02:30.190> many<00:02:30.550> other

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
a sugar coder there's many other

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.050 
a sugar coder there's many other
techniques<00:02:32.160> like<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.340> said<00:02:33.550> with<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.820> sugar

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
techniques like I said with the sugar

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.000 
techniques like I said with the sugar
coder<00:02:34.390> i<00:02:34.510> would<00:02:34.810> spend<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.230> lot<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.410> time<00:02:35.530> maybe

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
coder i would spend a lot of time maybe

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.190 
coder i would spend a lot of time maybe
on<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.340> back<00:02:36.550> side<00:02:36.850> of<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.060> hammer<00:02:37.300> but<00:02:38.020> you

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
on the back side of the hammer but you

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.250 
on the back side of the hammer but you
can<00:02:38.350> do<00:02:38.500> some<00:02:38.740> front<00:02:39.040> sight<00:02:39.250> as<00:02:39.460> well<00:02:39.700> and

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
can do some front sight as well and

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.110 
can do some front sight as well and
another<00:02:41.260> technique<00:02:41.770> that<00:02:42.010> was<00:02:42.100> taught<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.640> buy

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
another technique that was taught to buy

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.400 
another technique that was taught to buy
taught<00:02:43.840> me<00:02:44.110> by<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.040> great<00:02:45.850> technician<00:02:46.360> is<00:02:46.750> to

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
taught me by a great technician is to

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.120 
taught me by a great technician is to
voice<00:02:47.650> down<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.280> edge<00:02:48.610> of<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.650> hammer<00:02:53.130> both

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
voice down the edge of the hammer both

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.500 
voice down the edge of the hammer both
edges<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:56.140> if<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.800> do<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.490> will<00:02:58.120> help

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
edges and if you do that it will help

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.200 
edges and if you do that it will help
improve<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:59.320> sustained<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:01.000> particular

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
improve the sustained of that particular

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.930 
improve the sustained of that particular
note<00:03:01.810> so<00:03:02.320> if<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.560> find<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:03.010> dead<00:03:03.340> note<00:03:03.670> in<00:03:03.880> your

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
note so if you find a dead note in your

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.180 
note so if you find a dead note in your
piano<00:03:04.690> that's<00:03:04.990> just<00:03:05.290> not<00:03:05.500> giving<00:03:05.740> you<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:05.980> whole

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
piano that's just not giving you a whole

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.740 
piano that's just not giving you a whole
lot<00:03:06.220> of<00:03:06.520> life<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.900> can<00:03:08.080> voice<00:03:08.350> down<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.160> edges

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
lot of life you can voice down the edges

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.830 
lot of life you can voice down the edges
like<00:03:10.750> I'm<00:03:10.990> doing<00:03:11.320> here<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:12.310> hammer<00:03:12.840> then

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
like I'm doing here of the hammer then

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.210 
like I'm doing here of the hammer then
that<00:03:13.990> would<00:03:14.110> be<00:03:14.230> on<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.440> front<00:03:14.770> side<00:03:15.010> of<00:03:15.070> the

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
that would be on the front side of the

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.040 
that would be on the front side of the
hammer<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:17.580> increase<00:03:18.580> the<00:03:18.820> sustainer<00:03:19.330> open

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
hammer and increase the sustainer open

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.920 
hammer and increase the sustainer open
up<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:21.280> tone<00:03:21.610> and<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:21.910> piano<00:03:22.270> or<00:03:22.450> what's

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
up the the tone and the piano or what's

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.010 
up the the tone and the piano or what's
sometimes<00:03:23.230> called<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:24.010> bloom<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:25.540> it's<00:03:25.930> a

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
sometimes called the bloom so it's a

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.820 
sometimes called the bloom so it's a
great<00:03:26.200> technique<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:28.060> it's<00:03:28.210> a<00:03:28.300> great<00:03:28.540> tool

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
great technique and it's a great tool

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.770 
great technique and it's a great tool
you<00:03:29.830> don't<00:03:30.040> have<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.460> pull<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.000> action<00:03:31.600> out<00:03:31.750> of

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
you don't have to pull the action out of

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.860 
you don't have to pull the action out of
the<00:03:31.900> piano<00:03:32.110> to<00:03:32.320> use<00:03:32.710> this<00:03:32.890> tool<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.400> do<00:03:33.870> voicing

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
the piano to use this tool to do voicing

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.730 
the piano to use this tool to do voicing
and<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:36.670> nice<00:03:36.850> thing<00:03:37.150> about<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.630> is<00:03:37.690> that<00:03:38.350> if

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
and the nice thing about that is that if

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.030 
and the nice thing about that is that if
you're<00:03:38.920> in<00:03:39.220> a<00:03:39.580> concert<00:03:40.060> situation<00:03:40.810> or<00:03:41.050> or

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
you're in a concert situation or or

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.130 
you're in a concert situation or or
you're<00:03:42.459> tuning<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:43.000> piano<00:03:43.030> before<00:03:43.570> a<00:03:43.810> concert

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
you're tuning the piano before a concert

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.199 
you're tuning the piano before a concert
and<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.650> find<00:03:44.950> one<00:03:45.250> note<00:03:45.520> that<00:03:45.790> you<00:03:45.940> think

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
and you find one note that you think

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.260 
and you find one note that you think
needs<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:47.020> little<00:03:47.170> bit<00:03:47.350> of<00:03:47.410> work<00:03:47.970> simply<00:03:48.970> pull

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
needs a little bit of work simply pull

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.810 
my tuning kit pull this tool out and do
what<00:03:55.690> you<00:03:55.840> got<00:03:56.020> to<00:03:56.170> do<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.590> get<00:03:56.770> some<00:03:57.130> tone<00:03:57.520> and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
what you got to do to get some tone and

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.760 
what you got to do to get some tone and
some<00:03:57.970> life<00:03:58.180> back<00:03:58.209> into<00:03:58.570> that<00:03:58.990> string<00:03:59.440> or<00:03:59.650> that

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
some life back into that string or that

note so there you go a great tool when
you're<00:04:03.670> done<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.780> cap<00:04:05.110> itself<00:04:05.590> has<00:04:06.459> a<00:04:06.870> spot<00:04:07.870> at

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
you're done the cap itself has a spot at

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.470 
you're done the cap itself has a spot at
the<00:04:08.320> top<00:04:08.560> of<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.890> cap<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.760> accommodate<00:04:10.330> the
