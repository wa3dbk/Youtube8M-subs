00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
yes I I agree and I mean I was worried

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.400 
yes I I agree and I mean I was worried
about<00:02:33.860> writing<00:02:34.520> a<00:02:34.610> person<00:02:35.000> who<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.270> flawed<00:02:35.720> as

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
about writing a person who is flawed as

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.120 
about writing a person who is flawed as
we<00:02:36.680> all<00:02:36.860> are<00:02:37.060> it's<00:02:38.060> it's<00:02:38.750> easier<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.530> more

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
we all are it's it's easier and more

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.110 
we all are it's it's easier and more
tempting<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:41.239> write<00:02:41.450> somebody<00:02:41.750> who's<00:02:43.120> because

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
tempting to write somebody who's because

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.760 
tempting to write somebody who's because
I<00:02:44.209> because<00:02:44.569> I<00:02:44.690> needed<00:02:44.870> her<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.110> fall<00:02:45.500> off<00:02:45.739> a

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
I because I needed her to fall off a

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.090 
I because I needed her to fall off a
shelf<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.910> I<00:02:47.450> thought<00:02:47.810> well<00:02:47.989> so<00:02:48.650> while<00:02:48.860> she's

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
shelf and I thought well so while she's

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.310 
shelf and I thought well so while she's
on<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.550> Shelf<00:02:49.790> then<00:02:50.420> she<00:02:50.690> should<00:02:50.900> be<00:02:50.930> pretty

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
on the Shelf then she should be pretty

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.840 
on the Shelf then she should be pretty
capable<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.670> we<00:02:53.660> need<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.930> like<00:02:54.170> her<00:02:54.850> well

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
capable and we need to like her well

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.120 
capable and we need to like her well
actually<00:02:56.030> that's<00:02:56.510> just<00:02:56.780> not<00:02:57.350> very<00:02:57.380> truthful

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
actually that's just not very truthful

she<00:02:58.459> even<00:02:58.519> packs<00:02:58.820> her<00:02:59.030> suitcase

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
she even packs her suitcase

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.600 
she even packs her suitcase
prophetically<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:03.110> she's<00:03:03.590> got<00:03:03.830> four<00:03:04.190> tubes

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
prophetically and she's got four tubes

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.640 
prophetically and she's got four tubes
of<00:03:04.940> hair<00:03:05.150> removal<00:03:05.800> and<00:03:08.170> I<00:03:09.170> think<00:03:09.350> that's<00:03:09.500> the

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
of hair removal and I think that's the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.100 
of hair removal and I think that's the
beauty<00:03:09.980> because<00:03:10.100> mo<00:03:10.970> sees<00:03:11.269> that<00:03:11.510> in<00:03:11.660> door<00:03:11.870> she

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
and there has to be that that's a

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.420 
and there has to be that that's a
tribute<00:03:33.049> to<00:03:33.260> what<00:03:33.709> you've<00:03:33.890> done<00:03:34.100> up<00:03:34.250> until

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590
