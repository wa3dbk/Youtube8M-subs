00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
turn as you enter into turn three here

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.639 
turn as you enter into turn three here
it's<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.370> really<00:00:45.180> flat<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:46.170> were<00:00:46.230> going<00:00:46.500> really

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
it's a really flat you were going really

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.130 
it's a really flat you were going really
fast<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:48.000> realize<00:00:48.329> how<00:00:48.510> tight<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.930> turn

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
fast and you realize how tight of a turn

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.110 
fast and you realize how tight of a turn
it<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.440> especially<00:00:50.399> when<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.789> get<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
it is especially when you get to the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.520 
it is especially when you get to the
center<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.510> actually<00:00:51.840> kind<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.079> diamond<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
center you actually kind of diamond the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.500 
center you actually kind of diamond the
corner<00:00:52.829> off<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.579> let<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.820> get<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.090> real<00:00:54.300> low

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
corner off you let it get in real low

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.000 
corner off you let it get in real low
and<00:00:54.750> then<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.899> wash<00:00:55.079> off<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.559> center<00:00:55.860> and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
and then you wash off in the center and

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.770 
and then you wash off in the center and
then<00:00:56.340> drive<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.730> off<00:00:57.030> as<00:00:57.210> hard<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.719> on

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
then drive it off as hard as you can on

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.319 
then drive it off as hard as you can on
the<00:00:57.960> bottom<00:00:58.730> it's<00:00:59.730> like<00:00:59.910> any<00:01:00.090> typical

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the bottom it's like any typical

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.389 
the bottom it's like any typical
Louisville<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:00.989> guess<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.890> know<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.250> can

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
Louisville I guess you know if you can

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.650 
Louisville I guess you know if you can
stick<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.760> bottom<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.210> get<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.449> car<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
stick to the bottom and get the car to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
stick to the bottom and get the car to
turn<00:01:03.899> you're<00:01:04.080> going<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> be<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> pretty<00:01:04.589> good

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
turn you're going to be a pretty good

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.800 
turn you're going to be a pretty good
shape<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.280> with<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> current<00:01:06.299> track<00:01:06.570> being

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
shape but with the current track being

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.080 
shape but with the current track being
so<00:01:06.990> flat<00:01:07.229> too<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:08.430> really<00:01:08.610> hard<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.970> get

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
so flat too it's really hard to get

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.899 
so flat too it's really hard to get
forward<00:01:09.450> bite<00:01:09.600> up<00:01:09.780> off<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.140> corners<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.909> you

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
forward bite up off the corners so you

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.030 
forward bite up off the corners so you
know<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.450> combination<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.320> having<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.890> lot

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
know it's a combination of having a lot

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.130 
know it's a combination of having a lot
of<00:01:14.159> traction<00:01:14.430> having<00:01:15.299> good<00:01:15.450> tires<00:01:15.720> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
of traction having good tires and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.289 
of traction having good tires and
actually<00:01:17.070> having<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.670> lot<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.850> laps<00:01:18.090> around

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
actually having a lot of laps around

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.060 
actually having a lot of laps around
this<00:01:18.509> track<00:01:18.750> helps<00:01:19.110> too<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.830> tough<00:01:19.860> place

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
this track helps too it's a tough place

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.670 
this track helps too it's a tough place
