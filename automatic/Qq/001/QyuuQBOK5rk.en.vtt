00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:14.370
 the new golf watch of the brand 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.260
 garmin which is called the s6 approach so 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.840
 is the new the last born of the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:25.650
 golf range at garmin it's a watch 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:28.470
 100% connected color touch is who 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.300
 and that will allow you to have 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.660
 new information in your 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.719
 practical it integrates visualization 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.079
 during the course during your 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.149
 parts 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.940
 you have the option to slide on 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:47.250
 the screen is to be able to analyze 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.440
 the set of parameters that 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.350
 find in front of you it's a watch 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.760
 which also integrates swing analysis 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.880
 so partly in part training 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.580
 specifically 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.590
 and then she picks up all the 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.810
 particularities of a classic watch from 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.920
 at garmin with the green entrance 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.510
 all information concerning 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.100
 the green entrance the possibility of 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.620
 moving the flag actually makes it a 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.320
 connected mode to the east connectable to 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.260
 your smartphone so there would be this and 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.670
 android 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.950
 you have the opportunity therefore of the 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.030
 connect in bluetooth directly on 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.290
 your phone and you will receive 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.480
 what we call home leaves us mark 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.780
 notification ie you will receive 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.540
 your SMS calendar information 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.830
 call mails directly on your 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.550
 shows what lets you leave 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.930
 your phone in your bag or or 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.220
 simply not to finally all 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.300
 just do not see it with you 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.610
 and still have the information 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.500
 calendar sms or call 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.930
 mails directly on your watch then 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.000
 this function is disconnectable during 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.100
 parties or connectable only 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.910
 during the parties and so there we see 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.200
 that I had seven missed messages and 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.680
 so then I have the opportunity to 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.140
 to consult 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.660
 just pressed then we unlock the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.130
 watch and then we press the little 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.350
 tab is then here we see the 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.540
 who called me and who told me 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.670
 left a message about overcoming them on 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.170
 my phone and ditto for emails 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.620
 so you have the opportunity then 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.360
 to go straight in and see if 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.209
 it's a theft this mail so a message 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.880
 voice an email the ability to read 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.040
 the mails and to be able to parade and 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.240
 and the same for calendars alike 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.860
 for for sms 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.490
 when you are in the watch you are 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.630
 you unlock the watch here is where 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.130
 you have opportunity to start a 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:35.110
 part of manage your notifications 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.100
 the odometer so the number of the distance 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.870
 that you were able to browse 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.500
 thank you you have swing opportunity 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.300
 struts of analyzed your swing you have 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.910
 several proposals do it long the 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.160
 short or wood e.g. 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.300
 imagine we are going on a brain and 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.160
 then the watch will ask you 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.830
 to perform some either 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.540
 several swing to be able to caliber and 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.310
 the swing 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.659
 perfect in quotation marks you're going 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.739
 do several swinging according to 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:05.030
 that shows it will tell you if you 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.790
 how if you get closer to this 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.670
 swing or not and also she will give you 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.230
 information on the quality of the swing 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.120
 know if you have an attack that is 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.489
 too fast or just a gesture 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.379
 who afterwards goes too far or who is too 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.390
 quick exit so that's it 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.250
 can improve to improve your 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.720
 your swing there are different colors 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.900
 that appear for example if I'm going 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.700
 quite quickly at the beginning of my swing 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.200
 savalas if I go too fast on the 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.849
 watch you will have an indicator that you 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.530
 will say it's red so if you're 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.939
 went too fast and if we went out 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.530
 go slower it will put you that 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.819
 you are green and so there are different 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.430
 color code that allow you 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.879
 to improve your swing better 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.000
 the orient 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:46.220
 in fact the tempo so it's another 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.859
 function that is in the swing function 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.709
 it's a cadence m actually who will you 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.590
 indicated when you need to 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.970
 start the club when you have to 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.769
 and from the time you need 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.419
 hit the ball so it's a tempo 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.359
 that we must succeed in integrating into the 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:03.690
 head and that allows cadence is 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.850
 clocked the gesture and 2 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.130
 to have a better fluidity in his 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.480
 gesture the watch said a case of pimples 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.920
 which make it possible to orient oneself 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.480
 watch and otherwise the rest of the dial is 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.800
 tactile so for example if I want 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.730
 unlock the assembly took down to 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.440
 left so that puts me the little channel in 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.630
 party with workers and then you 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.770
 have the touch menu so they 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.050
 have concluded 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.930
 that's it then hop ever the light and 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.340
 so suddenly my to possibility of 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.660
 go down in the menus that's all is 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.210
 touch you have the alarms the 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.040
 configuration and then you can 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.350
 return very easily to the mode 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.970
 watch by going back through this 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.740
 little touch button near you have 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.150
 different buttons buttons that you 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.160
 allows to enter the game and therefore 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.390
 to search the satellites the difference 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.880
 is that already you have the possibility 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.630
 to visualize the whole course so 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.910
 of being able to evolve on 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.980
 on your journey directly into 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.960
 touch where you have a visibility 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:02.670
 in color of your of your hole and 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.240
 then you have the swing that is 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.460
 integrated 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.539
 so this this techno that allows 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.650
 to analyze your swing and to 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.759
 rework the sun exactly 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.669
 for the case in this medium the fact of 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.870
 see the courses here at the time you 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.889
 had the possible so on the floppy disk 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.270
 you have possibility to select 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.979
 to have the distance to the hole of the 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.630
 distance depending on where you have 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.400
 put your ball is now you have 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.199
 possibility also to have a 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.360
 visualization of the global course which 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:35.590
 allows you to have to see the 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.949
 different different variations of the 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:42.039
 field the bunkers to see the areas 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:43.539
 of water to see just about how 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.880
 is the hole we are on a 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:48.810
 rises to 399 euros and the watch is already 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.810
 available on the market
