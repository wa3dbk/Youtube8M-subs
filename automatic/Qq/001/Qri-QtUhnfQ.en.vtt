00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.750 
storage there we can see for this device
internal<00:02:12.450> number<00:02:12.630> is<00:02:12.750> around<00:02:13.019> 4<00:02:13.380> GB<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:14.310> if<00:02:14.580> I

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
internal number is around 4 GB so if I

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.610 
internal number is around 4 GB so if I
see<00:02:15.030> here<00:02:15.299> the<00:02:15.599> SD<00:02:15.930> card<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.319> is<00:02:16.470> showing

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
see here the SD card it is showing

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.729 
see here the SD card it is showing
around<00:02:16.799> 49<00:02:17.280> point<00:02:17.610> 70<00:02:18.000> B<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:19.170> scientist<00:02:19.620> is

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
around 49 point 70 B so the scientist is

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.500 
around 49 point 70 B so the scientist is
providing<00:02:20.160> us<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.310> very<00:02:20.489> good<00:02:20.579> space<00:02:21.209> even

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
providing us a very good space even

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.850 
providing us a very good space even
though<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.780> still<00:02:21.930> infected<00:02:22.140> with<00:02:22.410> GB<00:02:22.650> of

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
though it is still infected with GB of

internal storage EB memory card we kept

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.030 
internal storage EB memory card we kept
but<00:02:26.880> here<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.630> is<00:02:27.720> showing<00:02:27.840> around<00:02:28.140> some<00:02:28.260> 49.7

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
but here it is showing around some 49.7

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.949 
but here it is showing around some 49.7
1gb<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:29.609> it's<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.850> very<00:02:30.000> good<00:02:31.010> space<00:02:32.010> providing

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
1gb so it's a very good space providing

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.460 
1gb so it's a very good space providing
my<00:02:33.959> SanDisk<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:34.620> apps<00:02:34.950> see<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:36.239> saying<00:02:36.510> how

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
my SanDisk so apps see you saying how

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.729 
my SanDisk so apps see you saying how
much<00:02:37.880> things<00:02:38.880> there<00:02:39.209> so<00:02:40.019> we<00:02:40.230> have<00:02:40.380> all<00:02:40.590> these

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
much things there so we have all these

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.259 
much things there so we have all these
things<00:02:40.799> internal<00:02:41.430> storage<00:02:41.790> everything<00:02:42.180> we

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
things internal storage everything we

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.240 
things internal storage everything we
have<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.600> so<00:02:43.590> that's<00:02:43.950> it
