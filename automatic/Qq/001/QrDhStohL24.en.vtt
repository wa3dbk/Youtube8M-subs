00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
tiles at the beginning all right let's

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.040 
tiles at the beginning all right let's
go<00:00:33.410> that<00:00:34.410> very<00:00:34.710> simple<00:00:35.390> so<00:00:36.390> basically<00:00:36.809> if<00:00:36.930> you

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
go that very simple so basically if you

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.000 
go that very simple so basically if you
were<00:00:37.140> quick<00:00:37.380> enough<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.649> could<00:00:37.860> actually

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
were quick enough you could actually

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.639 
were quick enough you could actually
tell<00:00:38.420> where<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.540> match<00:00:39.690> tiles<00:00:40.020> were<00:00:40.320> I

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
tell where the match tiles were I

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.299 
tell where the match tiles were I
personally<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.850> saw<00:00:42.120> these<00:00:42.329> two<00:00:42.600> right<00:00:42.870> away

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
personally just saw these two right away

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.500 
personally just saw these two right away
but<00:00:44.309> I'm<00:00:44.430> not<00:00:44.579> sure<00:00:44.610> about<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.000> rest<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.480> I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
but I'm not sure about the rest so I

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.420 
but I'm not sure about the rest so I
guess<00:00:45.719> we'll<00:00:46.020> start<00:00:46.110> guessing<00:00:46.739> quote-unquote

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
guess we'll start guessing quote-unquote

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.709 
guess we'll start guessing quote-unquote

so<00:01:55.640> let's<00:01:56.640> start<00:01:56.790> guessing<00:01:58.189> game<00:01:59.189> mark<00:01:59.399> here

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
so let's start guessing game mark here

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.620 
so let's start guessing game mark here
The<00:02:00.540> Elements<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.869> Harmony<00:02:01.759> the<00:02:02.759> bird<00:02:03.090> which

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
The Elements of Harmony the bird which

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.510 
The Elements of Harmony the bird which
is<00:02:03.810> I'm<00:02:04.409> not<00:02:04.530> sure<00:02:04.680> whose<00:02:04.860> cutie<00:02:05.159> mark<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.399> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
is I'm not sure whose cutie mark is the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.459 
is I'm not sure whose cutie mark is the
bird<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:06.030> guess<00:02:06.299> it's<00:02:06.630> not<00:02:06.719> they're<00:02:07.110> not<00:02:07.229> all

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
bird I guess it's not they're not all

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.869 
bird I guess it's not they're not all
cutie<00:02:07.950> marks<00:02:09.140> anyway<00:02:10.489> buckskin<00:02:11.489> mark<00:02:11.700> here

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
cutie marks anyway buckskin mark here

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.680 
cutie marks anyway buckskin mark here
yeah<00:02:14.879> that's<00:02:15.060> actually<00:02:15.209> just<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.690> lot<00:02:15.900> harder

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
yeah that's actually just a lot harder

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.520 
yeah that's actually just a lot harder
just<00:02:18.690> because<00:02:18.750> how<00:02:19.050> big<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.980> whole<00:02:20.190> board<00:02:20.819> is

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
just because how big the whole board is

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.690 
just because how big the whole board is
you<00:02:22.530> know<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.980> distant<00:02:23.940> wit

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.280 

the<00:02:27.700> earth<00:02:27.880> is<00:02:28.180> down<00:02:28.540> there<00:02:31.140> do<00:02:32.140> i<00:02:32.170> see

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
the earth is down there do i see

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.890 
the earth is down there do i see
appletalk<00:02:32.770> skidmark<00:02:33.220> before<00:02:33.520> I<00:02:33.760> think<00:02:34.690> I<00:02:34.720> did

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
appletalk skidmark before I think I did

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.340 
appletalk skidmark before I think I did
and<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.650> was<00:02:35.800> right<00:02:35.920> over<00:02:35.980> there<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:40.350> I'm

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
and it was right over there and I'm

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.830 
and it was right over there and I'm
starting<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.710> forget<00:02:41.830> about<00:02:42.160> stuff<00:02:42.840> which

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
starting to forget about stuff which

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.540 
starting to forget about stuff which
means<00:02:44.080> my<00:02:44.200> score<00:02:44.590> will<00:02:44.740> be<00:02:44.770> excessively

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
means my score will be excessively

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.030 
means my score will be excessively
terrible<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.320> suppose<00:02:47.590> that's<00:02:47.740> worth

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
terrible but I suppose that's worth

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.280 
terrible but I suppose that's worth
showing<00:02:48.370> maybe<00:02:49.000> flush<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:49.990> will<00:02:50.110> have<00:02:50.230> a

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
showing maybe flush I will have a

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.710 
showing maybe flush I will have a
disappointed<00:02:50.860> look<00:02:50.890> on<00:02:51.340> how<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:51.970> performed

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
disappointed look on how I performed

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.620 
disappointed look on how I performed
back<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.200> here<00:02:54.150> although<00:02:55.150> she's<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.510> one

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
back to here although she's the one

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.010 
back to here although she's the one
pushing<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:56.050> buttons<00:02:57.660> every<00:02:58.660> supposed<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.960> be

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
pushing the buttons every supposed to be

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.460 
pushing the buttons every supposed to be
playing<00:02:59.290> together<00:02:59.470> to<00:02:59.800> compete<00:03:00.070> I<00:03:01.290> guess<00:03:02.290> we

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
playing together to compete I guess we

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
playing together to compete I guess we
are<00:03:05.790> ash<00:03:06.790> still<00:03:07.300> still<00:03:08.140> very<00:03:08.590> positive<00:03:09.130> even

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
are ash still still very positive even

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.650 
are ash still still very positive even
when<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:09.820> perform<00:03:10.350> excessively<00:03:11.350> terribly<00:03:12.660> ok

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
when you perform excessively terribly ok

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.440 
when you perform excessively terribly ok
let's<00:03:13.900> let's<00:03:14.320> actually<00:03:14.500> try<00:03:14.890> this<00:03:15.100> time<00:03:15.700> let's

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
let's let's actually try this time let's

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.090 
let's let's actually try this time let's
try<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:16.630> remember<00:03:16.900> everything<00:03:17.080> on<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:17.890> first

doesn't actually let us show you where
everything<00:03:25.390> is<00:03:25.960> so<00:03:26.890> guessing<00:03:27.760> time<00:03:29.550> wow<00:03:30.550> I

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850

actually got my first try in its

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:42.850 
actually got my first try in its
Applejack<00:03:33.010> skidmark<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.610> how<00:03:34.420> appropriate

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:52.339 

it's<00:03:43.860> harmony<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:45.510> bird<00:03:47.330> earth<00:03:50.450> also<00:03:51.450> yea

it's harmony the bird earth also yea
after<00:03:52.709> in<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.970> difficulty<00:03:54.870> aw<00:03:55.250> dang<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.400> I

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
after in this difficulty aw dang it I

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:02.199 
after in this difficulty aw dang it I
can't<00:03:56.610> screw<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.090> up<00:03:57.950> what<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:58.980> waste<00:03:59.250> ah

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.740 

there<00:04:03.209> we<00:04:03.299> go<00:04:03.950> precise<00:04:04.950> cutie<00:04:05.220> mark<00:04:05.599> gets<00:04:06.599> it

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
there we go precise cutie mark gets it

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.580 
there we go precise cutie mark gets it
again<00:04:07.730> letter<00:04:08.730> I<00:04:09.120> think<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.569> letter<00:04:09.750> was<00:04:09.959> over

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
again letter I think the letter was over

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:20.360 
again letter I think the letter was over
here<00:04:10.920> no<00:04:11.549> that's<00:04:11.760> it<00:04:13.700> okay<00:04:17.600> okay<00:04:18.600> I<00:04:19.370> suppose

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
here no that's it okay okay I suppose

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.590 
here no that's it okay okay I suppose
this<00:04:20.549> supposed<00:04:20.910> to<00:04:21.000> be<00:04:21.090> confusing<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:23.600> guess

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
this supposed to be confusing I guess

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.940 
this supposed to be confusing I guess
for<00:04:24.750> some<00:04:24.810> people<00:04:25.139> it<00:04:25.260> is

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.220 

you<00:04:28.950> know<00:04:29.040> i'm<00:04:29.190> performing<00:04:29.490> actually<00:04:30.300> really

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
you know i'm performing actually really

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.150 
you know i'm performing actually really
well<00:04:31.440> and<00:04:31.830> well<00:04:32.160> not<00:04:32.370> really<00:04:32.730> really<00:04:33.210> well<00:04:33.360> but

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
well and well not really really well but

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.770 
well and well not really really well but
for<00:04:35.160> level<00:04:35.580> three<00:04:35.790> difficulty<00:04:36.300> i'm<00:04:36.570> only

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
for level three difficulty i'm only

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.680 
for level three difficulty i'm only
going<00:04:36.960> to<00:04:37.020> have<00:04:37.110> it<00:04:37.380> like<00:04:37.830> two<00:04:38.730> positive<00:04:39.390> moves

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
going to have it like two positive moves

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.470 
going to have it like two positive moves
that's<00:04:40.410> where<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.740> smartest<00:04:41.310> ask<00:04:41.910> we<00:04:42.120> a

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
that's where the smartest ask we a

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.160 
that's where the smartest ask we a
flourish<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.200> and<00:04:43.500> I<00:04:43.770> gotta<00:04:43.950> celesta<00:04:44.910> rank<00:04:45.170> for

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
flourish I and I gotta celesta rank for

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:52.760 
flourish I and I gotta celesta rank for
this<00:04:46.320> huh<00:04:47.130> so<00:04:47.910> I<00:04:47.940> guess<00:04:48.410> one<00:04:49.410> positive<00:04:51.380> move<00:04:52.380> on

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
this huh so I guess one positive move on

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.020 
this huh so I guess one positive move on
the<00:04:52.890> center<00:04:53.160> of<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.280> screen<00:04:53.430> is<00:04:53.640> worse<00:04:53.790> than<00:04:53.910> a

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
the center of the screen is worse than a

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.870 
the center of the screen is worse than a
or<00:04:54.360> zero<00:04:54.690> moves<00:04:54.930> i<00:04:55.080> guess<00:04:55.260> it's<00:04:56.250> very<00:04:56.460> easy<00:04:56.640> to

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
or zero moves i guess it's very easy to

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.340 
or zero moves i guess it's very easy to
get<00:04:57.000> an<00:04:57.150> e<00:04:57.300> rank<00:04:57.600> is<00:04:57.780> what<00:04:57.930> i'm<00:04:58.020> trying<00:04:58.230> to<00:04:58.260> say

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
get an e rank is what i'm trying to say
