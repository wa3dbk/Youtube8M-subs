 graduate remember 61 81 102 x 122 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.360
 centimeters this smart design of 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.190
 Modules that are easy and fast adjustable 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.780
 of riding and also responsible 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.430
 allow him to extend or contribute 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.230
 custom dealer 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.030
 will not have the need to go back to 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.500
 buy another scenario the construction 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.290
 of these off-road scenarios 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.820
 will resist the inclemency of use and if 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.770
 have the need to change their 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.540
 stage or degrade height only

 all feet connecting the part 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.270
 of the extension tube and the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.310
 second bases a graduate and ensure the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.510
 tube and the intermediate extension to the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.270
 height that you would like to have your 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.860
 scenario then positions the four 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.410
 feet on the ground where you would like 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.180
 locate the first platform if you

 adjustment screw at the base of each 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.310
 one of the feet at the required height 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.470
 then slide the panels 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.390
 side by putting the stirrups on the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.369
 slots of the new color marked 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.500
 blue and secure them with the pins of 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.280
 lock make sure the frame is 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.050
 level 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.570
 using our level an instrument of 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.979
 easy to use if the brand is uneven 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.990
 just turn the screws 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.450
 graduation located in the bases of 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.190
 the feet then place the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.230
 platform on the frame 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.090
 that simple and now simply 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.580
 Repeat the same procedure with the

 components can also be easily 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.570
 raise a section of the stage or create 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.790
 multiple levels to position a 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.880
 choir or just add an extension 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.080

 complex bases to give traction 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.510
 during assembly on soft ground 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.670
 or small doubles mats for
