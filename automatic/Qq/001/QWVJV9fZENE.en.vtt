SIF<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.579> manner<00:01:32.819> actually<00:01:33.090> makes<00:01:33.450> what<00:01:33.929> he

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
SIF and manner actually makes what he

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.300 
SIF and manner actually makes what he
sends<00:01:34.319> I<00:01:34.500> suppose<00:01:34.829> if<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.979> could<00:01:35.100> take<00:01:35.219> the
