structure I mean bridge you can kind of
see<00:01:22.280> looks<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.430> now<00:01:23.930> but<00:01:24.930> now<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.799> actually

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
see looks like now but now it's actually

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.940 
see looks like now but now it's actually
really<00:01:26.340> fenced<00:01:26.909> off<00:01:27.119> her<00:01:27.840> has<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> huge<00:01:28.710> wall

around<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.790> was<00:01:30.210> lucky<00:01:30.540> enough<00:01:30.570> even<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.350> see

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
around it I was lucky enough even to see

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.910 
around it I was lucky enough even to see
this<00:01:31.860> when<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.220> was<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.520> Korea<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.659> when<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.619> saw

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
this when I was in Korea and when I saw

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.429 
this when I was in Korea and when I saw
this<00:01:35.130> structure<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:36.119> set<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.720> came<00:01:37.020> out<00:01:37.229> I

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
this structure this set that came out I

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.749 
this structure this set that came out I
was<00:01:37.560> really<00:01:37.700> excited<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.729> get<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:40.549> so<00:01:41.549> there

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
was really excited to get it so there

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.219 
was really excited to get it so there
you<00:01:41.850> go<00:01:42.060> some<00:01:42.420> facts<00:01:42.689> about<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.790> and<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:46.020> rest

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
you go some facts about it and the rest

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.600 
you go some facts about it and the rest
of<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> book<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.829> pretty<00:01:47.070> much<00:01:47.310> just

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
of the book is pretty much just

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.940 
of the book is pretty much just
instructions<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:49.380> how<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> put<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.950> together

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
instructions on how to put it together

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.770 
instructions on how to put it together
so<00:01:52.950> lots<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.549> little<00:01:53.729> pieces<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.420> think<00:01:54.450> they

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
so lots of little pieces I think they

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.289 
so lots of little pieces I think they
did<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.229> great<00:01:55.560> job<00:01:55.590> replicating<00:01:56.299> this

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
did a great job replicating this

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.120 
did a great job replicating this
structure<00:01:58.290> into<00:01:58.770> Lego<00:01:59.719> and<00:02:00.719> here<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.860> Lego

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
structure into Lego and here is the Lego

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.319 
structure into Lego and here is the Lego
structure<00:02:02.579> at<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.030> semi<00:02:03.270> moon<00:02:05.000> structure<00:02:06.000> and

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
structure at the semi moon structure and

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.699 
structure at the semi moon structure and
I<00:02:06.450> had<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.780> take<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.079> apart<00:02:07.380> just<00:02:07.469> to

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
I had to take it apart just to

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:16.830 
I had to take it apart just to
get<00:02:08.950> in<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.159> box<00:02:14.939> okay<00:02:15.939> and<00:02:16.269> here<00:02:16.569> you<00:02:16.719> can

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
get in the box okay and here you can

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.229 
get in the box okay and here you can
kind<00:02:17.109> of<00:02:17.230> see<00:02:18.450> all<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.659> detail<00:02:20.109> on<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:22.090> has

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
kind of see all the detail on it it has

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.050 
kind of see all the detail on it it has
a<00:02:22.269> great<00:02:22.689> little<00:02:23.370> tunnel<00:02:24.370> right<00:02:24.519> there

a great little tunnel right there
that's<00:02:25.359> the<00:02:25.569> gate<00:02:27.090> they<00:02:28.090> did<00:02:28.629> a<00:02:29.159> really<00:02:30.159> cool

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
that's the gate they did a really cool

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.780 
that's the gate they did a really cool
job<00:02:30.639> of<00:02:30.879> using<00:02:31.090> hinges<00:02:31.719> hinge<00:02:32.379> pieces<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.609> do

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
job of using hinges hinge pieces to do

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:46.229 
job of using hinges hinge pieces to do
this<00:02:43.919> and<00:02:44.919> I<00:02:45.010> love<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.459> plates<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:46.000> come

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
this and I love the plates that come

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:53.580 
this and I love the plates that come
with<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.480> also<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:49.239> you<00:02:49.299> can<00:02:49.599> see<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:53.290> plate

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
with it also so you can see the plate
