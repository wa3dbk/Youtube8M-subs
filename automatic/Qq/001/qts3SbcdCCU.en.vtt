00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.830
 hi to all spatogames users I am 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.530
 Dr. White we are here today with a new one 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.289
 video dedicated to fifa 15 latest teams 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.640
 we continue our reviews of 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.720
 players and after seeing rooney 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.029
 this week we talk about a 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.330
 player that we had already analyzed 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.039
 in our challenge against royce 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.289
 we are talking about franck ribery that 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.089
 we had analyzed in the basic version 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.580
 which was the only one available this 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.640
 week after the good performances that 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.520
 had put in series with the bayern 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.250
 monaco came out in its version in 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.370
 oven a first version then 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.280
 enhanced by alive 15 ribery and I was 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.079
 liked but let's see if that 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.789
 player who has anyway 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.910
 statistics are more good but not so 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:57.340
 the more worth the expense 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.410
 let's start with speed speed we have a 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.340
 we can fast this player 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.890
 say it very very agile though also the 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.170
 basic version was already so therefore not 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.299
 I can say that there was a big one 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.369
 increase and if there has been it is not that it is then 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.610
 so visible the only thing in which 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.040
 shame a little ribery and the basic version 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.360
 it was physical strength and trust me here too 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.509
 the situation is not improved 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.790
 so it's not like he can go 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.820
 to exalt the opposing defenders of physique 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.310
 indeed you can see he loses many fights 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.200
 physical is not like a neymar for example 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.600
 that although he is not himself 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.700
 very high gave me more security from 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.680
 physical point of view 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.960
 as for the shooting we must 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.820
 to say that it is still very good 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.890
 we had found it as a good one 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.020
 finalizer because he still managed to 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.000
 score not an excellent finisher 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.310
 so there are better finalizers than 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.460
 he is also thinking of outsiders 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.899
 at the same royce a neymar to the Christian 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.149
 ronaldo etcetera etc. 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.590
 however ribery knows signal above all with 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.280
 his precision shot 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.619
 I noticed that still a great shot from 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.830
 out of the air above all I did 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.180
 really wonderful goals with ribery ce 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.100
 there is one in particular that I put there 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.390
 that puts a goal on the second post 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.430
 incredible though 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.830
 I want to remember that he already did it more or 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.110
 minus the basic four state version 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.080
 weaker as its basic version 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.040
 so there was no upgrade 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.550
 net seems almost a half version 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.560
 between the base and a real fit version 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.360
 a version a little half way not 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.640
 they wanted to increase them so many 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.110
 statistics to make it known to 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.410
 hundred percent 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.420
 good rigors these have improved yes 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.350
 some extra points are good because 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.540
 however I managed to score 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.950
 quite easily rigor with the 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.170
 basic version a little less and the 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.030
 locations are very good if you like it 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.530
 as always the run of ribery that a 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.360
 particular 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.250
 dribbling here too great but it was already 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.690
 excellent basic 5-star skill version 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.430
 so if you love skills and the player 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.739
 which makes for you excellent ball control 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.850
 excellent agility this nothing to say 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.920
 good passages because he knows anyway 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.989
 passing the ball knows how to cross then 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.670
 will attract double then when i go to 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.350
 pull I can unload the ball 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.720
 and give it to a free and physical companion 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.810
 so we said it's not that great 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.070
 we understand that this frees for the 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.709
 my way of playing for you maybe 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.650
 you will be found of God is not burglary but 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.310
 probably the most scarce among the tops 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.709
 player 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.329
 then we get there that you are not 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.880
 recommended for this player vi 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.350
 I would say at the base because we have seen 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.090
 however, he can do more or less everything 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.560
 finalizer we set the shooting there 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.060
 physical to give him a few points in 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.489
 a few points more than finalization 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.100
 plus physical strength to use 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.880
 this player first of all costs 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.100
 a lot because it costs more than 2 million 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.440
 so it's not a low figure you can 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.040
 obviously use it as an as in a 4 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.380
 3 3 on the france then all the players 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.780
 french we have benzema we poop 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.810
 so we have so many players 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.390
 interesting but paradoxically ribery 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.400
 not being a big greider respect 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.049
 the basic version is more usable from 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.510
 people who can do this thing here 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.370
 then a 4 3 2 1 with all players 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.169
 best of the bundesliga 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.910
 so with robben team of the year new 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.530
 york team of the year muller his 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.990
 second version in shape because why 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.300
 costing so many since there is no 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.770
 so big upgrade compared to 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.120
 basic version this obviously second 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.229
 me then maybe you found yourself 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.660
 very well 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.370
 ribery is easily usable 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.889
 as its basic version rather than 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.620
 take this version in shape 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:45.500
 conclusion has a good speed a 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.660
 best shot excellent britain 5 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.699
 stars skill the ball control attracts the 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.510
 double then in attack however it is 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.860
 a constant threat but on the other hand 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.160
 very very similar to the basic version 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.930
 so in my opinion the price is excessive 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.490
 because there is not so much 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.280
 difference would not be my first 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.199
 choice among the as 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.320
 if I have to choose an extra free budget 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:11.320
 probably neymar is stronger and less 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.510
 decisive of the top players because anyway 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.760
 I noticed that it is difficult to resolve it 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.490
 he the game by himself how can he make a 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.960
 ronaldo po as other people can do 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.840
 need a team so i will 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.650
 I would say if you have for example a budget of 2 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.930
 million and a half 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.120
 pulls out two million and three for ribery 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.620
 for example you shouldn't take the 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.150
 version according to ribery and let them 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.010
 around a strong team anyway 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.169
 would have made place for a team with 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.360
 Iberian and many players scarce better 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.310
 is a team with basic and many ribery 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.030
 strong players to tell you a little what 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.190
 think of it 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.190
 we will see each other soon
