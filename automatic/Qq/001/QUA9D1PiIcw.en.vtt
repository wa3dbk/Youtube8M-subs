00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.160 

okay<00:00:02.970> so<00:00:03.030> I'm<00:00:03.330> just<00:00:03.480> gonna<00:00:03.600> try<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:03.810> explain

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
okay so I'm just gonna try and explain

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.950 
okay so I'm just gonna try and explain
quickly<00:00:04.380> how<00:00:04.770> that<00:00:05.250> only<00:00:05.370> works<00:00:05.730> it's<00:00:06.690> a

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
quickly how that only works it's a

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.740 
quickly how that only works it's a
different<00:00:07.470> way<00:00:07.560> of<00:00:07.589> expressing<00:00:08.309> time<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:09.120> the

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
different way of expressing time and the

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.020 
different way of expressing time and the
way<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:09.929> works<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:11.010> straight<00:00:11.340> line<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.820> the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
way it works the straight line is the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.740 
way it works the straight line is the
horizon

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
horizon

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.919 
horizon
so<00:00:13.130> whenever<00:00:14.130> just<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.849> Mac<00:00:15.059> did<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.540> biggest

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
so whenever just the Mac did the biggest

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.050 
so whenever just the Mac did the biggest
circle<00:00:16.260> there's<00:00:17.039> like<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> whole<00:00:17.609> document

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
circle there's like a whole document

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.810 
circle there's like a whole document
whenever<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.140> dot<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.590> above<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.369> line<00:00:20.520> that

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
whenever this dot is above the line that

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.570 
whenever this dot is above the line that
means<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:22.100> between<00:00:23.100> 6<00:00:23.580> a.m.<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.539> 6<00:00:25.019> p.m.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.890 

weights<00:00:29.580> under<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.390> means<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.660> Sun<00:00:30.810> is

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
weights under that means the Sun is

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.639 
weights under that means the Sun is
setting<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.260> it's<00:00:32.180> after<00:00:33.180> 6<00:00:33.480> p.m.<00:00:33.540> until<00:00:33.899> 6

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
setting and it's after 6 p.m. until 6

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.770 
setting and it's after 6 p.m. until 6
a.m.<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:36.230> every<00:00:37.230> line<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:38.640> portion<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
a.m. and every line is a portion of the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.240 
a.m. and every line is a portion of the
previous<00:00:40.230> line<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.090> looking<00:00:45.860> like<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> first

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
previous line so looking like the first

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.850 
previous line so looking like the first
line<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.610> good<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.350> first<00:00:49.530> dot<00:00:49.680> is

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
line is good this is the first dot is

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.250 
line is good this is the first dot is
going<00:00:50.100> around<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.760> circle<00:00:50.910> one<00:00:51.270> time<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
going around the circle one time the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.750 
going around the circle one time the
second<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.800> going<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.100> go<00:00:53.190> around<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.489> circle

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
second is going to go around the circle

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.150 
second is going to go around the circle
two<00:00:53.879> times<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.420> we<00:00:54.480> ended<00:00:55.469> four<00:00:55.680> times<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
two times and we ended four times in the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.740 
two times and we ended four times in the
eight<00:00:56.340> times<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:57.149> aligned<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:59.750> what

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
eight times and that's aligned and what

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.070 
eight times and that's aligned and what
we<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:00.989> see<00:01:01.109> here<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.440> like<00:01:02.480> stuff<00:01:03.480> lined<00:01:03.690> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
we can see here is like stuff lined and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.170 
we can see here is like stuff lined and
there's<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:04.619> four<00:01:05.010> four<00:01:05.430> portions<00:01:05.640> eight

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
there's like four four portions eight

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.770 
there's like four four portions eight
portions<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.930> system<00:01:07.380> um<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:09.420> yeah<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.630> is

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
portions in system um so yeah this is

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.270 
portions in system um so yeah this is
the<00:01:09.900> house<00:01:10.229> Network<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.479> right<00:01:12.479> now<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:14.450> 5:15

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
the house Network so right now it's 5:15

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.380 
the house Network so right now it's 5:15
so<00:01:18.890> this<00:01:19.890> circle<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.549> hit<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
so this circle is going to hit the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:30.990 
so this circle is going to hit the
origin<00:01:21.750> line<00:01:21.930> 6<00:01:22.380> o'clock<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.520> small

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.760 

this<00:01:32.000> one<00:01:32.179> is<00:01:32.719> going<00:01:32.899> to<00:01:32.960> be<00:01:33.049> right<00:01:33.229> on<00:01:33.259> top<00:01:33.530> at

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
this one is going to be right on top at

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.349 
this one is going to be right on top at
6:00<00:01:34.520> p.m.<00:01:34.640> as<00:01:35.090> it<00:01:35.929> was<00:01:36.140> at<00:01:36.710> noon<00:01:37.460> at<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.060> Bob

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
6:00 p.m. as it was at noon at the Bob

6:00 p.m. as it was at noon at the Bob
Ryan<00:01:38.569> bar<00:01:39.159> so<00:01:40.159> well<00:01:40.819> I<00:01:40.880> hope<00:01:41.060> this<00:01:41.270> explains

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
Ryan bar so well I hope this explains

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.609 
Ryan bar so well I hope this explains
outsource<00:01:43.000> I've<00:01:44.000> actually<00:01:44.179> I<00:01:44.630> did<00:01:45.259> an<00:01:45.350> update

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
outsource I've actually I did an update

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.490 
outsource I've actually I did an update
for<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.890> for<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.369> project<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:46.959> now<00:01:47.959> instead

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
for the for the project and now instead

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.050 
for the for the project and now instead
of<00:01:48.590> just<00:01:48.709> showing<00:01:49.009> that<00:01:49.369> this<00:01:49.520> is<00:01:49.579> the<00:01:49.789> Intel

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
of just showing that this is the Intel

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.580 
of just showing that this is the Intel
time<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:50.450> looks<00:01:50.600> like<00:01:50.719> binary<00:01:51.109> clock<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:53.590> d8

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
time that looks like binary clock and d8

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.580 
time that looks like binary clock and d8
is<00:01:54.829> like<00:01:55.490> compressed<00:01:56.030> time<00:01:56.439> there's<00:01:57.439> some

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
is like compressed time there's some

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.359 
is like compressed time there's some
documentation<00:01:57.740> I<00:01:58.689> like<00:01:59.689> the<00:02:00.470> way<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.709> works<00:02:00.950> is

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
documentation I like the way it works is

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:10.509 
documentation I like the way it works is
basically<00:02:08.200> there<00:02:09.200> are<00:02:09.229> 16<00:02:09.619> possible<00:02:09.649> patterns

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
basically there are 16 possible patterns

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.900 
basically there are 16 possible patterns
like<00:02:10.819> hexadecimals<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:12.410> there<00:02:13.129> are<00:02:13.280> there<00:02:13.670> are

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
like hexadecimals so there are there are

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.789 
like hexadecimals so there are there are
all<00:02:14.540> assigned<00:02:15.220> at<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.280> small<00:02:16.519> value<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:17.799> the

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
all assigned at a small value and the

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.250 
all assigned at a small value and the
two<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.730> two<00:02:19.760> patterns<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.840> first<00:02:21.049> one<00:02:21.170> the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
two the two patterns the first one the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.949 
two the two patterns the first one the
second<00:02:21.500> one<00:02:21.530> that<00:02:21.890> is<00:02:22.069> in<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.640> default<00:02:23.299> until

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
second one that is in the default until

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.530 
second one that is in the default until
time<00:02:24.549> are<00:02:25.549> given<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:27.319> know<00:02:27.440> pattern<00:02:27.680> so<00:02:28.540> if

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
time are given a you know pattern so if

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.180 
time are given a you know pattern so if
we<00:02:29.660> look<00:02:29.780> at<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.530> project<00:02:30.980> here<00:02:31.989> at<00:02:32.989> t8<00:02:33.530> t<00:02:34.040> is

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
we look at the project here at t8 t is

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.699 
we look at the project here at t8 t is
going<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.370> be<00:02:34.519> this<00:02:35.269> this<00:02:35.510> one<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:35.959> one<00:02:36.530> one

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
going to be this this one so one one

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.670 
going to be this this one so one one
zero<00:02:36.920> one<00:02:37.040> one<00:02:37.310> zero<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.660> once<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.380> reserves

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
zero one one zero and once the reserves

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.389 
zero one one zero and once the reserves
are<00:02:39.799> is<00:02:40.780> eight<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:42.709> we<00:02:42.739> got<00:02:42.950> t8<00:02:43.310> that's<00:02:44.269> it
