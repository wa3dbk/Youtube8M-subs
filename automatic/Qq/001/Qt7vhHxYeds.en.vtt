and<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.480> nice<00:00:36.630> thing<00:00:36.900> is<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:37.740 
and a nice thing is that we have the

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.890 
and a nice thing is that we have the
rotary<00:00:38.100> wheel<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.940> allows<00:00:39.240> you<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.450> very

like<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.399> we've<00:00:45.269> considered<00:00:46.079> ourselves<00:00:46.260> on

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
like this we've considered ourselves on

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.910 
like this we've considered ourselves on
the<00:00:47.039> what<00:00:47.519> we<00:00:47.579> call<00:00:47.609> the<00:00:47.940> Leanback

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
the what we call the Leanback

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.349 
the what we call the Leanback
functionality<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.190> you're<00:00:50.370> sitting<00:00:50.579> relaxed

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
functionality so you're sitting relaxed

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:52.729 
functionality so you're sitting relaxed
they<00:00:51.449> want<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.659> listen<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.899> some<00:00:52.140> music<00:00:52.289> and

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
they want to listen to some music and

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.889 
they want to listen to some music and
that's<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:53.010> we<00:00:53.159> have<00:00:53.309> implemented<00:00:53.940> what<00:00:54.780> we

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
that's what we have implemented what we

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.039 
that's what we have implemented what we
have<00:00:55.049> not<00:00:55.199> implemented<00:00:55.589> is<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:57.049> programming

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.049 
have not implemented is the programming

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:59.660 
have not implemented is the programming
and<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> data<00:00:58.559> setting<00:00:59.010> up<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.280> system

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and the data setting up of the system

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.579 
and the data setting up of the system
therefore<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.030> still<00:01:00.239> need<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> service<00:01:00.989> ec

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
therefore you still need the service ec

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.500 
therefore you still need the service ec
application<00:01:02.189> we<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.299> rest

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
application we have to the rest

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.249 
application we have to the rest
everything<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.430> there<00:01:05.899> what<00:01:06.899> else<00:01:07.049> could<00:01:07.200> you

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
everything is there what else could you

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.859 
everything is there what else could you
do<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.619> control<00:01:07.979> as<00:01:08.159> well<00:01:08.479> well<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.689> fact

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
do is control as well well in fact

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.200 
do is control as well well in fact
anything<00:01:10.409> for<00:01:11.310> instance<00:01:11.580> here<00:01:11.789> the<00:01:11.909> volume

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
anything for instance here the volume

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.660 
anything for instance here the volume
control<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.140> see<00:01:13.350> right<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.399> now

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
control that you see right here it's now

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.180 
control that you see right here it's now
linked<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.539> the<00:01:15.869> ok<00:01:16.319> that's<00:01:16.590> being<00:01:16.770> used<00:01:16.860> by

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
linked to the ok that's being used by

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.789 
linked to the ok that's being used by
another<00:01:17.369> user<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.020> multi<00:01:19.020> multi<00:01:19.500> panel

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
ok I have to answer today that they are

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.249 
ok I have to answer today that they are
touching<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.159> right<00:01:26.310> there<00:01:26.479> but<00:01:27.479> instead<00:01:27.899> of

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
touching it right there but instead of

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.809 
touching it right there but instead of
the<00:01:28.440> solar<00:01:28.619> system<00:01:28.709> the<00:01:29.159> volume<00:01:29.459> is<00:01:29.580> always

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
the solar system the volume is always

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.600 
the solar system the volume is always
related<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.380> solar<00:01:31.590> system<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.490> just

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
related to the solar system here is just

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.850 
related to the solar system here is just
related<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.240> indiscreet<00:01:34.020> an<00:01:34.140> AV<00:01:34.409> receiver

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
related to indiscreet an AV receiver

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.010 
related to indiscreet an AV receiver
which<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.159> connected<00:01:35.610> right<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.539> first<00:01:36.750> you

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
which is connected right but first you

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.600 
which is connected right but first you
can<00:01:37.140> also<00:01:37.289> hear<00:01:37.770> select<00:01:38.159> your<00:01:38.250> lighting

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
can also hear select your lighting

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.190 
can also hear select your lighting
settings<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.179> then<00:01:39.209> we<00:01:39.479> can<00:01:39.690> change<00:01:39.929> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
settings and then we can change the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.930 
settings and then we can change the
dilute

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
dilute

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.570

for listening to music and they each
simply<00:01:43.970> go<00:01:44.150> come<00:01:44.600> back<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.350> in<00:01:45.770> fact<00:01:46.010> you<00:01:46.220> can

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
simply go come back so in fact you can

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.490 
simply go come back so in fact you can
control<00:01:46.730> your<00:01:46.910> all<00:01:47.120> or<00:01:47.390> just<00:01:47.450> with<00:01:47.960> one<00:01:48.140> panel

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.490 
the dishonest information is stored on
the<00:01:58.430> pc<00:01:58.820> but<00:01:59.300> we<00:01:59.450> also<00:01:59.630> have<00:01:59.900> our<00:01:59.990> systems

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
the pc but we also have our systems

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.230 
the pc but we also have our systems
where<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:00.770> get<00:02:00.950> a<00:02:00.980> resistor<00:02:01.550> that<00:02:01.700> supports<00:02:02.090> a

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
where you get a resistor that supports a

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.180 
where you get a resistor that supports a
cozy<00:02:02.690> and<00:02:02.990> that<00:02:03.530> where<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:03.830> have<00:02:03.980> the<00:02:04.130> ability

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
cozy and that where you have the ability

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.600 
cozy and that where you have the ability
to<00:02:04.550> do<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:05.720> get<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:06.080> information<00:02:06.290> or<00:02:07.280> using<00:02:07.550> a

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
to do to get the information or using a

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.340 
to do to get the information or using a
content<00:02:07.940> from<00:02:08.149> pc<00:02:08.810> as<00:02:08.930> well<00:02:08.960> yeah<00:02:09.350> yeah

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
content from pc as well yeah yeah

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.350 
content from pc as well yeah yeah
excellent
