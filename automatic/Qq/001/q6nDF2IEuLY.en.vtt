what<00:03:16.549> you<00:03:16.640> have<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.790> do<00:03:16.940> is<00:03:17.450> just<00:03:17.660> heat<00:03:17.900> it<00:03:17.930> up

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
what you have to do is just heat it up

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.259 
what you have to do is just heat it up
you<00:03:18.799> can<00:03:18.950> heat<00:03:19.070> it<00:03:19.100> up<00:03:19.190> in<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.400> microwave<00:03:19.519> but

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
you can heat it up in the microwave but

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.970 
you can heat it up in the microwave but
you<00:03:20.570> don't<00:03:20.720> want<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:21.049> overheat<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:21.769> because

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
you don't want to overheat it because

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.650 
you don't want to overheat it because
you<00:03:22.070> can<00:03:22.220> damage<00:03:22.489> it<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:22.940> it<00:03:23.209> actually<00:03:23.360> takes

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
you can damage it and it actually takes

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.940 
you can damage it and it actually takes
away<00:03:23.959> some<00:03:24.290> of<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:24.440> nutrients<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.600> the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
away some of the nutrients and the

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.770 
away some of the nutrients and the
healing<00:03:27.950> properties<00:03:28.160> are<00:03:28.579> in<00:03:28.850> shea<00:03:29.299> butter<00:03:29.570> so

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
healing properties are in shea butter so

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.479 
healing properties are in shea butter so

really hot and I call go I cover it up

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.259 
really hot and I call go I cover it up
so<00:03:41.110> no<00:03:42.110> water<00:03:42.380> can<00:03:42.650> go<00:03:42.799> down<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.130> drink<00:03:43.400> I<00:03:43.640> put

this in there and then the shea butter
melts<00:03:46.220> down<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:47.209> that's<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:47.510> best<00:03:47.690> way<00:03:47.870> that

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
melts down and that's the best way that

right now you're making it have that
shine<00:05:06.580> effect<00:05:07.570> and<00:05:08.470> you're<00:05:08.919> also<00:05:09.070> getting

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
shine effect and you're also getting

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.600 
shine effect and you're also getting
some<00:05:09.760> of<00:05:09.910> the<00:05:10.560> pomade<00:05:11.560> side<00:05:12.070> of<00:05:12.190> your<00:05:12.310> scalp

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
some of the pomade side of your scalp

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.570 
some of the pomade side of your scalp
which<00:05:13.270> in<00:05:13.450> turn<00:05:13.690> makes<00:05:14.320> your<00:05:14.500> hair<00:05:14.680> become

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
which in turn makes your hair become

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.840 
which in turn makes your hair become
more<00:05:15.790> healthy<00:05:16.000> in<00:05:16.419> the<00:05:16.960> long<00:05:16.990> run<00:05:17.730> that's<00:05:18.730> why

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
more healthy in the long run that's why

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.400 
more healthy in the long run that's why
I<00:05:18.910> like<00:05:19.060> using<00:05:19.240> natural<00:05:19.750> pins<00:05:19.960> because<00:05:20.230> if<00:05:20.350> you
