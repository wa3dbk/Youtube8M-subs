00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.200 
important for students to be learning
and<00:00:15.110> talking<00:00:15.500> about<00:00:15.710> these<00:00:15.920> issues<00:00:16.190> I<00:00:17.150> think

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
and talking about these issues I think

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.990 
and talking about these issues I think
it's<00:00:17.540> really<00:00:17.689> important<00:00:18.200> because<00:00:18.349> our<00:00:19.010> world

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
it's really important because our world

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.030 
it's really important because our world
is<00:00:20.180> so<00:00:20.390> mobilize<00:00:21.050> like<00:00:21.560> there's<00:00:21.770> so<00:00:21.920> much

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040 
is so mobilize like there's so much

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.040 
is so mobilize like there's so much
going<00:00:22.220> on<00:00:22.430> but<00:00:22.490> you<00:00:23.240> really<00:00:23.390> need<00:00:23.510> to<00:00:23.689> have<00:00:24.020> a

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
going on but you really need to have a

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.380 
going on but you really need to have a
more<00:00:24.380> well-rounded<00:00:24.800> video<00:00:25.400> of<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:25.670> news<00:00:25.880> and

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
more well-rounded video of the news and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.689 
more well-rounded video of the news and
i<00:00:26.900> think<00:00:27.110> that<00:00:27.320> the<00:00:27.890> newspapers<00:00:28.430> especially

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
i think that the newspapers especially

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.150 
i think that the newspapers especially
Salem's<00:00:29.300> early<00:00:29.570> lacking<00:00:29.990> on<00:00:30.230> global<00:00:30.650> news<00:00:30.830> and

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
Salem's early lacking on global news and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.189 
Salem's early lacking on global news and
so<00:00:31.640> it's<00:00:31.789> nice<00:00:31.970> to<00:00:32.119> have<00:00:32.180> as<00:00:32.360> elevation<00:00:32.840> get

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 
so it's nice to have as elevation get

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.490 
so it's nice to have as elevation get
that<00:00:33.320> information<00:00:33.590> like<00:00:34.460> our<00:00:35.390> future<00:00:35.870> we're

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
that information like our future we're

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.080

when we usually hear stuff on the news

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.779 
when we usually hear stuff on the news
it's<00:01:16.250> just<00:01:16.490> we<00:01:17.390> have<00:01:17.539> to<00:01:17.780> open<00:01:18.649> like<00:01:19.340> open<00:01:19.520> our
