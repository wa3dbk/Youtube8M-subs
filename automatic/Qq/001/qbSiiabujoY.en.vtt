00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.190
 friends today we are going to teach you 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.930
 make these beautiful petals that 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.420
 We have here so that you can 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.390
 elaborate flowers combining different 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.910
 petals or it can be the same petal in 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.150
 a single flower will be very nice 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.400
 and here we have used it to decorate 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.789
 these elastic bands that get in 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.910
 stores where they sell accessories or 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:29.029
 materials to make accessories here 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:33.290
 we have made it in a and color the 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.989
 petals combined with fabric petals 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:41.180
 in ribbon designs and decorated with faces 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:45.590
 of porcelain here we have runs 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.079
 of appointment of 2.5 centimeters wide and 10 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.570
 centimeters long 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.989
 the petals that we are going to elaborate here are 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.060
 super simple we have already taught them 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:59.770
 you are going to bend the diagonal ribbon 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.130
 then you give 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:06.010
 they roll back and stick the 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.530
 tips that are the same here 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.620
 you fold in half and then 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.440
 they lower the tapes so that they are left 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:18.910
 delgadita the part where we are going to spend 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.700
 the culture is going to be hot and there are 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.220
 automatically sealed the petals 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.080
 these are the ones that we are going to combine 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.470
 with which we are going to learn today 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.450
 different the tape of 2.5 centimeters 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.119
 wide to 20 centimeters 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.540
 long and about the size 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.300
 you can leave this or place 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.250
 the size that you want here we go 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:47.440
 to do the same procedure we double 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:50.940
 the diagonal ribbon went down and here and 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:55.730
 we have formed the petal 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:02:01.280
 here you are going to fold the ribbon 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:04.730
 this way it goes up and here you go to 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.370
 seal the tape they will use a needle 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.130
 that has a large hole to be able to 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.790
 introduce the tape there and start 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.790
 screw in 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.250
 to form what is the roll 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.790
 when they reach half of you 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.330
 they just turn the needle and 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.650
 it unrolls easily and you here 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.720
 they finish making 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.730
 the petal unites the one by the middle here 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.269
 let's cut what's left of the 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.269
 tape 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.860
 let's seal with heat 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.660
 and here we already have 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.330
 we are going to place to arm these 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.819
 flowers three petals of each of 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.690
 those that we have made with roll and 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.569
 alone and so we can form a 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.690
 little flower with six petals or if you 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.319
 they want they can elaborate the single with 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.790
 petals with roll 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.790
 they are very beautiful 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.579
 we unite threads and our 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:28.430
 little flower so that you can 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:32.019
 use in any accessory that 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.019
 you want to decorate 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.709
 here as you arm the little flower as 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.459
 we are always going to put a circle in 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.459
 the back 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:03.610
 we put what is the elastic band 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.610
 we put silicone from side to side 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.580
 we put the bandit we hope that it 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.180
 dry that we always place silicone 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.750
 very hot so that you prevent us from 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.750
 are going to drop 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:27.870
 and finally we are going to place what is 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.870
 our porcelain and chrome face 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.040
 we apply 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.260
 good silicone 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.410
 we put the face 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.710
 smart girl we have finished our 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.720
 accessory so that you can 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.910
 sell them the pair we hope they have 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.340
 liked this idea 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.710
 and expect upcoming videos super easy is 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.830
 super simple until next 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.830
 opportunity
