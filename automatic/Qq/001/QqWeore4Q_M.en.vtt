00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
right next we're going to take took a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.309 
right next we're going to take took a
one<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.180> half<00:02:22.470> tablespoons<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.830> soy<00:02:24.670> butter

then<00:02:26.319> we're<00:02:26.470> going<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.680> combine<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.340> with<00:02:28.739> a

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
then we're going to combine that with a

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:37.199 
then we're going to combine that with a
quarter<00:02:30.280> cup<00:02:30.519> of<00:02:33.989> soy<00:02:34.989> milk<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.739> about<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.819> half

of another I don't have a 1/8 of a cup

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.350 
of another I don't have a 1/8 of a cup
to<00:02:41.620> use<00:02:41.830> for<00:02:42.130> measurement<00:02:42.549> so<00:02:42.819> we'll<00:02:43.000> use<00:02:43.180> it

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
to use for measurement so we'll use it

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.600 
to use for measurement so we'll use it
that<00:02:43.510> way<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.140> these<00:02:44.950> are<00:02:45.099> our<00:02:45.130> last<00:02:45.370> two

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
that way and these are our last two

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.460 
that way and these are our last two
ingredients<00:02:45.760> we'll<00:02:46.180> add<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.569> our<00:02:46.630> batter<00:02:49.470> and

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
ingredients we'll add to our batter and

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.319 
ingredients we'll add to our batter and
we'll<00:02:50.709> combine<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.280> ensure<00:02:51.940> that<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.239> will

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
we'll combine it ensure that you will

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.020 
we'll combine it ensure that you will
see<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.950> we<00:02:54.100> will<00:02:54.130> have<00:02:54.310> something<00:02:54.880> that

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
see that we will have something that

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:06.880 
see that we will have something that
looks<00:02:55.239> like<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:01.180> mix<00:03:01.600> for<00:03:01.930> visit

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.130 

and<00:03:07.550> that's<00:03:07.730> as<00:03:07.880> simple<00:03:07.910> as<00:03:08.270> it<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:10.960> gonna<00:03:11.960> take

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
and that's as simple as it is gonna take

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:45.339 

take<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.799> battery<00:03:22.040> out<00:03:22.459> of<00:03:22.519> here

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:04:03.080 

rolled<00:03:46.040> it<00:03:46.189> out<00:03:50.829> like<00:03:51.829> use<00:03:52.069> a<00:03:52.099> rolling<00:03:52.430> pin

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:19.240 

I'm<00:04:03.540> gonna<00:04:03.690> roll<00:04:03.870> out<00:04:04.019> one<00:04:04.200> last<00:04:04.379> time
