peach<00:00:22.350> or<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> Isabella<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.279> we'll<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.550> a

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
peach or the Isabella so we'll have a

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.429 
peach or the Isabella so we'll have a
look<00:00:23.699> at<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.150> bit<00:00:24.300> I'll<00:00:24.900> be<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> surprise

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.419 
look at that in a bit I'll be a surprise
between<00:00:25.769> two<00:00:25.970> and<00:00:26.970> then<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.390> just<00:00:27.539> plays<00:00:27.750> a

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
between two and then it just plays a

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.630 
between two and then it just plays a
generic<00:00:29.429> Marius<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.090> background<00:00:30.420> I

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
generic Marius on in the background I

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.680 
generic Marius on in the background I
just<00:00:32.640> turn<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:32.820> down<00:00:33.059> me<00:00:33.210> show<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> rest

and<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.320> rest<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:36.110> I<00:00:37.110> think<00:00:37.890> so

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
and the rest of it I think so

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.049 
and the rest of it I think so
personally<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> prefer<00:00:39.059> these<00:00:41.059> character

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
personally I prefer these character

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.580 
personally I prefer these character
cover<00:00:42.270> plates<00:00:42.510> because<00:00:42.780> they're<00:00:42.930> shiny<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
cover plates because they're shiny and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.170 
cover plates because they're shiny and
they<00:00:43.950> look<00:00:44.160> much<00:00:44.399> better<00:00:44.579> than<00:00:44.820> some<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.120> them

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
they look much better than some of them

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.389 
they look much better than some of them
at<00:00:45.329> once<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.800> Isabella<00:00:46.800> one<00:00:47.010> which<00:00:47.160> I'll<00:00:47.309> be

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
at once like Isabella one which I'll be

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.490 
at once like Isabella one which I'll be
looking<00:00:47.640> at<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.910> matte<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:49.200> still<00:00:49.469> looks

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
looking at is matte and it still looks

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.310 
looking at is matte and it still looks
fantastic<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.510> think<00:00:51.629> these<00:00:51.809> these

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
fantastic but I just think these these

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.750 
fantastic but I just think these these
character<00:00:52.680> cover<00:00:52.860> plates<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.550> better

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
character cover plates have a better

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.630 
character cover plates have a better
overall<00:00:54.270> effect<00:00:55.170> alright<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
overall effect alright so this is the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.970 
overall effect alright so this is the
peach<00:00:56.969> cover<00:00:57.270> plate<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
peach cover plate and I have the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.310 
peach cover plate and I have the
matching<00:00:59.280> theme<00:00:59.460> set<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.000> I'll<00:01:00.270> see<00:01:00.629> what

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
matching theme set so I'll see what

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.039 
matching theme set so I'll see what
happens

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
happens

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:06.440 
happens
alright<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.229> it's<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.339> generic<00:01:05.519> scenario

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
alright so it's just a generic scenario

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.679 
alright so it's just a generic scenario
sound<00:01:07.140> effect<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:08.070> still<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.180> same<00:01:09.390> as<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
sound effect but still the same as the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.719 
sound effect but still the same as the
Yoshi<00:01:09.869> theme<00:01:10.140> features<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.710> side<00:01:10.920> it's

just turn it there and that is the
overall<00:01:19.740> look<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> cover<00:01:20.640> plate<00:01:20.850> again

shiny gloss effect really nice and works
well<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.189> matching<00:01:26.490> theme<00:01:27.500> right<00:01:28.500> onto

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
well with the matching theme right onto

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.609 
well with the matching theme right onto
the<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.490> about<00:01:29.880> cover<00:01:30.390> plates<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.930> i've<00:01:31.560> been

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
the is about cover plates and i've been

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.109 
the is about cover plates and i've been
using<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.159> for<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.430> fair<00:01:32.610> while<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.000> it's

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
using this one for a fair while and it's

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.270 
using this one for a fair while and it's
matching<00:01:33.329> theme<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.020> I'm<00:01:34.259> pretty<00:01:34.860> sure<00:01:35.130> this

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
matching theme so I'm pretty sure this

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.960 
matching theme so I'm pretty sure this
doesn't<00:01:35.579> do<00:01:35.670> anything<00:01:36.000> when<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.210> open<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:37.970> and

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
doesn't do anything when you open it and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.219 
doesn't do anything when you open it and
that<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.119> carries<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.600> playing<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.960> Animal

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.319 
that just carries on playing the Animal
Crossing<00:01:40.320> music<00:01:40.860> which<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.100> nice<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.579> really<00:01:42.000> do

quite<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.840> theme<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.320> turn<00:01:43.979> up<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.450> it's

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
quite like this theme to turn up it it's

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.749 
quite like this theme to turn up it it's
the<00:01:45.750> bulletin<00:01:46.350> board<00:01:46.560> theme<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.100> think

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the bulletin board theme I think

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.770 
the bulletin board theme I think
everything<00:01:48.210> I've<00:01:48.329> showed<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.720> think

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
everything I've showed you I think

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.300 
everything I've showed you I think
they're<00:01:49.020> about<00:01:49.079> one<00:01:49.320> pound<00:01:49.500> seventy<00:01:49.890> nine<00:01:50.040> or

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
they're about one pound seventy nine or

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.780 
they're about one pound seventy nine or
around<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.000> range<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.369> quite<00:01:53.759> a

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
around that range and this is quite a

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.730 
around that range and this is quite a
nice<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.049> idea<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.530> this

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
nice I like I like the idea of this

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.249 
nice I like I like the idea of this
thing<00:01:56.329> just<00:01:57.329> turns<00:01:57.509> down<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.899> flowers

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
thing just turns down and the flowers

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.520 
thing just turns down and the flowers
and<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.560> bulletin<00:01:59.159> it's<00:01:59.280> very<00:02:00.200> very<00:02:01.200> animal

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and the bulletin it's very very animal

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.780 
and the bulletin it's very very animal
crossing<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.850> fits<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.450> game<00:02:03.990> perfectly

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
crossing it it fits the game perfectly

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.550 
crossing it it fits the game perfectly
and<00:02:05.790> then<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.360> course<00:02:06.450> Isobel<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.229> corner

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
and then of course Isobel in the corner

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.470 
and then of course Isobel in the corner
matches<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:09.890> cover<00:02:10.890> plates<00:02:11.129> these<00:02:11.489> are<00:02:11.550> matte

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
matches the cover plates these are matte

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.000 
matches the cover plates these are matte
cover

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
cover

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.600 
cover
so<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.400> only<00:02:13.580> matter<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.420> have<00:02:15.489> excluding<00:02:16.489> the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
so the only matter I have excluding the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.170 
so the only matter I have excluding the
originals<00:02:17.239> that<00:02:17.360> come<00:02:17.569> with<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.989> console

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
originals that come with the console

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.250 
originals that come with the console
they're<00:02:20.180> quite<00:02:20.390> nice<00:02:20.480> actually<00:02:20.720> they<00:02:21.080> don't

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
they're quite nice actually they don't

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.589 
they're quite nice actually they don't
seem<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.739> be<00:02:22.030> attracting<00:02:23.030> actually<00:02:23.450> these

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
seem to be attracting actually these

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.030 
seem to be attracting actually these
attract<00:02:24.049> less<00:02:24.170> fingerprints<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.920> glossy

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
attract less fingerprints and the glossy

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.070 
attract less fingerprints and the glossy
ones<00:02:25.370> which<00:02:25.549> obviously<00:02:25.940> makes<00:02:26.180> sense<00:02:26.510> but

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
ones which obviously makes sense but

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.089 
ones which obviously makes sense but
this<00:02:28.069> I<00:02:28.280> think<00:02:28.459> is<00:02:29.000> an<00:02:29.209> import<00:02:29.799> but<00:02:30.799> I<00:02:30.830> got<00:02:31.010> it

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
this I think is an import but I got it

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.080 
this I think is an import but I got it
from<00:02:31.220> ebay<00:02:31.610> on<00:02:31.910> in<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.510> UK<00:02:33.549> for<00:02:34.549> about<00:02:34.790> eleven

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.430 
from ebay on in the UK for about eleven
parents<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:35.510> think<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:35.900> it's<00:02:36.049> quite<00:02:36.200> a<00:02:36.260> bargain

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
parents I think so it's quite a bargain

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.890 
parents I think so it's quite a bargain
I<00:02:36.739> bought<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.160> before<00:02:37.420> my<00:02:38.420> console<00:02:39.400> arrived<00:02:40.900> so

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
I bought it before my console arrived so

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.089 
I bought it before my console arrived so
I've<00:02:42.019> been<00:02:42.170> using<00:02:42.349> this<00:02:42.500> since<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:42.890> beginning
