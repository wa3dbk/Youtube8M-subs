journey again and yeah as you guys can
see<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.130> still<00:00:26.430> have<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.670> genie<00:00:26.939> locs<00:00:27.769> these

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
see I still have the genie locs these

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.040 
see I still have the genie locs these
aren't<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> same<00:00:29.310> ones<00:00:29.640> though<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:30.300> read<00:00:30.840> it

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
aren't the same ones though I read it

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.470 
aren't the same ones though I read it
them<00:00:31.320> maybe<00:00:31.590> two<00:00:31.920> weeks<00:00:32.070> ago<00:00:32.750> they<00:00:33.750> are<00:00:35.059> so<00:00:36.059> low

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
them maybe two weeks ago they are so low

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.280 
them maybe two weeks ago they are so low
maintenance<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.320> makes<00:00:37.649> no<00:00:38.190> sense<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.820> guess

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
maintenance it makes no sense I guess

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.200 
maintenance it makes no sense I guess
