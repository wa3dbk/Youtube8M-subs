120<00:00:44.810> gigabyte<00:00:45.170> SSD<00:00:46.720> it<00:00:47.720> comes<00:00:47.930> with<00:00:48.080> screws

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
120 gigabyte SSD it comes with screws

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.900 
120 gigabyte SSD it comes with screws
but<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:49.010> screw<00:00:49.370> is<00:00:49.460> already<00:00:49.670> inside<00:00:49.850> the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
but the screw is already inside the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.869 
but the screw is already inside the
brick<00:00:50.150> so<00:00:50.330> it<00:00:50.420> won't<00:00:50.570> need<00:00:50.720> that

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.330 

and<00:00:57.570> here's<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> SSD<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:59.100> we're<00:00:59.190> going<00:00:59.280> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
and here's the SSD so we're going to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.889 
and here's the SSD so we're going to
remove<00:00:59.519> the<00:00:59.760> small<00:00:59.969> screw<00:01:00.329> which<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.660> already

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
remove the small screw which is already

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.690 
remove the small screw which is already
in<00:01:01.019> place<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.469> bricks

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.020 

take<00:01:06.700> it<00:01:06.820> out<00:01:06.940> of<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.150> bricks

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.660 

and<00:01:10.119> then<00:01:10.960> put<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.320> SSD<00:01:11.740> carefully<00:01:12.250> into<00:01:12.580> the

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
and then put the SSD carefully into the

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.370 
and then put the SSD carefully into the
slot<00:01:12.909> it<00:01:13.210> only<00:01:13.390> goes<00:01:13.570> in<00:01:13.720> one<00:01:13.750> way<00:01:13.869> so<00:01:14.049> don't

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
slot it only goes in one way so don't

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.570 
slot it only goes in one way so don't
worry<00:01:14.500> about<00:01:14.799> getting<00:01:15.040> your<00:01:15.130> stuck

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
worry about getting your stuck

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.080 
worry about getting your stuck
push<00:01:16.299> it<00:01:16.420> down<00:01:16.540> gently<00:01:16.750> and<00:01:17.549> then<00:01:18.549> replace<00:01:18.909> the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
push it down gently and then replace the

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:28.920 
push it down gently and then replace the
screw<00:01:27.060> doesn't<00:01:28.060> need<00:01:28.149> to<00:01:28.210> be<00:01:28.270> too<00:01:28.450> tight<00:01:28.659> just

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
screw doesn't need to be too tight just

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.990 
screw doesn't need to be too tight just
as<00:01:29.440> long<00:01:29.590> as<00:01:29.680> it<00:01:29.770> can<00:01:29.860> hold<00:01:30.009> down<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.640> SSD

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
as long as it can hold down the SSD

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.920 
as long as it can hold down the SSD
securely<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:34.240> you<00:01:34.330> can<00:01:34.450> put<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.720> lid<00:01:34.899> back

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
securely then you can put the lid back

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.820 
securely then you can put the lid back
on<00:01:35.170> your<00:01:35.409> bricks

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:46.630 

return<00:01:38.580> all<00:01:38.610> four<00:01:38.940> screws<00:01:39.180> original<00:01:39.840> places

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.210 

and<00:01:47.640> then<00:01:47.940> you're<00:01:48.060> finished<00:01:48.830> one<00:01:49.830> double<00:01:50.130> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
and then you're finished one double a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.560 
and then you're finished one double a
battery<00:01:52.730> and<00:01:53.730> I<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:53.970> been<00:01:54.150> impressed<00:01:54.510> with

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570
