because<00:04:49.419> of<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.690> hill<00:04:50.050> probably<00:04:50.229> stop<00:04:50.560> when

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
because of the hill probably stop when

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.670 
because of the hill probably stop when
he<00:04:50.770> gets<00:04:50.950> the<00:04:51.160> end<00:04:51.280> of<00:04:51.400> that<00:04:51.490> school<00:04:51.729> year<00:04:52.680> more

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
he gets the end of that school year more

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.230 
he gets the end of that school year more
likely<00:04:53.950> that's<00:04:54.460> what<00:04:54.610> he<00:04:54.700> did<00:04:54.820> with<00:04:54.970> number

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.820 
two but I think he was going to continue
on<00:04:57.760> anyway<00:04:58.180> but<00:04:58.419> the<00:04:58.810> whole<00:04:58.960> animation<00:04:59.349> style

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830
