segment when I talk about how to drain a
lawn<00:00:05.000> so<00:00:06.000> we<00:00:06.359> buy<00:00:06.600> our<00:00:06.870> nice<00:00:07.109> beautiful<00:00:07.859> new

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
lawn so we buy our nice beautiful new

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.759 
lawn so we buy our nice beautiful new
homes<00:00:08.400> in<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.820> new<00:00:09.000> developments<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.200> we

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
homes in the new developments and we

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.259 
homes in the new developments and we
didn't<00:00:11.040> realize<00:00:11.190> when<00:00:11.610> we<00:00:11.639> bought<00:00:11.910> them<00:00:12.059> that

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
didn't realize when we bought them that

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.089 
didn't realize when we bought them that
they<00:00:12.389> were<00:00:12.450> actually<00:00:12.780> built<00:00:13.230> on<00:00:13.380> swampland

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
they were actually built on swampland

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.910 
they were actually built on swampland
because<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:14.969> lot<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.360> ado<00:00:15.690> houses<00:00:16.230> are<00:00:16.440> built<00:00:16.680> in

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
because a lot of ado houses are built in

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.590 
because a lot of ado houses are built in
areas<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.279> would<00:00:17.580> not<00:00:17.820> have<00:00:18.000> been<00:00:18.210> built<00:00:18.420> on

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
areas that would not have been built on

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.890 
areas that would not have been built on
20<00:00:19.080> years<00:00:19.109> ago<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.000> ground<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.539> soggy

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
20 years ago and so the ground is soggy

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.140 
20 years ago and so the ground is soggy
wet<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.890> never<00:00:23.160> dries<00:00:23.490> out<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:24.029> you're

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
wet and it never dries out and you're

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.330 
wet and it never dries out and you're
trying<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.449> put<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> lawn<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:25.080> top<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.949> so

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
trying to put a lawn on top of it and so

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.189 
trying to put a lawn on top of it and so
there's<00:00:26.490> no<00:00:26.640> compost<00:00:27.210> there's<00:00:27.480> no<00:00:27.630> material

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
there's no compost there's no material

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.269 
there's no compost there's no material
you're<00:00:28.650> putting<00:00:29.099> lawn<00:00:29.789> right<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.630> top<00:00:30.900> of

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
you're putting lawn right on top of

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.280 
you're putting lawn right on top of
gravel<00:00:32.279> or<00:00:32.430> no<00:00:32.780> you're<00:00:33.780> putting<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> lawn

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
gravel or no you're putting the lawn

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.530 
gravel or no you're putting the lawn
right<00:00:34.320> on<00:00:34.739> top<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> clay<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.940> muck<00:00:36.180> and

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
right on top of the clay in the muck and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.030 
right on top of the clay in the muck and
so<00:00:36.719> it's<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:36.899> gonna<00:00:37.050> rot<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> wintertime

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
so it's just gonna rot in the wintertime

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.600 
so it's just gonna rot in the wintertime
so<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:39.450> drain<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.989> out<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:41.010> can<00:00:41.190> solve<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
so to drain it out you can solve the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.030 
so to drain it out you can solve the
problem<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.780> try<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.079> get<00:00:43.469> your<00:00:43.829> lawn

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
problem and you can try to get your lawn

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.790 
problem and you can try to get your lawn
to<00:00:44.280> grow<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:45.329> before<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.960> drain<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.230> out<00:00:46.500> you

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
to grow but before you drain it out you

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.130 
to grow but before you drain it out you
might<00:00:47.010> address<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.000> issue<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.390> why<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:49.020> so

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
might address the issue of why it's so

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.830 
might address the issue of why it's so
wet<00:00:49.469> there<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.039> if<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.730> lay<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.420> bunch<00:00:51.690> of

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
wet there and if you just lay a bunch of

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.590 
wet there and if you just lay a bunch of
gravel<00:00:52.079> down<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.920> footer<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.820> compost<00:00:54.420> over

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
gravel down and footer to a compost over

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.830 
gravel down and footer to a compost over
that<00:00:54.960> gravel<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.559> raise<00:00:56.039> your<00:00:56.340> lawn<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.879> then

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
that gravel and raise your lawn up then

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.599 
that gravel and raise your lawn up then
you<00:00:57.989> will<00:00:58.140> find<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.770> will<00:00:58.859> drain<00:00:59.219> really

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
you will find that it will drain really

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.970 
you will find that it will drain really
well<00:00:59.789> just<00:01:00.090> by<00:01:00.210> raising<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.800> you're

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
well just by raising it and that you're

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.889 
well just by raising it and that you're
not<00:01:02.129> addressing<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.940> issue<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.660> muck

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
not addressing the issue of the muck

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.359 
not addressing the issue of the muck
underneath<00:01:04.110> because<00:01:04.979> whether<00:01:05.189> you're

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
underneath because whether you're

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.789 
underneath because whether you're
draining<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.939> or<00:01:06.119> not<00:01:06.420> usually<00:01:07.320> there's<00:01:07.530> still

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
draining it or not usually there's still

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.950 
draining it or not usually there's still
no<00:01:07.979> compost<00:01:08.460> underneath<00:01:08.850> your<00:01:09.030> lawn<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.570> it's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
no compost underneath your lawn and it's

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.810 
no compost underneath your lawn and it's
still<00:01:10.170> right<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.380> clay<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.340> even<00:01:11.580> if<00:01:11.700> you're

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
still right on clay so even if you're

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.520 
still right on clay so even if you're
draining<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.570> not<00:01:12.840> gonna<00:01:13.020> grow<00:01:13.200> very

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
draining it and it's not gonna grow very

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.950 
draining it and it's not gonna grow very
well<00:01:13.740> because<00:01:14.070> it's<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:14.310> muck<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.689> can

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
well because it's just muck so you can

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.980 
well because it's just muck so you can
drain<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.320> by<00:01:16.680> putting<00:01:16.979> any<00:01:17.310> types<00:01:17.610> of

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
drain it by putting any types of

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.420 
drain it by putting any types of
drainage<00:01:18.990> system<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.860> basically<00:01:20.189> you're

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
drainage system in and basically you're

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.539 
drainage system in and basically you're
just<00:01:20.640> making<00:01:21.090> any<00:01:21.570> type<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.130> canal<00:01:23.130> or<00:01:23.490> a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
just making any type of canal or a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.030 
just making any type of canal or a
little<00:01:23.909> hole<00:01:24.240> or<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:25.110> cutting<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.710> slit

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
little hole or just cutting a slit

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.030 
little hole or just cutting a slit
around<00:01:26.970> through<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.960> grass<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:28.890> put

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
around through the grass and you can put

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.609 
around through the grass and you can put
PVC<00:01:29.670> pipe<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.270> there<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.810> then<00:01:31.200> fill<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.500> back

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
PVC pipe in there and then fill it back

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.319 
PVC pipe in there and then fill it back
in<00:01:31.829> with<00:01:31.920> gravel<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.610> put<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:33.060> dirt

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
in with gravel and put it in with dirt

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.060 
in with gravel and put it in with dirt
and<00:01:33.630> that's<00:01:33.840> really<00:01:34.079> all<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.560> French<00:01:34.920> a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
and that's really all that a French a

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.850 
and that's really all that a French a
French<00:01:35.640> drain<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.270> does<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.290> or<00:01:37.560> any<00:01:37.799> other

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.399 
you're doing is you're taking the water
out<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.970> your<00:01:42.090> lawn<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.659> you're<00:01:43.079> putting<00:01:43.320> it

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
out of your lawn and you're putting it

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.080 
out of your lawn and you're putting it
back<00:01:43.560> into<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.009> street<00:01:44.280> or<00:01:44.460> into<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> storm

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
back into the street or into the storm

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.819 
back into the street or into the storm
drains<00:01:45.479> where<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.079> belongs

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
drains where it belongs

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.060 
drains where it belongs
and<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.590> spend<00:01:49.799> all<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
and so you can do that and spend all the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.460 
and so you can do that and spend all the
money<00:01:50.100> on<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> drain<00:01:50.820> system<00:01:51.390> but<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> end

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
money on a drain system but in the end

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.990 
money on a drain system but in the end
I'm<00:01:52.740> not<00:01:52.890> sure<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.369> your<00:01:53.460> grass<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.820> gonna

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
grill that much better because it's

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.929 
grill that much better because it's
