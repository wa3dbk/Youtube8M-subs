you're<00:00:37.850> never<00:00:38.030> gonna<00:00:38.149> get<00:00:38.329> a<00:00:38.359> hundred<00:00:38.510> percent

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
you're never gonna get a hundred percent

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
be really qualified as a bright shrimp

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.669 
be really qualified as a bright shrimp
cuz<00:00:57.019> they're<00:00:57.170> kind<00:00:57.350> of<00:00:57.409> a<00:00:57.530> larvae<00:00:59.679> obviously

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679

cuz they're kind of a larvae obviously
this<00:01:01.039> isn't<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:02.469> American<00:01:03.469> product<00:01:03.920> because

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
this isn't a American product because

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.720 
this isn't a American product because
the<00:01:04.790> first<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:06.350> first<00:01:06.860> instruction<00:01:07.280> guides

the first the first instruction guides

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.770 
the first the first instruction guides
are<00:01:08.000> all<00:01:08.150> in<00:01:10.390> not<00:01:11.390> to<00:01:11.570> English<00:01:12.040> Russian<00:01:13.040> I

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
are all in not to English Russian I

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.100 
are all in not to English Russian I
don't<00:01:14.780> know<00:01:15.050> that<00:01:15.460> something<00:01:16.540> French<00:01:17.540> Spanish

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
don't know that something French Spanish

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.600 
don't know that something French Spanish
so<00:01:19.070> pretty<00:01:19.310> much<00:01:19.400> everything<00:01:19.700> but<00:01:19.880> America's

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.950 

that's<00:01:25.610> probably<00:01:25.820> why<00:01:26.000> I<00:01:26.030> find<00:01:26.450> in<00:01:26.600> many<00:01:26.780> other

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
that's probably why I find in many other

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.190 
that's probably why I find in many other
places<00:01:27.110> online<00:01:27.680> or<00:01:28.400> in<00:01:29.180> America<00:01:29.690> just<00:01:29.960> because

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
places online or in America just because

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.250 
places online or in America just because
it's<00:01:30.350> I<00:01:30.680> think<00:01:30.860> it's<00:01:31.100> German<00:01:31.750> or<00:01:32.750> something<00:01:33.140> in

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
it's I think it's German or something in

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:40.420 
it's I think it's German or something in
Europe<00:01:37.420> hard<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.630> get<00:01:38.870> in<00:01:39.590> large<00:01:39.920> quantities

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
Europe hard to get in large quantities

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.460 
Europe hard to get in large quantities
I'm<00:01:40.580> guessing<00:01:40.910> that<00:01:41.480> I<00:01:41.600> can't<00:01:41.870> open<00:01:42.140> this<00:01:42.290> so

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
I'm guessing that I can't open this so

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.069 
I'm guessing that I can't open this so
I'm<00:01:42.530> gonna<00:01:42.650> put<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:42.980> camera<00:01:43.880> down

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.990 

so<00:01:48.979> here's<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.430> aquavit<00:01:49.850> 1000<00:01:51.670> does<00:01:52.670> look

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
so here's the aquavit 1000 does look

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.969 
so here's the aquavit 1000 does look
quite<00:01:53.659> simple<00:01:54.500> but<00:01:56.079> honestly<00:01:57.079> much<00:01:57.560> harder<00:01:57.860> to

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
quite simple but honestly much harder to

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.520 
quite simple but honestly much harder to
build<00:01:58.549> this<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.270> it's<00:01:59.810> much<00:01:59.960> more<00:02:00.140> convenient

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
build this and it's much more convenient

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.279 
build this and it's much more convenient
then<00:02:03.280> much<00:02:04.280> more<00:02:04.310> convenient<00:02:04.819> to<00:02:05.060> build<00:02:05.929> it<00:02:06.049> or

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
then much more convenient to build it or

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.910 
then much more convenient to build it or
to<00:02:06.469> buy<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:07.509> because<00:02:08.509> it's<00:02:08.690> made<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.590> be

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
to buy it because it's made to be

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.270 
to buy it because it's made to be
exactly<00:02:10.310> a<00:02:10.399> leader<00:02:10.720> stuff<00:02:12.819> it<00:02:13.819> comes<00:02:13.970> with

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
exactly a leader stuff it comes with

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.979 
exactly a leader stuff it comes with
these<00:02:16.280> which<00:02:16.700> on<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.720> side<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:19.780> like<00:02:20.780> airline

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
these which on the side and like airline

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.890 
these which on the side and like airline
tubing<00:02:21.349> a<00:02:21.920> brace<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:23.150> think<00:02:23.360> this<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.630> for<00:02:23.780> when

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
tubing a brace I think this is for when

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.059 
tubing a brace I think this is for when
you<00:02:23.930> put<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.170> on<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.349> outside<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:24.860> frame

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
you put it on the outside of the frame

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.380 
you put it on the outside of the frame
you<00:02:25.130> can<00:02:25.400> put<00:02:25.549> it<00:02:25.640> on<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.790> outside<00:02:25.910> or<00:02:26.269> the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
you can put it on the outside or the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.280 
you can put it on the outside or the
inside<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:27.530> little<00:02:28.150> tubing<00:02:29.150> contraption<00:02:29.900> thing

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
inside a little tubing contraption thing

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.360 
inside a little tubing contraption thing
I'm<00:02:31.040> not<00:02:31.160> sure<00:02:31.239> what<00:02:32.239> this<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.930> know<00:02:33.799> what<00:02:34.220> it

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
I'm not sure what this is I know what it

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.500 
I'm not sure what this is I know what it
is<00:02:34.459> but<00:02:34.640> I'm<00:02:34.730> not<00:02:34.760> sure<00:02:34.970> how<00:02:35.150> it's<00:02:35.269> supposed<00:02:35.480> to

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
is but I'm not sure how it's supposed to

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.330 
is but I'm not sure how it's supposed to
work<00:02:37.329> but<00:02:38.329> whatever<00:02:39.230> all<00:02:39.920> right<00:02:40.130> I'm<00:02:40.190> gonna

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
work but whatever all right I'm gonna

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.160 
work but whatever all right I'm gonna
turn<00:02:40.579> the<00:02:40.670> camera<00:02:40.700> off<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.390> try<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:41.959> put<00:02:42.079> this

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
turn the camera off and try and put this

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.589 
turn the camera off and try and put this
thing<00:02:42.230> together<00:02:42.500> all<00:02:43.370> right<00:02:43.549> I<00:02:43.579> got<00:02:43.970> it<00:02:44.090> pretty

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
thing together all right I got it pretty

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.630 
thing together all right I got it pretty
much<00:02:44.900> together<00:02:46.810> so<00:02:47.810> this<00:02:48.440> is<00:02:48.890> what<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:49.459> looks

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
much together so this is what it looks

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.520 
much together so this is what it looks
like<00:02:49.730> out<00:02:50.120> of<00:02:50.329> the<00:02:50.390> tank<00:02:50.660> without<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.349> top
