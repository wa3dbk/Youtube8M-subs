is also kind of strange and a nice
format<00:04:15.449> of<00:04:15.750> Minecraft<00:04:16.650> making<00:04:17.220> everything

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
format of Minecraft making everything

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.620

everything<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:22.590> also<00:04:23.159> these<00:04:23.340> little<00:04:23.700> ruins

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
everything and also these little ruins

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.850 
everything and also these little ruins
adds<00:04:24.539> adds<00:04:25.169> to<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.740> feeling<00:04:26.039> of

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
adds adds to the feeling of

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.890 
adds adds to the feeling of
scariness<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:27.789> there's<00:04:28.330> a<00:04:28.419> little<00:04:28.539> bit<00:04:28.719> of<00:04:28.780> a

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
scariness and there's a little bit of a

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.339 
scariness and there's a little bit of a
desert<00:04:29.289> desert<00:04:30.069> biome<00:04:30.789> here<00:04:31.090> and<00:04:31.319> that<00:04:32.319> I

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
desert desert biome here and that I

hopefully<00:04:43.300> this<00:04:43.449> video<00:04:43.629> I've<00:04:44.020> done<00:04:44.349> a<00:04:44.379> lot<00:04:44.710> of

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
hopefully this video I've done a lot of

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.279 
hopefully this video I've done a lot of
tests<00:04:45.250> and<00:04:45.370> hopefully<00:04:45.819> the<00:04:45.969> this<00:04:46.870> when<00:04:47.259> I

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
tests and hopefully the this when I

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.020 
tests and hopefully the this when I
record<00:04:47.740> with<00:04:47.919> fraps<00:04:48.189> it<00:04:48.460> doesn't<00:04:48.789> show<00:04:49.000> the

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
record with fraps it doesn't show the

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.420 
record with fraps it doesn't show the
flickering<00:04:49.719> of<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:50.050> screen<00:04:50.500> hopefully<00:04:51.340> it

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
flickering of the screen hopefully it

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.399 
flickering of the screen hopefully it
won't<00:04:51.580> but<00:04:51.759> you<00:04:51.819> can<00:04:51.969> it's<00:04:52.240> very<00:04:52.599> minimal<00:04:53.199> on

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
won't but you can it's very minimal on

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:56.089 
won't but you can it's very minimal on
minecraft<00:04:53.949> when<00:04:54.159> it<00:04:54.250> turned<00:04:54.490> off<00:04:54.610> vsync<00:04:55.060> and

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
minecraft when it turned off vsync and

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.619 
minecraft when it turned off vsync and
that<00:04:57.099> sort<00:04:57.340> of<00:04:57.370> helped<00:04:57.639> minecraft<00:04:58.150> out<00:04:58.330> a<00:04:58.360> lot

00:04:58.619 --> 00:04:58.629 
that sort of helped minecraft out a lot

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:01.589 
that sort of helped minecraft out a lot
but<00:04:59.080> not<00:04:59.229> many<00:04:59.889> other<00:05:00.129> games<00:05:00.400> so<00:05:00.879> it<00:05:01.180> isn't<00:05:01.509> I

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:01.599 
but not many other games so it isn't I

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:03.420 
but not many other games so it isn't I
thought<00:05:01.930> it<00:05:02.110> was<00:05:02.199> a<00:05:02.229> Minecraft<00:05:02.800> problem<00:05:03.279> by

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
thought it was a Minecraft problem by

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.719 
thought it was a Minecraft problem by
itself<00:05:03.789> but<00:05:04.449> now<00:05:04.779> it's<00:05:05.020> not<00:05:05.319> it's<00:05:05.590> a<00:05:05.800> basically

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
itself but now it's not it's a basically

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.300 
itself but now it's not it's a basically
a<00:05:06.879> hardware<00:05:07.479> problem<00:05:07.509> of<00:05:08.020> isolated<00:05:08.830> to<00:05:09.279> a

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
a hardware problem of isolated to a

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.790 
a hardware problem of isolated to a
hardware<00:05:10.150> and<00:05:10.479> hopefully<00:05:11.349> I<00:05:11.379> can<00:05:11.469> get<00:05:11.680> it

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
hardware and hopefully I can get it

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.249 
hardware and hopefully I can get it
fixed<00:05:12.009> by<00:05:12.279> Wednesday<00:05:12.849> I<00:05:13.090> can<00:05:13.569> go<00:05:13.719> out<00:05:13.900> and<00:05:14.080> buy

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
up and then we'll have a stable computer

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.360 
up and then we'll have a stable computer
for<00:05:19.270> more<00:05:19.449> videos<00:05:19.990> and<00:05:20.289> hopefully<00:05:20.979> I'll<00:05:21.340> be

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
videos cuz I really want to play

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.010 
videos cuz I really want to play
Minecraft<00:05:27.069> now<00:05:27.310> and<00:05:27.550> make<00:05:27.759> the<00:05:27.939> cinematics<00:05:28.779> of

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
Minecraft now and make the cinematics of

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.200 
Minecraft now and make the cinematics of
me<00:05:29.379> flying<00:05:29.800> around<00:05:30.219> because<00:05:30.819> before<00:05:31.150> I

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
me flying around because before I

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.579 
me flying around because before I
couldn't<00:05:31.569> because<00:05:31.750> it<00:05:31.839> was<00:05:31.960> too<00:05:32.169> laggy<00:05:32.379> but

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:32.589 
couldn't because it was too laggy but

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:35.070 
couldn't because it was too laggy but
now<00:05:32.949> everything<00:05:33.610> loads<00:05:33.879> a<00:05:34.120> lot<00:05:34.300> more<00:05:34.509> faster

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
now everything loads a lot more faster

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.769 
now everything loads a lot more faster
and<00:05:35.199> it's<00:05:35.289> not<00:05:35.529> laggy<00:05:36.279> at<00:05:36.610> all<00:05:36.849> so<00:05:37.449> now<00:05:37.629> I<00:05:37.659> can

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:37.779 
and it's not laggy at all so now I can

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.800 
and it's not laggy at all so now I can
try<00:05:38.199> out<00:05:38.229> the<00:05:38.620> photo<00:05:38.860> realism<00:05:39.539> texture<00:05:40.539> pack
