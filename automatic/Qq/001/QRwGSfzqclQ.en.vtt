the mouth in the common shares where we

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.100 
the mouth in the common shares where we
might<00:00:46.770> find<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.670> fungal<00:00:48.210> infection<00:00:48.270> angular

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
might find a fungal infection angular

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.500 
might find a fungal infection angular
cheilitis<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:50.340> would<00:00:50.610> most<00:00:50.879> commonly<00:00:51.360> be

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
cheilitis this would most commonly be

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.160 
cheilitis this would most commonly be
seen<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:52.050> patients<00:00:52.500> who<00:00:52.920> are<00:00:53.660> missing<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.960> lot

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
seen in patients who are missing a lot

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.130 
seen in patients who are missing a lot
of<00:00:55.289> their<00:00:55.440> teeth<00:00:55.649> or<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:56.420> worn<00:00:57.420> down<00:00:57.600> their

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
of their teeth or have worn down their

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.990 
of their teeth or have worn down their
teeth<00:00:58.859> or<00:00:59.190> maybe<00:00:59.370> have<00:01:00.260> ill-fitting<00:01:01.260> dentures

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
teeth or maybe have ill-fitting dentures

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.060 
teeth or maybe have ill-fitting dentures
so<00:01:03.000> if<00:01:03.239> they<00:01:03.449> if<00:01:04.019> their<00:01:04.229> teeth<00:01:04.439> have<00:01:04.680> collapsed

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
so if they if their teeth have collapsed

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.890 
so if they if their teeth have collapsed
in<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.460> distance<00:01:05.939> between<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.479> tip<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.780> their

nose and the tip of their chin has

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.020 
nose and the tip of their chin has
collapsed<00:01:09.540> then<00:01:10.110> they<00:01:10.500> may<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.909> folds<00:01:11.909> in

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
collapsed then they may have folds in

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.370 
collapsed then they may have folds in
the<00:01:12.119> corner<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.420> their<00:01:12.600> mouth<00:01:12.780> which<00:01:13.049> would<00:01:13.229> be

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
the corner of their mouth which would be

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.950 
the corner of their mouth which would be
a<00:01:13.830> good<00:01:14.610> environment<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.450> fungal

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
a good environment for a fungal

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.950 
a good environment for a fungal
infection<00:01:16.790> okay<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.030> then<00:01:18.479> we'll<00:01:18.689> start

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
infection okay and then we'll start

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.960 
infection okay and then we'll start
going<00:01:19.530> inside<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.070> lip<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.490> open<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> little

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
going inside the lip so open a little

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.090 
going inside the lip so open a little
bit<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.360> me<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.990> we'll<00:01:22.320> want<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.619> use<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
bit for me and we'll want to use the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.499 
bit for me and we'll want to use the
technique<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.700> by<00:01:24.270> digital<00:01:24.720> palpation<00:01:25.470> by

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
technique of by digital palpation by

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.120 
technique of by digital palpation by
squeezing<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.750> tissue<00:01:28.049> gently<00:01:28.560> between<00:01:28.740> our

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
squeezing the tissue gently between our

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.490 
squeezing the tissue gently between our
two<00:01:29.310> fingers<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.939> here<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.869> lower<00:01:31.020> lip<00:01:31.259> we

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
two fingers and here in the lower lip we

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.580 
two fingers and here in the lower lip we
should<00:01:31.860> feel<00:01:32.310> some<00:01:33.060> slight<00:01:33.240> nodularity<00:01:33.780> which

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
should feel some slight nodularity which

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.200 
should feel some slight nodularity which
is<00:01:34.710> minor<00:01:34.979> salivary<00:01:35.250> glands<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.030> that's

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
is minor salivary glands and that's

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.060 
is minor salivary glands and that's
normal<00:01:36.659> but<00:01:36.869> we<00:01:36.990> would<00:01:37.170> want<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.439> take<00:01:37.590> note<00:01:37.860> of

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
normal but we would want to take note of

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.190 
normal but we would want to take note of
any<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.909> are<00:01:39.119> tender<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.600> patient<00:01:40.110> or

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
any that are tender to the patient or

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.580 
any that are tender to the patient or
seem<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:41.329> larger<00:01:42.329> stand<00:01:43.140> out<00:01:43.320> more<00:01:43.350> than

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
seem to be larger stand out more than

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.310 
seem to be larger stand out more than
the<00:01:43.829> others<00:01:44.159> we<00:01:45.060> would<00:01:45.149> also<00:01:45.299> take<00:01:45.750> note<00:01:45.810> of

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
the others we would also take note of

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.609 
the others we would also take note of
the<00:01:46.799> Eco<00:01:47.700> gingival<00:01:48.119> junction<00:01:48.600> which<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.439> can

the Eco gingival junction which we can

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.240 
the Eco gingival junction which we can
clearly<00:01:49.950> see<00:01:50.310> here<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:52.070> melanin<00:01:53.070> has

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
clearly see here the melanin has

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.730 
clearly see here the melanin has
deposited<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.060> attached<00:01:54.720> tissue<00:01:55.229> the

below that we have the non keratinized
movable<00:02:00.899> tissue<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:02.180> then<00:02:03.180> from<00:02:03.390> there<00:02:03.450> we

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
movable tissue and then from there we

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.469 
movable tissue and then from there we
would<00:02:04.259> want<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.680> move<00:02:05.100> into<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:06.119> buccal

our patient happens to have what's

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.220 
our patient happens to have what's
called<00:03:11.540> a<00:03:11.750> palatal<00:03:12.260> taurus<00:03:12.850> which<00:03:13.850> is<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.420> bony

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
called a palatal taurus which is a bony

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.320 
called a palatal taurus which is a bony
growth<00:03:15.560> in<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:16.160> center<00:03:16.520> of<00:03:16.550> the<00:03:16.730> palate<00:03:17.060> so<00:03:17.240> if

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
growth in the center of the palate so if

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.290 
growth in the center of the palate so if
you<00:03:17.450> palpate<00:03:17.780> that<00:03:18.260> you<00:03:19.130> can<00:03:19.370> feel<00:03:19.610> that<00:03:19.940> it

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
you palpate that you can feel that it

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.600 
you palpate that you can feel that it
has<00:03:20.480> firm<00:03:20.990> characterised<00:03:21.770> tissue<00:03:22.070> over<00:03:22.520> it

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
has firm characterised tissue over it

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.050 
has firm characterised tissue over it
and<00:03:22.820> it<00:03:23.630> is<00:03:23.660> a<00:03:24.040> very<00:03:25.040> firm<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.700> bounty

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
and it is a very firm and bounty

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.730 
and it is a very firm and bounty
underneath<00:03:26.660> it's<00:03:27.050> a<00:03:27.080> totally<00:03:28.070> normal<00:03:29.740> pattern

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
underneath it's a totally normal pattern

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.370 
underneath it's a totally normal pattern
there<00:03:30.950> you'll<00:03:31.370> see<00:03:31.610> it<00:03:31.730> quite<00:03:31.940> often<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:33.080> then

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
there you'll see it quite often and then

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.260 
there you'll see it quite often and then
we're<00:03:33.530> just<00:03:33.560> going<00:03:33.830> forward<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:34.430> looking<00:03:35.120> at

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
we're just going forward and looking at

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.420 
we're just going forward and looking at
the<00:03:35.420> rugae<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:36.170> ridges<00:03:36.530> here<00:03:36.770> in<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.190> front

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
the rugae the ridges here in the front

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.330 
the rugae the ridges here in the front
and<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.750> incisive<00:03:38.750> papilla<00:03:39.320> just<00:03:39.770> behind<00:03:40.130> the

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
and the incisive papilla just behind the

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.300 
and the incisive papilla just behind the
two<00:03:40.520> front<00:03:40.820> teeth<00:03:41.110> common<00:03:42.110> areas<00:03:42.470> for<00:03:42.770> injury

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
two front teeth common areas for injury

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.550 
two front teeth common areas for injury
so<00:03:43.610> you<00:03:43.670> might<00:03:43.850> see<00:03:44.260> ulcerations<00:03:45.260> there

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
so you might see ulcerations there

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.699 
so you might see ulcerations there
especially<00:03:46.400> from<00:03:46.880> hot<00:03:47.600> coffee<00:03:47.900> or<00:03:48.200> chips<00:03:48.500> or

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
especially from hot coffee or chips or

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.440 
especially from hot coffee or chips or
something<00:03:48.890> like<00:03:49.160> that<00:03:49.220> so<00:03:49.700> it's<00:03:49.850> not<00:03:50.000> uncommon

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
something like that so it's not uncommon

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.980 
something like that so it's not uncommon
to<00:03:50.660> see<00:03:50.900> traumatic<00:03:51.770> officers<00:03:52.130> there<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:53.600> very

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
to see traumatic officers there a very

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.360 
to see traumatic officers there a very
common<00:03:54.410> thing<00:03:54.650> that<00:03:54.709> you<00:03:54.920> might<00:03:55.070> see

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
common thing that you might see

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.760 
common thing that you might see
especially<00:03:56.060> in<00:03:56.390> smokers<00:03:56.690> would<00:03:57.350> be<00:03:57.470> where<00:03:57.650> the

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
especially in smokers would be where the

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.670 
especially in smokers would be where the

filiform papillae right in the middle

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.890 
filiform papillae right in the middle
tend<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.890> elongate<00:04:01.610> and<00:04:01.940> don't<00:04:02.330> desk<00:04:02.690> what

make the way they normally should maybe

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
inflammation and the papillae are not

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.399 
inflammation and the papillae are not
filling<00:05:57.090> the<00:05:57.210> spaces<00:05:57.659> in<00:05:57.690> between<00:05:57.840> and

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
filling the spaces in between and

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.110 
filling the spaces in between and
especially<00:05:58.650> if<00:05:58.889> the<00:05:58.979> teeth<00:05:59.219> are<00:05:59.460> a<00:05:59.669> little<00:05:59.789> bit

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
especially if the teeth are a little bit

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.269 
especially if the teeth are a little bit
loose<00:06:00.330> then<00:06:00.659> the<00:06:01.169> patient<00:06:01.590> may<00:06:01.680> have<00:06:01.889> a<00:06:01.919> form

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:02.279 
loose then the patient may have a form

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:05.570 
loose then the patient may have a form
of<00:06:02.509> periodontitis<00:06:03.509> which<00:06:04.469> is<00:06:04.800> where<00:06:05.370> the

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
of periodontitis which is where the

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.089 
of periodontitis which is where the
supporting<00:06:06.300> structures<00:06:06.719> of<00:06:06.870> the<00:06:06.990> teeth<00:06:07.199> are

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
supporting structures of the teeth are

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.689 
supporting structures of the teeth are
involved<00:06:08.610> as<00:06:08.729> well<00:06:10.159> okay<00:06:11.159> I<00:06:11.310> think<00:06:11.639> that

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 
involved as well okay I think that

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.889 
involved as well okay I think that
