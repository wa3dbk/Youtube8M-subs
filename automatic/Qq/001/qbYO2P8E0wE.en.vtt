00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:10.680
 in a corral there are pigs and chickens that 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:14.139
 they make a total of 61 heads and 196 legs 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.180
 how many pigs and chickens there are as 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.820
 wants to solve this exercise of a 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.130
 algebraic way or with equations what 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.949
 first thing to do is name 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.150
 to the variables and with them you can already 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:30.400
 work then let's use x 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.070
 what is the problem of finding 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.030
 amount of pigs and chickens 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.739
 then x is going to be the number or amount 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.739
 of pigs then here I will assume 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.739
 a drawing because it is measured ugly 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.760
 although there is more or less like that 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:55.740
 and we are going to name the quantity or number 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.200
 of chickens and we entertain ourselves by drawing 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.200
 a little bit has more or less like that 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.730
 ok we have x and now let's start 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.000
 to translate 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.430
 says that in total there is a total and a 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.270
 total of 61 heads obviously you have to 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:21.340
 remember that the pig has a 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:25.329
 head and has four legs 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:29.159
 and the rooster or hen obviously nothing more 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.159
 It has two legs 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.729
 then that is a characteristic of 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.790
 every animal very important and obviously 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.729
 because everyone has a head so 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.640
 both in the amount of pigs plus 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.920
 amount of chickens will add me the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.050
 total heads so we can 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.440
 establish translating the first 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.090
 enunciated in equation would be that the same 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.700
 amount of pigs plus the same 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.360
 amount of chickens will tell me the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.909
 total of heads that are 61 now the 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.770
 second part 196 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.960
 here we can see that the amount of 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.450
 potatoes is not respected for pigs and 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.290
 chickens since each hen contributes two 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.900
 and each pig brings 4 so for each 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.900
 pig would have four legs if there are two 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.190
 pigs would have eight legs and so on 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.410
 successively 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.209
 If there is a chicken there are two legs and so on 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.459
 successively if there are two there will be four 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:30.470
 so for each quantity of pork the 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.319
 number of legs that will be or will 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:38.400
 exist will be for four 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.379
 and when chickens are added each 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.730
 will provide two legs that's why the 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.319
 amount of hens you have to 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.120
 multiply by two and he will tell me 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.790
 number of legs that are adding up 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.670
 to the total then we already have two 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.280
 equations that came out of translating the 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.219
 statement of the problem when working 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.780
 with two equations and these contain the 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:01.079
 same two variables 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.670
 then it is known as a system 2 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.920
 x 2 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.680
 now there are several methods to solve 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.170
 a two by two system and each method 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.069
 It depends on the characteristics of the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.569
 system in this case as we have 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.640
 constants 1 that multiply the 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.390
 variables here we have 1 by x 1 because 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.000
 It is recommended to use the method by 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.100
 Substitution substitution although you can 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.620
 use any other and we will get there 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.620
 to the same result but with this one going to 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.140
 get out faster this is this method 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.010
 consists of let's name equation a 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.709
 Equation 2 and the first step of the method 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.739
 by substitution is to clear a variable 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.160
 which of equation 1 we're going to have 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:50.360
 here then 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.720
 x plus equals 61 if we clear one 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.490
 equation a variable for example that already 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.950
 that in the second here I see that he has the 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.900
 of lesser number you can paste x not 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.650
 matter let's clear here we leave and 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.810
 is equal to 61 and remember that the 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.030
 term with x is more x 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.240
 if we want to clear, let's cancel x 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.850
 with a minus x it becomes 0 and of adding 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.299
 then here I would have nothing more 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:20.180
 subtracting and already we already cleared or a 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:24.590
 variable this is the first step step 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.200
 number 2 is to simply replace this 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.810
 equation that we are going to name as 3 in 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.340
 which it was not used initially this 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.650
 yes this used we had used 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:39.410
 therefore we will use it in the 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:42.770
 step 2 let's write 4 x + 2 is equal 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.260
 to 196 and instead of putting that we're going to 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.880
 put your equivalent here in what I'm going to 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.020
 put the variable so that you notice the 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.410
 change 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.639
 + 2 and instead of putting he got to put his 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:58.139
 equivalent that its equivalent is 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:01.590
 61 - x 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:04.620
 the intention to do this is to combine or 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:08.219
 replace the value of a variable in 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.349
 function of a single next step 

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:13.379
 solve the first degree equation or 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:15.240
 clear x here you have to consider that 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:17.699
 the sign determines me amount of 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.340
 terms we have a term this sign 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:23.639
 start the next term all the 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.219
 grouping sign causes the term to 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:29.729
 make bigger therefore for 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:32.250
 simplify we leave 4x the same here for 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.620
 be able to remove this parenthesis or the 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.240
 operation you have to multiply the plus two 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.460
 by the two terms that are inside 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.889
 of the parentheses beginning to multiply 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:47.229
 the more signs for more that gives more 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:50.650
 2 for 61 that would give 122 more for less 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:53.139
 less and 2 x x2 x we ​​already use the 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.409
 parentheses and we left that this is equal 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:06:00.520
 to 196 simplifying the part of x 4 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:03.939
 positive minus 2 is 2 that we are 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:07.749
 talking about the x remains constant 122 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:10.360
 equal to 196 to clear x we ​​have to 

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:12.729
 cancel this term with a minus 122 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.419
 on both sides 0 is done on the side 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:20.259
 left and nothing else we have more 2x is 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:22.599
 equal to 196 positive it was canceled and of 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:29.500
 adding here we have subtracting 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:32.830
 simplifying missing 470 thousand 96 and 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.319
 positive is equal to 12 to clear x 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.180
 it is divided by 2 on both sides it 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:40.389
 they make a factor one on the left side and 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:44.379
 only one x or x positive 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:46.870
 equals 74 between multiplying 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:49.080
 canceled 6 good was made 1 and from the side 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.850
 right now we have it divided 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.530
 simplifying here we have that half 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:57.590
 of 70 is 35 plus half of good would be 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.350
 37 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:03.470
 finally you need to find the value 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:06.050
 of iu or amount of hens this is already 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:08.990
 possible because we already know the value of 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.540
 amount of pigs or Xs so 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:14.780
 using equation 3 the first one 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:17.270
 it cleared we have that the amount of 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:20.900
 chickens is equal to 61 minus the amount 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:23.680
 of pigs x we already know this value 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:28.180
 we only replace it 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:32.680
 and we have 61 minus 37 making the 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:35.880
 difference you get 24 that 24 is the 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:38.670
 amount of chickens 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:42.330
 in conclusion the amount of pigs are 

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:44.520
 37 and the number of chickens are 24 as 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.860
 extra can be checked by substituting 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.960
 these values in the equations 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:52.650
 initials and how they give equality 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:55.370
 means that the solution is correct 

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.370
 who meet both
