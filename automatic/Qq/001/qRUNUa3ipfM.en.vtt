00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
they could've used a lot better pieces

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.200 
they could've used a lot better pieces
but<00:04:54.800> you<00:04:54.890> can<00:04:55.010> see<00:04:55.220> those<00:04:55.400> ones<00:04:55.670> kind<00:04:55.910> of<00:04:56.000> stick

out a little bit and they could have

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.100 
out a little bit and they could have
used<00:04:58.310> much<00:04:58.580> better<00:04:58.850> pieces<00:04:59.150> so<00:04:59.570> wouldn't<00:04:59.960> have

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
used much better pieces so wouldn't have

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.420 
used much better pieces so wouldn't have
stuck<00:05:00.290> out<00:05:00.500> you<00:05:00.680> want<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:00.860> be<00:05:00.950> able<00:05:01.010> to<00:05:01.160> see<00:05:01.310> any

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
stuck out you want to be able to see any

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.760 
stuck out you want to be able to see any
of<00:05:01.490> that<00:05:01.700> ugly<00:05:02.090> red<00:05:02.630> which<00:05:03.140> doesn't<00:05:03.500> fit<00:05:03.530> in

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
of that ugly red which doesn't fit in

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.620 
of that ugly red which doesn't fit in
with<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:03.980> color<00:05:04.160> scheme<00:05:04.340> at<00:05:04.580> all<00:05:04.700> and<00:05:04.970> on<00:05:05.510> the

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
with the color scheme at all and on the

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.600 
with the color scheme at all and on the
bottom<00:05:05.780> here<00:05:06.170> you<00:05:06.200> can<00:05:06.410> actually<00:05:06.530> see<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:07.250> red

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
bottom here you can actually see the red

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.280 
bottom here you can actually see the red
really<00:05:08.000> clearly<00:05:08.330> and<00:05:08.660> that's<00:05:08.810> just<00:05:08.900> a<00:05:09.110> big

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
really clearly and that's just a big

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.680 
really clearly and that's just a big
problem<00:05:09.740> with<00:05:10.370> me<00:05:10.640> that's<00:05:11.300> really<00:05:11.510> my<00:05:11.660> only

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
problem with me that's really my only

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.990 
problem with me that's really my only
problem<00:05:12.230> with<00:05:12.560> a<00:05:12.590> set<00:05:12.920> overall<00:05:13.490> I<00:05:13.520> think<00:05:13.700> it's

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
problem with a set overall I think it's

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.510 
problem with a set overall I think it's
a<00:05:14.090> pretty<00:05:14.270> cool<00:05:14.570> set<00:05:14.920> this<00:05:15.920> is<00:05:16.130> the<00:05:16.190> Ewok

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
a pretty cool set this is the Ewok

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.190 
a pretty cool set this is the Ewok
attack<00:05:16.820> you<00:05:16.970> may<00:05:17.120> be<00:05:17.180> asking<00:05:17.690> I<00:05:17.930> would

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
attack you may be asking I would

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.960 
attack you may be asking I would
probably<00:05:18.410> think<00:05:18.890> the<00:05:19.070> Ewok<00:05:19.340> attack<00:05:19.640> might<00:05:19.850> be

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
probably think the Ewok attack might be

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.940 
probably think the Ewok attack might be
a<00:05:20.000> little<00:05:20.120> bit<00:05:20.330> of<00:05:20.420> a<00:05:20.480> better<00:05:20.690> set<00:05:21.080> but<00:05:21.710> this<00:05:21.830> is

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
a little bit of a better set but this is

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.530 
a little bit of a better set but this is
still<00:05:22.070> a<00:05:22.190> pretty<00:05:22.430> cool<00:05:22.670> one<00:05:22.880> to<00:05:23.000> get<00:05:23.210> and<00:05:23.450> you

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
still a pretty cool one to get and you

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.600 
still a pretty cool one to get and you
get<00:05:23.660> some<00:05:23.840> really<00:05:24.020> nice<00:05:24.290> figures<00:05:24.740> and<00:05:24.980> you

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
get some really nice figures and you

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:26.560 
get some really nice figures and you
know<00:05:25.760> I'm<00:05:25.880> going<00:05:26.000> to<00:05:26.060> give<00:05:26.150> it<00:05:26.180> an<00:05:26.300> eight<00:05:26.450> ounce

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
know I'm going to give it an eight ounce

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.030 
know I'm going to give it an eight ounce
in<00:05:26.810> just<00:05:26.960> like<00:05:27.020> I<00:05:27.110> gave<00:05:27.230> the<00:05:27.380> Ewok<00:05:27.740> attack<00:05:28.010> i

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
in just like I gave the Ewok attack i

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.770 
in just like I gave the Ewok attack i
think<00:05:28.130> this<00:05:28.370> new<00:05:28.640> wave<00:05:28.850> of<00:05:28.910> star<00:05:29.150> wars<00:05:29.300> sets<00:05:29.570> at

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
think this new wave of star wars sets at

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.150 
think this new wave of star wars sets at
least<00:05:29.930> the<00:05:30.020> three<00:05:30.230> that<00:05:30.350> i<00:05:30.410> have<00:05:30.740> are<00:05:30.890> actually

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
least the three that i have are actually

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.770 
least the three that i have are actually
really<00:05:31.340> good<00:05:31.520> so<00:05:32.270> i'll<00:05:32.360> see<00:05:32.510> you<00:05:32.570> guys<00:05:32.630> next

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.350 
really good so i'll see you guys next
