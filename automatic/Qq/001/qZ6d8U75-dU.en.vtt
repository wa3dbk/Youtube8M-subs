00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
 people like him or her he says 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.030
 a spacious and different one and then sometimes it is not always the same 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:08.200
 few stress sometimes 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.999
 for example you have about my child is so needed 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:12.359
 and yes 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:14.179
 I'm very angry too 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.730
 But that's not always so healthy being nice to those things against well 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.810
 for instance 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.480
 and and that i just told my son had a head full 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.220
 he finishes quickly 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.210
 but I had no successor has nothing to do with it reports the other way 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.160
 my head full 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.690
 Japan is then you actually I say but more metaphorical look or hey 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.080
 grace has gained figurative meaning 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.160
 you really can't do better 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.690
 the teacher think 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.570
 so accurate 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.100
 grass children that every time as declarant 80 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.100
 so all those children negotiated ready 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.800
 have such a problem 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.280
 pristina the perfect problems than the manageability yourself and 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.769
 liaison team because of course 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.469
 and the one leg a child goes on a colder 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.240
 yes but you can be a big trigger 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.000
 and groups of children 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.070
 mine where you as the airlines 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.980
 sit in our stomach 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.570
 the hang-around problem with ADHD 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.910
 children 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.420
 Nowadays, many labels are simply said nowadays 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.090
 hehe us 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.410
 yes if it's from trading and ds it means nothing else 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.970
 because it has too little attention for it 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.190
 the things that really matter 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.140
 The IV incident is not seeing too little attention and it pulls itself more 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.860
 to care 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.800
 and then they are pressing 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.120
 Busy with anything and everything 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.610
 where dominique and have seen real attention 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.360
 and those children can therefore not do their gardens rightly at school no 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.990
 we also do not perform any essential duties 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.100
 for our life follow 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.459
 would have to stand for it and got already released especially in the us 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.189
 we make it all go by 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.990
 and I immediately go to the store to bet 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.179
 but temporarily 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.179
 we just created a few society there 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.760
 and where last record from the most normal thing in the world is that you are not on 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.669
 search 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.789
 who you really are and what you can do 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:21.939
 and that may not be 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.320
 because sometimes your parents see that behavior 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.079
 she understand that she did have a share in it 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.249
 He is there after two years when I saw driving, of course, whatever my child is 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.049
 not to the defender of hsv 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.249
 yes but and that you can really see that their child 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:39.439
 better ward of his physical complaints 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.749
 the willingness of the elderly to do something else 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:46.299
 peter r this is not immediately people are just chattering 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.909
 Yes 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.029
 If only it were like that with so many people 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:51.299
 fc lienden of the 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.299
 I think they assume it is so that my character is me 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.840
 With that yes if you only have to keep yourself circus also a more often 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:01.460
 homes but I'm going I am already uncertain once 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.710
 exactly after the painful defeat, the government acknowledges a slightly lower start 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.859
 in the neighborhood and that is uncertain of that 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:15.510
 sometimes it's really no different than asking for a popping bottle of 9 k 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:18.239
 to have 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.569
 we help 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.699
 if i'm not even a writer i thought this is such 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.429
 wonderful you have to measure more people 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:27.689
 and 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.540
 well and then the joke agents got to know trainee in my practice 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.599
 it has now become my colleague 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.659
 nkc his song when you bind you to write a book 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.709
 Then we must ensure that people in the Netherlands have this methodology 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.309
 be able to apply my body is going to work can vote 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.820
 But yes we are in Friesland but if someone in Limburg finishes in Amsterdam then 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.750
 Many other countries therefore have to be very positive people 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.750
 come or after the break the recovery is handicap 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:02.809
 stolen there is a big one because i was actually writing 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:06.549
 but then went a bit to set up the training as a child interpreter 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.349
 and that there is also that children's interpreter 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.230
 so it is and that is and that is the word what we have continued there 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:16.199
 and 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.309
 jane and so confess 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:21.680
 after professionals who are just in the care 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.650
 to look this way 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.110
 and there are now around 40 45 soybean skaters derived in the Netherlands 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.729
 decades 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:32.880
 9 and 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.760
 yes they are all there in their own region days and with it going 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.860

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.870
 years we have a training day names all those weird stories come forward 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:45.909
 besides great 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.930
 down and then we go back a bit 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.599
 yes, everything sharp again and make life smile again they will do 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.220
 with a meter thick it is just very nice 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.600
 he just booked the book salon step by step and with it a little 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.969
 have extra wild bees then you can go to a children's village 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:10.779
 but it's just a method with two feet on the ground and you can but you can 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:13.499
 just start tomorrow yes yes 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:15.620
 it is actually very effective to use 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.599
 a regular accident 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:23.349
 You start even though the blood is not a syrian woman from the Frisian language area 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:27.610

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.139
 yes how terrible what a hooter cleaned up 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.849

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:43.450
 the woman is actually whispering child 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.940
 years because children want to give us my message logically to the rich 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.060
 but they don't say that in words but they actually do it non verbally 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.400
 9 often paid via play or complaints 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.380
 All things like that are kept to sleep through developments 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:03.740
 there is still neither 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.740

 I also think it's really going to do something 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:40.520
 ultimately everyone 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.710
 what is needed is a mua road 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.710
 to realize that you are the perpetrators 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.789

 ceo van apple church services

 hunting is a popular thing to do 

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:35.249
 and then involved 

00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:38.389
 there are just fickle brothers on the scenes 

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:41.389
 they got us in 1903 

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:42.710
 coffee shops
