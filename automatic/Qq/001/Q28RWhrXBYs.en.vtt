skyscrapers are going to build now in

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.940 
skyscrapers are going to build now in
order<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.579> do<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.530> add<00:01:31.650> more

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
order to do that you you can add more

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.679 
order to do that you you can add more
stuff<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.490> Linux<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.060> stuff<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.540> and

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
stuff like Linux and stuff like that and

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.420 
stuff like Linux and stuff like that and
things<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.259> need<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.829> usually<00:01:35.040> go

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
things that you need but I usually go

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.760 
things that you need but I usually go
with<00:01:35.460> parks<00:01:36.180> because<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.020> easier<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
with parks because it's easier and

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.800 
with parks because it's easier and
cheaper<00:01:37.829> if<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.909> know<00:01:39.210> how<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.390> place<00:01:39.600> them

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
cheaper if you know how to place them

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.469 
cheaper if you know how to place them
now<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.439> thing<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.770> basic<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.729> only<00:01:41.880> used<00:01:42.180> when

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
now the thing is basic is only used when

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.810 
now the thing is basic is only used when
you<00:01:42.630> have<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> factory<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.009> giving<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.549> red

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
you have a factory that is giving a red

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.940 
you have a factory that is giving a red
orb<00:01:45.119> around<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.020> want<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.350> build<00:01:46.710> some

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
orb around and you want to build some

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.249 
orb around and you want to build some
houses<00:01:47.130> around<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.700> factory<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:48.990> put<00:01:49.229> a

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
houses around that factory so you put a

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.460 
where it loads amounts of money that one
only<00:02:31.170> takes<00:02:31.790> $40<00:02:32.790> every<00:02:33.329> hour<00:02:33.510> or<00:02:33.840> 40

only takes $40 every hour or 40

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.860 
only takes $40 every hour or 40
simoleons<00:02:35.010> every<00:02:35.489> hour<00:02:35.640> which<00:02:36.269> is<00:02:36.450> not<00:02:36.629> bad

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
simoleons every hour which is not bad

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.649 
simoleons every hour which is not bad
we're<00:02:37.200> going<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.379> put<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.590> right<00:02:37.739> here<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:39.090> as

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
we're going to put it right here and as

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.009 
we're going to put it right here and as
you<00:02:39.750> can<00:02:39.870> see<00:02:39.930> we<00:02:40.799> have<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:42.030> area<00:02:42.659> increase

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
you can see we have the area increase

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.110 
you can see we have the area increase
now<00:02:43.709> what<00:02:43.890> we're<00:02:44.010> going<00:02:44.129> to<00:02:44.159> do<00:02:44.340> is<00:02:44.549> instead<00:02:45.060> of

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
now what we're going to do is instead of

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.089 
now what we're going to do is instead of
actually<00:02:45.360> putting<00:02:45.840> another<00:02:46.170> one<00:02:46.530> we're<00:02:47.010> going

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
actually putting another one we're going

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.849 
actually putting another one we're going
to<00:02:47.220> click<00:02:47.459> on<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.879> Park<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.510> now<00:02:49.290> we<00:02:49.349> will

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
to click on that Park and now we will

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.849 
to click on that Park and now we will
click<00:02:50.730> back<00:02:50.970> into<00:02:51.209> land<00:02:51.599> value<00:02:51.870> because<00:02:52.170> the

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
click back into land value because the

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.839 
click back into land value because the
views<00:02:53.190> taken<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:53.940> this<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.930> actually<00:02:55.849> better

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
views taken and this is actually better

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.619 
views taken and this is actually better
than<00:02:57.269> placing<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.930> lot<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.940> lot<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.090> parks<00:03:00.510> all

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
than placing a lot of a lot of parks all

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.960 
than placing a lot of a lot of parks all
over<00:03:00.659> the<00:03:00.870> place<00:03:01.079> as<00:03:01.260> as<00:03:01.859> you<00:03:02.159> can<00:03:02.310> see<00:03:02.549> like<00:03:02.849> I

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
over the place as as you can see like I

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.539 
over the place as as you can see like I
told<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.329> before<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.750> was<00:03:04.260> not<00:03:04.620> dark<00:03:05.159> blue

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
told you before that was not dark blue

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.080 
told you before that was not dark blue
this<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.420> dark<00:03:06.840> blue<00:03:07.049> this<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:07.650> where<00:03:07.920> the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
this is dark blue this is where the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.309 
this is dark blue this is where the
skyscrapers<00:03:09.090> are<00:03:09.209> going<00:03:09.359> to<00:03:09.420> be<00:03:09.510> built<00:03:09.720> now

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
skyscrapers are going to be built now

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.160 
skyscrapers are going to be built now
once<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.829> build<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.250> area<00:03:12.060> like<00:03:12.329> a<00:03:12.359> circle<00:03:12.930> with

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
once you build a area like a circle with

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.309 
once you build a area like a circle with
three<00:03:13.500> parks<00:03:14.040> at<00:03:14.159> least<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:15.510> will<00:03:15.659> start<00:03:16.230> to

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
three parks at least you will start to

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.030 
three parks at least you will start to
build<00:03:16.590> parks<00:03:17.250> in<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.940> edge<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.870> dark<00:03:19.680> blue

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
build parks in the edge of the dark blue

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.319 
build parks in the edge of the dark blue
for<00:03:20.819> example<00:03:21.239> let's<00:03:21.389> go<00:03:21.450> back<00:03:21.750> into<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.940> parks

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
for example let's go back into the parks

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.050 
for example let's go back into the parks
over<00:03:24.599> here<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.370> let's<00:03:26.370> go<00:03:26.489> back<00:03:26.669> into<00:03:26.849> the

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
over here and let's go back into the

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.900 
over here and let's go back into the
land<00:03:27.269> value<00:03:28.099> I'm<00:03:29.099> going<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.370> build<00:03:29.549> one<00:03:29.730> over

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
land value I'm going to build one over

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.280 
land value I'm going to build one over
here<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.120> don't<00:03:30.269> want<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.569> destroy<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.019> but<00:03:31.260> I

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
here I don't want to destroy it but I

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.509 
here I don't want to destroy it but I
don't<00:03:31.379> want<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.620> store<00:03:31.919> that<00:03:31.950> big<00:03:32.250> building

build<00:03:34.530> right<00:03:34.769> there<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.389> then<00:03:36.389> we're<00:03:36.720> gonna

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
build right there and then we're gonna

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.589 
build right there and then we're gonna
click<00:03:37.019> on<00:03:37.079> it<00:03:37.290> I'm<00:03:38.280> going<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.459> boost<00:03:38.730> one<00:03:39.269> more

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.879 
making a line and all the builds over
here<00:03:46.379> are<00:03:46.530> actually<00:03:47.010> changing<00:03:47.669> not<00:03:48.359> only<00:03:48.419> the

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
here are actually changing not only the

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.309 
here are actually changing not only the
buildings<00:03:49.889> but<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.579> shops<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:52.049> shops

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
buildings but the shops to the shops

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.409 
buildings but the shops to the shops
will<00:03:52.590> not<00:03:52.829> change<00:03:53.220> unless<00:03:53.639> the<00:03:53.819> land<00:03:54.030> value<00:03:54.329> is

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
will not change unless the land value is

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.150 
will not change unless the land value is
actually<00:03:54.870> higher<00:03:55.049> so<00:03:55.379> you<00:03:55.470> can<00:03:55.620> see<00:03:55.799> this<00:03:56.010> is

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
actually higher so you can see this is

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.699 
actually higher so you can see this is
shops<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:57.000> they're<00:03:57.150> going<00:03:57.419> to<00:03:57.569> change<00:03:57.810> into<00:03:58.680> a

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
shops and they're going to change into a

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.580 
shops and they're going to change into a
bigger<00:03:59.069> shop<00:03:59.459> providing<00:04:00.419> more<00:04:00.660> jobs<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:01.379> more

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
bigger shop providing more jobs and more

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.259 
bigger shop providing more jobs and more
happiness<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.370> Sims<00:04:02.609> now<00:04:04.010> freaking<00:04:05.269> the

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
happiness to the Sims now freaking the

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.830 
happiness to the Sims now freaking the
the<00:04:07.049> factories<00:04:07.680> do<00:04:08.099> not<00:04:08.310> change<00:04:08.849> because<00:04:09.480> of

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
the factories do not change because of

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.409 
the factories do not change because of
land<00:04:10.049> value<00:04:10.470> so<00:04:11.099> it<00:04:11.699> doesn't<00:04:12.000> really<00:04:12.090> matter

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
land value so it doesn't really matter

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.720 
land value so it doesn't really matter
if<00:04:12.750> you<00:04:12.930> have<00:04:13.109> a<00:04:13.410> bunch<00:04:13.769> of<00:04:13.859> parks<00:04:14.280> around<00:04:14.579> the

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
if you have a bunch of parks around the

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.360 
if you have a bunch of parks around the
factories<00:04:15.269> they<00:04:15.750> will<00:04:15.930> not<00:04:16.139> increase<00:04:16.560> if<00:04:17.039> you

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
factories they will not increase if you

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.640 
factories they will not increase if you
have<00:04:17.579> a<00:04:18.650> building<00:04:19.650> like<00:04:19.889> a<00:04:20.180> Missi<00:04:21.409> where<00:04:22.409> as<00:04:22.500> it

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
have a building like a Missi where as it

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.909 
have a building like a Missi where as it
was<00:04:22.770> right<00:04:23.460> like<00:04:23.490> for<00:04:23.789> example<00:04:24.919> the

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
was right like for example the

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.490 
was right like for example the
university<00:04:26.789> which<00:04:26.940> says<00:04:27.419> increases<00:04:28.229> tech

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
university which says increases tech

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.520 
university which says increases tech
level<00:04:28.740> of<00:04:29.010> nearby<00:04:29.580> industry<00:04:30.479> buildings<00:04:30.900> that

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
level of nearby industry buildings that

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.800 
level of nearby industry buildings that
will<00:04:31.830> actually<00:04:32.550> increase<00:04:32.969> the<00:04:33.419> volume<00:04:33.630> of

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
will actually increase the volume of

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.520 
will actually increase the volume of
this<00:04:34.260> factories<00:04:34.919> not<00:04:35.669> parks<00:04:36.210> also<00:04:36.690> if<00:04:37.380> you

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
this factories not parks also if you

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.450 
this factories not parks also if you
have<00:04:37.710> this<00:04:38.190> which<00:04:38.969> is<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.300> boot<00:04:39.690> hour<00:04:39.960> also

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
have this which is the boot hour also

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.270 
have this which is the boot hour also
increases<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:42.620> detect<00:04:43.620> level<00:04:43.950> of<00:04:44.099> the

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
increases the detect level of the

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.820 
increases the detect level of the
industry<00:04:44.729> buildings<00:04:45.360> so<00:04:46.110> you<00:04:46.169> got<00:04:46.440> a<00:04:46.469> change

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
industry buildings so you got a change

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.070 
industry buildings so you got a change
you<00:04:47.610> got<00:04:47.760> to<00:04:47.849> choose<00:04:48.300> which<00:04:48.539> one<00:04:48.750> you<00:04:48.900> put<00:04:49.050> a

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
you got to choose which one you put a

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.930 
you got to choose which one you put a
lot<00:04:49.289> around<00:04:49.530> that<00:04:49.830> one<00:04:50.070> so<00:04:50.280> you<00:04:50.310> can<00:04:50.550> they<00:04:50.789> can

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
lot around that one so you can they can

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.060 
lot around that one so you can they can
actually<00:04:51.510> increase<00:04:51.780> as<00:04:52.320> you<00:04:52.409> can<00:04:52.530> see<00:04:52.680> here

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
actually increase as you can see here

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.129 
actually increase as you can see here
there's<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.400> lot<00:04:53.580> of<00:04:53.700> bunch<00:04:53.909> of<00:04:54.060> big-ass<00:04:54.599> houses

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
there's a lot of bunch of big-ass houses

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.560 
there's a lot of bunch of big-ass houses
and<00:04:56.659> big-ass<00:04:57.659> shops<00:04:58.080> now<00:04:59.070> now<00:05:00.000> it<00:05:00.180> takes<00:05:00.360> a

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
and big-ass shops now now it takes a

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.659 
and big-ass shops now now it takes a
while<00:05:00.780> but<00:05:01.080> this<00:05:01.409> are<00:05:02.039> the<00:05:02.250> houses<00:05:02.430> that

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
while but this are the houses that

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.839 
while but this are the houses that
actually<00:05:02.729> change<00:05:03.450> into<00:05:04.130> skyscrapers<00:05:05.130> this

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
actually change into skyscrapers this

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.110 
actually change into skyscrapers this
ones<00:05:06.770> so<00:05:07.770> you<00:05:07.889> can<00:05:08.039> start<00:05:08.400> putting<00:05:08.700> all<00:05:09.000> the

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
ones so you can start putting all the

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.620 
ones so you can start putting all the
stuff<00:05:09.150> like<00:05:09.659> for<00:05:09.870> example<00:05:09.930> a<00:05:14.180> police<00:05:15.180> station

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
stuff like for example a police station

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.779 
stuff like for example a police station
which<00:05:15.750> I<00:05:15.870> didn't<00:05:16.110> have<00:05:16.229> before<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:16.889> also

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:17.789 
which I didn't have before that also

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.959 
which I didn't have before that also
increases<00:05:18.330> the<00:05:18.650> land<00:05:19.650> value<00:05:20.070> and<00:05:20.310> people<00:05:20.610> I

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:20.969 
increases the land value and people I

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:23.300 
increases the land value and people I
don't<00:05:21.029> like<00:05:21.180> people<00:05:21.719> like<00:05:21.990> it<00:05:22.289> people<00:05:22.979> do<00:05:23.130> not

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
don't like people like it people do not

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.070 
don't like people like it people do not
increase<00:05:23.729> their<00:05:24.000> volume<00:05:24.150> if<00:05:24.539> you<00:05:24.690> don't<00:05:24.870> have

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
increase their volume if you don't have

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.589 
increase their volume if you don't have
the<00:05:25.710> three<00:05:25.979> things<00:05:26.190> necessary<00:05:26.880> like<00:05:27.150> a<00:05:27.180> police

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
the three things necessary like a police

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.200 
the three things necessary like a police
station<00:05:28.050> a<00:05:28.169> clinic<00:05:28.560> and<00:05:28.770> a<00:05:29.070> fire<00:05:29.430> station<00:05:29.729> also

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
station a clinic and a fire station also

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.600 
station a clinic and a fire station also
people<00:05:31.110> will<00:05:31.320> not<00:05:31.620> increase<00:05:32.070> the<00:05:32.250> bottom<00:05:32.490> of

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
people will not increase the bottom of

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.879 
people will not increase the bottom of
the<00:05:32.760> houses<00:05:32.969> if<00:05:33.300> you<00:05:33.659> don't<00:05:34.050> have<00:05:34.409> the<00:05:34.650> right

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
the houses if you don't have the right

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.790 
the houses if you don't have the right
street<00:05:35.370> they<00:05:36.060> do<00:05:36.120> not<00:05:36.360> like<00:05:36.659> to<00:05:36.840> build<00:05:37.020> specify

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
street they do not like to build specify

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.690 
street they do not like to build specify
this<00:05:37.860> on<00:05:38.250> dirt<00:05:38.700> road<00:05:39.000> they<00:05:39.930> like<00:05:40.169> it<00:05:40.349> in<00:05:40.700> high

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
this on dirt road they like it in high

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.830 
this on dirt road they like it in high
density<00:05:41.940> streets<00:05:42.479> and<00:05:42.750> so<00:05:43.529> forth<00:05:43.889> so<00:05:44.840> that's

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
density streets and so forth so that's

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.360 
density streets and so forth so that's
all<00:05:45.990> I<00:05:46.110> have<00:05:46.229> to<00:05:46.349> do<00:05:46.469> now<00:05:46.650> you<00:05:46.710> only<00:05:46.979> got<00:05:47.219> to<00:05:47.279> do

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
all I have to do now you only got to do

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.510 
all I have to do now you only got to do
is<00:05:47.430> wait<00:05:47.729> in<00:05:48.020> those<00:05:49.020> houses<00:05:49.260> will<00:05:49.650> start<00:05:50.130> to

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
is wait in those houses will start to

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.610 
is wait in those houses will start to
build<00:05:50.760> skyscrapers<00:05:51.450> and<00:05:52.080> stuff<00:05:52.260> like<00:05:52.409> that

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
build skyscrapers and stuff like that

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.769 
build skyscrapers and stuff like that
see<00:05:53.430> you<00:05:53.520> next<00:05:53.700> time<00:05:53.789> this<00:05:54.000> was<00:05:54.300> dragging

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:54.779 
see you next time this was dragging

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:56.750 
see you next time this was dragging
hands<00:05:54.990> for<00:05:55.349> eyes<00:05:55.440> for<00:05:55.770> gaming<00:05:56.070> teaching<00:05:56.430> you

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
hands for eyes for gaming teaching you
