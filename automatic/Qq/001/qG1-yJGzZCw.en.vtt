presto is worked to put the pan on a
fairly<00:01:27.539> low<00:01:27.779> heat<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.380> start<00:01:29.130> off<00:01:29.279> with<00:01:29.579> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
fairly low heat to start off with and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.910 
fairly low heat to start off with and
we're<00:01:30.209> going<00:01:30.389> to<00:01:30.420> reduce<00:01:30.719> what<00:01:31.499> we've<00:01:31.649> got<00:01:31.799> in

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.039 
we're going to reduce what we've got in
the<00:01:32.039> pan<00:01:32.279> till<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.029> gets<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.479> about<00:01:33.509> 3

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
the pan till it gets to about 3

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.139 
the pan till it gets to about 3
tablespoons<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:35.279> what<00:01:35.459> we've<00:01:35.579> got<00:01:35.700> then<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.119> a

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
tablespoons so what we've got then is a

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.089 
tablespoons so what we've got then is a
really<00:01:36.599> really<00:01:36.630> strong<00:01:36.990> reduction<00:01:37.590> that's

00:01:38.089 --> 00:01:38.099 
really really strong reduction that's

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:39.800 
really really strong reduction that's
going<00:01:38.249> to<00:01:38.340> add<00:01:38.429> a<00:01:38.459> great<00:01:38.700> deal<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:38.909> flavor<00:01:39.209> to

slurp and my wine and then get on with
the<00:01:48.599> rest<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.959> recipe<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.709> reduction<00:01:50.099> is

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
the rest of the recipe the reduction is

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.469 
the rest of the recipe the reduction is
now<00:01:50.340> ready<00:01:50.639> you<00:01:50.880> can<00:01:50.999> tell<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.299> ready

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
now ready you can tell it's ready

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.649 
now ready you can tell it's ready

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
of a slow process but this is absolutely

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.990 
of a slow process but this is absolutely
crucial<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:48.080> make<00:03:48.470> sure<00:03:48.770> the<00:03:49.310> sauce<00:03:49.550> doesn't

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
crucial to make sure the sauce doesn't

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.199
