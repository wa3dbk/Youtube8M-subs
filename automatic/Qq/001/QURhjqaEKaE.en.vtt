00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.879
 to the slice on sea what is problematic is not so much the 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.680
 wild parking has gotten rid of motorhome in front of Toulouse 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.530
 motorhomes who take advantage of the free parking areas 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.870
 to settle there for several weeks or even months 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.370
 obviously prevents the scary tornos and the welcome of new summer visitors too 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.840
 to try to reduce this effect the French municipality comes from 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.270
 decide for the very first time to make the four sisters 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.589
 reserved parking for paying motorhomes 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.070
 so the young German place of the parking 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.620
 the first sport forever their 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.380
 cr7 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.010
 we spend the morning in europe the staffs dream the night per cent 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.560
 make them pay in the morning 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.670
 the people stop the agents but we make them pay at night because 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.589
 of five euros the night is 12 euros the two musicians 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.319
 so obviously this measure is not always very appreciated 

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:53.319
 motorhome 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.550
 but promised some exceptions in their vast majority of 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.230
 summers we take the measure he accepts 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.190
 even if the tariff remains for a lot a bit high the dogs bark payment 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:04.890
 parking 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.690
 it serves as paid campervans 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.690
 anyway more and more even having fed up 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.160
 the parties to go higher and the electricity are fine but no 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.980
 she left this euro 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.680
 we can consider that it is a little bit expensive 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.020
 but we are obliged anyway 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.030
 there is no choice 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.180
 volleyball on average more expensive normand strangely declared Friday 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.450
 in freeville 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.220
 you must not hide rtl 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.090
 just to undertake the work of restoring to full standards in the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.240
 conflict does not ask the partridge but I still find it's too much 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.540
 dear for the club it's the cadet saint outgoing boss 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.250
 so it's normal when you pay 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.530
 the measure seems very much that this TV rate a little less so it's 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.860
 possibly the price if it is that the municipality slicer duty 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.880
 re-examine after this experimentation 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.840
 the price but also consequences related to paid parking we do not 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.610
 do not know exactly what impact it's going to have 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.610
 the content that you are in any case remains like you on the semester 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.090
 positioned elsewhere anyway it's moving to move it will be more 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.779
 on the spot for several weeks 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:13.269
 did paying parking result in an increase in the number of 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.729
 wild parkings of motorhomes 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:19.189
 so does the serenity of the seaside resort that can accommodate 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.819
 daily and in season plus two of his father
