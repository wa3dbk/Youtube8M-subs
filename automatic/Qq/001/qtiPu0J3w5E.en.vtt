compact now the cable that comes with
this<00:00:55.940> power<00:00:56.150> brick<00:00:56.420> is<00:00:58.089> moderately<00:00:59.089> sized<00:00:59.390> and

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
this power brick is moderately sized and

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.320 
this power brick is moderately sized and
at<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.049> end<00:01:00.199> it<00:01:00.409> has<00:01:00.440> a<00:01:00.729> squarish<00:01:01.729> connector

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
at the end it has a squarish connector

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.240 
at the end it has a squarish connector
or<00:01:02.600> rectangular<00:01:03.110> connector<00:01:03.650> which<00:01:03.830> is<00:01:03.860> pretty

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
or rectangular connector which is pretty

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.010 
or rectangular connector which is pretty
different<00:01:04.879> than<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:05.420> regular<00:01:05.780> round

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.070 
different than the regular round
connectors<00:01:06.530> that<00:01:06.560> we<00:01:06.770> see<00:01:06.950> with<00:01:07.130> laptops<00:01:08.080> you

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
connectors that we see with laptops you

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.020 
connectors that we see with laptops you
also<00:01:09.230> get<00:01:09.530> your<00:01:09.680> wall<00:01:09.860> sockets<00:01:10.340> your<00:01:10.820> wall

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
also get your wall sockets your wall

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.690 
also get your wall sockets your wall
plugs<00:01:11.620> which<00:01:12.620> are<00:01:12.770> at<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.950> other<00:01:13.070> part<00:01:13.460> of<00:01:13.610> the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
plugs which are at the other part of the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.060 
plugs which are at the other part of the
adapter<00:01:14.150> so<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:14.960> get<00:01:15.170> your<00:01:15.410> three<00:01:15.650> pin<00:01:15.830> style

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
adapter so you get your three pin style

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.570 
adapter so you get your three pin style
a<00:01:16.430> wall<00:01:17.000> plug<00:01:17.180> you<00:01:17.630> also<00:01:17.780> get<00:01:18.110> two<00:01:19.100> pin<00:01:19.310> style

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
a wall plug you also get two pin style

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.120 
a wall plug you also get two pin style
so<00:01:19.790> if<00:01:19.880> you<00:01:20.030> in<00:01:20.570> UK<00:01:21.050> you<00:01:21.530> can<00:01:21.560> use<00:01:21.800> the<00:01:21.950> three
