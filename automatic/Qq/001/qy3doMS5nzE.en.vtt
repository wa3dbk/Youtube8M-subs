liter petrol engine with a turbo and it

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.170 
liter petrol engine with a turbo and it

sprint from all to 100 in about seven

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.050 
sprint from all to 100 in about seven
seconds<00:03:37.270> if<00:03:38.140> you're<00:03:38.709> driving<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.490> engine

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
seconds if you're driving the engine

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.680 
seconds if you're driving the engine
very<00:03:40.330> calm<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:41.110> is<00:03:41.230> also<00:03:41.880> very<00:03:42.880> calm<00:03:43.330> well<00:03:43.570> you

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
very calm it is also very calm well you

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.090 
very calm it is also very calm well you
don't<00:03:43.840> hear<00:03:44.110> anything<00:03:44.380> when<00:03:44.650> driving<00:03:44.860> in<00:03:45.010> the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
don't hear anything when driving in the

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.510 
don't hear anything when driving in the
city<00:03:45.250> for<00:03:45.520> example<00:03:45.580> and<00:03:46.060> know<00:03:46.209> it<00:03:46.420> like<00:03:47.520> 120

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
city for example and know it like 120

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.480 
city for example and know it like 120
kilometers<00:03:49.030> now<00:03:49.240> and<00:03:49.510> it's<00:03:49.900> also<00:03:50.320> still<00:03:50.830> quite

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
kilometers now and it's also still quite

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.340 
kilometers now and it's also still quite
sinusoids<00:03:52.240> I<00:03:52.450> think<00:03:52.720> it's<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:52.959> good<00:03:53.080> engine

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
sinusoids I think it's a good engine

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.830 
sinusoids I think it's a good engine
it's<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:54.010> bigger<00:03:54.220> petrol<00:03:54.610> engine<00:03:54.910> is<00:03:55.180> also

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
it's the bigger petrol engine is also

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.050 
it's the bigger petrol engine is also
smaller<00:03:56.170> one<00:03:56.350> available<00:03:56.560> but<00:03:57.550> I<00:03:57.580> think<00:03:57.820> we<00:03:57.940> can

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
smaller one available but I think we can

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.180 
smaller one available but I think we can
recommend<00:03:58.480> this<00:03:58.630> engine<00:03:59.020> you<00:03:59.650> shouldn't<00:04:00.010> just

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
recommend this engine you shouldn't just

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.600 
recommend this engine you shouldn't just
expect<00:04:00.730> a<00:04:01.180> little<00:04:01.870> consumption<00:04:02.560> we<00:04:03.040> are<00:04:03.160> right

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
expect a little consumption we are right

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.630 
expect a little consumption we are right
now<00:04:03.880> about<00:04:04.090> above<00:04:04.600> 8<00:04:05.110> liters<00:04:05.620> per<00:04:05.770> wanted<00:04:06.070> one

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
now about above 8 liters per wanted one

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.840 
now about above 8 liters per wanted one
on<00:04:06.760> kilometers<00:04:07.270> and<00:04:07.600> I<00:04:08.500> think<00:04:08.920> that's<00:04:09.550> quite

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
on kilometers and I think that's quite

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:30.959 
on kilometers and I think that's quite
realistic<00:04:10.630> value

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:30.969 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.839 

a<00:04:31.029> very<00:04:31.719> nice<00:04:31.929> exterior<00:04:32.559> design<00:04:33.039> feature<00:04:33.369> is

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
a very nice exterior design feature is

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:35.699 
a very nice exterior design feature is
also<00:04:34.179> something<00:04:34.539> you<00:04:34.839> can<00:04:35.019> see<00:04:35.349> from<00:04:35.619> the

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:35.709 
also something you can see from the

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:39.659 
also something you can see from the
interior<00:04:37.229> see<00:04:38.229> out<00:04:38.469> at<00:04:38.679> the<00:04:38.799> front<00:04:39.009> bonnet<00:04:39.249> you

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
interior see out at the front bonnet you

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.869 
interior see out at the front bonnet you
see<00:04:40.360> this<00:04:40.479> kind<00:04:40.869> of<00:04:41.110> power<00:04:41.559> dome<00:04:42.039> structure

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
see this kind of power dome structure

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.879 
see this kind of power dome structure
which<00:04:43.360> you<00:04:43.479> can<00:04:43.629> also<00:04:43.809> see<00:04:44.289> here<00:04:44.529> when<00:04:44.739> you're

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
which you can also see here when you're

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.249 
which you can also see here when you're
just<00:04:45.039> driving<00:04:45.969> and<00:04:46.119> that<00:04:46.360> makes<00:04:46.629> a<00:04:46.899> lot<00:04:47.079> of

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
just driving and that makes a lot of

00:04:47.259 --> 00:05:22.339 
just driving and that makes a lot of
emotion<00:04:47.799> in<00:04:47.979> my<00:04:48.279> opinion

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.379 

joining<00:05:23.349> me<00:05:23.559> today<00:05:23.740> University's<00:05:24.610> GLA<00:05:25.119> is<00:05:25.180> my

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
joining me today University's GLA is my

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.389 
joining me today University's GLA is my
colleague<00:05:25.659> Michael<00:05:26.050> he<00:05:26.800> is<00:05:26.830> likely<00:05:27.159> some

colleague Michael he is likely some
experience<00:05:27.879> with<00:05:28.029> new<00:05:28.389> a-class<00:05:28.629> as<00:05:29.349> we<00:05:29.680> can

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
experience with new a-class as we can

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.809 
experience with new a-class as we can
compare<00:05:30.279> it<00:05:30.399> the<00:05:30.669> normal<00:05:31.180> a<00:05:31.330> class<00:05:31.569> to<00:05:31.839> the<00:05:31.960> GLA

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:32.819 
compare it the normal a class to the GLA

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.850 
compare it the normal a class to the GLA
so<00:05:33.819> Michael<00:05:34.149> tell<00:05:34.180> us<00:05:34.439> when<00:05:35.439> you're<00:05:35.529> driving

so Michael tell us when you're driving

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.909 
so Michael tell us when you're driving
the<00:05:35.949> GLA<00:05:36.399> now<00:05:36.699> here<00:05:37.169> what<00:05:38.169> does<00:05:38.439> it<00:05:38.499> feel<00:05:38.860> like

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
the GLA now here what does it feel like

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.920 
the GLA now here what does it feel like
in<00:05:39.490> comparison<00:05:39.819> to<00:05:40.469> the<00:05:41.469> normal<00:05:41.740> a<00:05:42.069> classroom

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
in comparison to the normal a classroom

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.850 
in comparison to the normal a classroom
well<00:05:43.930> drums<00:05:44.409> a<00:05:44.680> new<00:05:45.069> a-class<00:05:45.339> you<00:05:46.330> feel<00:05:46.860> that

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
well drums a new a-class you feel that

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.969 
well drums a new a-class you feel that
you<00:05:48.550> have<00:05:48.759> many<00:05:49.089> similarities<00:05:49.599> so<00:05:50.199> the

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
you have many similarities so the

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:54.299 
you have many similarities so the
steering<00:05:51.490> is<00:05:52.059> nearly<00:05:52.719> the<00:05:52.870> same<00:05:53.309> secure

00:05:54.299 --> 00:05:54.309 
steering is nearly the same secure

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:57.950 
steering is nearly the same secure
transmission<00:05:54.939> works<00:05:55.800> pretty<00:05:56.800> same<00:05:57.309> to<00:05:57.550> that

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
transmission works pretty same to that

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.989 
transmission works pretty same to that
you<00:05:58.960> feel<00:05:59.229> that<00:05:59.469> you<00:06:00.189> are<00:06:00.339> a<00:06:00.370> little<00:06:00.699> bit

00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:00.999 
you feel that you are a little bit

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:06.420 
you feel that you are a little bit
higher<00:06:01.240> or<00:06:02.279> yeah<00:06:03.279> it's<00:06:03.689> not<00:06:04.689> that<00:06:05.229> high<00:06:05.529> s<00:06:05.830> and

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
higher or yeah it's not that high s and

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.049 
higher or yeah it's not that high s and
the<00:06:06.909> usual<00:06:07.599> SUV<00:06:08.169> like<00:06:08.469> the<00:06:08.709> G<00:06:08.949> okay<00:06:09.309> or<00:06:09.610> the<00:06:09.909> N

00:06:10.049 --> 00:06:10.059 
the usual SUV like the G okay or the N

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:15.019 
the usual SUV like the G okay or the N
class<00:06:10.360> but<00:06:11.399> it's<00:06:12.399> a<00:06:12.819> little<00:06:13.180> bit<00:06:13.539> higher<00:06:14.169> so

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.029 
class but it's a little bit higher so

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:18.749 
class but it's a little bit higher so
dry<00:06:16.029> driving<00:06:16.839> through<00:06:17.110> city<00:06:17.469> feels<00:06:18.430> a<00:06:18.550> little

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
dry driving through city feels a little

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:27.439 
dry driving through city feels a little
bit<00:06:19.120> more<00:06:20.279> relaxing

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:27.449 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.090 

so<00:06:28.449> to<00:06:28.510> conclude<00:06:28.930> about<00:06:29.290> the<00:06:29.410> new<00:06:29.560> machinist

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.100 
so to conclude about the new machinist

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.170 
so to conclude about the new machinist
GLA<00:06:30.580> I<00:06:30.880> must<00:06:31.660> say<00:06:31.810> it<00:06:32.080> is<00:06:32.260> not<00:06:32.590> an<00:06:32.800> SUV<00:06:33.190> right<00:06:33.610> is

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
GLA I must say it is not an SUV right is

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.260 
GLA I must say it is not an SUV right is
rather<00:06:34.540> a<00:06:34.870> normal<00:06:35.530> car<00:06:35.800> maybe<00:06:36.699> a<00:06:36.850> bit<00:06:37.030> higher

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
rather a normal car maybe a bit higher

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.560 
rather a normal car maybe a bit higher
and<00:06:37.650> you<00:06:38.650> shouldn't<00:06:38.979> expect<00:06:39.430> this<00:06:39.729> very<00:06:40.090> high

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
and you shouldn't expect this very high

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.900 
and you shouldn't expect this very high
confía<00:06:41.350> to<00:06:41.530> be<00:06:41.650> right<00:06:41.830> but<00:06:42.010> the<00:06:42.370> right<00:06:42.550> is<00:06:42.580> very

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
confía to be right but the right is very

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.080 
confía to be right but the right is very
relaxed<00:06:43.510> and<00:06:43.770> the<00:06:44.770> car<00:06:45.010> is<00:06:45.190> very<00:06:45.220> attractive

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
relaxed and the car is very attractive
