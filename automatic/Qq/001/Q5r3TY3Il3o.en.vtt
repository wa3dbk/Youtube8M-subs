could<00:00:17.070> tell<00:00:17.310> by<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.490> video<00:00:17.910> but<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.359> very<00:00:19.289> thick

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
could tell by the video but a very thick

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.950 
could tell by the video but a very thick
hair<00:00:20.060> before<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.090> used<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:22.070> two<00:00:23.070> inch

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
hair before I used a two inch

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.150 
hair before I used a two inch
straightener<00:00:24.960> like<00:00:25.199> two<00:00:25.380> inch<00:00:25.590> wide<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:25.890> is

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
straightener like two inch wide this is

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.099 
straightener like two inch wide this is
a<00:00:26.310> one<00:00:26.550> inch<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:28.070> it<00:00:29.150> really<00:00:30.150> didn't<00:00:30.510> work<00:00:30.570> I

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
a one inch and it really didn't work I

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.620 
a one inch and it really didn't work I
just<00:00:31.529> thought<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.579> needed<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:33.090> bigger

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
just thought I needed a bigger

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.389 
just thought I needed a bigger
straightener<00:00:34.230> since<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.649> had<00:00:34.770> thicker<00:00:35.130> hair

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
straightener since I had thicker hair

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.880 
straightener since I had thicker hair
and<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.969> thought<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.230> would<00:00:37.290> work<00:00:37.590> better

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
and I thought that it would work better

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.160 
and I thought that it would work better
but<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.969> not<00:00:39.360> true<00:00:39.920> um<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.899> think<00:00:42.899> that

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
but that is not true um I think that

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.260 
but that is not true um I think that
everyone<00:00:43.710> should<00:00:43.739> have<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.700> one<00:00:45.030> inch

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
everyone should have a one inch

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.470 
everyone should have a one inch
straightener<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.190> really<00:00:47.850> thin

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
straightener if you have really thin

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.110 
straightener if you have really thin
hair<00:00:48.960> if<00:00:49.350> you're<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.860> doing<00:00:50.190> your<00:00:50.219> bangs<00:00:50.670> you

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
hair if you're just doing your bangs you

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.869 
hair if you're just doing your bangs you
could<00:00:51.360> probably<00:00:52.100> get<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> half<00:00:53.550> inch

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
could probably get a half inch

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.360 
could probably get a half inch
straightener<00:00:54.449> which<00:00:54.899> that'd<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.620> easier<00:00:56.039> to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
straightener which that'd be easier to

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.069 
straightener which that'd be easier to
do<00:00:56.550> your<00:00:56.789> banks<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.270> course<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:59.239> yeah<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.780> I

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
do your banks of course and yeah so I

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.070 
do your banks of course and yeah so I
think<00:01:01.469> why<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.030> bigger<00:01:03.030> straighteners<00:01:03.690> don't

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
think why the bigger straighteners don't

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.990 
think why the bigger straighteners don't
really<00:01:04.379> work<00:01:04.589> for<00:01:04.860> me<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.220> because<00:01:05.460> they<00:01:05.670> don't

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
really work for me is because they don't

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.760 
really work for me is because they don't
they're<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.500> big<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:09.560> straightener<00:01:10.560> it

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
they're so like big the straightener it

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.630 
they're so like big the straightener it
can't<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:12.080> distribute<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.380> heat<00:01:13.650> evenly<00:01:13.710> on

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
can't like distribute the heat evenly on

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.429 
can't like distribute the heat evenly on
these<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:16.140> yeah<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:17.600> anyways<00:01:18.600> back<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.960> what

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
Ceramics aromatic I don't know how to

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.080 
Ceramics aromatic I don't know how to
call<00:02:12.720> um<00:02:13.940> plates<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:16.530> heats<00:02:16.770> up<00:02:16.980> very

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
call um plates and it heats up very

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.900 
call um plates and it heats up very
quickly<00:02:18.090> like<00:02:18.750> within<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.830> minute<00:02:20.610> or<00:02:20.880> even

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
quickly like within a minute or even

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.160 
quickly like within a minute or even
less<00:02:21.510> than<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:24.390> plates<00:02:24.720> are<00:02:24.930> really

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
less than that and the plates are really

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.110 
less than that and the plates are really
cool<00:02:25.530> because<00:02:25.710> they<00:02:25.950> move<00:02:26.220> they're<00:02:26.490> called

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
cool because they move they're called

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.630 
cool because they move they're called
floating<00:02:27.630> plates<00:02:28.160> if<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.790> could<00:02:30.000> tell<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:31.640> so

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
floating plates if you could tell and so

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
it's a blue light first it starts off at

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.060 
it's a blue light first it starts off at
390<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.720> beeps<00:03:00.960> like<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.470> until<00:03:01.920> it's

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
390 and it beeps like this until it's

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.660 
390 and it beeps like this until it's
ready<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:03.210> you<00:03:03.630> know<00:03:03.840> when<00:03:03.990> it's<00:03:04.140> ready<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.710> it

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
ready so you know when it's ready and it

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.940 
ready so you know when it's ready and it
beats<00:03:05.940> when<00:03:06.330> it's<00:03:06.570> ready<00:03:06.930> I<00:03:07.170> think<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.710> said

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
beats when it's ready I think I said

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.210 
beats when it's ready I think I said
that<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.690> so<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:09.750> could<00:03:10.140> either<00:03:10.380> do<00:03:10.740> it<00:03:10.890> oh

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
that and so you could either do it oh

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.380 
that and so you could either do it oh
yeah<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.030> could<00:03:12.390> do<00:03:12.570> go<00:03:12.960> up<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.820> 4:30<00:03:14.820> which<00:03:15.210> is

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
yeah you could do go up to 4:30 which is

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.360 
yeah you could do go up to 4:30 which is
really<00:03:15.810> high<00:03:16.020> I<00:03:16.350> don't<00:03:16.380> really<00:03:17.010> recommend

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
really high I don't really recommend

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.990 
really high I don't really recommend
doing<00:03:17.820> that<00:03:18.240> because<00:03:19.010> on<00:03:20.010> any<00:03:20.400> straightener

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
doing that because on any straightener

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.990 
doing that because on any straightener
if<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.270> go<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:21.720> high<00:03:21.990> it<00:03:22.470> kind<00:03:23.220> of<00:03:23.340> stinks

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
if you go this high it kind of stinks

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.240 
if you go this high it kind of stinks
and<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.570> smells<00:03:25.080> like<00:03:25.230> your<00:03:25.410> hair<00:03:25.710> is<00:03:25.740> burning

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
and it smells like your hair is burning

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.860 
and it smells like your hair is burning
so<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:26.940> don't<00:03:27.210> want<00:03:27.360> that<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.950> always<00:03:28.950> use<00:03:29.720> 300

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
so you don't want that I always use 300

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.170 
so you don't want that I always use 300
I<00:03:30.900> think<00:03:31.170> 320<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.010> good<00:03:32.310> too<00:03:32.520> if<00:03:32.730> you're<00:03:32.940> more

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
I think 320 is good too if you're more

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.520 
I think 320 is good too if you're more
of<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.480> in<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:34.050> rush<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.640> then<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.850> next<00:03:36.150> one's

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
of a in a rush and then the next one's

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:46.040 
of a in a rush and then the next one's
410<00:03:38.300> 393<00:03:41.180> 73<00:03:42.180> 63<00:03:43.140> 43<00:03:44.130> 20<00:03:44.580> and<00:03:44.820> then<00:03:45.000> 300<00:03:45.330> which

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
410 393 73 63 43 20 and then 300 which

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.740 
410 393 73 63 43 20 and then 300 which
is<00:03:46.290> what<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.680> use<00:03:47.070> it's<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.940> lowest<00:03:48.210> level<00:03:48.930> and

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
is what I use it's the lowest level and

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.730 
is what I use it's the lowest level and
yeah<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.290> this<00:03:52.560> is<00:03:52.770> a<00:03:52.800> very<00:03:53.220> good<00:03:53.490> straightener

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
yeah so this is a very good straightener

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.240 
yeah so this is a very good straightener
forty-four<00:03:55.740> dollars

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
forty-four dollars

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.570 
forty-four dollars
it<00:03:56.870> just<00:03:59.000> works<00:04:00.050> really<00:04:01.050> good<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:02.190> makes<00:04:02.430> your

and it's really cute too so yeah and I
think<00:04:22.069> you<00:04:22.249> should<00:04:22.280> invest<00:04:23.120> in<00:04:23.389> a

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
think you should invest in a

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.629 
think you should invest in a
straightener<00:04:24.020> definitely<00:04:24.620> don't<00:04:24.919> go<00:04:25.189> out<00:04:25.370> and

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
straightener definitely don't go out and

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.189 
straightener definitely don't go out and
buy<00:04:25.699> one<00:04:26.150> of<00:04:26.270> those<00:04:26.419> cheap<00:04:26.919> $20<00:04:27.919> ones<00:04:29.139> if<00:04:30.139> you

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
buy one of those cheap $20 ones if you

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.230 
buy one of those cheap $20 ones if you
don't<00:04:30.650> have<00:04:30.830> money<00:04:31.099> I<00:04:31.189> think<00:04:31.310> you<00:04:31.610> should<00:04:31.849> save

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
don't have money I think you should save

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.409 
don't have money I think you should save
up<00:04:32.509> for<00:04:33.219> a<00:04:34.219> straightener<00:04:34.879> and<00:04:34.909> this<00:04:35.240> isn't

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
up for a straightener and this isn't

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.390 
up for a straightener and this isn't
even<00:04:35.779> that<00:04:35.810> expensive<00:04:36.620> compared<00:04:37.249> to

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
even that expensive compared to

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.739 
even that expensive compared to
straighteners<00:04:37.999> that<00:04:38.270> they<00:04:38.419> have<00:04:38.569> out<00:04:38.719> there

00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:38.749 
straighteners that they have out there

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:42.670 
straighteners that they have out there
like<00:04:39.110> chai<00:04:39.879> that's<00:04:40.879> like<00:04:41.120> $100<00:04:41.960> for<00:04:42.289> this<00:04:42.439> one

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
like chai that's like $100 for this one

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.980 
like chai that's like $100 for this one
this<00:04:42.919> will<00:04:43.159> do<00:04:43.400> for<00:04:43.849> me<00:04:43.999> before<00:04:44.300> I<00:04:44.539> thought

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
this will do for me before I thought

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.809 
this will do for me before I thought
that<00:04:45.050> would<00:04:45.409> be<00:04:45.439> like<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.949> only<00:04:46.069> good<00:04:46.430> one<00:04:46.610> a

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
that would be like the only good one a

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:50.439 
that would be like the only good one a
chai<00:04:47.060> but<00:04:47.900> that's<00:04:48.439> not<00:04:48.770> true<00:04:49.039> this<00:04:49.249> is<00:04:49.310> very<00:04:49.999> a

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
chai but that's not true this is very a

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:56.159 
chai but that's not true this is very a
very<00:04:50.870> good<00:04:51.110> straightener<00:04:53.889> $40<00:04:54.889> the<00:04:55.789> heat

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
very good straightener $40 the heat

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.869 
very good straightener $40 the heat
temperatures<00:04:57.169> I<00:04:57.560> just<00:04:57.889> used<00:04:58.129> the<00:04:58.279> lowest<00:04:58.669> one

00:04:58.869 --> 00:04:58.879 
temperatures I just used the lowest one

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:05.860 
temperatures I just used the lowest one
so<00:04:59.210> I<00:04:59.740> think<00:05:01.900> 4:30<00:05:02.900> is<00:05:03.319> enough<00:05:03.949> though<00:05:04.669> if<00:05:05.060> you

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
so I think 4:30 is enough though if you

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.550 
so I think 4:30 is enough though if you
like<00:05:06.139> using<00:05:06.620> a<00:05:06.939> very<00:05:07.939> high<00:05:08.029> heat<00:05:08.990> temperature

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
like using a very high heat temperature

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.320 
like using a very high heat temperature
and<00:05:10.539> its<00:05:11.539> really<00:05:12.080> good<00:05:12.319> for<00:05:12.349> coarse<00:05:13.330> thick

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
and its really good for coarse thick

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.300 
and its really good for coarse thick
curly<00:05:15.289> hair<00:05:15.319> I<00:05:15.919> my<00:05:16.759> hair<00:05:17.120> is<00:05:17.419> like<00:05:18.199> um<00:05:18.680> kind<00:05:19.129> of

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310

wavy curly really thick and it

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:30.550 
wavy curly really thick and it
straightens<00:05:22.879> out<00:05:23.060> very<00:05:23.810> well<00:05:27.279> yeah<00:05:28.279> I<00:05:29.560> don't

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
straightens out very well yeah I don't

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.129 
straightens out very well yeah I don't
know<00:05:30.680> what<00:05:30.830> else<00:05:30.949> to<00:05:31.069> say<00:05:31.159> about<00:05:31.430> it<00:05:31.750> yeah<00:05:32.750> so
