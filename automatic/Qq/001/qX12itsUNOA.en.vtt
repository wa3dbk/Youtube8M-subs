00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.100
 download the file 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.100
 and we are going to put on the desk 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.240

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.140

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.840
 I have them here you part 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.060

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.329
 just but let's put here 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:04.180
 move to the resort pack 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.750
 Now what we're going to do is going to be 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.750
 close 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.600

 let's open the minecraft 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:25.210
 a tip that you use active aim or the mc 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:28.600
 pound so that you go more fluid and 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.119
 much better is it a tip you do not have 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.330
 because to use it but that way you will go much 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.440
 best 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.870
 if you know how to install the optimum in the 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.350
 description you have the video of how 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.509
 download has been worth 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.509
 what we are going to go now is to 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.430
 here as you see 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.410
 well let's go back so you can see 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.410
 let's go to options 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:05.799
 resource oil and we have it here 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.619
 good open folder that will wait for you 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.869
 that does not respond 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.370
 who play at a moment now when 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:18.390
 answer you can come back a moment 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:22.349
 It's worth as you have seen it has responded 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.269
 now we have the textures package in 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.989
 the one who uses vegeta as you can see has 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:32.750
 changed completely let's go to the 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.750
 world the world that I have created 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.170
 only what we have done has been to give 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.230
 right click the subject of 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.870
 above plan and textures as 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.440
 you can see now 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.860
 it's going a bit slower for me because my 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.129
 computer is not very good so is 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.860
 recommends using electric line as 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:02.310
 you can see everything has changed everything 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:05.740
 completely normal 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.460
 It's worth as you can see here 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.690
 expect this that we eat it this is 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.690
 the one he is currently using 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.080
 as you can see here now perfectly 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.080
 there is 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.940
 yes 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.690
 and as I say it is better your locti geyser 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.080
 fine I guess you already know what it is 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:35.140
 this here video settings 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.540
 and it lets us change everything better 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.450
 and that's why it's advisable to use the opi 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.910
 file 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.910
