00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.830
 I have a new video today 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.770
 for you and a guide from diana 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.880
 Diana is a relatively new champion 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:32.820
 this advertise ep 6300 in wheelchair 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.820
 can or even for 975 rp 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.370
 I do not want to be around for long 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.140
 catch a porridge because of that 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.930
 We directly contact you with your crafts 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.750
 On the one hand we have their passive ones 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.329
 craft the lunar silver jingle their 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.609
 passive craft brings diana 20% 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.699
 Attack speed and every third beat 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:54.359
 which she performs adds extra 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.799
 add magic damage to the opponent 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:59.439
 then we would have jumped the crescent moon 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:02.680
 diana's football here diana shoots her 

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:04.509
 crafts in a bow shape and all 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.369
 opponents the drinstehen in this form 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:13.470
 be selected and uncovered further 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:16.720
 for example facade diana 36 produces 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.360
 Ferries in contact with opponents 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.420
 explode the prize award you 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.520
 shield that cuts off a bit of damage 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.250
 but the shield is regenerated again 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.259
 when all 13 were destroyed 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.860
 These will do magic harm 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.959
 as well as football 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.869
 as a third active craft we would have 

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:39.549
 the moon seeks here beats jana once 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.079
 in the ground and all the opponents around her 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.020
 around are used and 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.630
 slows last but not least we would have 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.869
 Then the moon hates its ultimate 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.820
 craft with the craft jumps 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.950
 diana to her adversary to one 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.469
 selected opponents and caused 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.850
 damage 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:02.890
 the cooldown is pretty high 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.039
 So over 16 seconds but if the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.170
 opponent is marked by your football 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.549
 then the cooldown will be immediate 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.310
 reset if you are with the 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.540
 Ultimate craft leaps out 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.370
 that's why you should be careful 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.130
 before you jump to an opponent 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.250
 he also through your yours 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.510
 crescent moon jump is marked 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.780
 where we are already with the crafts 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.880
 go straight to the order 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.280
 i want to be first with diana 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.450
 football up that means so should 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.500
 fast as possible the football 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.590
 bring up to level 5 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.770
 second, I bring the way up 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.540
 and third, the pebble bed 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.710
 I always master the ultimate craft skill 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.270
 if you can do it on stage 6 11 and 16 in 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.880
 image you should again a 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.470
 sequence of the skills displayed 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.640
 to get 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.200
 Well then we can be right in the 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.040
 theory and continue to the 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.900
 game sweep 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.560
 I have Diana pretty offensive 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.450
 that means in offensive tree 21 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.209
 points in defensive tree 9 and 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.910
 utility tree 0 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.130
 a precise order or 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.340
 dot distribution you see in the picture like that 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.050
 then on to the runes in the red 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.580
 runen so in the sign I have the 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.090
 big sign of magic penetration 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.590
 took 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.980
 they bring you as the name implies 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.630
 Market penetration in the blue beans 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.459
 I have the big flowers of the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.880
 Growing ability taken 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.640
 they bring certain numbers per level 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.370
 in the capacity of strength they should 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.400
 Make sure you're on level 18 then enough 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.230
 and in the yellow rounds I have 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.040
 the great sail-grown ability 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.220
 taken strength 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.739
 they also bring you up 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.440
 stage 18 more ap 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.269
 but not the last essences still there have 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.799
 I had three great essences of capacity 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.200
 Strength takes you for a start 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.650
 15 more skill 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.720
 bring 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.370
 runes in things you have to enough now 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.040
 bescheid then we can also 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.570
 summon conjurators I would say 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.840
 but you should follow the summoners 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.519
 to choose your personal taste 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.440
 but I'll tell you anyway 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.510
 still what i always take and that are 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.640
 the lightning and ignite 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.829
 so now we are already at 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.430
 last point though the biggest 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:21.890
 probably the items me personally 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.660
 start with jana with a goal on the ring 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.229
 he gives you the man of regeneration 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.820
 and strengthen the ability to start and 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.380
 still live a little bit you can 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.770
 Of course with shoes and three 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.550
 pretty city ​​states but me 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.170
 personally preferred to penetrate 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.090
 Now I try as fast as 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.060
 possible the catalyst of the protector 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.470
 to buy them in turn to 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.030
 to upgrade the bar of the age 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.230
 as an appreciation for the school should 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.500
 you drink the maleki and shoes 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.930
 or better you can buy and 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.160
 then I try as soon as possible 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.480
 to get an oversized died 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.520
 in turn, I try that way 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.060
 quickly as possible to a kind us 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.900
 Death has to revalue 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.090
 ansich you now have a first 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.840
 based on items and that the 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.550
 so-called krems now the others 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.520
 items that I leave then always buy 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.010
 I play the game and you can 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.940
 choose between riehl eiskristall 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:28.450
 scepter bright scepter of death 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:32.230
 Fire's flight of light learning died 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.180
 or sony us hourglass at the 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.920
 I want to tell you that it is me 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.340
 very important, that's not easy 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.530
 only now so all the items you buy 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.960
 but you should also stand up 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.240
 watch the gameplay 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.920
 Of course you can do all the items 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.700
 I buy you here listed 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.530
 but if it is the game right now 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.330
 not so well running and her armor 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.040
 however, magic resistance is needed 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.560
 you buy yourself for example 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.900
 guardians angel unfortunately i just know 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.580
 not in the german name 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.790
 Well, please take a look yourself 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:11.380
 a little bit that you see the items 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:13.770
 So not only buys good for me 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.410
 then we would be so far already finished 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:19.210
