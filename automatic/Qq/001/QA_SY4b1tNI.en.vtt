00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.520
 Few cities can be in a prime location like Sydney. Sydney is located on the east coast of Australia. 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.490
 It is the capital of New South Wales with a population of more than 4.5 million. 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.490
 Sydney is surrounded by the surf of the Pacific Ocean, and the two striking capes are like an eternal gate. 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:40.170
 Guarding one of the most beautiful ports in the world. It is blessed with more than 100 beaches. 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.960
 Bathed in the sun all year round, and full of youthful vitality. 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.470
 To ask where can I pursue a better life? Sydney is definitely the best choice. 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.429
 To count the heart of Sydney, it must be its harbour. 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:58.440
 The city began in 1788, when it was just a place for exiles, but in less than a century, it turned into a paradise. 

00:00:58.465 --> 00:01:01.565
 The history of Sydney originated in a place called The Rocks, which was very confusing at the time. 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.250
 Then Sydney quickly took off the criminal’s shackles and developed into 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.810
 The intimate and elegant city is filled with Victorian architecture and public gardens. 

00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:16.509
 A large number of new immigrants came here by boat to find their new life. 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.510
 The city continues to evolve, creating an extremely attractive inner city suburb such as Paddington. 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.870
 The port is adjacent to Rose Bay. 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.419
 Different seaside communities have been built along the coast. 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.619
 For the first time, Sydney will feel like a maze of beaches, capes, bays and coves. 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.960
 The quickest way to find your direction is to take the top of the Sydney Tower. 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.960
 Take a walk above the 244-meter-high observation deck and take a 360-degree panoramic view of the city. 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.990
 After mastering the layout of the city, you may wish to go to the Sydney Grand Central Station - 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.539
 Take a look at Circular Quay. 

00:02:02.564 --> 00:02:09.064
 At Circular Quay, you can take a ferry, water taxi or train to any place. 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:16.039
 On the right, like the white sails in the breeze is the Sydney Opera House. 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:21.440
 You can explore this amazing performance venue without having to buy tickets or dress up. 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:29.440
 No matter how you look at it, from the inside out, from top to bottom, the opera house is definitely an architectural marvel. 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.190
 Behind the Opera House is the first farm in Sydney. 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.860
 This is home to the Royal Botanic Gardens and the Sydney Domain. 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.560
 Here you will find the Government House, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the most lush landscape of Sydney. 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.180
 On the left side of the Circular Quay is the famous Sydney Harbour Bridge, which is very special in shape and has the title of “hanger”. 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.840
 "Mr. Crocodile" actor Paul Hogan is one of the famous sons of Sydney. 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.480
 But before he became famous, he used to be the painter of the bridge. 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.980
 You certainly don't need to work on the bridge to enjoy the view from a height, just attach a seat belt and take part in the Bridge Climb Tour. 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.990
 Opposite the bridge is Luna Park, where you will see Sydney's most famous big smile. 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.070
 Although the rides inside are a bit old-fashioned, the locals will never mind. 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.670
 This fun park has been listed as a heritage and has provided a thrilling experience for countless Australian families since 1935. 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.900
 Take a ferry from Luna Park and you will soon arrive at Darling Harbour. 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.930
 This is one of the outstanding areas for urban renewal in Sydney. 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.930
 Darling Harbour used to be a broken railway yard, but now it has developed into a national Maritime Museum, a popular park, a bar and a restaurant. 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.090
 A few streets away from the Powerhouse Museum were created to celebrate the steam engine, aerospace technology and science. 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.270
 Cross the Pyrmont Bridge to the Sydney Sea Life Aquarium. 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.570
 Here you can experience the different marine environments of Australia, from the Great Barrier Reef. 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.070
 Go to the rugged South Coast. 

00:04:13.095 --> 00:04:19.495
 Australia is famous for having different kinds of land creatures, biting, stabbing, and even tearing off your entire arm. 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.300
 You can come to Wild Life Sydney. 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.400
 Say hello to some of the world's endangered species, as well as Australia's most proud animals. 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.389
 However, to visit the beautiful zoo, take a ferry or cruise to the Taronga Zoo. 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.939
 Take the cable car to the top of the mountain and follow the mountain trail. 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:52.290
 Watch out for the most enjoyable and relaxing animal ecology along the way. 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.539
 The beauty here is so beautiful, everyone wants to have this enjoyment! 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.860
 If it's time to relax, take your towel and head to Bondi Beach. 

00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:08.059
 If you don't set foot on Bondi Beach and feel the golden sand flowing between your toes, you won't be in Sydney. 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.490
 The beach has an Australian lifeguard tour with tanned skin throughout the year. 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.990
 But remember to swim in a safe area between the flags! 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.960
 Alternatively, you should not miss another famous seaside suburb, Manly. 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.169
 From the Circular Quay, take a 30-minute boat ride to Manly Wharf for an adventure in this indispensable place. 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:35.770
 Take a dip in the mirror-like Manly Cove or take a stroll along the historic Corso to Manly Beach. 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.890
 If you have never tried surfing, pack your gear quickly and learn from this surf. 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:50.870
 Feeling energetic? Follow the coastal trails and jungle trails to the North Head, where you can look back and enjoy the elegant views of the mountains and rivers. 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:00.870
 Now that you have climbed the bridge, conquered the waves of Bondi and saw wild animals, 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:07.029
 Needless to say, you should feel a little thirsty now. It's time to get involved in one of Sydney's great traditions. 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:13.919
 Come to the sea to integrate into the world of the locals, raise the cold beer in your hand, and cheer for this paradise.
