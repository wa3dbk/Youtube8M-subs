that's<00:01:57.900> a<00:01:57.990> hundred

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.070 

boy<00:02:27.950> we<00:02:28.100> decided<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.760> do<00:02:28.940> is<00:02:29.120> bring<00:02:29.690> this<00:02:29.870> thing

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
boy we decided to do is bring this thing

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.540 
boy we decided to do is bring this thing
on<00:02:30.260> out<00:02:30.470> into<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.010> shallow<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:34.250> can<00:02:34.400> actually

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
on out into the shallow you can actually

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.890 
on out into the shallow you can actually
walk<00:02:34.910> across<00:02:35.270> this<00:02:35.570> bag

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
walk across this bag

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.170 
walk across this bag
of<00:02:37.260> course<00:02:37.470> where<00:02:37.650> he's<00:02:37.830> at<00:02:38.069> you<00:02:38.220> can't<00:02:38.459> you

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
of course where he's at you can't you

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.470 
of course where he's at you can't you
can't<00:02:39.450> right<00:02:39.659> here<00:02:40.489> so<00:02:41.489> numbnuts<00:02:42.030> here<00:02:42.269> is

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
can't right here so numbnuts here is

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:51.100 
can't right here so numbnuts here is
going<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.750> back<00:02:42.959> out<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.409> me

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.830 

that<00:02:51.740> that's<00:02:52.190> good

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.180 

okay<00:02:56.560> say<00:02:56.800> so<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.989> lot<00:02:58.989> more<00:02:59.020> shallow<00:02:59.680> than<00:02:59.860> what

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
okay say so a lot more shallow than what

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.380 
okay say so a lot more shallow than what
I<00:03:00.220> thought<00:03:00.489> he's<00:03:00.730> able<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:01.090> back

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.970 

25<00:03:05.990> yards<00:03:08.020> so<00:03:09.020> it<00:03:09.200> should<00:03:09.350> be<00:03:09.380> no<00:03:09.560> problem<00:03:09.920> at

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
25 yards so it should be no problem at

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.040 
25 yards so it should be no problem at
all<00:03:10.070> reaching<00:03:10.520> him<00:03:10.610> now

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:20.059 

if<00:03:13.560> we<00:03:13.710> can<00:03:13.830> get<00:03:13.950> back<00:03:13.980> out

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.229 

so<00:03:21.069> when<00:03:21.189> he's<00:03:21.340> down<00:03:21.459> he's<00:03:21.670> run<00:03:21.879> a<00:03:21.909> snatch

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
so when he's down he's run a snatch

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.369 
so when he's down he's run a snatch
block<00:03:22.269> to<00:03:22.810> that<00:03:22.959> middle<00:03:23.200> tree<00:03:23.499> out<00:03:23.709> there<00:03:25.319> in<00:03:26.319> a

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
block to that middle tree out there in a

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.149 
block to that middle tree out there in a
little<00:03:26.590> bit<00:03:26.680> better<00:03:26.829> pulling<00:03:27.730> out<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.090> the

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
little bit better pulling out of the

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:35.220 
little bit better pulling out of the
angle<00:03:30.159> him<00:03:30.280> out<00:03:30.430> of<00:03:30.609> there<00:03:30.730> I<00:03:34.109> don't<00:03:35.109> know<00:03:35.170> why

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
angle him out of there I don't know why

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.420 
angle him out of there I don't know why
I<00:03:35.290> don't<00:03:35.439> just<00:03:35.650> get<00:03:35.799> in<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:35.980> water<00:03:36.159> because

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
I don't just get in the water because

00:03:36.430 --> 00:04:45.620 
I don't just get in the water because
he's<00:03:36.549> already<00:03:36.700> left

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.180 

and<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.470> other<00:04:46.590> problem<00:04:46.800> is<00:04:46.950> we're<00:04:47.100> gonna

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
and the other problem is we're gonna

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.320 
and the other problem is we're gonna
have<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.400> pulling<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:47.730> rest<00:04:47.880> the<00:04:48.030> way<00:04:48.150> out

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
have to pulling the rest the way out

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.660 
have to pulling the rest the way out
because<00:04:48.540> that<00:04:49.320> thing<00:04:49.530> is<00:04:49.560> not<00:04:49.830> gonna<00:04:49.950> run

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
because that thing is not gonna run

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.000 
because that thing is not gonna run
I<00:04:51.140> wouldn't<00:04:52.140> think<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.590> engines<00:04:52.890> been

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
I wouldn't think the engines been

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.630 
I wouldn't think the engines been
underwater<00:04:55.070> little<00:04:56.070> deeper<00:04:56.340> than<00:04:56.400> what<00:04:56.580> I

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
underwater little deeper than what I

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.150 
underwater little deeper than what I
thought<00:04:56.880> it<00:04:56.940> was<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:01.470> like<00:05:01.620> I<00:05:01.740> say<00:05:01.920> it's

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160
