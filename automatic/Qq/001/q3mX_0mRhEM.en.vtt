volt<00:00:17.810> lipo<00:00:18.470> and<00:00:18.710> then<00:00:19.369> you'll<00:00:19.520> need<00:00:19.640> a

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
volt lipo and then you'll need a

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.590 
volt lipo and then you'll need a
connector<00:00:20.180> for<00:00:20.210> the<00:00:20.420> lipo<00:00:20.869> for<00:00:20.900> the<00:00:21.170> other<00:00:21.320> end

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.600

LED<00:00:23.600> light<00:00:23.869> strip<00:00:24.260> and<00:00:24.500> a<00:00:25.340> sharp<00:00:25.640> blade<00:00:26.769> the

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
LED light strip and a sharp blade the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.400 
LED light strip and a sharp blade the
first<00:00:28.039> thing<00:00:28.279> that<00:00:28.519> I<00:00:28.730> did<00:00:28.850> was<00:00:29.320> cutting<00:00:30.320> a

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
first thing that I did was cutting a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.469 
first thing that I did was cutting a
piece<00:00:30.710> of<00:00:30.890> this<00:00:31.010> copper<00:00:31.400> foil<00:00:31.670> tape<00:00:31.970> to<00:00:32.239> length

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:32.479 
piece of this copper foil tape to length

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:38.619 
piece of this copper foil tape to length
to<00:00:32.989> run<00:00:34.059> from<00:00:35.059> here<00:00:36.429> come<00:00:37.429> around<00:00:37.729> to<00:00:38.510> the

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
to run from here come around to the

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.439 
to run from here come around to the
about<00:00:38.960> half<00:00:39.139> way<00:00:39.379> down<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:39.589> other<00:00:39.859> side<00:00:40.449> these

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
about half way down the other side these

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.399 
about half way down the other side these
blades<00:00:41.749> are<00:00:41.929> for<00:00:42.260> 450<00:00:42.949> sized<00:00:43.129> helicopter<00:00:44.409> and

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:45.409 
blades are for 450 sized helicopter and

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.579 
blades are for 450 sized helicopter and
then<00:00:45.679> I<00:00:46.059> cut<00:00:47.059> it<00:00:47.089> down<00:00:47.209> lengthwise<00:00:48.139> in<00:00:48.530> half

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
then I cut it down lengthwise in half

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.090 
then I cut it down lengthwise in half
because<00:00:49.579> you<00:00:49.909> don't<00:00:50.089> need<00:00:50.299> a<00:00:50.329> whole<00:00:51.100> whole

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
because you don't need a whole whole

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.910 
because you don't need a whole whole
strip<00:00:52.489> of<00:00:52.639> that<00:00:52.789> for<00:00:53.449> each<00:00:53.629> positive<00:00:54.440> and

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
strip of that for each positive and

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.569 
strip of that for each positive and
negative<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:56.209> I<00:00:56.269> cut<00:00:56.539> that<00:00:56.719> in<00:00:56.899> half

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
negative so I cut that in half

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.090 
negative so I cut that in half
and<00:00:59.090> then<00:00:59.270> ran<00:00:59.780> it<00:00:59.960> down<00:01:00.110> it<00:01:00.290> has<00:01:00.500> an<00:01:00.890> adhesive

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
and then ran it down it has an adhesive

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.049 
and then ran it down it has an adhesive
backing<00:01:02.230> so<00:01:03.230> then<00:01:03.440> just<00:01:03.620> apply<00:01:03.820> apply<00:01:04.820> it<00:01:04.879> to

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
backing so then just apply apply it to

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.620 
backing so then just apply apply it to
the<00:01:05.180> blade<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:06.680> next<00:01:06.950> thing<00:01:07.100> I<00:01:07.190> did<00:01:07.450> was<00:01:08.450> to

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
the blade the next thing I did was to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.840 
the blade the next thing I did was to
cut<00:01:08.810> out<00:01:08.990> these<00:01:09.560> lights<00:01:09.860> this<00:01:10.310> light<00:01:10.550> strip

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
cut out these lights this light strip

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.990 
cut out these lights this light strip
here<00:01:11.060> I<00:01:11.270> got<00:01:11.720> from<00:01:11.900> Hobby<00:01:12.050> parts<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:13.000> they

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
here I got from Hobby parts and they

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.910 
here I got from Hobby parts and they
work<00:01:14.210> really<00:01:14.390> good<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:15.050> light<00:01:15.259> strip<00:01:15.560> itself

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
work really good the light strip itself

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.560 
work really good the light strip itself
will<00:01:16.220> not<00:01:16.430> work<00:01:16.640> on<00:01:16.790> a<00:01:16.850> three<00:01:17.090> point<00:01:17.300> seven

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
will not work on a three point seven

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.630 
will not work on a three point seven
volt<00:01:17.630> lipo<00:01:18.080> because<00:01:18.590> it<00:01:18.680> has<00:01:18.800> old<00:01:19.070> resistors

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
volt lipo because it has old resistors

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.480 
volt lipo because it has old resistors
in<00:01:19.820> there<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:20.960> I<00:01:21.020> cut<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.409> LEDs<00:01:21.770> out<00:01:21.950> singly

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
in there so I cut the LEDs out singly

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.510 
in there so I cut the LEDs out singly
like<00:01:22.700> this<00:01:23.000> from<00:01:23.930> here<00:01:24.200> to<00:01:24.380> just<00:01:24.920> like<00:01:25.040> that

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
like this from here to just like that

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.080 
like this from here to just like that
and<00:01:25.610> I<00:01:26.509> know<00:01:26.570> my<00:01:26.780> camera<00:01:27.080> sucks<00:01:27.290> but<00:01:27.880> on<00:01:28.880> each

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
and I know my camera sucks but on each

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.889 
and I know my camera sucks but on each
side<00:01:29.330> of<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.479> LED<00:01:29.720> there<00:01:30.440> are<00:01:30.649> solder<00:01:31.009> points

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
side of the LED there are solder points

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.380 
side of the LED there are solder points
with<00:01:32.899> positive<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:33.500> negative<00:01:33.910> so<00:01:34.910> I<00:01:34.940> just

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
with positive and negative so I just

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.260 
with positive and negative so I just
turned<00:01:35.630> them<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.080> correct<00:01:36.380> way<00:01:36.619> and

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
turned them to the correct way and

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.169 
turned them to the correct way and
you'll<00:01:38.270> want<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.509> test<00:01:38.690> them<00:01:38.929> out<00:01:39.880> on<00:01:40.880> which

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
you'll want to test them out on which

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.660 
you'll want to test them out on which
side<00:01:41.539> is<00:01:41.720> positive<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.229> negative<00:01:42.289> and<00:01:42.800> then<00:01:43.640> I

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
side is positive and negative and then I

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.270 
side is positive and negative and then I
ran<00:01:44.000> this<00:01:44.240> side<00:01:44.479> is<00:01:44.660> my<00:01:44.810> negative<00:01:45.020> this<00:01:46.009> side

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
ran this side is my negative this side

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.320 
ran this side is my negative this side
is<00:01:46.399> my<00:01:46.520> positive<00:01:47.350> so<00:01:48.580> then<00:01:49.580> I<00:01:49.759> just<00:01:49.789> soldered

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
is my positive so then I just soldered

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.460 
is my positive so then I just soldered
in<00:01:50.420> my<00:01:50.570> LEDs<00:01:50.899> like<00:01:51.289> that<00:01:51.560> I<00:01:52.780> put<00:01:53.780> one<00:01:54.020> on<00:01:54.050> top

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
in my LEDs like that I put one on top

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.779 
in my LEDs like that I put one on top
and<00:01:55.210> two<00:01:56.210> on<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.539> bottom<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:58.490> can<00:01:58.640> use

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
and two on the bottom and you can use

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.090 
and two on the bottom and you can use
whatever<00:01:59.149> colors<00:01:59.630> you<00:01:59.780> like<00:01:59.810> I<00:02:00.200> chose<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.979> go

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
whatever colors you like I chose to go

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.690 
whatever colors you like I chose to go
with<00:02:01.130> green<00:02:01.550> for<00:02:02.090> both<00:02:03.459> mainly<00:02:04.459> because

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
with green for both mainly because

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.529 
with green for both mainly because
that's<00:02:04.880> what<00:02:05.000> I<00:02:05.030> had<00:02:05.209> more<00:02:05.420> of<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:05.929> I<00:02:06.500> did<00:02:07.539> ruin

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
that's what I had more of and I did ruin

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.979 
that's what I had more of and I did ruin
a<00:02:08.690> few<00:02:08.929> LEDs<00:02:09.110> in<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:10.250> process<00:02:10.729> so<00:02:11.030> I<00:02:11.270> guess<00:02:11.780> get

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
a few LEDs in the process so I guess get

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.260 
a few LEDs in the process so I guess get
extras

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
extras

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.530 
extras
so<00:02:15.070> after<00:02:16.070> I<00:02:16.100> did<00:02:16.370> after<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:16.850> soldered<00:02:17.300> on<00:02:17.390> the

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
so after I did after I soldered on the

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.340 
so after I did after I soldered on the
LEDs<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:18.380> sought<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.310> on<00:02:19.580> my<00:02:20.180> connector<00:02:20.690> okay

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
LEDs I sought it on my connector okay

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.050 
LEDs I sought it on my connector okay
it's<00:02:21.710> really<00:02:22.010> hard<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.280> see<00:02:22.460> in<00:02:22.610> here<00:02:22.790> because

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
it's really hard to see in here because

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.310 
it's really hard to see in here because
I<00:02:23.090> have<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:23.420> covered<00:02:23.570> up<00:02:23.780> because<00:02:24.140> I've<00:02:24.230> been

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
I have it covered up because I've been

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.630 
I have it covered up because I've been
flying<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:26.060> use<00:02:26.270> this<00:02:27.170> 10<00:02:27.470> ohm<00:02:27.500> resistor<00:02:28.190> 10

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
flying and I use this 10 ohm resistor 10

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.600 
flying and I use this 10 ohm resistor 10
ohm<00:02:28.820> quarter<00:02:29.270> watt<00:02:29.420> resistor<00:02:29.990> on<00:02:30.610> the

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
ohm quarter watt resistor on the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.810 
ohm quarter watt resistor on the
negative<00:02:32.060> wire<00:02:32.470> so<00:02:33.470> this<00:02:33.920> connector<00:02:34.400> here<00:02:34.430> I

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
negative wire so this connector here I

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.970 
negative wire so this connector here I
soldered<00:02:35.690> on<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.990> negative<00:02:36.350> wire<00:02:36.560> here<00:02:36.950> and

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
soldered on the negative wire here and

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.180 
soldered on the negative wire here and
the<00:02:37.160> positive<00:02:37.640> here<00:02:37.990> with<00:02:38.990> my<00:02:39.590> 10<00:02:40.010> ohm

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
the positive here with my 10 ohm

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.570 
the positive here with my 10 ohm
resistor<00:02:40.670> on<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.030> negative<00:02:41.420> wire<00:02:44.200> okay<00:02:45.580> so

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
resistor on the negative wire okay so

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.150 
resistor on the negative wire okay so
after<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:46.910> did<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:48.230> have<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.500> charge<00:02:48.800> the

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
after I did that you have to charge the

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.310 
after I did that you have to charge the
lipo<00:02:49.550> because<00:02:50.450> if<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.630> don't<00:02:50.870> charge<00:02:51.080> the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
lipo because if you don't charge the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.430 
lipo because if you don't charge the
lipo<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:53.180> LEDs<00:02:53.660> aren't<00:02:53.900> going<00:02:54.020> to<00:02:54.080> shine<00:02:54.230> very

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
lipo the LEDs aren't going to shine very

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.480 
lipo the LEDs aren't going to shine very
bright<00:02:54.740> and<00:02:54.860> you're<00:02:54.950> going<00:02:55.070> to<00:02:55.130> be<00:02:55.190> like<00:02:55.310> what

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
bright and you're going to be like what

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.970 
bright and you're going to be like what
is<00:02:55.610> this<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:56.300> make<00:02:57.050> sure<00:02:57.080> you<00:02:57.290> charge<00:02:57.470> a<00:02:57.650> lipo

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
is this so make sure you charge a lipo

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.790 
is this so make sure you charge a lipo
all<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.220> way<00:02:58.310> first<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:59.380> there's<00:03:00.380> plenty<00:03:00.650> of

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
all the way first and there's plenty of

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.390 
all the way first and there's plenty of
plenty<00:03:01.250> enough<00:03:01.460> power<00:03:01.820> to<00:03:01.970> run<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:02.930> 3<00:03:03.350> 3<00:03:03.980> LEDs

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
plenty enough power to run the 3 3 LEDs

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.910 
plenty enough power to run the 3 3 LEDs
on<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.670> blade

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
on the blade

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.690 
on the blade
now<00:03:06.920> securing<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.880> blade<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.500> did<00:03:09.500> this<00:03:09.650> a<00:03:09.890> lot

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
now securing the blade I did this a lot

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.080 
now securing the blade I did this a lot
differently<00:03:11.150> than<00:03:11.900> some<00:03:12.080> other<00:03:12.200> people<00:03:12.500> do

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
differently than some other people do

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.340 
differently than some other people do
people<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.390> lot<00:03:14.750> of<00:03:14.840> people<00:03:15.080> will<00:03:15.170> put

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
people a lot of people will put

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.080 
people a lot of people will put
double-sided<00:03:15.680> tape<00:03:16.190> under<00:03:16.490> there<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:16.910> then

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
double-sided tape under there and then

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.300 
double-sided tape under there and then
wrap<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.630> with<00:03:18.410> some<00:03:18.470> heat-shrink<00:03:18.830> or

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
wrap it with some heat-shrink or

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.670 
wrap it with some heat-shrink or
something<00:03:19.670> well<00:03:20.450> I<00:03:20.480> just<00:03:20.600> glued<00:03:20.990> my<00:03:21.200> it<00:03:21.260> on<00:03:21.410> and

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
something well I just glued my it on and

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.880 
something well I just glued my it on and
then<00:03:22.340> wrapped<00:03:22.640> it<00:03:22.820> in<00:03:22.970> electrical<00:03:23.600> tape<00:03:23.890> it

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
then wrapped it in electrical tape it

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.590 
then wrapped it in electrical tape it
works<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:26.120> flies<00:03:26.630> good

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.840 

I<00:03:29.660> got<00:03:30.350> LEDs<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.850> lipo<00:03:32.300> and<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:33.650> blades<00:03:34.010> from

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
I got LEDs the lipo and the blades from

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.600 
I got LEDs the lipo and the blades from
hobby<00:03:35.060> parts<00:03:35.480> it's<00:03:36.050> all<00:03:36.230> very<00:03:36.860> inexpensive

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
hobby parts it's all very inexpensive

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.820 
hobby parts it's all very inexpensive
the<00:03:38.360> copper<00:03:38.690> tape<00:03:38.840> was<00:03:39.110> about<00:03:39.350> six<00:03:39.650> dollars

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
the copper tape was about six dollars

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.570 
the copper tape was about six dollars
from<00:03:40.670> a<00:03:41.200> from<00:03:42.200> like<00:03:42.350> a<00:03:42.380> glass<00:03:42.800> company<00:03:43.400> they

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
from a from like a glass company they

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.740 
from a from like a glass company they
build<00:03:43.880> glass<00:03:44.270> stuff<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.880> I<00:03:47.210> get<00:03:47.420> got<00:03:47.600> these

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
build glass stuff and I get got these

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.380 
build glass stuff and I get got these
connectors<00:03:48.290> from<00:03:48.500> horizon<00:03:49.130> hobby<00:03:49.390> they're

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
connectors from horizon hobby they're

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.940 
connectors from horizon hobby they're
like<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.720> same<00:03:50.870> kind<00:03:51.140> of<00:03:51.200> connectors<00:03:51.620> that

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
like the same kind of connectors that

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.500 
like the same kind of connectors that
the<00:03:53.260> hobby<00:03:54.260> zone<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:54.920> park<00:03:55.130> zone<00:03:55.370> fliers<00:03:56.240> will

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
the hobby zone and park zone fliers will

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.840 
the hobby zone and park zone fliers will
use<00:03:58.840> so<00:03:59.840> after<00:04:00.830> you<00:04:00.920> get<00:04:01.070> everything<00:04:01.100> soldered

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
use so after you get everything soldered

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.840 
use so after you get everything soldered
in<00:04:02.000> before<00:04:02.480> you<00:04:02.570> secure<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.020> battery<00:04:03.850> check

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
in before you secure the battery check

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.210 
in before you secure the battery check
check<00:04:05.600> and<00:04:05.630> make<00:04:05.870> sure<00:04:05.900> plug<00:04:06.740> your<00:04:06.890> battery

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
check and make sure plug your battery

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.380 
check and make sure plug your battery
and<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.460> make<00:04:07.610> sure<00:04:07.640> all<00:04:07.910> the<00:04:08.030> lights<00:04:08.210> are

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
and to make sure all the lights are

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.500 
and to make sure all the lights are
working<00:04:08.510> properly

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
working properly

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.480 
working properly
because<00:04:11.510> if<00:04:11.780> you<00:04:12.200> wire<00:04:12.470> MIT<00:04:12.770> if<00:04:12.920> you<00:04:13.040> wire<00:04:13.250> one

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
because if you wire MIT if you wire one

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.000 
because if you wire MIT if you wire one
of<00:04:13.610> them<00:04:13.700> in<00:04:13.820> wrong<00:04:14.020> then<00:04:15.020> it's<00:04:15.680> not<00:04:15.800> going<00:04:15.950> to

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
of them in wrong then it's not going to

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.750 
of them in wrong then it's not going to
work<00:04:16.130> right<00:04:16.430> so<00:04:18.130> make<00:04:19.130> sure<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:19.430> have<00:04:19.610> them

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
work right so make sure you have them

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.810 
work right so make sure you have them
all<00:04:19.910> set<00:04:20.690> up<00:04:20.840> right<00:04:21.110> and<00:04:21.320> it's<00:04:22.250> real<00:04:22.370> easy<00:04:22.610> it

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
all set up right and it's real easy it

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.410 
all set up right and it's real easy it
doesn't<00:04:23.150> take<00:04:23.270> very<00:04:23.300> long<00:04:23.630> at<00:04:23.900> all<00:04:25.420> the

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
doesn't take very long at all the

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.740 
doesn't take very long at all the
hardest<00:04:26.780> part<00:04:27.020> for<00:04:27.140> me<00:04:27.350> was<00:04:28.480> soldering<00:04:29.480> in<00:04:29.660> the

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
hardest part for me was soldering in the

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.340 
hardest part for me was soldering in the
LEDs

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.310 

so<00:04:36.070> yeah<00:04:36.330> if<00:04:37.330> you<00:04:37.480> have<00:04:37.600> any<00:04:37.750> questions<00:04:38.200> just
