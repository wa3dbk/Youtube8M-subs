00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.570
 hello friends today I will teach you how to create 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.460
 homemade darts very easy to create and 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.570
 very effective 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.860
 here we have one that already creates 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.019
 previously 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.600
 then I will show you how the 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:22.990
 materials that we need is needles 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:27.610
 and the normal thing of sewing any kind of 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.680
 Canuto turns a boli bic Vale 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.310
 see first you take one you take one 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.310
 needle let's go 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.750
 I picked up two singles but good one said 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.500
 here nothing happens for here we have the 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.820
 needle and we choose two and all three that 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.590
 it depends on which we are going to use 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.690
 as if we want to use a good one myself 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.120
 this time I'm going to choose two first one 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.400
 take one of the colors that you go to 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.720
 be for the back okay we see 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.630
 here the back is of the 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:00.160
 hairs then we have to choose 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:04.079
 because this grab you leave it out there 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.079
 and you start to roll it on your finger 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:20.640
 we give approximately 40 laps 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.390
 between 30 and 48 give more 40 but there are good 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.390
 each one to your liking 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.649
 ok and once we have it 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.350
 cut a pair of pliers with scissors 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.640
 whatever we have the pliers 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.860
 they do not cut because they are made 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.860
 good fuck I cut it with the scissors 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.799
 ok we leave this thread apart 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.020
 and this same thing stays here done in a 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.460
 sort of rolled circle is left to 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.630
 one side apart now we take the needle 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.240
 it gets this way more or less vice state 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.810
 we enter one until the middle leaving a 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.920
 cachito about two centimeters out there 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.410
 for from the needle to other 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.179
 ok now we take the other thread equal 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.310
 we do the same and let out there made 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.920
 somewhere so that we do not fall 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.420
 and we started winding him in between the needle 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.550
 and the thread 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.960
 we keep like that we hold on at once 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.770
 this turn 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.770
 we do so 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.630
 you see that the needle back here is 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.760
 that try to get as much as fair 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.540
 it is possible either by spending more or 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.469
 less at a distance than here 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.469
 it stretches well again 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.020
 that begins to stretch 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.810
 we have to be careful that we do not 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.100
 roll is not always straight and 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.670
 if it does not roll we have to go 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.670
 placing it 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.870
 you see here more or less then that 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.459
 distance you have to leave now for 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.459
 go ahead and we have to keep rolling 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.329
 it rolls up little by little 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.700
 covering all the holes so that it is 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.700
 prettier a good presentation 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.260
 roll up 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.300
 this is a bit boring but good not 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.890
 nothing happens 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.420
 it rolls up like this now for example 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.150
 we changed our sense and created the 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.430
 Return of a person is not mandatory 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.720
 change direction but good and that already 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.770
 that he turns around to do it more 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.750
 Quick 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.720
 rolling up like this 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.200
 covering all purple except the 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.200
 back side 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.680
 it is rolled up it is forward and 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.230
 we would have to get to this point 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.610
 more or less until here but let's go 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.380
 they want to leave it like that you can also 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.690
 but they will work better and they will be 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.830
 more powerful and reach the tip 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.830
 in knee well 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.330
 and we are carrying 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.420
 more or less until here it leaves it is well 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.740
 away 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.010
 I was back to do it a little 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.010
 fatter 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.820
 it starts to roll 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.550
 A) Yes 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.780
 it's worth more or less is it can be rolled 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.830
 more so that it looks nicer and you 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.830
 brings the purple groups 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.480
 we see that here we have remained as a 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.550
 kind of little mountain girl is not a great 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.110
 problem is going to divert a bit then the 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.160
 dart trajectory but there's no 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.800
 problem 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.960
 that is, you have to press hard because if 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.430
 we squeeze loose and then we loose 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.900
 for example here in front you can drop or 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.520
 exit and this disassembles the entire dart 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.780
 ok then we cut with a distance 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.780
 a small chunk 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.360
 dance 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.000
 and a loose loop is given thus leaving a 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.670
 beige hole so that it stays there for 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.060
 make a knot 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:32.330
 now then we take the tip 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.330
 of the thread 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.520
 we put it here 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.370
 and we stretch see how it closes now 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:46.260
 palante bends a couple of turns 5 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.930
 6 7 8 depends on which 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.940
 you see convenient and it is done again 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.850
 another knot 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.930
 it is caught again the tip gets through the 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.930
 hole of this one 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.360
 it stretches is tensed equal and the other two 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.280
 or three laps 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.180
 and then to do the third and last 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:10.659
 knot turns to take another turn gets 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.659
 through the hole 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:18.230
 it stretches a bit like that and tightens well 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.940
 We cut the leftovers not leaving it too 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.980
 tight we can release the knot 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:26.550
 it's more or less like that 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.960
 come on a little nothing happens this 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.910
 it's not going to affect anything 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.240
 Now what we have to do is cut 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:36.729
 this so that it goes well between we take 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.110
 more or less at a distance that we 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.190
 let's see convenient that average we're going 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.630
 making darts 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.800
 we are going to take better measures and 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.900
 we will be more will be more 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.240
 simple is worth the first to the best you 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:50.449
 it costs a little they do not fly well they do not 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:53.849
 they nail but well no problem 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:58.610
 little by little you are going to get it 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:58.610
 vale is cut and cut 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:12.920
 and cut medium and leave this 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:15.880
 already there was a hair piece 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.880
 from the west 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.610
 is more or less worth it is left so straight now 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.220
 I will teach next the 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.740
 dart operation thank you very much 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.880
 I hope you liked the video 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.610
 subscribe to like if it has 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.110
 liked and good that you be careful with 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.550
 this can be very dangerous if you see 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.530
 a person in one eye can you leave 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.520
 blind is very careful 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.520
 Thank you
