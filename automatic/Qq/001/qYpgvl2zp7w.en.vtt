you look at some of the later offerings
the<00:00:50.309> Kawasaki<00:00:50.879> had<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.659> gpu-z<00:00:52.140> 11<00:00:52.769> +<00:00:52.920> 0<00:00:53.339> X

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
the Kawasaki had like the gpu-z 11 + 0 X

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.240 
the Kawasaki had like the gpu-z 11 + 0 X
11s<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.299> 12s<00:00:54.470> which<00:00:55.470> were<00:00:55.650> really<00:00:55.920> known<00:00:56.100> to

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
11s and 12s which were really known to

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.990 
11s and 12s which were really known to
be<00:00:56.400> you<00:00:57.299> know<00:00:57.390> really<00:00:57.659> torquey<00:00:58.350> strong

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
be you know really torquey strong

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.189 
be you know really torquey strong
motorcycles<00:01:00.000> with<00:01:00.330> basically<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> same

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
motorcycles with basically the same

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.640 
motorcycles with basically the same
displacement<00:01:01.619> as<00:01:02.159> a<00:01:02.280> Kawasaki<00:01:02.879> concourse

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
displacement as a Kawasaki concourse

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.200 
displacement as a Kawasaki concourse
those<00:01:04.650> bikes<00:01:04.979> had<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> lot<00:01:05.489> better<00:01:05.729> well<00:01:06.000> women

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
those bikes had a lot better well women

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.170 
those bikes had a lot better well women
than<00:01:06.780> your<00:01:07.200> concourse<00:01:07.800> did<00:01:08.130> well<00:01:08.730> part<00:01:09.060> of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
than your concourse did well part of

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.450 
than your concourse did well part of
that<00:01:09.330> was<00:01:09.540> because<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.590> redesigns<00:01:11.160> that

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
that was because of the redesigns that

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.510 
that was because of the redesigns that
they<00:01:11.610> did<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.060> airbox<00:01:12.470> so<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.770> found<00:01:14.400> a

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
they did with the airbox so I found a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.850 
they did with the airbox so I found a
way<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.970> able<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.210> offset<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.870> using<00:01:16.620> our

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
way to be able to offset that using our

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.000 
way to be able to offset that using our
air<00:01:17.070> box<00:01:17.240> basically<00:01:18.240> if<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.350> look<00:01:19.500> at<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
air box basically if you look at the

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.060 
air box basically if you look at the
Concours<00:01:20.790> air<00:01:21.030> box<00:01:21.330> at<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.350> back<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.920> air

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
Concours air box at the back of the air

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.340 
Concours air box at the back of the air
box<00:01:23.340> you'll<00:01:23.670> see<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.180> has<00:01:24.300> a<00:01:24.450> very<00:01:24.840> large

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
box you'll see that it has a very large

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.490 
box you'll see that it has a very large
intake<00:01:25.920> rod<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.270> feel<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:27.750> what<00:01:27.990> happens

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
intake rod and I feel like what happens

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.830 
intake rod and I feel like what happens
with<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.920> concordances<00:01:29.840> particularly

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
with the concordances particularly

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.840 
with the concordances particularly
because<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.170> think<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.650> cams<00:01:31.920> new<00:01:32.220> call

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
because I think the cams new call

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.700 
because I think the cams new call
a<00:01:32.880> little<00:01:33.270> too<00:01:33.450> big<00:01:33.689> for<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.020> way<00:01:34.170> most<00:01:34.380> guys

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
a little too big for the way most guys

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.850 
a little too big for the way most guys
write<00:01:35.130> them<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:36.330> have<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.810> kind<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.170> constant

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
write them we have this kind of constant

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.969 
write them we have this kind of constant
air<00:01:38.580> moving<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.869> out<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.590> out

air moving in and out and in and out
through<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.430> air<00:01:41.700> box<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.780> out<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.650> from

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
through the air box the out is from

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.889 
through the air box the out is from
reversion<00:01:44.759> that's<00:01:45.000> something<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.540> happens

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
reversion that's something that happens

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.440 
reversion that's something that happens
because<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.530> cam<00:01:46.770> timing<00:01:47.100> events<00:01:47.759> and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
because of the cam timing events and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.899 
because of the cam timing events and
it's<00:01:48.600> actually<00:01:49.080> exhaust<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:50.100> low<00:01:50.369> rpm

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
it's actually exhaust that low rpm

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.300 
it's actually exhaust that low rpm
exhaust<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.630> pushing<00:01:52.170> pressure<00:01:52.470> back<00:01:52.860> out<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
exhaust is pushing pressure back out the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.580 
exhaust is pushing pressure back out the
intake<00:01:53.700> before<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.390> intakes<00:01:54.750> start<00:01:55.049> sucking

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
intake before the intakes start sucking

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.130

the<00:01:55.710> air<00:01:55.860> back<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:57.240> with<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.690> large

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
the air back in so with the large

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.580 
the air back in so with the large

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.370 
opening that air is very free to move in
and<00:02:01.799> out<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.729> know<00:02:03.380> after

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
and out in and up and you know after

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.649 
and out in and up and you know after
doing<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.860> lot<00:02:05.039> of<00:02:05.069> testing<00:02:05.640> dyno<00:02:05.940> test<00:02:06.360> and

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
doing a lot of testing dyno test and

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.270 
doing a lot of testing dyno test and
tested<00:02:07.080> on<00:02:07.200> live<00:02:07.380> likes<00:02:07.679> and<00:02:07.890> many<00:02:08.069> other

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
tested on live likes and many other

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.029 
tested on live likes and many other
bikes<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.450> goes<00:02:09.840> back<00:02:10.140> actually<00:02:10.410> over<00:02:10.920> a

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
bikes and this goes back actually over a

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.900 
bikes and this goes back actually over a
period<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.489> years<00:02:11.989> what<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.019> found<00:02:13.319> was<00:02:13.680> that

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
period of years what I found was that

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.460 
period of years what I found was that
not<00:02:14.910> only<00:02:15.090> would<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.540> bike<00:02:15.750> be<00:02:15.989> able<00:02:16.290> to

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
not only would the bike be able to

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.309 
not only would the bike be able to
perform<00:02:16.680> better<00:02:17.250> at<00:02:17.610> higher<00:02:18.209> rpm<00:02:18.900> but

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
perform better at higher rpm but

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.949 
perform better at higher rpm but
actually<00:02:19.800> pick<00:02:20.040> up<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.370> lot<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.700> low<00:02:21.060> rpm<00:02:21.569> torque

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
actually pick up a lot of low rpm torque

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.590 
actually pick up a lot of low rpm torque
if<00:02:22.260> we<00:02:22.769> could<00:02:23.010> control<00:02:23.819> some<00:02:24.209> of<00:02:24.420> this

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
if we could control some of this

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.009 
if we could control some of this
reversion<00:02:25.350> that's<00:02:25.560> going<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.100> in<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.340> airbox

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
reversion that's going on in the airbox

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.390 
reversion that's going on in the airbox
so<00:02:28.019> I<00:02:28.049> ultimately<00:02:28.590> came<00:02:28.890> up<00:02:29.100> with<00:02:29.280> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
so I ultimately came up with the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.550 
so I ultimately came up with the
two-minute<00:02:29.910> not<00:02:30.090> jet<00:02:30.360> kit<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:31.019> two-minute<00:02:31.470> of

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
two-minute not jet kit the two-minute of

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.130 
two-minute not jet kit the two-minute of
my<00:02:31.650> jet<00:02:31.980> kit<00:02:32.280> works<00:02:32.880> in<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.420> way<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.900> everybody

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
my jet kit works in a way that everybody

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.530 
my jet kit works in a way that everybody
would<00:02:34.500> say<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:35.069> shouldn't<00:02:35.400> work<00:02:35.540> basically

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
would say it shouldn't work basically

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.390 
would say it shouldn't work basically
what<00:02:37.049> we're<00:02:37.230> going<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.380> do<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.829> we're<00:02:38.160> going<00:02:38.190> to

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.770 
what we're going to do is we're going to
block<00:02:38.700> one<00:02:39.630> side<00:02:39.959> of<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.230> air<00:02:40.350> box<00:02:41.570> now<00:02:42.570> this

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
block one side of the air box now this

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.710 
block one side of the air box now this
is<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.380> full<00:02:44.130> two<00:02:44.430> inch<00:02:44.670> wide<00:02:44.850> block<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.660> you

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
is a full two inch wide block that you

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.990 
is a full two inch wide block that you
would<00:02:46.019> get<00:02:46.370> whenever<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.670> get<00:02:47.820> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
would get whenever you get the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.040 
would get whenever you get the
two-minute<00:02:48.450> my<00:02:48.600> jet

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
two-minute my jet

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.430 
two-minute my jet
from<00:02:50.210> typically<00:02:51.210> this<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.720> going<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.230> make

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
from typically this is going to make

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.090 
from typically this is going to make
your<00:02:52.650> jetting<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.070> little<00:02:53.340> bit<00:02:53.460> too<00:02:53.700> rich<00:02:55.100> as

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
your jetting a little bit too rich as

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.190 
your jetting a little bit too rich as
you<00:02:56.370> can<00:02:56.520> see<00:02:56.820> we've<00:02:57.090> reduced<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.780> lot<00:02:57.960> of<00:02:58.020> the

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
you can see we've reduced a lot of the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.910 
you can see we've reduced a lot of the
air<00:02:59.180> basically<00:03:00.180> 50%<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.320> air<00:03:01.470> has<00:03:01.710> been

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
air basically 50% of the air has been

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.550 
air basically 50% of the air has been
reduced<00:03:02.340> don't<00:03:03.300> let<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.570> bother<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:04.110> my

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
reduced don't let that bother you my

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.430 
reduced don't let that bother you my

can completely feed your bike as much as
it's<00:03:15.300> going<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.720> need<00:03:16.070> so<00:03:17.070> by<00:03:17.340> installing<00:03:17.640> the

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
it's going to need so by installing the

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.210 
it's going to need so by installing the
phone<00:03:18.660> here<00:03:19.020> in<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.230> back<00:03:19.440> what<00:03:19.830> we've<00:03:20.010> done

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
phone here in the back what we've done

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.030 
phone here in the back what we've done
is<00:03:20.430> we've<00:03:20.670> kind<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:21.000> created<00:03:21.240> a<00:03:21.720> baffle<00:03:22.260> so

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
is we've kind of created a baffle so

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.750 
is we've kind of created a baffle so
that<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:24.180> air<00:03:25.040> reversing<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.280> not<00:03:26.550> that

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
that the air reversing is not that

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.760 
that the air reversing is not that
easily<00:03:27.030> moving<00:03:27.960> through<00:03:28.200> your<00:03:28.440> blocks

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
easily moving through your blocks

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.590 
easily moving through your blocks
because<00:03:29.250> of<00:03:29.460> the<00:03:29.610> onrush<00:03:30.000> of<00:03:30.180> air<00:03:30.390> that's

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
because of the onrush of air that's

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.500 
because of the onrush of air that's
coming<00:03:30.990> in<00:03:31.230> by<00:03:31.860> this<00:03:31.920> reduction<00:03:32.550> in<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.090> air

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
two-minute wide jet kit this is where

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.350 
two-minute wide jet kit this is where

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
at the air box intake you want to leave

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.080 
at the air box intake you want to leave
the<00:03:48.720> phone<00:03:48.960> so<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.410> it's<00:03:50.090> partially

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
the phone so that it's partially

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.880 
the phone so that it's partially
sticking<00:03:51.540> out<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:52.050> way<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.290> can't<00:03:52.680> ever

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
sticking out that way you can't ever

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.210 
sticking out that way you can't ever

that<00:04:26.760> way<00:04:27.030> you<00:04:27.690> can<00:04:27.900> make<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.290> two<00:04:28.500> minute

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
that way you can make a two minute

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.010 
that way you can make a two minute
hence<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.830> name<00:04:29.980> 2-minute<00:04:30.580> line<00:04:30.760> by<00:04:31.720> just

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
hence the name 2-minute line by just

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.000 
hence the name 2-minute line by just
changing<00:04:32.260> on<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.830> phone<00:04:33.070> so<00:04:33.820> basically

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
changing on the phone so basically

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.590 
changing on the phone so basically
you'll<00:04:36.010> start<00:04:36.370> off<00:04:36.580> you<00:04:36.850> can<00:04:37.030> put<00:04:37.240> this<00:04:37.390> whole

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
you'll start off you can put this whole

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.500 
you'll start off you can put this whole
