00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
well I'm going to go back to that stage

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.340 
well I'm going to go back to that stage
where<00:04:21.880> we<00:04:22.030> saw<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.270> other<00:04:22.450> end<00:04:22.870> so<00:04:23.080> you<00:04:23.200> can

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
where we saw the other end so you can

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.110 
where we saw the other end so you can
compare<00:04:23.530> what<00:04:24.010> that<00:04:24.190> one<00:04:24.310> looks<00:04:24.340> like<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.970> this

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
compare what that one looks like to this

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.520 
compare what that one looks like to this
one

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
can also export a report which will help

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.350 
can also export a report which will help
us<00:05:02.990> analyze<00:05:03.260> how<00:05:04.130> this<00:05:04.370> whole<00:05:04.580> campaign<00:05:05.120> is

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360

us analyze how this whole campaign is
working<00:05:05.530> there<00:05:06.530> it<00:05:06.650> is<00:05:06.680> downloaded<00:05:07.340> as<00:05:07.460> a<00:05:07.490> CSV

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
working there it is downloaded as a CSV

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.909 
working there it is downloaded as a CSV
so<00:05:09.740> we<00:05:09.950> can<00:05:10.130> see<00:05:10.900> these<00:05:11.900> are<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.290> whole

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
week and analyze it from there as well

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.440 
week and analyze it from there as well
we<00:05:22.190> can<00:05:22.340> see<00:05:22.520> this<00:05:22.669> graph<00:05:23.000> as<00:05:23.210> well

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
we can see this graph as well

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
also go into this great tab we can run a

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.900 
also go into this great tab we can run a
campaign<00:05:51.470> on<00:05:51.530> report<00:05:52.039> type<00:05:52.250> responder

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
campaign on report type responder

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.510 
campaign on report type responder
demographics<00:05:53.599> respond<00:05:54.020> to<00:05:54.139> profiles<00:05:54.620> respond

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
demographics respond to profiles respond

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.010 
demographics respond to profiles respond
the<00:05:55.610> demographics<00:05:56.210> would<00:05:56.330> be<00:05:56.450> in<00:05:56.510> for<00:05:56.690> one<00:05:56.840> to

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
the demographics would be in for one to

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.469 
the demographics would be in for one to
look<00:05:57.169> at<00:05:57.380> because<00:05:58.070> we<00:05:58.160> could<00:05:58.310> actually<00:05:58.479> look

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
look at because we could actually look

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.570 
look at because we could actually look
at<00:05:59.720> who's<00:06:00.020> clicking<00:06:00.530> on<00:06:00.740> the<00:06:00.950> edge<00:06:01.070> and<00:06:01.310> maybe

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
at who's clicking on the edge and maybe

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.850 
at who's clicking on the edge and maybe
even<00:06:01.729> customize<00:06:02.330> it<00:06:02.539> a<00:06:02.630> little<00:06:02.780> bit<00:06:02.960> law<00:06:03.139> so

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
even customize it a little bit law so

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:10.360 
even customize it a little bit law so
let's<00:06:04.010> look<00:06:04.130> at<00:06:04.280> the<00:06:04.340> past<00:06:04.580> two<00:06:04.820> months

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.189 

so<00:06:11.370> mainly<00:06:12.000> Australians<00:06:12.659> which<00:06:12.810> is<00:06:12.930> what<00:06:13.080> we

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
so mainly Australians which is what we

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:18.080 
so mainly Australians which is what we
wanted<00:06:13.470> females<00:06:14.330> 18<00:06:15.330> to<00:06:15.569> 24<00:06:16.050> and<00:06:16.259> 25<00:06:16.650> to<00:06:16.919> 34<00:06:17.370> so

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
wanted females 18 to 24 and 25 to 34 so

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.960 
wanted females 18 to 24 and 25 to 34 so
we<00:06:18.330> can<00:06:18.479> see<00:06:18.629> that<00:06:18.750> not<00:06:18.930> so<00:06:19.169> many<00:06:19.319> 55<00:06:19.949> to<00:06:20.220> 64

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
we can see that not so many 55 to 64

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.469 
we can see that not so many 55 to 64
year<00:06:21.150> olds<00:06:21.419> are<00:06:21.509> clicking<00:06:21.840> on<00:06:21.930> the<00:06:22.050> edge<00:06:23.479> which

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
year olds are clicking on the edge which

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:26.779 
year olds are clicking on the edge which
is<00:06:24.659> interesting<00:06:25.199> so<00:06:25.800> maybe<00:06:26.069> we<00:06:26.340> could<00:06:26.490> narrow

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
is interesting so maybe we could narrow

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:30.409 
is interesting so maybe we could narrow
our<00:06:27.120> focus<00:06:27.180> down<00:06:27.810> a<00:06:28.110> little<00:06:28.319> subblock<00:06:29.180> so<00:06:30.180> it

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
our focus down a little subblock so it

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.649 
our focus down a little subblock so it
really<00:06:30.690> is<00:06:30.840> critic<00:06:31.319> sensor<00:06:32.240> you<00:06:33.240> can<00:06:33.330> actually

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:33.659 
really is critic sensor you can actually

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.869 
really is critic sensor you can actually
set<00:06:33.840> up<00:06:33.870> scheduled<00:06:34.409> reports<00:06:34.800> as<00:06:34.919> well<00:06:34.949> so<00:06:35.849> that

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:35.879 
set up scheduled reports as well so that

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:40.369 
set up scheduled reports as well so that
these<00:06:36.150> will<00:06:36.479> be<00:06:36.720> emailed<00:06:37.259> to<00:06:37.740> you<00:06:39.050> so<00:06:40.050> we<00:06:40.259> can

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:40.379 
these will be emailed to you so we can

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:43.189 
these will be emailed to you so we can
say<00:06:40.620> send<00:06:41.280> me<00:06:41.400> the<00:06:41.520> advertising<00:06:42.199> performance

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 
say send me the advertising performance
