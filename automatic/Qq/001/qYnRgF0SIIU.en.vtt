00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.370 

hey<00:00:01.530> I<00:00:01.589> just<00:00:01.829> wanted<00:00:02.220> to<00:00:02.399> make<00:00:02.520> a<00:00:02.580> quick<00:00:02.850> video

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:03.380 
hey I just wanted to make a quick video

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.860 
hey I just wanted to make a quick video
comparing<00:00:04.380> these<00:00:04.560> two<00:00:04.620> surveys<00:00:05.660> both<00:00:06.660> from

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
comparing these two surveys both from

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.520 
comparing these two surveys both from
hobbyking<00:00:07.259> on<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:08.040> Left<00:00:08.280> way<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.790> xtronic

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
hobbyking on the Left way of the xtronic

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.530 
hobbyking on the Left way of the xtronic
hxt<00:00:10.530> 900<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:12.179> on<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.420> right<00:00:12.660> we<00:00:12.690> have<00:00:12.990> corona

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
hxt 900 and on the right we have corona

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.000 
hxt 900 and on the right we have corona
928<00:00:15.540> BB<00:00:16.789> both<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:18.000> them<00:00:18.150> cost<00:00:18.650> around<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.949> same

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
928 BB both of them cost around the same

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.609 
928 BB both of them cost around the same
both<00:00:20.699> are<00:00:20.939> about<00:00:21.180> three<00:00:21.480> dollars<00:00:22.970> I<00:00:24.619> found

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
both are about three dollars I found

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.029 
both are about three dollars I found
that<00:00:26.099> these<00:00:26.730> ones<00:00:27.090> on<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.570> left<00:00:27.840> here<00:00:28.199> don't

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
that these ones on the left here don't

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.939 
that these ones on the left here don't
have<00:00:29.189> as<00:00:29.340> much<00:00:29.550> movement<00:00:29.849> as<00:00:30.349> the<00:00:31.349> corona<00:00:31.679> so

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
have as much movement as the corona so

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.580 
have as much movement as the corona so
is<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> right<00:00:32.809> got<00:00:33.809> them<00:00:33.989> both<00:00:34.020> picked<00:00:34.380> up

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
is on the right got them both picked up

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.000 
is on the right got them both picked up
till<00:00:34.829> y<00:00:35.130> lead<00:00:35.430> at<00:00:36.270> both<00:00:37.260> getting<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> same

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
till y lead at both getting the same

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:49.910 
till y lead at both getting the same
signal<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:48.629> I've<00:00:48.719> got<00:00:48.930> them<00:00:49.140> running<00:00:49.469> off<00:00:49.739> this

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
signal so I've got them running off this

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.189 
signal so I've got them running off this
switch<00:00:50.250> here<00:00:50.550> which<00:00:50.940> will<00:00:51.239> remove<00:00:51.960> them

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
switch here which will remove them

00:00:52.199 --> 00:01:04.800 
switch here which will remove them
through<00:00:52.469> their<00:00:52.620> full<00:00:52.860> range

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:04.810 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.780 

so<00:01:05.810> you<00:01:05.900> can<00:01:06.110> see<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.470> corona<00:01:06.710> survey<00:01:07.370> on<00:01:07.640> the

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
so you can see the corona survey on the

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.070 
so you can see the corona survey on the
right<00:01:08.060> is<00:01:08.540> moving<00:01:09.140> all<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:09.410> way<00:01:09.560> 390<00:01:10.430> degrees

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
right is moving all the way 390 degrees

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.740 
right is moving all the way 390 degrees
then<00:01:12.080> even<00:01:12.350> a<00:01:12.440> bit<00:01:12.620> past<00:01:12.920> it<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:14.180> that's<00:01:14.390> good

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
then even a bit past it so that's good

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.500 
then even a bit past it so that's good
got<00:01:15.410> about<00:01:15.530> a<00:01:15.710> hundred<00:01:15.920> degrees<00:01:16.520> movement<00:01:17.300> on

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
got about a hundred degrees movement on

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
got about a hundred degrees movement on
the<00:01:17.630> kleiner<00:01:18.820> but<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:19.970> extranet<00:01:20.540> gummy<00:01:20.990> has

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:32.230 

70<00:01:24.530> degrees<00:01:30.520> that<00:01:31.520> being<00:01:31.760> said<00:01:31.970> though<00:01:32.210> the

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
70 degrees that being said though the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.050 
70 degrees that being said though the
extra<00:01:32.870> neck<00:01:33.020> does<00:01:33.440> have<00:01:33.860> slightly<00:01:34.700> longer

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
extra neck does have slightly longer

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:57.240 
extra neck does have slightly longer
serve<00:01:35.450> alarms

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.600 

in<00:01:58.250> terms<00:01:58.670> of<00:01:58.880> their<00:01:59.090> sides<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.860> hex<00:02:01.100> tronic

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
in terms of their sides the hex tronic

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.070 
in terms of their sides the hex tronic
adds<00:02:01.909> about<00:02:02.210> one<00:02:02.689> millimeter<00:02:03.340> pika<00:02:04.340> sy<00:02:06.280> and

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
adds about one millimeter pika sy and

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.470 
adds about one millimeter pika sy and
the<00:02:09.080> corona<00:02:09.530> is<00:02:09.920> about<00:02:10.429> two<00:02:10.880> or<00:02:10.940> three

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
the corona is about two or three

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:22.270 
the corona is about two or three
millimeters<00:02:12.170> longer<00:02:12.530> this<00:02:13.250> way<00:02:20.920> now<00:02:21.920> show<00:02:22.220> you

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
millimeters longer this way now show you

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.670 
millimeters longer this way now show you
the<00:02:22.730> comparison<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.019> sound<00:02:24.349> that<00:02:24.500> they

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
the comparison in the sound that they

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:54.230 
the comparison in the sound that they
make<00:02:27.459> now<00:02:28.459> will<00:02:28.730> unplug<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:31.690> corona

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.770 

now<00:02:55.240> unplug<00:02:56.790> heck<00:02:57.790> strike<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:01.180> plug<00:03:01.450> in<00:03:01.630> the

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
now unplug heck strike and plug in the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:22.470 
now unplug heck strike and plug in the
corner<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:20.310> think<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.430> corona<00:03:21.820> sounds<00:03:22.270> bit

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
corner I think the corona sounds bit

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.870 
corner I think the corona sounds bit
more<00:03:22.690> manly<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:24.070> other<00:03:24.220> ones<00:03:24.460> sound<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.850> bit

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
more manly the other ones sound a bit

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.040 
more manly the other ones sound a bit
squeaky<00:03:25.450> in<00:03:25.870> my<00:03:26.110> opinion<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:28.750> then<00:03:28.900> we<00:03:29.020> have

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
squeaky in my opinion and then we have

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.430 
squeaky in my opinion and then we have
the<00:03:29.320> two<00:03:29.590> best<00:03:30.360> cheapest<00:03:31.360> surveys<00:03:32.230> from

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
the two best cheapest surveys from

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.640 
the two best cheapest surveys from
hobbyking<00:03:32.860> compared
