but<00:02:08.270> it<00:02:09.270> will<00:02:09.420> work<00:02:09.629> great<00:02:09.660> for<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.200> foster

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
but it will work great for the foster

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.809 
but it will work great for the foster

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
too small to be doing a lot of climbing

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.190 
too small to be doing a lot of climbing

sturdy<00:02:30.030> it's<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.900> my<00:02:31.020> roommate<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.620> had

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
sturdy it's a my roommate and I had

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:32.780 
sturdy it's a my roommate and I had
about<00:02:31.830> an<00:02:31.980> hour<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.340> half<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.580> put<00:02:32.700> it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
about an hour and a half to put it

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.130 
about an hour and a half to put it
together<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:33.270> definitely<00:02:33.780> would<00:02:33.930> not

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
together I definitely would not

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.380 
together I definitely would not
recommend<00:02:34.440> putting<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:35.459> together<00:02:35.580> alone<00:02:38.390> now

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
recommend putting it together alone now

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.840 
recommend putting it together alone now
that<00:02:39.540> cow<00:02:39.660> opens<00:02:39.989> up<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.319> full<00:02:40.590> access

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
that cow opens up to a full access

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.370 
that cow opens up to a full access
here's<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:41.910> litter<00:02:42.239> box<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.630> yes<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.050> huge

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
here's a litter box and yes it is huge

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.080 
here's a litter box and yes it is huge
and<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.590> takes<00:02:43.739> up<00:02:43.860> such<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.400> lot<00:02:44.849> of<00:02:44.970> room

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
and it takes up such a lot of room

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.120 
and it takes up such a lot of room
that's<00:02:45.360> why<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.569> did<00:02:45.989> want<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.319> get<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.680> double

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
that's why I did want to get the double

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.910 
that's why I did want to get the double
but<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.569> actually<00:02:48.900> helps<00:02:49.170> with<00:02:49.260> kittens

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
but that actually helps with kittens

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.460 
but that actually helps with kittens
because<00:02:50.160> when<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:50.970> tried<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.300> use<00:02:51.540> small<00:02:51.959> boxes

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
because when I tried to use small boxes

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.100 
because when I tried to use small boxes
the<00:02:53.280> litter<00:02:53.700> got<00:02:53.940> all<00:02:54.060> over<00:02:54.360> this<00:02:54.720> litter<00:02:54.989> is

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
the litter got all over this litter is

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.289 
the litter got all over this litter is
better<00:02:55.319> using<00:02:55.799> like<00:02:56.190> yesterday's<00:02:56.760> news<00:02:57.060> or

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
better using like yesterday's news or

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.670 
better using like yesterday's news or
something<00:02:57.600> like<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.950> with<00:02:58.950> those<00:02:59.100> pellets

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
something like that with those pellets

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.410 
something like that with those pellets
because<00:03:01.680> with<00:03:02.069> regular<00:03:02.489> clay<00:03:02.760> litter<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.209> was

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
because with regular clay litter it was

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.690 
because with regular clay litter it was
everywhere<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.500> like<00:03:04.739> is<00:03:04.980> heavier<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:05.489> it

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
everywhere this like is heavier so it

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.190 
everywhere this like is heavier so it
just<00:03:05.910> sticks<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.600> doesn't<00:03:06.870> stick<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.170> the

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
just sticks and it doesn't stick to the

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.259 
just sticks and it doesn't stick to the
paws<00:03:07.500> as<00:03:07.709> much<00:03:07.920> which<00:03:08.790> is<00:03:08.819> good<00:03:09.120> because

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
paws as much which is good because

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.550 
paws as much which is good because
kitten<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.260> like<00:03:10.440> good<00:03:10.799> in<00:03:11.040> just<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:12.560> regular

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
kitten is like good in just the regular

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.520 
kitten is like good in just the regular
clay<00:03:13.830> so<00:03:14.610> this<00:03:15.360> also<00:03:15.540> has<00:03:15.720> high<00:03:15.900> side<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.470> it

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
clay so this also has high side so it

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.310 
clay so this also has high side so it
won't<00:03:16.650> get<00:03:16.769> all<00:03:16.920> over<00:03:17.069> and<00:03:17.400> also<00:03:18.390> adds<00:03:19.109> a<00:03:19.230> lot

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
won't get all over and also adds a lot

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.840 
won't get all over and also adds a lot
of<00:03:19.470> room<00:03:19.680> because<00:03:20.130> sometimes<00:03:20.609> when<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.760> get

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
of room because sometimes when you get

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.490 
of room because sometimes when you get
letters<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.180> kittens<00:03:21.450> they<00:03:21.959> see<00:03:22.019> one<00:03:22.290> cat

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
letters the kittens they see one cat

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.930 
letters the kittens they see one cat
going<00:03:22.650> back<00:03:22.890> here<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.160> another<00:03:23.430> one<00:03:23.640> wants<00:03:23.760> to

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
going back here and another one wants to

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.900 
going back here and another one wants to
go<00:03:24.090> or<00:03:24.390> if<00:03:25.350> it's<00:03:25.980> too<00:03:26.160> small<00:03:26.459> they<00:03:26.700> end<00:03:26.880> up

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
go or if it's too small they end up

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.180 
go or if it's too small they end up
stepping<00:03:27.239> in<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.570> room<00:03:28.910> yeah<00:03:29.910> so<00:03:30.329> I<00:03:30.890> had<00:03:31.890> some

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
stepping in the room yeah so I had some

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.370 
stepping in the room yeah so I had some
blankets<00:03:33.030> still<00:03:33.299> from<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.570> shelter<00:03:33.900> from<00:03:34.290> the

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
blankets still from the shelter from the

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.690 
blankets still from the shelter from the
last<00:03:34.560> time<00:03:34.739> when<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:34.980> was<00:03:35.100> waiting<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.459> get<00:03:35.549> more

last time when I was waiting to get more
foster<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:36.420> that<00:03:36.570> was<00:03:36.690> amazing<00:03:37.109> because<00:03:37.290> it

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
foster so that was amazing because it

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.610 
foster so that was amazing because it
actually<00:03:38.459> matches<00:03:38.970> not<00:03:39.810> with<00:03:40.019> perfectly<00:03:40.410> but

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
actually matches not with perfectly but

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.220 
actually matches not with perfectly but

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
litter and then their food over here so

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.400 
litter and then their food over here so
those<00:03:57.060> are<00:03:57.269> like<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.510> two<00:03:57.720> easiest<00:03:57.930> things<00:03:58.290> to

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
those are like the two easiest things to

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.620 
those are like the two easiest things to
get<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:59.040> then<00:03:59.640> if<00:03:59.790> they're<00:04:00.000> able<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.390> climb

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
get to and then if they're able to climb

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.990 
get to and then if they're able to climb
I<00:04:00.780> can<00:04:01.170> go<00:04:01.260> up<00:04:01.380> here<00:04:01.440> it's<00:04:01.680> kind<00:04:01.890> of<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.160> big

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
I can go up here it's kind of a big

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.180 
I can go up here it's kind of a big
climb<00:04:03.269> but<00:04:03.540> kittens<00:04:04.049> are<00:04:04.200> pretty<00:04:04.500> good<00:04:04.950> and

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
climb but kittens are pretty good and

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.250 
climb but kittens are pretty good and
then<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:05.670> like<00:04:05.910> that<00:04:06.090> these<00:04:06.239> are<00:04:06.390> half<00:04:06.630> shelves

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
then I like that these are half shelves

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.129 
then I like that these are half shelves
so<00:04:07.590> they<00:04:07.709> have<00:04:07.859> less<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.160> a<00:04:08.250> chance<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.579> falling

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
so they have less of a chance of falling

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.559 
so they have less of a chance of falling
um<00:04:10.280> cuz<00:04:11.280> like<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.880> ones<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.090> had<00:04:12.209> before<00:04:12.239> were

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
um cuz like the ones I had before were

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.229 
um cuz like the ones I had before were
really<00:04:12.810> small<00:04:13.139> and<00:04:13.489> they<00:04:14.489> did<00:04:14.639> kind<00:04:14.850> of<00:04:14.940> tumble

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
really small and they did kind of tumble

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.180 
really small and they did kind of tumble
off<00:04:15.359> of<00:04:15.569> it<00:04:15.690> this<00:04:15.959> they<00:04:16.169> could<00:04:16.350> wrestle<00:04:16.560> on<00:04:16.919> and

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
off of it this they could wrestle on and

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.460 
off of it this they could wrestle on and
they<00:04:17.280> wouldn't<00:04:17.549> fall<00:04:17.700> so<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:18.450> will<00:04:19.079> just<00:04:19.320> put

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
they wouldn't fall so I will just put

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.440 
they wouldn't fall so I will just put
blankets<00:04:19.889> in<00:04:20.010> there<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.549> then<00:04:20.970> it's<00:04:21.090> got<00:04:21.269> this

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
blankets in there and then it's got this

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.409 
blankets in there and then it's got this
these<00:04:22.320> are<00:04:22.560> weird<00:04:22.800> because<00:04:22.979> this<00:04:23.970> one<00:04:24.180> looks

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
these are weird because this one looks

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.899 
these are weird because this one looks
straighter<00:04:24.990> now<00:04:25.260> but<00:04:26.070> look<00:04:26.310> how<00:04:26.400> crooked<00:04:26.640> that

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
what but this is the thing which is

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.610 
what but this is the thing which is
weird<00:04:33.000> these<00:04:33.180> are<00:04:33.300> all<00:04:33.449> curved<00:04:33.870> but<00:04:34.500> you're

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
weird these are all curved but you're

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.719 
weird these are all curved but you're
supposed<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:34.860> be<00:04:34.919> able<00:04:35.009> to<00:04:35.129> put<00:04:35.250> it<00:04:35.340> up<00:04:35.490> here

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
and hook it but it's curved so I'd have

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.939 
and hook it but it's curved so I'd have
to<00:04:38.400> really<00:04:38.550> press<00:04:38.849> it<00:04:39.030> up<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.509> be<00:04:39.960> able<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.199> get
