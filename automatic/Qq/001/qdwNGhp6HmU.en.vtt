00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.369 
Skywalker and I have right here the
1980s<00:00:14.160> been<00:00:14.490> Luke<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:15.000> just<00:00:15.839> want<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.020> say<00:00:16.139> this

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
1980s been Luke I just want to say this

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.970 
1980s been Luke I just want to say this
is<00:00:16.529> one<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.710> my<00:00:16.830> favorite<00:00:17.220> figures<00:00:18.949> that<00:00:19.949> I

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
is one of my favorite figures that I

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.470 
is one of my favorite figures that I
think<00:00:20.220> they<00:00:20.340> really<00:00:20.760> put<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> lot<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.180> effort

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
think they really put a lot of effort

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.390 
think they really put a lot of effort
into<00:00:21.600> making<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.470> 1080<00:00:22.800> if<00:00:23.039> you

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
into making this in that 1080 if you

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.640 
into making this in that 1080 if you
take<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> look<00:00:23.760> at<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.970> picture<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.619> a

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
future paint and sculpt wise not so good

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.850 
future paint and sculpt wise not so good
I<00:02:39.140> still<00:02:39.620> prefer<00:02:39.769> this<00:02:40.099> one<00:02:41.410> he<00:02:42.410> looks<00:02:42.620> dirty

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
I still prefer this one he looks dirty

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.979 
I still prefer this one he looks dirty
but<00:02:43.040> it's<00:02:43.459> just<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.819> rough<00:02:44.060> paint<00:02:44.329> job<00:02:44.690> it's<00:02:44.930> not

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
but it's just a rough paint job it's not

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.400 
but it's just a rough paint job it's not
very<00:02:45.230> good<00:02:45.530> he<00:02:46.160> has<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.970> cuts<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.690> bruises<00:02:48.290> on

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
very good he has the cuts and bruises on

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.140 
very good he has the cuts and bruises on
his<00:02:48.500> face<00:02:48.560> from<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.010> lightsaber<00:02:49.670> duel<00:02:49.880> with

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
his face from the lightsaber duel with

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.850 
his face from the lightsaber duel with
later<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:53.209> blaster<00:02:53.690> he's<00:02:54.049> given<00:02:54.410> is<00:02:54.590> too

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
later the blaster he's given is too

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.390 
later the blaster he's given is too
large<00:02:55.069> it's<00:02:56.049> not<00:02:57.049> shaped<00:02:57.319> very<00:02:57.560> good<00:02:57.799> it

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
large it's not shaped very good it

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.949 
large it's not shaped very good it
doesn't<00:02:58.730> really<00:02:58.819> resemble<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.329> blaster<00:02:59.720> and<00:02:59.870> it

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
doesn't really resemble a blaster and it

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.539 
doesn't really resemble a blaster and it
is<00:03:00.079> certainly<00:03:00.440> does<00:03:00.590> not<00:03:00.650> fit<00:03:00.980> very<00:03:01.160> good<00:03:01.400> in

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
is certainly does not fit very good in

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.640 
is certainly does not fit very good in

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
out also that this Luke did come with

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:54.000

the<00:03:49.569> bacta<00:03:50.569> bandage<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:51.169> put<00:03:51.319> on<00:03:51.440> his<00:03:51.590> stump

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.020 

which

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.780 

it<00:03:57.540> fit<00:03:57.780> like<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.590> then<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:59.520> could<00:03:59.610> put

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
it fit like so and then you could put

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.240 
it fit like so and then you could put
the<00:03:59.910> this<00:04:00.209> handle<00:04:00.540> in<00:04:00.600> his<00:04:00.630> hand<00:04:03.500> so<00:04:04.500> there's

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
the this handle in his hand so there's

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.090 
the this handle in his hand so there's
that<00:04:05.400> okay<00:04:05.850> anyway<00:04:06.330> back<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:06.660> this<00:04:06.830> this<00:04:07.830> was

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
that okay anyway back to this this was

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.840 
that okay anyway back to this this was
definitely<00:04:08.640> an<00:04:09.000> improvement<00:04:10.640> this<00:04:11.640> was

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
definitely an improvement this was

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.170 
definitely an improvement this was
obviously<00:04:12.000> one<00:04:12.600> of<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:13.819> this<00:04:14.819> is<00:04:14.970> not<00:04:15.090> the

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
obviously one of the this is not the

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.069 
obviously one of the this is not the
recent<00:04:15.690> 2010<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.440> believe<00:04:16.950> this<00:04:17.100> was<00:04:17.900> she<00:04:18.900> like

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
recent 2010 I believe this was she like

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.330 
recent 2010 I believe this was she like
what<00:04:19.260> update<00:04:19.590> this<00:04:20.400> is<00:04:20.579> 2007<00:04:22.160> when<00:04:23.160> they<00:04:23.280> were

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
what update this is 2007 when they were

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.520 
what update this is 2007 when they were
releasing<00:04:23.880> these<00:04:24.150> typically<00:04:24.840> these<00:04:25.050> came<00:04:25.320> in

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
releasing these typically these came in

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.800 
releasing these typically these came in

the outer packaging the protective case
this<00:04:28.080> one<00:04:28.260> doesn't<00:04:28.290> have<00:04:28.620> one<00:04:29.330> face<00:04:30.330> wise<00:04:30.600> he

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840

this one doesn't have one face wise he
doesn't<00:04:31.080> look<00:04:31.140> very<00:04:31.200> much<00:04:31.470> like<00:04:31.530> Mark<00:04:31.890> Hamill

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
doesn't look very much like Mark Hamill
