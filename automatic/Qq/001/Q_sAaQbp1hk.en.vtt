00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:13.610
 I got up early to be 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:16.460
 punctual for example of punctuality and 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.950
 have given us work 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.780
 tests with general knowledge questions 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:26.020
 grammatically and then a part 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.760
 evaluate our expressiveness 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.760
 there is a part of the famous 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.579
 mine 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.480
 he didn't wonder if he preferred to 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.480
 donut 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.410
 we will carry in hand 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.920
 or new methods of walls 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.920
 but me 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.880
 what kind of questions 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.470
 you know this thing I 'm paying for 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.579
 provide 2004 thousand euros as it's called 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.300
 stars like that 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.300
 central themes 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.810
 about the duration of 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.810
 bad 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.860
 the bikes ready 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.500
 you have made 2 meters payments if 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.190
 you want to send all the ladies to pay 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.190
 500 Euros 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.060
 these 100 euros per accommodation 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.540
 about 2,000 euros 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.640
 29 be treated in the posthumous and who is 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.850
 move ceo would be nice 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.970
 there is also risk 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.970
 I 'm sure I 'm thank you 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.740
 Yup 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.150
 when it was an open question that me 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.240
 he asked for the characteristics of one 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.690
 same ideal to use specifications 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.830
 reasons and i for one thing i great 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.780
 writing and more features 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.160
 important in my opinion are the passion and 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.530
 love for travel and those 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.880
 we will know the countries so here is better 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.940
 that I am my journey from 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.640
 instead improves the faith of this course 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.040
 training is normal both a course and 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.110
 lasted for months abroad for example in 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.330
 germany ireland obviously do not know 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.360
 the goals but most likely they are 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.630
 these lasted three months six weeks more 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:28.950
 or less it is still an experience I think 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:32.590
 quite formative and therefore those who dream 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.450
 repayable the expenses a part is known 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.420
 that part is our future 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.990
 winning but not even ok so if 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.990
 you would be available is the dream of 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.630
 so my life is 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.360
 however you have to invest if you don't 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.940
 he is now inter and we are twenty years old 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.940
 we no longer respond 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.610
 I still don't know why with the university 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.520
 I have to see if it's worth it 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.320
 folders 23 years of not giving me up for 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.980
 make these then the foreign guest 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.450
 goes better 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.450
 306 diamond 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.960
 Rome no 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.830
 so 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.830
 with the times they run 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.650
 history 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.810
 dream 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.549
 the sudden is called however it is from 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.200
 thank as it falls they invite you 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.180
 to participate again however 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.939
 next time 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:32.500
 these don't show you with that 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:34.269
 task nothing so the gotha â€‹â€‹no is not 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.370
 went well however in the end not me 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:40.109
 I'm taken I'm very calm I see 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.129
 people like sand 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.000
 you can anyway really remained 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.859
 very bad 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.480
 from what we have seen not because of the fact that 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.879
 every guy almost every kid is 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.909
 been rejected but for the bad 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.909
 management 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.080
 the selection process I feel a 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.650
 little 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.550
 state 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.860
 I don't see that it was given 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.290
 the possibility every boy to be able to 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.410
 expressing their activities not only 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.480
 on the basis however of the wall provided 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.860
 written 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.430
 but in any case 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.859
 broader context written title what 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.049
 they told you nothing had been imported 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.620
 just called that they were 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.320
 eliminated 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.800
 we know 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.159
 but there is a feeling then 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.159
 do 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.370
 true result
