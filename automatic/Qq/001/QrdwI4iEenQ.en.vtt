gold cover and silver sometimes I take

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.160 
gold cover and silver sometimes I take
the<00:02:04.560> pigment<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.969> mix<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:06.899> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
the pigment and mix it with the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.120 
the pigment and mix it with the
denatured<00:02:07.740> alcohol<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:09.050> then<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.679> sweep

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
denatured alcohol and then you can sweep

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.890 
denatured alcohol and then you can sweep
that<00:02:11.370> across<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.910> surface<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.599> painting

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
that across the surface of the painting

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:22.760 
that across the surface of the painting
and<00:02:13.230> light<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.709> on<00:02:13.769> fire

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.620 

effect<00:02:23.770> is<00:02:24.100> extraordinary<00:02:24.610> on<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.240> paintings

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
effect is extraordinary on the paintings

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.410 
effect is extraordinary on the paintings
and<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.840> find<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.530> leaves<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:27.250> paintings<00:02:27.700> with

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
and I find it leaves the paintings with

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.100 
and I find it leaves the paintings with
a<00:02:28.450> great<00:02:28.810> deal<00:02:29.020> energy<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:30.100> it<00:02:30.340> shows<00:02:30.640> the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
a great deal energy and it shows the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.310 
a great deal energy and it shows the
expressive<00:02:32.110> nature<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.770> fire<00:02:33.040> itself

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
expressive nature of the fire itself

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.160 
expressive nature of the fire itself
this<00:02:35.320> technique<00:02:36.040> for<00:02:36.340> me<00:02:36.520> is<00:02:37.170> an

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
this technique for me is an

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.430 
this technique for me is an
extraordinary<00:02:39.030> technique<00:02:40.030> because<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:41.110> has<00:02:41.410> a

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
extraordinary technique because it has a

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.370 
extraordinary technique because it has a
great<00:02:41.950> deal<00:02:42.130> of<00:02:42.310> tension<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:43.630> tension<00:02:44.170> comes

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
great deal of tension the tension comes

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.160 
great deal of tension the tension comes
about<00:02:44.830> not<00:02:45.160> only<00:02:45.340> what's<00:02:45.670> taking<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.330> solid<00:02:46.960> to

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
about not only what's taking a solid to

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.760 
about not only what's taking a solid to

another form of tension that one might
