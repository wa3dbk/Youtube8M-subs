00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 small bonus special live channel a 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.250
 I went to the application nokia lumia that 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.790
 correct your profile and found 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.910
 here is a link where you can specify 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.309
 all the nokia phones that you had 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.970
 since i only had nokia 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.750
 Now we will choose to remember me 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.820
 there were phones 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.279
 my first phone was nokia 2 100 here 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.560
 he he still has me alive and in 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.650
 last year, even I was with him 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.020
 about a week that is in the period before 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.390
 I bought nokia lumia from me 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.969
 water phone broke I went here 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.649
 this black and white phone until 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.530
 I haven't bought lumia yet 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.940
 has been working for him already for years 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.660
 whore in years to hell they are already 15 years 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.050
 probably, but it still works there 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.600
 after this phone I had a color 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.160
 nokia 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:02.250
 I honestly donâ€™t remember which model 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.010
 It was one of the most common of 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.040
 I think there is 5000 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.570
 Anode I still had this slider 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.390
 he still had music control buttons 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.430
 xpressmusic or so it was called shorter 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.970
 Here, moreover, are not they had two one 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.170
 broke and then immediately I bought 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.869
 imagine 2 here but before that it was exactly 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.150
 still such a color night the cross was 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:36.990
 such an unusual helped he was called but 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:40.560
 boil 100 need to check no maybe 5 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:46.890
 110 were generally attributed to black and white with 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.810
 antenna I did not remember I do not remember how he 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.420
 I remember exactly what it looks like 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.070
 there is if i see live 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:58.979
 or from the pictures were bigger I would definitely 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:03.590
 why this he oh no so after that 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:08.940
 after that there was an account but here it is 6 100 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:13.490
 nokia 6 here then there was another nokia 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.780
 she was very unusual she had 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.970
 turning 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.890
 down so to speak if here she is nokia 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.570
 3250 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.460
 at that time she was very cool with her 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.090
 turn the keyboard on the back 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.370
 the side was like a joystick control 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.340
 or how not to control the music on 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.040
 if you can say so here somehow 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.030
 nice and old man I still have a phone 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.120
 was such a wild pda one can say 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:50.670
 On on from the first kp of kashnikov who are common 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.470
 Only went well, that's kind of like that is 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.110
 it was it looks like a regular phone 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.820
 but could open up as clamshell 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.170
 only this so never have god like 2 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.420
 it would be full to me so far 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.390
 but let's say let's say it's him 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.370

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:13.920

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:17.220
 Well, like he was here and then later 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.370
