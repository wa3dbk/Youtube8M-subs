the stand here that's interesting um-hmm

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.880 
the stand here that's interesting um-hmm
wondering<00:05:09.880> if<00:05:09.970> we<00:05:10.060> could<00:05:10.210> toss<00:05:10.740> some<00:05:11.740> of<00:05:11.830> this

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
wondering if we could toss some of this

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.390 
wondering if we could toss some of this
other<00:05:12.100> stuff<00:05:12.220> in<00:05:12.670> here<00:05:13.800> grab<00:05:14.800> a<00:05:14.830> mushroom

other stuff in here grab a mushroom

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.950 
other stuff in here grab a mushroom
let's<00:05:16.030> try<00:05:16.680> I'll<00:05:17.680> grab<00:05:17.919> some<00:05:18.130> die<00:05:18.540> I'll<00:05:19.540> see<00:05:19.810> if

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
let's try I'll grab some die I'll see if

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.360 
let's try I'll grab some die I'll see if
any<00:05:20.230> of<00:05:20.290> that<00:05:20.410> does<00:05:20.620> anything<00:05:20.830> toss<00:05:21.250> the

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
any of that does anything toss the

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.780 
any of that does anything toss the
mushroom<00:05:21.640> in<00:05:21.730> know<00:05:22.690> what<00:05:22.960> about<00:05:23.110> to<00:05:23.200> die<00:05:23.790> no

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
mushroom in know what about to die no

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.690 
mushroom in know what about to die no
mmm<00:05:25.540> it's<00:05:26.350> also<00:05:26.470> possible<00:05:26.770> that<00:05:27.100> the<00:05:27.340> system

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
mmm it's also possible that the system

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.700 
mmm it's also possible that the system
is<00:05:27.730> not<00:05:27.940> quite<00:05:28.150> working<00:05:28.450> yet<00:05:28.690> too<00:05:29.140> although

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
is not quite working yet too although

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.210 
is not quite working yet too although
I'm<00:05:29.860> more<00:05:30.340> than<00:05:30.490> likely<00:05:30.730> just<00:05:31.000> doing<00:05:31.360> it<00:05:31.480> wrong

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
I'm more than likely just doing it wrong

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.200 
I'm more than likely just doing it wrong
that's<00:05:33.220> my<00:05:33.400> guess<00:05:35.730> well<00:05:36.730> we<00:05:36.790> do<00:05:36.910> have<00:05:36.940> a<00:05:37.090> couple

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
that's my guess well we do have a couple

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.230 
that's my guess well we do have a couple
more<00:05:37.390> bottles<00:05:38.880> can<00:05:39.880> I<00:05:39.910> put<00:05:40.150> oh<00:05:40.410> wait<00:05:41.410> wait<00:05:42.240> that
