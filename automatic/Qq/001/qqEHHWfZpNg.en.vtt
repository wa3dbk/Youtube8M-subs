00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.530 
mithun allowed but I'll probably keep to
a<00:03:29.560> nap<00:03:29.709> I'm<00:03:29.980> totally<00:03:30.250> honest<00:03:30.549> but<00:03:30.760> at<00:03:31.420> the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
a nap I'm totally honest but at the

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.059 
a nap I'm totally honest but at the
moment<00:03:31.660> is<00:03:31.989> probably<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.650> easiest<00:03:32.859> way<00:03:33.040> for

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
moment is probably the easiest way for

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.750 
moment is probably the easiest way for
me<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.310> level<00:03:33.700> so<00:03:34.239> yeah<00:03:34.450> i<00:03:35.130> think<00:03:36.130> i<00:03:36.430> will<00:03:36.609> keep

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
me to level so yeah i think i will keep

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.289 
me to level so yeah i think i will keep
doing<00:03:37.060> this<00:03:38.190> well<00:03:39.190> i<00:03:39.220> could<00:03:39.639> buy<00:03:39.790> up<00:03:39.970> my<00:03:40.090> mine

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
doing this well i could buy up my mine

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.030 
doing this well i could buy up my mine
in<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.660> get<00:03:40.810> access<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:41.530> living<00:03:41.799> Rock

wield the chaotic so I do know one thing
I<00:04:49.039> was<00:04:49.190> thinking<00:04:49.220> though<00:04:49.490> is<00:04:49.700> if<00:04:49.940> I<00:04:50.060> get<00:04:50.210> the

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
I was thinking though is if I get the

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.390 
I was thinking though is if I get the
agility<00:04:50.600> up<00:04:50.810> then<00:04:51.620> that<00:04:51.830> gives<00:04:51.950> me<00:04:52.100> access<00:04:52.220> to

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
agility up then that gives me access to

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.670 
agility up then that gives me access to
God<00:04:52.580> walls<00:04:52.760> dungeon<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.690> I<00:04:53.780> can<00:04:53.960> try<00:04:54.169> and<00:04:54.500> find

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
God walls dungeon and I can try and find

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.800 
God walls dungeon and I can try and find
the<00:04:54.889> wall<00:04:54.919> priest<00:04:55.280> Anna<00:04:55.460> now<00:04:56.360> I<00:04:56.389> know<00:04:56.539> this

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
the wall priest Anna now I know this

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.450 
the wall priest Anna now I know this
does<00:04:57.080> take<00:04:57.410> a<00:04:57.440> long<00:04:57.740> ass<00:04:57.800> time<00:04:58.160> to<00:04:58.310> farm

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
does take a long ass time to farm

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.350 
does take a long ass time to farm
especially<00:04:58.850> if<00:04:58.910> you're<00:04:59.000> not<00:04:59.060> killing<00:04:59.210> the

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
especially if you're not killing the

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.960 
especially if you're not killing the
bosses<00:04:59.750> things<00:05:00.380> like<00:05:00.560> a<00:05:00.680> denture<00:05:00.889> kills<00:05:01.310> maybe

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
bosses things like a denture kills maybe

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.550 
bosses things like a denture kills maybe
probably<00:05:02.780> it'll<00:05:02.960> probably<00:05:03.139> take<00:05:03.320> me<00:05:03.380> about

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
probably it'll probably take me about

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.800 
probably it'll probably take me about
that<00:05:03.710> much<00:05:03.889> to<00:05:04.039> get<00:05:04.130> all<00:05:04.250> the<00:05:04.340> organs<00:05:04.610> but<00:05:05.510> I

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
that much to get all the organs but I

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.050 
that much to get all the organs but I
don't<00:05:06.350> actually<00:05:06.530> have<00:05:06.889> any<00:05:07.160> decent<00:05:07.610> gear<00:05:07.880> on

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
don't actually have any decent gear on

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.510 
don't actually have any decent gear on
this<00:05:08.510> account<00:05:08.750> yet<00:05:08.990> so<00:05:09.710> wall<00:05:10.010> priest<00:05:10.310> is

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
this account yet so wall priest is

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.240 
this account yet so wall priest is
probably<00:05:10.880> going<00:05:11.120> to<00:05:11.240> be<00:05:11.360> my<00:05:11.660> best<00:05:11.900> gear<00:05:12.229> so<00:05:13.220> I

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
probably going to be my best gear so I

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.150 
probably going to be my best gear so I
think<00:05:13.340> that's<00:05:13.700> what<00:05:13.880> I<00:05:13.910> might<00:05:14.060> have<00:05:14.120> to<00:05:14.240> do<00:05:14.419> I

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
think that's what I might have to do I

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.190 
think that's what I might have to do I
can't<00:05:16.160> aboard<00:05:16.400> yield<00:05:16.610> another<00:05:16.820> Lambert<00:05:17.240> was

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
can't aboard yield another Lambert was

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.890 
can't aboard yield another Lambert was
there<00:05:18.349> only<00:05:18.470> 70<00:05:19.300> 70<00:05:20.300> will<00:05:20.389> give<00:05:20.510> me<00:05:20.570> access<00:05:20.660> to

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
there only 70 70 will give me access to

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.400 
there only 70 70 will give me access to
shower<00:05:21.560> so<00:05:21.919> it'd<00:05:22.130> be<00:05:22.280> Sarah<00:05:22.550> amor<00:05:22.940> de<00:05:23.090> Guerin

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
shower so it'd be Sarah amor de Guerin

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.700 
shower so it'd be Sarah amor de Guerin
yeah<00:05:26.050> might<00:05:27.050> have<00:05:27.200> to<00:05:27.289> get<00:05:27.380> some<00:05:27.470> pretty
