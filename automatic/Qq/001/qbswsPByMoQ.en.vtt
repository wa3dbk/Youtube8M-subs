 to do a new tutorial lately 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.370
 I'm seeing a huge amount of 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.870
 tutorials with a change that they thought 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.429
 that what I have two or three but the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.259

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.340
 Well, I've been researching and 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.750
 Many people have asked me to see if 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.640
 there was some way to get the qb 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.619
 work and thanks to a friend tom ayub now 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.070
 and I would mention you I got the final 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.570
 get it full and that some 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.070
 little problem that we had pretty good 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.660
 this is how he leaves us on the page 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.030
 main in the description how good is 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.489
 same as the minecraft as close as 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.190
 good to combined minecraft cells 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.410
 secrets manna monster high devil equal 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.719
 or waka and many more and one is a game 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.640
 quite churchill but slow the bad 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.649
 that laptop does not work at least 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.870
 I've tried it because a little bit of that if 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.219
 you need a slightly powerful pc is a 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.360
 alpha version that only have the years 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.000
 youtube is how it can be willy kings 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.350
 alex what that was I one of 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.739
 three because it can be vegetable 7 737 and 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.489
 Well, I'm going to bring you the word cube here 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.110
 for 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.030
 the economy not usually have much 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.689
 you have all the links lately 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.250
 I'm seeing rapidshare and well what 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.450
 first thing that we have here is the winzip 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.580
 that I'm going to open it at the same time so that 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.369
 see that the two links are true 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.110
 because good because the rise mediafire and 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.750
 why not climb rapidshare while not 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.479
 by aitor putting only one not good they 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.869
 commented that there are times that mediafire or 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.299
 rapidshare can say I consider this 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.369
 inappropriate object for this web mine and 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.899
 they take it away and well for not being 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.240
 arranging all the tutorials all 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.920
 but the links as well as pens 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.569
 will download automatically you can not 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.580
 be well in addition to highlighting publicity 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.709
 and it 's very simple you have to give what 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.899
 Did I know next next accept 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:52.590
 install and then we have to install the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.149
 qb work full, I think it 's a the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.640
 unique of the sites we have 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.979
 could get it since it has not 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.659
 from being someone who had the alpha that 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.670
 he has passed those that put him 3 a great 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.959
 youtuber that good has fought for their 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.450
 subscribers and what he has done has been 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.590
 upload or a download link that good 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.539
 then he has allowed us to 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.970
 promote it and be able to use it in 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.740
 different places 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.110
 because to a fuzzy mess of getting it 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.270
 between surveys you know the typical 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.590
 survey pages if we were always 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.630
 more in these ads that we 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.430
 will return to download quickly is a 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.960
 wing is a rare point but you can 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.640
 unzip it in the wifi as all the 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.490
 assets that I upload and here is the cube 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.710
 world is also worth not do you download those 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.750
 little things and you do not have to install voucher just 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.320
 download it and then here you have the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.920
 solution if your pc is 64 bits and 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.900
 64 bits we go to it very well and 64 bytes 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.580
 here is doing the tutorial nothing else 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.810
 we have achieved the solution 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.700
 we have a couple of days 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.620
 trying to get this solution but 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.209
 it cost us an egg to get it 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.560
 ivonne since it has cost us so much 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.200
 get this solution well then I 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.790
 I would like people to know 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.680
 a way to get this game that 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.110
 so much is playing willy kings vegetable 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.400
 xxvi many people more than one that all 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.140
 we want to use there are not many 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.610
 tutorials by youtube that none of 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.350
 they work or most of them give you 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.360
 problems in this tutorial we will learn 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.860
 to remove that problem that is the 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.240
 typical that I will teach you also good not 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.980
 is the downloaded would mark cancer has 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.810
 be careful with this downloaded and good 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.910
 we have here and then louis to download and 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.790
 if your pc is 86 bits or 3 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.160
 better said then download it here jce 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.610
 that I 'm going to put links of the two 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.010

 that is not much sin and now that 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.330
 you have the 86- bit solution and already 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.980
 we can close the scanner repair 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.780

 of control system and security the 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.100
 system that is another way of going through here 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.850
 it gives me that it is an operating system of 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.230
 64 bits the only thing that my pc because I do not know if 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.850
 only to contradict what 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.800

 solution of 10 64 and 86 my pc is 64 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.730
 but we use the 32 so there will be 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.380
 32 good even though I put 86 guys I'm 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.870

 some word problems unzip 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.300
 the game 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.330
 we open the folder worth and here it brings us 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.710
 a file this file we have it 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.890
 to do is to take it to drag it to the 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.450
 folder and it will play games for me 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.890
 for example I'm going to replace it but 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.080
 You see that it occupies the same or already 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.970
 had moved before so good 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.830
 we wait a second and try again 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.200
 you have to be an administrator 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.660
 I'm really sorry or if you do not give 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.210
 copy and here and good here you give 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.450
 public control to replace spies a 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.950
 second pipiripi good time to see what 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:38.040
 pussy if this already waits a second that 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:39.870
 it's surrounding and it's already 232 64 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.610
 it's the same as the rich who should see 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.250
 this file is worth when we finish 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.570
 aitor will say we do now because 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.850
 Now I'm going to delete these files 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.620
 what we have to do is execute the 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.230
 qb launcher but instead of running the 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.640
 qb launcher jugadón that we will execute 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:57.330
 exiles double click we hope a 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:59.280
 second pi pi pi pi pi pi pi pi now yes 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.900
 you want you can minimize this and now 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.310
 we wait for a second I have to like 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.530
 I'm on a laptop just like a little 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:08.220
 slow and good here is the game and 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:10.140
 you will say there are two willy rex has not even that 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.570
 say to know or above is wrongly crossed out 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.490
 cube by is the alpha version that we have 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.380
 got is not the alpha version 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.120
 original worth what we had to create 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.340
 a little bit and good at the time of character 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.950
 It puts us advertising and not others but 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.870
 to one you give options and here you change 

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.470
 as I leave you of the country of the 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.500
 eggs 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.820
 you want your game is worth more than 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.590
 the kids this has been all I hope you 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.600
 I liked the tutorial that has 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.890
 cost a bit told that you vote the 

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.420
 favorite X of the day that I do not get is 

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.770
 rather that you give me the comments 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.060
 What do you think about uploading news to 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.830
 channel about games that are being searched 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.830
 lately and a coming version 

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.150
 or whatever
