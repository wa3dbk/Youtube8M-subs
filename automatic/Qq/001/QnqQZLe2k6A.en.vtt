00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 The popular saying goes that poached cat 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 Are you afraid of cold water? 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.690
 maybe that's why a lot of people believe that 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.809
 is that cats really are afraid of water 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.440
 but who has pussies around knows that 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.440
 this is myth 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.000
 who has cat in the house already must have seen 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.490
 dinners like this 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.550
 drinking with the water coming out of the 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.550
 tap 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.790
 behavior is more common than if 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.610
 thinks 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.610
 there are even water sources for cats only 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.650
 videos were made by customers who 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.480
 bought Luis's sources 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.250
 television cameraman left the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.060
 stressful career path to create 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.410
 sources 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.090
 I played with the people I said 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.350
 Now I'm going to the public square to sell. 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.200
 my sources 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.600
 So I got this joking done. 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.360
 sources and such continue doing and I went 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.820
 even for life was to sell people 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.820
 bought the sources but left them to the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.440
 Cats drinking water did not know when I 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.530
 I knew this was to study here. 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.990
 Because it 's the cat's idea to want water from the source. 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.060
 I have a liter and a half of two 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.619
 liter there goes according to the quantity 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.780
 of cats that one has with the days 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.000
 that the person will stay away from home and 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.180
 leave the cat alone with 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.590
 models cost between 75 and 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.050
 120 reais 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.180
 monica is fiona's mistress who was evil 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.920
 But Monica decided to take a 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.960
 source to please the other cats that 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.030
 have at home because they do not drink water 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.860
 so it ends up with a 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.020
 logic always running so they stay 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.610
 the whole day even playing with 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.380
 The water, I'm here with the vet. 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.420
 Maria Cecilia that will explain why 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.380
 cats like to interact with 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.929
 Water 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.869
 So it's playful, it 's fun for them. 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.270
 have the drive have the noisy ne 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.520
 they try to drink water in places where 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.060
 they do not touch the whiskers the experiences 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.190
 huh 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.500
 It's an uncomfortable feeling to them yet. 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.259
 have a stimulant this water is cool right? 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.610
 is encountering a constant movement o 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.970
 containers generally have a diameter 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.099
 the higher there is no vibration touch if 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.170
 makes it quite interesting she says 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.970
 even though cat owners do not need 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.980
 worry about this behavior 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.130
 they should do everything to encourage 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.440
 that animals always drink water 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.120
 It's important to keep the cats 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.140
 drink water in some animals that do not 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.480
 like a lot 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.700
 drinking water then must be offered 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.470
 ways they like it if they 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.470
 interest in water intake
