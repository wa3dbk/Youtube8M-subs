research<00:01:42.400> has<00:01:42.550> shown<00:01:42.760> is<00:01:42.940> that<00:01:42.970> as<00:01:43.450> soon<00:01:43.630> as

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
research has shown is that as soon as

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.240 
research has shown is that as soon as
the<00:01:43.870> source<00:01:44.080> of<00:01:44.200> stimuli<00:01:44.560> goes<00:01:44.800> away<00:01:44.950> that's

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
the source of stimuli goes away that's

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.400 
the source of stimuli goes away that's
giving<00:01:45.520> you<00:01:45.580> that<00:01:45.760> high<00:01:45.910> as<00:01:46.870> soon<00:01:47.020> as<00:01:47.320> that

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
giving you that high as soon as that

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.870 
giving you that high as soon as that
goes<00:01:47.560> away<00:01:47.710> your<00:01:47.950> happiness<00:01:48.070> just<00:01:48.400> plummets

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
goes away your happiness just plummets

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.640 
goes away your happiness just plummets
and<00:01:49.030> drops<00:01:49.210> right<00:01:49.420> back<00:01:49.600> down<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:50.020> where<00:01:50.470> ever

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
and drops right back down to where ever

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.760 
and drops right back down to where ever
it<00:01:50.710> was<00:01:50.830> before<00:01:51.510> it's<00:01:52.510> a<00:01:52.570> shortest<00:01:52.960> lasting

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
it was before it's a shortest lasting

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.050 
it was before it's a shortest lasting
type<00:01:53.950> of<00:01:54.100> happiness<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.490> second<00:01:54.820> is<00:01:54.880> called

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
type of happiness the second is called

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.640 
type of happiness the second is called
flow<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:55.510> it's<00:01:55.600> about<00:01:55.840> we've<00:01:56.530> all

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
flow and it's about we've all

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.900 
flow and it's about we've all
experienced<00:01:57.190> this<00:01:57.340> it's<00:01:57.580> about<00:01:57.670> those

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
experienced this it's about those

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.430 
experienced this it's about those
moments<00:01:58.120> when<00:01:58.330> time<00:01:58.630> just<00:01:58.870> flies<00:01:59.080> because

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
moments when time just flies because

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.810

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
with it are you lose a sense

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.240 
with it are you lose a sense
self-consciousness<00:02:17.010> self-consciousness<00:02:18.010> or

self-consciousness self-consciousness or
even<00:02:18.489> self<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.000> basically<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.890> strategies

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
even self and basically the strategies

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.830 
even self and basically the strategies
there<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.549> notice<00:02:21.879> when<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.120> happens<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.689> then

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
there is notice when it happens and then

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.959 
there is notice when it happens and then
change<00:02:23.469> your<00:02:23.590> environment<00:02:23.859> your<00:02:24.310> friends

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:24.969 
change your environment your friends

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.660 
change your environment your friends
where<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:25.329> live<00:02:25.569> your<00:02:25.870> job<00:02:26.109> and<00:02:26.290> so<00:02:26.890> on<00:02:27.040> to

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
where you live your job and so on to

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.970 
where you live your job and so on to
have<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.299> happen<00:02:28.329> more<00:02:28.810> often<00:02:29.019> and<00:02:29.349> the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
have that happen more often and the

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.649 
have that happen more often and the
research<00:02:30.250> shows<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.489> that's<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.299> second

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
research shows that that's the second

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.839 
research shows that that's the second
longest<00:02:32.439> lasting<00:02:32.650> type<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.159> happiness<00:02:33.609> and

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
longest lasting type of happiness and

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.000 
longest lasting type of happiness and
the<00:02:33.959> third<00:02:34.959> type<00:02:35.200> is<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.439> longest<00:02:35.889> lasting

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
the third type is the longest lasting

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.259 
the third type is the longest lasting
type<00:02:36.310> it's<00:02:36.459> about<00:02:36.609> being<00:02:36.819> part<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.090> something

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
type it's about being part of something

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:38.580 
type it's about being part of something
bigger<00:02:37.569> than<00:02:37.659> yourself<00:02:38.079> and<00:02:38.260> for<00:02:38.379> some<00:02:38.560> people

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
bigger than yourself and for some people

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.740 
bigger than yourself and for some people
might<00:02:38.980> be<00:02:39.159> volunteering<00:02:40.120> for<00:02:40.299> your<00:02:40.450> favorite

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
might be volunteering for your favorite

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.839 
might be volunteering for your favorite
charity<00:02:40.780> for<00:02:41.290> example<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:42.040> what<00:02:42.579> I<00:02:42.609> found

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
charity for example and what I found

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.339 
charity for example and what I found
interesting<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.450> most<00:02:43.659> people<00:02:43.930> go<00:02:44.079> through

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
interesting is most people go through

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.170 
interesting is most people go through
life<00:02:44.379> chasing<00:02:45.219> after<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.730> first<00:02:45.939> type<00:02:46.150> of

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
life chasing after the first type of

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.390 
life chasing after the first type of
happiness<00:02:46.719> thinking<00:02:47.560> once<00:02:47.769> I<00:02:47.859> can<00:02:48.010> sustain

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
happiness thinking once I can sustain

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.309 
happiness thinking once I can sustain
that<00:02:48.579> on<00:02:48.730> an<00:02:48.849> ongoing<00:02:49.000> basis<00:02:49.599> which<00:02:49.810> is<00:02:49.959> next

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
that on an ongoing basis which is next

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.990 
that on an ongoing basis which is next
to<00:02:50.439> impossible<00:02:50.500> then<00:02:51.340> I'll<00:02:51.430> worry<00:02:51.639> about<00:02:51.700> the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
to impossible then I'll worry about the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.849 
to impossible then I'll worry about the
second<00:02:52.329> type<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:52.720> then<00:02:53.319> if<00:02:53.439> I<00:02:53.530> ever<00:02:53.650> get

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
second type and then if I ever get

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.140 
second type and then if I ever get
around<00:02:54.189> to<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.400> they<00:02:54.549> don't<00:02:54.639> worry<00:02:54.849> about<00:02:54.909> the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
around to it they don't worry about the

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.569 
around to it they don't worry about the
third<00:02:55.389> type<00:02:55.599> when<00:02:56.319> based<00:02:56.980> on<00:02:57.129> the<00:02:57.280> research

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
third type when based on the research

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.940 
third type when based on the research
data<00:02:57.909> and<00:02:58.269> purely<00:02:59.169> on<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.349> research<00:02:59.620> that<00:02:59.769> the

data and purely on the research that the

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.440 
data and purely on the research that the
proper<00:03:00.250> strategy<00:03:00.370> is<00:03:00.669> figure<00:03:01.000> out<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.239> third

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
proper strategy is figure out the third

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.780 
proper strategy is figure out the third
type<00:03:01.629> first<00:03:01.989> layer<00:03:02.829> on<00:03:03.010> top<00:03:03.040> of<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.579> the

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
second tight and then anytime you

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.440 
second tight and then anytime you
experience<00:03:05.409> the<00:03:05.799> first<00:03:05.950> type<00:03:06.219> just<00:03:06.849> icing<00:03:07.269> on

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
experience the first type just icing on
