00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.379
 Good day to all today 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.990
 tell you the problems that appeared on 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.480
 our cucumbers 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.780
 some pulse and started hard 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:20.279
 shed foliage 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:24.449
 throw envy from the tip to the very 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.960
 root and we believe that this is no accident 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.380
 as spoke winnie the pooh bear form pooh 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.149
 Well this is no accident 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.320
 Now we will see what it will understand 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.969
 here we are even the sexes of the row 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:47.960
 missing some completely empty 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:52.219
 gone from tip to finish 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.449
 the problem is most likely with us is that 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.820
 we brought us here nematodes 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.250
 This is such a little worm which 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:08.350
 destroys the root system here it is 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:12.110
 it is clear that the root system has been destroyed and 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.149
 so it doesn't taste good 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.170
 of course these nematodes start here 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:23.119
 it thickens right into the root and it 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:28.160
 destroys the root system and therefore 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.030
 we bushes because of this and dying measures 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.369
 struggle 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:37.789
 very difficult with nematode one of the measures 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.250
 this is the replacement of the earth and in this again 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.229
 the advantages of our warm beds 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.369
 will become this piece which is here 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.759
 contaminated land 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:51.619
 we simply and throw out replace 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.509
 new and fall off many problems because 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.369
 that the nematode is spreading very 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:02.270
 quickly and would have to change 78 from 110 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:05.329
 square meters of land per season and this 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.860
 very expensive to poison her almost 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:12.940
 impossible I at least don't know 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.340
 good ways to fight nematode 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.209
 it needs either steaming the ground or 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.459
 it is necessary to fill in with winter formalin 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.820
 someone or chemicals that are nothing 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.220
 good does not give formalin destroys and 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.810
 good bacteria and total 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.230
 without even realizing how to go after it 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.290
 in the greenhouses I repeat once again in our 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.090
 warm beds makes it easy to land 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.970
 take and replace with new ones we will 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.210
 continue on the garage it says on 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.160
 this very place on it is all about what i am 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.280
 I wanted to say thanks today to everyone 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.330
 who watched subscribe to our channel 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.160
 put likes 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.870
 Speak your comments and suggestions 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.760
 maybe someone knows an effective way 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.080
 fighting nematode 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.080
 goodbye everyone
