00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
well this one is the pivot when you're

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.399 
well this one is the pivot when you're
using<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.280> single<00:01:23.729> pivot<00:01:23.970> spot<00:01:24.450> instead<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.320> a

using a single pivot spot instead of a

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.910 
using a single pivot spot instead of a
double<00:01:25.590> pivot<00:01:25.950> spot<00:01:26.540> we<00:01:27.540> remember<00:01:28.110> where<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
double pivot spot we remember where the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.249 
double pivot spot we remember where the
force<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.640> coming<00:01:30.060> from<00:01:30.390> when<00:01:31.079> you're

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259

force is coming from when you're
striking<00:01:32.060> taking<00:01:33.060> me<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.520> this

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
striking taking me like a one and this

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.429 
striking taking me like a one and this
is<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.850> pivot<00:01:36.210> point

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
is the pivot point

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.370 
is the pivot point
it's<00:01:38.439> going<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:38.799> have<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:38.979> different<00:01:39.310> strike<00:01:39.850> if

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
it's going to have a different strike if

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.899 
it's going to have a different strike if
this<00:01:41.380> is<00:01:41.619> the<00:01:41.649> pivot<00:01:42.039> point<00:01:42.069> and<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:42.579> bring<00:01:42.789> it

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
this is the pivot point and you bring it

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.099 
this is the pivot point and you bring it
over<00:01:43.179> here<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.530> strike<00:01:45.000> changes<00:01:46.000> that<00:01:46.719> is<00:01:46.899> one

see a one now the trick is is with a

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.970 
see a one now the trick is is with a
slight<00:02:09.399> movement<00:02:10.060> of<00:02:10.239> this<00:02:10.539> hand<00:02:10.869> that<00:02:11.140> one

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
slight movement of this hand that one

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.240 
slight movement of this hand that one
becomes<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.910> six<00:02:13.239> and<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:14.230> hand<00:02:14.530> still<00:02:14.950> goes

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
becomes a six and the hand still goes

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.729 
becomes a six and the hand still goes
through<00:02:15.579> the<00:02:15.670> pivot<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.180> same<00:02:16.420> way<00:02:16.660> but<00:02:17.500> as

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
through the pivot the same way but as

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.559 
through the pivot the same way but as
the<00:02:18.040> pivot<00:02:18.489> is<00:02:18.879> moved<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:20.769> control<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:22.060> is

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
the pivot is moved the control of it is

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.500 
the pivot is moved the control of it is
changed<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:24.190> they<00:02:24.430> will<00:02:24.549> still<00:02:24.849> see<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.180> one

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
changed so they will still see a one

of my attacks up this is the main

the idea is to keep yourself out of
their<00:04:02.530> attack<00:04:02.919> zone<00:04:03.220> while<00:04:03.939> keeping<00:04:04.419> them<00:04:04.780> in

very tricky but if you can maintain that

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:17.249

that's<00:04:55.310> a<00:04:55.760> 4<00:04:57.070> it<00:04:58.070> moves<00:04:58.550> differently<00:04:59.120> and<00:04:59.780> you

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
that's a 4 it moves differently and you

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.920 
that's a 4 it moves differently and you
have<00:05:00.650> to<00:05:00.800> think<00:05:01.070> with<00:05:01.310> a<00:05:01.340> different<00:05:01.790> part<00:05:02.150> now

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
have to think with a different part now
