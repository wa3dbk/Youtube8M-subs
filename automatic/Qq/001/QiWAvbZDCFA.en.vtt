so<00:00:26.340> I'm<00:00:27.119> always<00:00:27.330> afraid<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.170> device<00:00:28.500> is

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
so I'm always afraid that this device is

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.820 
so I'm always afraid that this device is
gonna<00:00:28.800> get<00:00:28.949> scratched<00:00:29.369> or<00:00:30.170> banged<00:00:31.170> up<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.590> some

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
gonna get scratched or banged up in some

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.530 
gonna get scratched or banged up in some
sort<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.099> way<00:00:32.250> now<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> small

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
sort of way now this is a small

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.799 
sort of way now this is a small
form-factor<00:00:34.370> PC<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:35.880> basically<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.450> same

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
form-factor PC it's basically the same

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.139 
form-factor PC it's basically the same
size<00:00:37.110> as<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> netbook<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.520> could<00:00:38.730> put<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.030> in

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
size as a netbook so you could put it in

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.650 
size as a netbook so you could put it in
a<00:00:39.239> laptop<00:00:39.480> bag<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:41.010> chances<00:00:41.700> are<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.059> laptop

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
a laptop bag but chances are that laptop

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.569 
a laptop bag but chances are that laptop
bag<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.140> probably<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.530> little<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:43.980> too<00:00:44.010> big<00:00:44.370> for

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
bag is probably a little bit too big for

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.090 
bag is probably a little bit too big for
this<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.969> also<00:00:45.600> some<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.960> those<00:00:46.079> bags<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
this and also some of those bags have a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.500 
this and also some of those bags have a
zipper<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> top<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.149> I'm<00:00:48.239> always<00:00:48.360> afraid

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
zipper on the top and I'm always afraid

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.630 
zipper on the top and I'm always afraid
of<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.110> top<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.770> getting<00:00:50.010> scratched<00:00:50.399> on

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
of the top of this getting scratched on

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.670

of these cases or sleeves that I tried

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.580 
of these cases or sleeves that I tried
one<00:01:26.729> before<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.689> was<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> little<00:01:28.080> bit<00:01:28.229> small

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
one before and it was a little bit small

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.390 
one before and it was a little bit small
for<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:30.229> transformer<00:01:31.229> book<00:01:31.500> was<00:01:32.070> probably

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
for the transformer book was probably

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.080 
for the transformer book was probably
made<00:01:32.640> for<00:01:32.970> an<00:01:33.030> iPad<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.770> iPad<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.490> 4:3

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
made for an iPad and the iPad is a 4:3

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.850 
made for an iPad and the iPad is a 4:3
aspect<00:01:36.270> ratio<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.790> 16:9<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.710> really

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
aspect ratio this is a 16:9 so it really

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.160 
aspect ratio this is a 16:9 so it really
didn't<00:01:41.159> fit<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.400> there<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.420> let's<00:01:42.659> get<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.020> out

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
didn't fit in there so let's get it out

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.749 
didn't fit in there so let's get it out
of<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.409> second<00:01:44.220> bag<00:01:44.430> here<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:46.799> see<00:01:47.549> how<00:01:47.729> it

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
of the second bag here and see how it

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.510 
of the second bag here and see how it
fits

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.450 

so<00:01:51.520> as<00:01:51.640> you<00:01:51.700> can<00:01:51.790> see<00:01:52.259> it's<00:01:53.259> red<00:01:53.560> neoprene<00:01:54.130> on

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
so as you can see it's red neoprene on

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.310 
so as you can see it's red neoprene on
the<00:01:54.640> back<00:01:54.850> you've<00:01:55.329> got<00:01:55.360> your<00:01:55.630> black<00:01:55.899> neoprene
