00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 so friends and welcome back to 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:11.000
 a new minecraft model view granny and 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.460
 Although this time with the dynamic light spot 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.560
 yes the mod improves a bit 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.850
 minecraft and here as we already see 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.830
 beautiful 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.020
 So what is really minecraft now 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.449
 we're missing a bit more realistic 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.830
 shape 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.420
 if we have the torch in hand 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.920
 then the environment lights up 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:36.239
 The whole thing is fine here with opti 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.790
 from there in the mod so I in the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.790
 Linking that is fine with opti 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.190
 that works a bit better while I can 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.739
 today no sentence form again the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.360
 mod runs a little smoother and better with 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.329
 opti finely than without as we see 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.770
 well done and that still has 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.989
 small features like me, of course 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.210
 still show 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.120
 the whole can be made out with l and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.439
 of course then again 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.119
 probably maybe call that 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.220
 smith lightning and now pack away 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.520
 we'll see it's dark again 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.140
 also really only if the torch off 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.540
 New York you can see the torch too 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.890
 throw it away and the light then okay 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.590
 we had just such a small 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.040
 bug but that does not matter so that 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.990
 to cope with it completely, I think so 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.340
 thrown away again and there it is 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.829
 Of course, the whole thing is also with fire 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.840
 I believe that in the normal 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.119
 version is normal was the fire in the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.909
 environment so lit but when we are 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:46.350
 now bonn this little components 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:48.210
 and if we light the individual that 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.390
 Fire with that would be normal 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.329
 not happen when a monster burns 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.380
 that shines then and as we see if 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.349
 the water is gone, it goes again 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.899
 out of a bit so small misfires 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:02.250
 but those are things of a half 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.649
 second, that's completely too 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.380
 and I think that's what it's about 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.849
 mod just so epic yes so you have to 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.289
 just do not place any torches 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.700
 so can run through the height and see 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.150
 just look at it like master 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.989
 If the room looks so easy it looks like it 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.489
 must be so fluidly lit so easily 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.420
 becomes 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.329
 So I think the power in any case 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.360
 very cool increases especially the let's 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:29.519
 play the let's play feeling in one 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.980
 ultimately, of course , let's play 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.349
 people perfectly suitable but of course 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.959
 also suitable for private use 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.459
 So yeah well that sounds right now 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.299
 as if I turn on you machines 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.530
 But that was definitely this 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:48.389
 mod like it very much 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.859
 that should 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:53.250
 now the others minecraft 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:54.540
 set definitely integrate and yes 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.040
 friends I do not have the round 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.690
 Please, see you soon 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.590
 Next time, if no one skype me 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.590
