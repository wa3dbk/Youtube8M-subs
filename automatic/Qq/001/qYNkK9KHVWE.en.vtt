carbon copy between two papers so that

the person to whom its directed then the

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.200 
the person to whom its directed then the

date very important I see many members

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.240 
date very important I see many members
without<00:02:08.420> dates<00:02:08.840> this<00:02:09.259> would<00:02:09.470> probably<00:02:10.039> become

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
without dates this would probably become

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.250 
without dates this would probably become
the<00:02:10.580> most<00:02:10.850> important<00:02:11.480> thing<00:02:11.720> at<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.959> latest

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
the most important thing at the latest

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.410 
the most important thing at the latest
stage<00:02:12.530> when<00:02:13.250> your<00:02:13.400> memo<00:02:13.700> becomes<00:02:14.060> relevant

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
stage when your memo becomes relevant

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.309 
stage when your memo becomes relevant
when<00:02:14.629> was<00:02:15.110> this<00:02:15.319> written

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
when was this written

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.530 
when was this written
then<00:02:17.129> of<00:02:17.280> course<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.609> subject<00:02:17.849> line<00:02:18.209> what<00:02:18.510> is

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
then of course the subject line what is

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.690 
then of course the subject line what is
this<00:02:18.870> about<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.620> then<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.069> type<00:02:20.310> your<00:02:20.489> memo

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
this about and then you type your memo

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.879 
this about and then you type your memo
when<00:02:21.060> typing<00:02:21.420> your<00:02:21.780> memo<00:02:22.049> be<00:02:22.290> short<00:02:22.650> be

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:22.889 
when typing your memo be short be

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.539 
when typing your memo be short be
concise<00:02:23.420> try<00:02:24.420> not<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.200> use<00:02:25.439> nonsense<00:02:26.189> words

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
concise try not to use nonsense words

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.129 
concise try not to use nonsense words
and<00:02:26.849> nonsense<00:02:27.269> word<00:02:27.480> would<00:02:27.719> be<00:02:27.870> something

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:28.139 
and nonsense word would be something

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.429 
and nonsense word would be something
like<00:02:28.290> how<00:02:28.620> are<00:02:28.889> you<00:02:29.719> get<00:02:30.719> to<00:02:30.749> the<00:02:30.930> point<00:02:31.109> a

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
like how are you get to the point a

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.559 
like how are you get to the point a
memory<00:02:32.219> is<00:02:32.340> there<00:02:32.579> to<00:02:32.760> be<00:02:32.879> precise<00:02:33.299> to<00:02:33.480> be

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
memory is there to be precise to be

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.379 
memory is there to be precise to be
concise<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.200> have<00:02:34.650> short<00:02:34.889> sentences<00:02:35.519> bullet

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
concise to have short sentences bullet

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.059 
concise to have short sentences bullet
points<00:02:36.719> is<00:02:36.810> always<00:02:37.109> very<00:02:37.319> good<00:02:37.500> for<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.769> memo

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
points is always very good for a memo

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.869 
points is always very good for a memo
and<00:02:38.900> that's<00:02:39.900> basically<00:02:40.349> it<00:02:40.609> there's<00:02:41.609> a<00:02:41.670> lot<00:02:41.790> of

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
and that's basically it there's a lot of

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.159 
and that's basically it there's a lot of
templates<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.480> your<00:02:42.629> company<00:02:43.049> would

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:43.169 
templates and your company would

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:45.409 
templates and your company would
probably<00:02:43.650> have<00:02:44.280> some<00:02:44.669> templates<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.239> this

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:45.419 
probably have some templates in this

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:49.369 
probably have some templates in this
regard<00:02:45.870> as<00:02:46.079> well<00:02:47.719> lastly<00:02:48.719> we<00:02:49.049> talked<00:02:49.260> about

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
regard as well lastly we talked about

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.949 
regard as well lastly we talked about
the<00:02:49.620> structure<00:02:49.919> of<00:02:50.099> memos<00:02:50.599> well<00:02:51.599> the

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
the structure of memos well the

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.539 
the structure of memos well the
structure<00:02:52.230> of<00:02:52.469> members<00:02:52.739> is<00:02:52.919> basically<00:02:53.310> that

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
structure of members is basically that

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.250 
structure of members is basically that
memos<00:02:53.939> do<00:02:54.120> not<00:02:54.299> have<00:02:54.449> structures<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.169> that's

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
memos do not have structures and that's

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.439 
memos do not have structures and that's
why<00:02:55.469> they<00:02:55.650> called<00:02:55.889> memos<00:02:56.219> they<00:02:56.519> should<00:02:56.790> be<00:02:57.120> the

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:57.449 
why they called memos they should be the

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:59.209 
why they called memos they should be the
heading<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:58.319> should<00:02:58.530> know<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.739> whom<00:02:59.040> this

00:02:59.209 --> 00:02:59.219 
heading you should know to whom this

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.189 
heading you should know to whom this
memo<00:02:59.459> is<00:02:59.639> going<00:02:59.909> this<00:03:00.329> you<00:03:00.659> should<00:03:00.840> know<00:03:00.989> from

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:01.199 
memo is going this you should know from

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.199 
memo is going this you should know from
where<00:03:01.469> it's<00:03:01.590> coming<00:03:01.829> and<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.699> should<00:03:02.849> be<00:03:02.969> short

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
where it's coming and it should be short

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.580 
where it's coming and it should be short
and<00:03:03.329> concise<00:03:03.540> that's<00:03:04.049> why<00:03:04.230> it's<00:03:04.349> a<00:03:04.409> memo

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
and concise that's why it's a memo

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.909 
and concise that's why it's a memo
another<00:03:05.430> official<00:03:05.819> letter<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.560> structure

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:07.919 
another official letter so the structure

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:09.679 
another official letter so the structure
will<00:03:08.040> depend<00:03:08.310> from<00:03:08.519> company<00:03:08.909> to<00:03:08.939> company<00:03:09.060> and

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
will depend from company to company and

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.750 
will depend from company to company and
it<00:03:10.019> would<00:03:10.199> probably<00:03:10.409> be<00:03:10.680> prescribed<00:03:11.489> and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
it would probably be prescribed and

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.020 
it would probably be prescribed and
there<00:03:11.879> would<00:03:12.000> be<00:03:12.030> templates<00:03:12.659> for<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:14.030> enjoy

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
there would be templates for it enjoy

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.689 
there would be templates for it enjoy
the<00:03:15.150> next<00:03:15.329> session
