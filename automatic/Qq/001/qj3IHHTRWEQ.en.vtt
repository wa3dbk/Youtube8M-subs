topics about PC building the first topic

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.540 
topics about PC building the first topic
is<00:00:06.450> about<00:00:06.509> building<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.290> future-proof<00:00:07.740> puc<00:00:08.340> and

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
is about building a future-proof puc and

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.490 
is about building a future-proof puc and
the<00:00:08.940> second<00:00:09.269> topic<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.750> going<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.320> be<00:00:10.410> about

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
the second topic is going to be about

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.310 
the second topic is going to be about
whether<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:11.070> should<00:00:11.099> go<00:00:11.309> sli<00:00:11.759> or<00:00:11.790> crossfire

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.320 
versus single GPU now let's get into the
first<00:00:16.320> topic<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:17.340> term<00:00:17.550> future<00:00:17.760> proof<00:00:18.119> is

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330

guys ask whether a pc can last for five
years<00:00:47.690> let's<00:00:48.690> discuss<00:00:49.050> how<00:00:49.079> possible<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:50.010> is

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
years let's discuss how possible it is

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.860 
years let's discuss how possible it is
to<00:00:50.280> build<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.550> pc<00:00:50.730> that's<00:00:51.059> any<00:00:51.270> amount<00:00:51.690> of

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
to build a pc that's any amount of

it's<00:00:58.079> not<00:00:58.260> possible<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.920> build<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.430> completely

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
it's not possible to build a completely

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
present proof pc so a future-proof pc is

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.539

time discrepancy even with a single GPU
I've<00:05:12.030> been<00:05:12.240> reading<00:05:12.420> some<00:05:12.750> statistics<00:05:13.380> and

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
I've been reading some statistics and

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.830 
I've been reading some statistics and
the<00:05:13.800> frame<00:05:13.980> time<00:05:14.160> discrepancy<00:05:14.520> between<00:05:15.000> a<00:05:15.240> gtx

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
the frame time discrepancy between a gtx

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.250 
the frame time discrepancy between a gtx
680<00:05:16.260> and<00:05:16.590> a<00:05:16.770> gtx<00:05:17.220> 680<00:05:17.640> and<00:05:17.910> sli<00:05:18.390> was<00:05:19.020> five

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
680 and a gtx 680 and sli was five

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.930 
680 and a gtx 680 and sli was five
percent<00:05:19.680> and<00:05:19.830> seven<00:05:20.370> percent<00:05:20.730> respectively

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
percent and seven percent respectively

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.840 
percent and seven percent respectively
so<00:05:21.900> basically<00:05:22.410> an<00:05:22.710> imperceptible<00:05:23.220> difference

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
so basically an imperceptible difference

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.850 
so basically an imperceptible difference

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720
