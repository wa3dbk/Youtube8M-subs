00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
straight hair and I just thought going

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.240 
straight hair and I just thought going
all<00:01:11.159> out<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.570> straight<00:01:12.570> hair<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.350> not<00:01:13.890> me

all out for straight hair just is not me

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.530 
all out for straight hair just is not me
I've<00:01:14.490> never<00:01:14.970> done<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.330> before<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.810> did<00:01:16.409> um<00:01:17.540> check

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
I've never done it before I did um check

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.840 
I've never done it before I did um check
them<00:01:18.810> like<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.470> did<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.860> length<00:01:20.220> check<00:01:20.520> or

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
them like I did a length check or

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.330 
them like I did a length check or
whatever<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.630> they<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.650> very<00:01:22.680> true<00:01:23.220> to

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
whatever and they are very true to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.690 
whatever and they are very true to
length<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.729> 16<00:01:24.150> measures<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.720> 17<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:26.189> 18

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
length the 16 measures to 17 the 18

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.130 
length the 16 measures to 17 the 18
measures<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.630> 19<00:01:28.350> mb<00:01:28.680> 20<00:01:29.610> inch<00:01:29.759> measures<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.930> a

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
measures to 19 mb 20 inch measures to a

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.100 
measures to 19 mb 20 inch measures to a
21<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.850> bundles<00:01:33.210> are<00:01:33.360> not<00:01:33.600> all<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.930> same

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
21 so the bundles are not all the same

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.560 
21 so the bundles are not all the same
color<00:01:34.590> as<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.100> see<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.880> longest<00:01:36.270> one<00:01:36.450> is

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
color as you can see the longest one is

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.870 
color as you can see the longest one is
a<00:01:36.600> little<00:01:36.900> bit<00:01:37.020> lighter<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:38.100> happened<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.759> me

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
a little bit lighter this happened to me

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.550 
a little bit lighter this happened to me
when<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.119> bought<00:01:39.210> my<00:01:39.630> Queens<00:01:39.990> hair<00:01:40.229> products

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
when I bought my Queens hair products

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.770 
when I bought my Queens hair products
hair<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.520> longest<00:01:41.909> length<00:01:42.180> was<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> little<00:01:42.689> bit

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
hair the longest length was a little bit

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.230 
hair the longest length was a little bit
longer<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> um<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.939> looks<00:01:44.970> like

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
longer so this one is a um it looks like

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.139 
longer so this one is a um it looks like
a<00:01:45.270> color<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:46.020> while<00:01:46.799> these<00:01:47.040> look<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.520> 1<00:01:47.909> b

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
a color for while these look like a 1 b

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.700 
a color for while these look like a 1 b
2<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.540> 2<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.610> 20<00:01:51.119> inch<00:01:52.399> bundle<00:01:53.399> and

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
2 a 2 so this is the 20 inch bundle and

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.120 
2 a 2 so this is the 20 inch bundle and
it's<00:01:55.710> really<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.549> really<00:01:56.670> fluffy<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:58.130> not

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
it's really it's really fluffy like not

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.819 
it's really it's really fluffy like not
fluffy<00:01:59.579> but<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.210> do<00:02:00.750> get<00:02:01.020> some<00:02:01.229> resistance

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
fluffy but I do get some resistance

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.050 
fluffy but I do get some resistance
going<00:02:02.159> through<00:02:02.369> maybe<00:02:02.610> because<00:02:02.939> I've

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
going through maybe because I've

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.670 
going through maybe because I've
actually<00:02:03.090> already<00:02:03.750> done<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.290> before

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
actually already done this before

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.399 
actually already done this before
because<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.460> first<00:02:05.670> time<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.820> did<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.630> did

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
because the first time I did this it did

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.380 
because the first time I did this it did
not<00:02:07.439> look<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.190> was<00:02:08.610> going<00:02:08.970> through<00:02:09.209> very

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
not look it was going through very

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.469 
not look it was going through very
freely<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.140> haven't

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
freely and I haven't

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.479 
freely and I haven't
combed<00:02:10.659> it<00:02:10.840> or<00:02:10.959> anything<00:02:11.170> so<00:02:12.040> this<00:02:12.220> is<00:02:12.370> just

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
combed it or anything so this is just

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.039 
combed it or anything so this is just
what<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.879> curl<00:02:13.659> powder<00:02:13.959> looks<00:02:14.379> like<00:02:15.299> and<00:02:16.299> it's

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
what the curl powder looks like and it's

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.410 
what the curl powder looks like and it's
a<00:02:17.170> very<00:02:17.200> pretty<00:02:17.650> pattern<00:02:18.129> I<00:02:18.340> do<00:02:18.909> not<00:02:19.120> mind<00:02:19.269> the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
a very pretty pattern I do not mind the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.119 
a very pretty pattern I do not mind the
curl<00:02:19.750> pattern<00:02:20.080> at<00:02:20.230> all<00:02:20.379> i<00:02:20.440> just<00:02:20.680> didn't<00:02:21.069> want

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
curl pattern at all i just didn't want

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.619 
curl pattern at all i just didn't want
curly<00:02:21.489> and<00:02:21.790> I<00:02:21.879> didn't<00:02:22.060> want<00:02:22.180> body<00:02:22.360> weight

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
curly and I didn't want body weight

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.330 
curly and I didn't want body weight
either<00:02:23.170> because<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.560> feel<00:02:23.739> like<00:02:23.769> when<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.099> wash

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
either because I feel like when I wash

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.220 
either because I feel like when I wash
the<00:02:24.610> body<00:02:24.790> wave<00:02:25.090> it'll<00:02:25.450> just<00:02:25.480> be<00:02:25.659> straight<00:02:26.080> and

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
the body wave it'll just be straight and

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.750 
the body wave it'll just be straight and
I<00:02:26.379> didn't<00:02:26.590> want<00:02:26.769> that<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.459> would<00:02:27.549> rather

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
I didn't want that so I would rather

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.360 
I didn't want that so I would rather
watch<00:02:28.239> this<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:28.959> watch<00:02:28.989> it<00:02:29.769> become<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.069> body

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
watch this and watch it become a body

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.460 
watch this and watch it become a body
wave<00:02:30.640> than<00:02:31.299> by<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.510> body<00:02:31.750> wave<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.200> watch<00:02:32.319> it

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
wave than by a body wave and watch it

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.570 
wave than by a body wave and watch it
become<00:02:32.709> straight<00:02:33.069> if<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.280> get<00:02:33.430> what<00:02:33.519> I'm

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
become straight if you get what I'm

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.589 
become straight if you get what I'm
saying<00:02:33.819> okay<00:02:34.360> I<00:02:34.390> did<00:02:34.629> ask<00:02:35.019> for<00:02:36.090> healthy<00:02:37.090> ends

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
saying okay I did ask for healthy ends

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.390 
saying okay I did ask for healthy ends
when<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:37.780> did<00:02:37.989> talk<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.829> person<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.280> I

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
when I did talk to the person that I

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.970 
when I did talk to the person that I
talked<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.909> with<00:02:40.060> them<00:02:40.239> and<00:02:40.540> these<00:02:41.500> are<00:02:41.769> not

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
talked to with them and these are not

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.369 
talked to with them and these are not
the<00:02:42.159> healthiest<00:02:42.790> they<00:02:43.030> are<00:02:43.269> kind<00:02:43.629> of<00:02:43.750> dry<00:02:44.049> and

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
the healthiest they are kind of dry and

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.360 
the healthiest they are kind of dry and
raggedy<00:02:44.980> so<00:02:45.910> this<00:02:46.209> is<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.629> 20<00:02:47.500> inch<00:02:47.739> bundle

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
raggedy so this is the 20 inch bundle

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.330 
raggedy so this is the 20 inch bundle
this<00:02:48.519> one<00:02:48.700> has<00:02:48.910> more<00:02:49.329> of<00:02:49.629> a<00:02:49.720> spiral<00:02:50.079> curl<00:02:50.530> than

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
this one has more of a spiral curl than

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.000 
this one has more of a spiral curl than
the<00:02:51.519> other<00:02:51.730> ones<00:02:52.090> so<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:53.530> is<00:02:53.680> just<00:02:53.799> what<00:02:53.980> it

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
the other ones so this is just what it

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.610 
the other ones so this is just what it
looks<00:02:54.459> like<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:54.970> it<00:02:55.660> is<00:02:55.810> pretty<00:02:56.019> easy<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.530> run

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
looks like and it is pretty easy to run

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.740 
looks like and it is pretty easy to run
my<00:02:56.799> fingers<00:02:57.190> through<00:02:57.400> this<00:02:57.519> one<00:02:57.760> as<00:02:58.090> well<00:02:58.299> I'm

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.949 
my fingers through this one as well I'm
not<00:02:59.230> getting<00:02:59.590> any<00:02:59.829> shedding<00:03:00.480> I'm<00:03:01.480> not<00:03:01.720> getting

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
not getting any shedding I'm not getting

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.960 
not getting any shedding I'm not getting
any<00:03:02.079> shedding<00:03:02.349> at<00:03:02.590> all<00:03:02.799> of<00:03:03.430> course<00:03:03.670> on<00:03:03.819> when

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
any shedding at all of course on when

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.990 
any shedding at all of course on when

ends of this one are healthy they're not

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.159 
ends of this one are healthy they're not
like<00:03:36.849> the<00:03:37.000> other<00:03:37.180> ones<00:03:37.510> so<00:03:37.950> this<00:03:38.950> is<00:03:39.130> what<00:03:39.310> the

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
like the other ones so this is what the

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.150 
like the other ones so this is what the
18<00:03:41.169> inch<00:03:41.319> looks<00:03:41.829> like<00:03:41.980> this<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.220> 18<00:03:42.609> inch

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
18 inch looks like this is the 18 inch

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.020 
18 inch looks like this is the 18 inch
and<00:03:45.160> so<00:03:45.940> this<00:03:46.209> is<00:03:46.389> the<00:03:46.569> 16<00:03:47.169> inch<00:03:47.380> bundle<00:03:48.190> I<00:03:48.430> feel

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
and so this is the 16 inch bundle I feel

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.180 
and so this is the 16 inch bundle I feel
like<00:03:49.239> this<00:03:49.569> one<00:03:49.840> is<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.230> best<00:03:50.650> bundle<00:03:51.099> that

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
like this one is the best bundle that

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.970 
like this one is the best bundle that
I've<00:03:51.340> gotten<00:03:51.930> out<00:03:52.930> of<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.200> three<00:03:53.470> this<00:03:53.680> one<00:03:53.859> is

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
I've gotten out of the three this one is

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.369 
I've gotten out of the three this one is
extremely<00:03:54.609> soft<00:03:54.910> very<00:03:55.540> easy<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:56.019> run<00:03:56.200> my
