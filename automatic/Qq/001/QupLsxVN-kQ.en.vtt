00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
this is a great catch of an unknown I

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.699 
this is a great catch of an unknown I
will<00:03:58.910> send<00:03:59.209> him<00:03:59.390> photos<00:03:59.840> under<00:04:00.140> separate

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
cover directly off my phone they are

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.640 
cover directly off my phone they are
sequential<00:04:03.850> first<00:04:04.850> one<00:04:05.209> I<00:04:05.450> don't<00:04:05.989> see<00:04:06.260> an<00:04:06.410> orb

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
sequential first one I don't see an orb

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.309 
sequential first one I don't see an orb
then<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.549> next<00:04:07.910> four<00:04:08.180> it<00:04:08.269> is<00:04:08.390> amazingly<00:04:08.900> clear

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
then the next four it is amazingly clear

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.340 
then the next four it is amazingly clear
the<00:04:10.040> next<00:04:10.430> few<00:04:10.730> I<00:04:10.760> can't<00:04:11.150> seem<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:11.450> locate<00:04:11.750> it

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
the next few I can't seem to locate it

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.099 
the next few I can't seem to locate it
I<00:04:12.380> believe<00:04:13.010> it<00:04:13.160> slipped<00:04:13.489> behind<00:04:13.730> a<00:04:14.030> cloud<00:04:14.299> then

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
I believe it slipped behind a cloud then
