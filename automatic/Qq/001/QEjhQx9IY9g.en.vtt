00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.280
 Hello, dear 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.280
 Game of go 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:16.110
 and today I will take a review 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:20.890
 light tank 20 each 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.890
 What to check sing 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.890
 but 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.840
 i will need you now you are bad 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:06.559
 so back around 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.559
 what is a tank in principle many already know 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.820
 so what to do with it 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.680
 I possibly 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.550
 help back 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:32.630
 experience 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:34.310
 he will go first and foremost for the fights 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.490
 I'm getting away with some 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.490
 such as 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:48.440
 Waly 2 secrets such as medium tanks and 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.330
 especially too heavy 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:57.220
 small light tanks sau ipad and sau 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:02.890
 he will naturally manage his level and 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.890
 Well, let's see it in action 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.980
 So 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.980
 understandably 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.560
 In principle, everything is extremely clear and 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.560
 so what 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.080
 of the year 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.530
 from 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.280
 enter a little 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.659
 Nina met there 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.659
 don't go on any 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.850
 since i'm just gonna spend on that tank 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.030
 go 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.410
 to clean up 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.410
 don't run up so let's say 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:15.310
 if you are running into something then running 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.310
 if we ran into 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.730
 since it has very good speed 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.090
 we almost can not break through 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.790
 and if in the end on the caterpillar 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.790
 something else is gone 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.850
 it must be constantly great as possible 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:49.820
 maneuver see something here we have already 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:54.560
 taken away much more than half 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.130
 everything in life with 47 and what we do we 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.930
 now 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.580
 dying if we manage to hide behind it 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.220
 a stone 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:07.090
 then we are lucky she will succeed it 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.970
 do as we can 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.430
 any second come but they don't 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.610
 made 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.610
 what 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.709
 we wait 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:32.200
 and maybe we do not even wait as we 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:37.590
 lose about it and here it is me now 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.590
 can cover sau 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.270
 so I quickly give up quickly 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.480
 backwards 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.280
 unfolding this to the other to me and 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.680
 so you can gradually move to 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.790
 enemy base 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:05:00.520
 unless of course no one shines here 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:03.640
 some tank crews think that on a2a 20 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.240
 You can shine well on it of course you can 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:11.020
 shine but I would not recommend 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:15.150
 he is more for sudden penetration 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:22.470
 to the enemy base as well as for 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:29.950
 destruction such as this is, and what 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:32.370
 last shot and that was the easy one 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.370
 target 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.830
 there that never go on heavy 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.830
 tanks 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.419
 he as I first did flew break 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:48.020
 head 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:48.020
 here you do all the guys talk right away 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.960
 I move gradually 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.770
 I am my ally 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.630
 but as 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:14.030
 lucky now good I can him 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:19.770
 but it is unlikely since released 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:26.569
 and I do not hang out gradually 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:26.569
 stupid on poke out and pike 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:36.830
 here's another 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:40.310
 I do not know sa 5 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:45.170
 at least on the minimap so on my 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:48.290
 the disadvantage that the action capture capture 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:54.360
 enemy base but still do it 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:58.969
 you see 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.969
 it's so easy there 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.780
 added 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.290
 best to drink anyway 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.290
 from the spot 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.480
 oh 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.480
 we all won and 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:26.890
 what is this on a 20 of the mod we have not gone 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:31.000
 in a minus 

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:34.340
 we found a lot of goals and 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.800
 detail even the total 10,000 on it 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:45.470
 I earned a lot of experience and I 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:47.990
 keep saving up on t-34 thank you all 

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:50.480

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:54.080
