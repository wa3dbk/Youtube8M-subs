games<00:01:03.539> really<00:01:04.229> do<00:01:04.650> look<00:01:04.890> good<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.460> agree<00:01:05.880> with

him<00:01:06.150> there<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.600> think<00:01:07.260> there's<00:01:07.470> still<00:01:07.740> one<00:01:08.040> more

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
him there I think there's still one more

him there I think there's still one more
step<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:08.909> take<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.960> don't<00:01:10.470> think<00:01:10.799> we

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
step we can take but I don't think we

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.670 
step we can take but I don't think we
have<00:01:11.340> many<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.909> those<00:01:12.240> steps<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> left<00:01:13.140> now

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
think about this for a second how much

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.050 
think about this for a second how much
of<00:01:34.170> an<00:01:34.259> improvement<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.189> really<00:01:35.520> see<00:01:35.909> in

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
of an improvement can you really see in

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.240 
of an improvement can you really see in
games<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.990> future<00:01:37.500> but<00:01:37.950> that's<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
games in the future but that's a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.010 
games in the future but that's a
different<00:01:38.400> topic<00:01:38.759> according<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
different topic according to the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.510 
different topic according to the
interview<00:01:40.380> karmic<00:01:40.829> did<00:01:41.040> predict<00:01:41.430> a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
interview karmic did predict a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.510 
interview karmic did predict a
performance<00:01:42.240> increase<00:01:42.689> by<00:01:43.049> tenfold<00:01:43.470> which<00:01:44.340> in

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
performance increase by tenfold which in

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.240 
performance increase by tenfold which in
turn<00:01:44.790> should<00:01:45.090> allow<00:01:45.390> developers<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.229> boost<00:01:46.950> up

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
turn should allow developers to boost up

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.300 
turn should allow developers to boost up
the<00:01:47.280> frames<00:01:47.790> per<00:01:48.090> second<00:01:48.659> count<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.110> also<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
the frames per second count and also the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.359 
the frames per second count and also the
