00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
together and it really just comes down

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.090

to<00:00:17.460> time<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.690> as<00:00:18.750> we<00:00:18.930> get<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> little<00:00:19.230> bigger<00:00:19.560> it

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
to time and as we get a little bigger it

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.920 
to time and as we get a little bigger it
becomes<00:00:20.580> more<00:00:20.790> difficult<00:00:20.940> to<00:00:21.300> find<00:00:21.540> time<00:00:21.630> and

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
becomes more difficult to find time and

I<00:02:31.410> look<00:02:32.410> at<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.650> river<00:02:32.920> behind<00:02:33.280> me<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.989> wet

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
I look at the river behind me in the wet

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.500 
I look at the river behind me in the wet
season<00:02:35.590> we<00:02:35.920> will<00:02:36.220> stop<00:02:36.550> out<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.790> big<00:02:37.060> bolt<00:02:37.270> here

and we get on the canoe that will go

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.850 
and we get on the canoe that will go
through<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.120> mangrove<00:02:40.599> which<00:02:41.080> is<00:02:41.230> beautiful

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
through the mangrove which is beautiful

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.059 
through the mangrove which is beautiful

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
lot of fish trap and activity of

00:02:50.860 --> 00:03:07.140 
lot of fish trap and activity of
fishermen<00:02:52.590> heading<00:02:53.590> out<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.700> lake

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.760 

so<00:03:08.150> we're<00:03:08.330> just<00:03:08.360> hitting<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.440> edge<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:09.710> the

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
so we're just hitting the edge of the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.280 
so we're just hitting the edge of the
lake<00:03:10.300> you<00:03:11.300> can<00:03:11.330> see<00:03:11.600> there's<00:03:11.780> all<00:03:11.990> these

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
lake you can see there's all these

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.900 
lake you can see there's all these
floating<00:03:12.770> villages<00:03:13.160> out<00:03:13.370> there<00:03:13.670> in<00:03:13.790> the

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
floating villages out there in the

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.170 
floating villages out there in the
horizon<00:03:16.240> heaps<00:03:17.240> and<00:03:17.450> heaps<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:17.870> them

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:47.569 

pretty<00:03:20.810> massive<00:03:21.260> lake

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.190 

so<00:03:48.579> most<00:03:48.790> families<00:03:49.209> will<00:03:49.329> have<00:03:49.390> a<00:03:49.510> fish<00:03:49.870> farm

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
so most families will have a fish farm

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.649 
so most families will have a fish farm
these<00:03:50.590> are<00:03:50.769> these<00:03:50.920> pens<00:03:51.189> and<00:03:52.180> they<00:03:52.329> lure<00:03:52.540> it

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
these are these pens and they lure it

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.119 
these are these pens and they lure it
into<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.900> water<00:03:53.049> a<00:03:53.200> week<00:03:53.409> -<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.680> water<00:03:53.829> comes

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
into the water a week - the water comes

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.490 
into the water a week - the water comes
up<00:03:54.310> and<00:03:54.700> when<00:03:55.629> the<00:03:55.780> water<00:03:55.989> gets<00:03:56.290> higher

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
up and when the water gets higher

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.039 
up and when the water gets higher
they'll<00:03:56.709> also<00:03:57.099> put<00:03:57.489> longer<00:03:57.849> stilts<00:03:58.239> up<00:03:58.359> and

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
they'll also put longer stilts up and

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:08.920 
they'll also put longer stilts up and
move<00:03:59.290> their<00:03:59.469> houses<00:03:59.859> up

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:33.549 

making<00:04:09.930> our<00:04:10.079> way<00:04:10.109> back<00:04:10.280> inland<00:04:11.280> from<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.239> lake

00:04:33.549 --> 00:04:33.559 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:35.689 

between<00:04:34.559> the<00:04:34.740> river<00:04:34.919> in<00:04:35.099> the<00:04:35.189> village<00:04:35.490> this

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
between the river in the village this

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.659 
between the river in the village this
time<00:04:35.759> of<00:04:36.089> year<00:04:36.919> there's<00:04:37.919> no<00:04:38.039> water<00:04:38.279> and<00:04:38.580> I

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
time of year there's no water and I

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.159 
time of year there's no water and I
guess<00:04:38.849> people<00:04:39.029> really<00:04:39.629> don't<00:04:39.809> like<00:04:39.930> it<00:04:40.080> this

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
guess people really don't like it this

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:41.420 
guess people really don't like it this
time<00:04:40.409> of<00:04:40.529> year<00:04:40.649> because<00:04:40.740> they<00:04:41.009> have<00:04:41.099> to<00:04:41.249> spend

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
time of year because they have to spend

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.820 
time of year because they have to spend
a<00:04:41.520> lot<00:04:41.639> of<00:04:41.759> money<00:04:41.909> on<00:04:42.719> motorbikes<00:04:43.289> getting<00:04:43.649> to

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
a lot of money on motorbikes getting to

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:51.510 
a lot of money on motorbikes getting to
and<00:04:43.979> from<00:04:44.189> or<00:04:44.899> walking<00:04:45.899> through<00:04:46.649> mud

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.909 

my<00:04:52.030> trusty<00:04:52.539> driver<00:04:52.810> seems<00:04:53.169> to<00:04:53.319> be<00:04:53.470> well<00:04:53.650> in

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
my trusty driver seems to be well in

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:08.290 
my trusty driver seems to be well in
control

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.520 

so<00:05:09.300> this<00:05:09.480> trip<00:05:09.750> will<00:05:09.900> be<00:05:10.020> very<00:05:10.290> different

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
so this trip will be very different

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.400 
so this trip will be very different
depending<00:05:11.130> on<00:05:11.550> dry<00:05:11.970> and<00:05:12.240> wet<00:05:12.990> season

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
depending on dry and wet season

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.530 
depending on dry and wet season
obviously
