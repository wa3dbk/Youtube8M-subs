00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 have a nice day and welcome now almost 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.000
 at the end of this week we are at 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.550
 Thursday in obviously well found by 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.469
 mystery to the class today 11 June 2015 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.150
 so much news from that first 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.900
 from behind but very interesting because 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.449
 in that country it is starting with work 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.250
 browser is a new local operator 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.580
 system for downloading applications 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.590
 a sort of monthly subscription for which 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.930
 with a predefined figure then you can 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.359
 download all applications 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.219
 possible a weekend download cannot 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.530
 a form of all you can eat 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.719
 and it could be an interesting form 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.860
 to experiment also in other places 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.690
 we'll see how it goes 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.719
 the Vietnam pin experiment instead of 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.640
 pay 99 cents a euro two dollars 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.469
 what every application you pay 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.670
 a monthly subscription and then download 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.390
 whatever you like 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.070
 we'll see if the project is successful 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.140
 interesting news that comes from 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.510
 Japan just a few days ago apple 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.120
 has presented apple news and I also understand 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.289
 that the radio contained in it but is from 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.809
 Japan comes the news that 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.090
 the laimer messaging application 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.030
 will launch in a few days his 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.070
 pay-per-view music streaming line 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.770
 in short, we will see a market that begins 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.619
 to become particularly crowded lg 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.299
 c4 came out a few days ago is a 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.470
 product among other things that already online yes 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.720
 finds prices particularly 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.100
 convenient a very nice product for 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.990
 there is nothing else but curiosity in the states 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.520
 united users of haiti institutions entities 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.409

 reset the phone is restarted on 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.500
 phone without asking for any kind of 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.290
 permission would be curious to know what kind 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.250
 update the rappers who was is like this 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.020
 important 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.939
 according to capel skin the company that 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.820
 produces one of the most widespread antivirus 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.100
 in the world windows phone is more secure than 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.899
 android and ios with the ranking of 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.899
 windows phone ios and android 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.880
 last of the row among these 3 you are 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.469
 be alerted when you open content on 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.950
 your mobile phones 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.880
 ness the manufacturer of a thermostat 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.250
 the science-fiction society that it is then 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.079
 was bought by google 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.020
 however, it is widespread in many European countries 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.220
 except Italy 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.830
 the next one will present the first one 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.510
 surveillance camera that will be 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.980
 so completely wireless is yes 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.600
 it only attacks the current then the whole 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.430
 the rest is done with the command a 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.590
 distance exactly as it also happens 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.300
 for the thermostat we are curious about 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.920
 understand what the elements will be 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.920
 singular of this product in a 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.450
 already quite busy google market 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.040
 owner trait of nesta ha 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.590
 also presented a bizarre yesterday 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.950
 company that is called sidewalk is that yes 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.720
 its mission is to resolve 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.790
 the problems of life in big cities 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.120
 the cost of the apartments 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.320
 the flow of passers-by countries 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.960
 pavements 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.330
 traffic I am curious to understand how 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.030
 this sidewalk company will address 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.480
 these themes and how it proposes to 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.790
 solve them 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.520
 we know that netflix will arrive in October 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.620
 in Italy with a subscription in short 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.210
 quite interesting at least in his 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.740
 basic format of 7 euros and 99 but we know 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.110
 instead also that in the united states it is one 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.420
 of the most widespread systems for making use of 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.650
 movies and TV shows and well 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.900
 widespread today that even hotels 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.550
 will begin to offer netflix the first 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.750
 of the row will be the marriott hotel that 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.240
 will give the possibility to its users 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.810
 find the client and netflix in the 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.610
 own rooms 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.230
 just put your username and 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.870
 passwords that will be deleted in 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.120
 moment you will leave the room 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.060
 finally the latest news concerns huawei 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.980
 the news of the fact that 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.959
 android lollipop is coming for the main 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.000
 7 unfortunately not good news for 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.130
 those who wait I will have cook and watch 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.990
 because apparently the smartwatch of the 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.209
 Chinese house will only come next 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.310
 autumn is certainly a very long wait 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.200
 since it was presented last 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.000
 March we will not have to wait 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.950
 so long to find mister travel 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.790
 and for su radio number one because at 13 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.709
 at 8pm 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.600
 I await you with the dedicated space 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.010
 to technology if you live in an area 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.600
 where Rome gathered it does not arrive there 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.820
 worry there is the podcast format e 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.990
 both on itunes and how much on radio number 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.990
 one point in a good day
