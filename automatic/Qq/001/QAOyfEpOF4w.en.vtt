removing the small islands will be super

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.079 
removing the small islands will be super
easy<00:00:32.059> we<00:00:33.059> now<00:00:33.269> go<00:00:33.570> back<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:34.260> our<00:00:34.800> start<00:00:35.489> island

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:36.089 
easy we now go back to our start island

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:39.860 
easy we now go back to our start island
and<00:00:36.300> goes<00:00:37.019> south<00:00:37.699> we<00:00:38.699> will<00:00:38.909> reach<00:00:39.089> the

and goes south we will reach the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.020 
and goes south we will reach the
mushroom<00:00:40.409> biome<00:00:40.769> pretty<00:00:41.129> soon<00:00:41.460> cause<00:00:41.820> it's

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
quite close by actually to find the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.479 
quite close by actually to find the
seeds<00:00:45.539> took<00:00:45.870> me<00:00:46.079> quite<00:00:46.319> a<00:00:46.440> while<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.829> found<00:00:47.129> 800

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
seeds took me quite a while I found 800

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.930 
seeds took me quite a while I found 800
seeds<00:00:48.239> which<00:00:48.960> had<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> mushroom<00:00:49.920> island<00:00:50.249> and<00:00:50.730> a

seeds which had a mushroom island and a
witch<00:00:51.120> hat<00:00:51.359> but<00:00:51.659> a<00:00:51.929> spawn<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.679> a<00:00:52.829> swamp<00:00:53.370> seems

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
witch hat but a spawn in a swamp seems

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.910 
witch hat but a spawn in a swamp seems
to<00:00:53.909> be<00:00:53.999> impossible<00:00:54.359> so<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.989> had<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.379> find<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.710> seat

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
to be impossible so I had to find a seat

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.389 
to be impossible so I had to find a seat
where<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.370> bonus<00:00:56.819> next<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.839> the<00:00:57.960> swamp<00:00:58.399> as

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
where this bonus next to the swamp as

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.189 
where this bonus next to the swamp as
you<00:00:59.519> can<00:00:59.670> see<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.059> mushroom<00:01:00.389> biome<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.809> nice

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
you can see the mushroom biome is nice

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.119 
you can see the mushroom biome is nice
as<00:01:02.010> well<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.879> when<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:03.329> go<00:01:03.449> further<00:01:03.809> south<00:01:04.320> we

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
as well and when we go further south we

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.120 
as well and when we go further south we
will<00:01:05.159> reach<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.210> Mesa<00:01:06.450> biome<00:01:06.899> super<00:01:07.409> soon<00:01:07.710> so

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
will reach the Mesa biome super soon so

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.700 
will reach the Mesa biome super soon so
getting<00:01:08.460> clay<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:09.149> nice<00:01:09.299> buildings<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.259> easy

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
getting clay for nice buildings is easy

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.380 
getting clay for nice buildings is easy

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
bit further we can see that we got some

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.609 
bit further we can see that we got some
floating<00:01:44.399> islands<00:01:44.850> there<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.500> following<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
floating islands there and following the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.130 
floating islands there and following the
coast<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:47.039> will<00:01:47.159> find<00:01:47.460> much<00:01:48.210> more<00:01:48.600> beautiful

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
coast we will find much more beautiful

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.819 
coast we will find much more beautiful
landscape<00:01:50.149> so<00:01:51.149> first<00:01:51.810> we<00:01:51.929> have<00:01:52.049> another<00:01:52.320> swamp

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
landscape so first we have another swamp

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.919 
landscape so first we have another swamp
here<00:01:53.250> if<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.850> want<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.119> get<00:01:54.299> slimes

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
here if you want to get slimes

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.510 
here if you want to get slimes
that's<00:01:55.140> perfect

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
that's perfect

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.389 
that's perfect
and<00:01:56.609> then<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.420> get<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> forest<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.979> then<00:01:59.369> a

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
and then we get to a forest and then a

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.700 
and then we get to a forest and then a
roofed<00:01:59.729> forest<00:01:59.880> with<00:02:00.450> extreme<00:02:00.990> Hut's<00:02:01.229> nearby

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
roofed forest with extreme Hut's nearby

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.609 
roofed forest with extreme Hut's nearby
and<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.219> looks<00:02:02.460> already<00:02:02.850> super<00:02:03.299> awesome<00:02:03.689> but

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
and that looks already super awesome but

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.520 
and that looks already super awesome but
if<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:04.979> go<00:02:05.130> further<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:05.850> have<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.570> plane<00:02:07.170> loop

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
if we go further we have this plane loop

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.460 
if we go further we have this plane loop
surrounded<00:02:08.190> by<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.369> roof<00:02:08.610> forests<00:02:09.090> and

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
surrounded by the roof forests and

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.550
