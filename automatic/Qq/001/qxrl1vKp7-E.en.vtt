00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
guess and here is my theory let's just

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.470 
guess and here is my theory let's just
get<00:00:53.520> down<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.000> chase

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
get down in the chase

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.290 
get down in the chase
arm<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.860> pokemon<00:00:56.460> black<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.850> white<00:00:56.969> there's

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
arm in pokemon black and white there's

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.660 
arm in pokemon black and white there's
an<00:00:57.449> area<00:00:57.840> that's<00:00:58.410> like<00:00:58.620> all<00:00:58.949> desert<00:00:59.430> II<00:00:59.520> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
an area that's like all desert II and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.340 
an area that's like all desert II and
shit<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.059> think<00:01:00.420> it's<00:01:00.539> called<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> desert<00:01:01.109> area

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
shit I think it's called the desert area

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.650 
shit I think it's called the desert area
or<00:01:01.500> something<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.010> route<00:01:02.370> 210<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.480> don't

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
or something is like route 210 I don't

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.979 
or something is like route 210 I don't
remember

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
remember

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.260 
remember
the<00:01:04.470> point<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.400> desert<00:01:05.850> II<00:01:05.939> area

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the point is it's this desert II area

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.230 
the point is it's this desert II area
and<00:01:06.530> I<00:01:07.530> believe<00:01:07.650> there's<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.520> lot<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.790> like<00:01:08.970> talk

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and I believe there's a lot of like talk

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.760 
and I believe there's a lot of like talk
around<00:01:09.420> there<00:01:09.689> saying<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.320> based<00:01:10.619> off

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
around there saying that it's based off

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.120 
around there saying that it's based off
of<00:01:10.830> Ground<00:01:11.220> Zero<00:01:11.689> because<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.130> universe

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
of Ground Zero because you know universe

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.280 
of Ground Zero because you know universe
based<00:01:14.400> off<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.640> New<00:01:14.880> York<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.540> blah<00:01:15.990> blah<00:01:16.020> blah

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
based off of New York and blah blah blah

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.800 
based off of New York and blah blah blah
blah<00:01:17.009> when<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.729> correlate<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.420> up

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
blah when you correlate it up

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.830 
blah when you correlate it up
it's<00:01:19.439> where<00:01:20.340> Ground<00:01:20.580> Zero<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.390> yeah<00:01:21.600> yeah

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.389 
yeah that's creepy as fuck and my theory
is<00:01:51.210> your<00:01:51.450> mask<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.079> Pokemon<00:01:52.770> which<00:01:53.220> is

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
is your mask is a Pokemon which is

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.270 
is your mask is a Pokemon which is
created<00:01:53.909> by<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:55.049> Dead<00:01:55.380> Souls<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.009> people

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
created by the Dead Souls or the people

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.060 
created by the Dead Souls or the people
who<00:01:56.369> died<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.670> 9/11<00:01:57.259> it<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.439> really<00:01:58.860> dark

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
who died in 9/11 it is really dark

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.249 
who died in 9/11 it is really dark
theory<00:01:59.490> it's<00:01:59.729> not<00:01:59.790> nice<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.479> mean<00:02:00.689> it's<00:02:00.869> not

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
theory it's not nice I mean it's not

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.780 
theory it's not nice I mean it's not
something<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.740> tell<00:02:01.979> your<00:02:02.130> kids<00:02:02.369> before<00:02:02.549> you

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
something you tell your kids before you

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.569 
something you tell your kids before you
put<00:02:02.969> them<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.119> bed<00:02:03.299> but<00:02:03.990> it's<00:02:04.229> my<00:02:04.439> theory<00:02:04.770> so

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
put them in bed but it's my theory so
