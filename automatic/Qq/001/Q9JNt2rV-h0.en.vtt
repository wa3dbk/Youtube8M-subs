world is not going to be brought about
by<00:00:16.410> cellular<00:00:16.650> activity<00:00:17.250> because<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.940> Sun<00:00:18.090> has

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
by cellular activity because the Sun has

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.150 
by cellular activity because the Sun has

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
hours we still have the same three

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.910 
hours we still have the same three
numbered<00:00:22.109> regions<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.590> southern

hemisphere 12 14 12 16 and 12 18 are
they're<00:00:26.880> all<00:00:27.000> single<00:00:27.269> spots<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.500> don't

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
they're all single spots and I don't

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.290 
they're all single spots and I don't
expect<00:00:28.890> any<00:00:29.130> activity<00:00:29.670> out<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> moon

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
expect any activity out of the moon

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.150 
expect any activity out of the moon
there<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> new<00:00:31.289> region<00:00:31.439> appearing<00:00:31.920> over<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
there is a new region appearing over the

there is a new region appearing over the

which<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.719> not<00:00:33.870> as<00:00:33.960> yet<00:00:34.110> numbered<00:00:34.530> but<00:00:35.010> it

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
which is not as yet numbered but it

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.229 
which is not as yet numbered but it
doesn't<00:00:35.340> look<00:00:35.430> too<00:00:35.579> impressive<00:00:35.940> at<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
doesn't look too impressive at the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.760 
doesn't look too impressive at the
moment<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:36.840> i'm<00:00:36.960> not<00:00:37.110> expecting<00:00:37.320> very<00:00:37.620> much

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
moment so i'm not expecting very much

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.369 
moment so i'm not expecting very much
mad<00:00:38.010> either<00:00:38.300> so<00:00:39.300> let's<00:00:39.420> see<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.809> evolution<00:00:40.079> of

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
produce any significant events this is

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.170 
produce any significant events this is
indeed<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.250> case<00:01:05.369> when<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.880> look<00:01:06.030> at<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
indeed the case when you look at the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.969 
indeed the case when you look at the
goes<00:01:06.360> x-ray<00:01:06.780> plot<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.470> see<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.860> there

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
goes x-ray plot you can see that there

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.859 
goes x-ray plot you can see that there
are<00:01:08.100> no<00:01:08.250> significant<00:01:09.090> events<00:01:09.360> whatsoever

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
are no significant events whatsoever

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.080 
are no significant events whatsoever
over<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.260> last<00:01:10.439> 24<00:01:10.920> hours<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.030> see

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
over the last 24 hours and you can see

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.490 
over the last 24 hours and you can see
the<00:01:12.210> background<00:01:12.479> x-ray<00:01:12.930> flux<00:01:13.110> has<00:01:13.229> dropped

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the background x-ray flux has dropped

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.590 
the background x-ray flux has dropped
even<00:01:13.619> further<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> let's<00:01:15.240> take<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> look<00:01:15.570> at

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
even further so let's take a look at

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.120 
even further so let's take a look at
what's<00:01:15.780> been<00:01:15.900> going<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> corona<00:01:16.619> by

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
what's been going on in the corona by

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.670 
what's been going on in the corona by
going<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.580> sto<00:01:17.909> AIA<00:01:18.509> instrument<00:01:19.110> looking

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.710 
but let's see if they've been any film
interruption<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.180> we<00:01:33.360> go<00:01:33.480> to<00:01:33.510> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
interruption for that we go to the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.320 
interruption for that we go to the
helium<00:01:34.050> 2<00:01:34.230> 304<00:01:34.860> channel<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:35.910> see<00:01:36.120> in<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
helium 2 304 channel and we see in the

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.360 
helium 2 304 channel and we see in the
southeast<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.530> indeed<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.010> filament<00:01:38.310> that

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
southeast that indeed the filament that

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.130 
southeast that indeed the filament that
I<00:01:38.460> was<00:01:38.610> talking<00:01:38.700> about<00:01:39.000> yesterday<00:01:39.180> least<00:01:39.990> had

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
I was talking about yesterday least had

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.840 
I was talking about yesterday least had
a<00:01:40.170> partial<00:01:40.470> eruption<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.460> let's<00:01:41.640> see<00:01:41.760> if<00:01:41.820> that

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
a partial eruption so let's see if that

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.430 
a partial eruption so let's see if that
eruption<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.480> the<00:01:42.540> southeast<00:01:42.960> produced<00:01:43.350> a

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
eruption in the southeast produced a

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.620 
eruption in the southeast produced a
coronal<00:01:43.800> mass<00:01:43.830> ejection<00:01:44.120> that<00:01:45.120> we<00:01:45.240> go<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
coronal mass ejection that we go to the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.900 
coronal mass ejection that we go to the

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
sailboat coronagraphs first we look at

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.160 
sailboat coronagraphs first we look at

on the backside of the Sun we can

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.560 
on the backside of the Sun we can

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
confirm that using the stereo data here

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.760 
confirm that using the stereo data here
I<00:02:12.600> have<00:02:12.810> an<00:02:12.900> image<00:02:13.050> from<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.320> stereo-b

I have an image from the stereo-b

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.070 
I have an image from the stereo-b

the<00:02:18.450> earth<00:02:18.570> is<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.050> right<00:02:19.260> but<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.130> can

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
the earth is on the right but you can

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.160 
the earth is on the right but you can
see<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.640> coronal<00:02:21.360> mass<00:02:21.480> ejection<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:22.050> on

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
see that the coronal mass ejection is on

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.870 
see that the coronal mass ejection is on
the<00:02:22.290> left<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:23.010> that<00:02:23.160> is<00:02:23.280> indeed<00:02:23.580> on<00:02:23.790> the

the left so that is indeed on the

the left so that is indeed on the

the update on the stages of the common
here<00:02:29.340> I've<00:02:29.490> taken<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.820> magnified<00:02:30.210> part<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.570> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
moving up towards the Sun as it does so

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.229 
moving up towards the Sun as it does so
it<00:02:40.020> gets<00:02:40.200> brighter<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.800> larger<00:02:41.010> at<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.030> very

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
it gets brighter and larger at the very
