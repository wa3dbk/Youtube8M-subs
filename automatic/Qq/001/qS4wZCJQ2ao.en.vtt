 the priority in this case 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.460
 already given bucket 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.930
 sometimes what to do then where

 distributor and gives the boom and need 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:42.580
 understand and move the same on 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.620

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.510

 what we consider 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.390
 as we raised coke with an arrow we lower 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.390
 porsche simultaneously unload 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.450
 raise the queue 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.040

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.910
 done on what customers need 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.270
 pay attention that the killer is over on 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:52.690
 what is hidden here is the operator's eye 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:52.690
