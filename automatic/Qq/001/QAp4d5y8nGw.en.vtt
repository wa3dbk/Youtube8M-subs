00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.920
 how about friends of the listener today 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.440
 I'm going to show you how to crop an image and 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.870
 modify it or after passing it to another to another 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.600
 obviously image with photoshop in this 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.760
 Case use the portable essence version 6 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.490
 but to no problem if they have a 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.920
 previous since the process is almost equal 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.269
 if some interested in acquiring the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.680
 version that I have I will leave it in the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.230
 description of the video so that they can 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.090
 download and then download for 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.250
 start then I will simply work with 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.340
 this image that is very simple 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:43.420
 the goal is simply to have 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.130
 cut out some aspect some size 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.930
 precise of the image in this case will be 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:52.750
 this kind of star and we're going to work 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.340
 first clear that there are 73 tools 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.340
 that serve us to cut that is the 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.790
 tool quick selection 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.699
 If you are square cut to 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.010
 touch with the settings and the pen 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.960
 so then let's see if it is 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.250
 necessary to explain the three you have for 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.100
 this case we will see with the 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.560
 quick selection we give you click 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.009
 this is very easy because click 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.810
 form the program automatically 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.750
 is pointing out the regions that we want 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.000
 I recommend that you enlarge 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.510
 mollema in a little means the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.370
 transformation what is is the a 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.370
 is we start making the selection 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.800
 and as we see is making the selection 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.750
 just from the star 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.270
 We keep clicking and selected the 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.110
 star but it happens that here I do not 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.590
 they select everything then let's give 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:54.659
 reduce the size a bit 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:58.600
 so that I can select the object 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.700
 ready in windows 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.570
 i'm not 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.570
 3 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.980
 crystal for that is what then remains 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.260
 is left after giving control x cut that 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.930
 they can also do it by image 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.300
 cut and as we see, we have already been 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.920
 gone the image we were still to create a 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.310
 new 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.450
 1 document for the program 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.110
 the width we can put of 100 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.110
 in case he 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.450
 and we are going to stick it in control and ready 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.200
 we have the first the first cut of 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.200
 the picture 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.910
 so it is for 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.610
 when using the selection tool 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.890
 fast 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.580
 Now we will work with 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.580
 tool d 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.630
 feathers I'm not bad that's called created 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.400
 this tool is used more than anything 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.799
 when the figure is very difficult to take 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.780
 already when the colors agree a lot 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.730
 like the gray ones for example the black ones 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.040
 Well with the quick selection also 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.290
 comes out 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.540
 but in this case to explain the 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.849
 pen already experience you what 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.150
 they want to use those are simply 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:26.989
 dotted points as sales 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.500
 and round and round but with the figure 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.840
 that you want to cut 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.410
 so for as long as I do this for 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.410
 use the video 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.170
 ready I have the image thus indicated 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.170
 I do not know if I'm very good at it 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.480
 Here is a line and we click right 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:53.010
 to make selection 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.420
 ok control x did not fit perfectly but 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.069
 well as it is for an explanation not 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.340
 nothing happens you perfect it a 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.340
 little bit 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.620
 live 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.410
 for me 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.360
 and the elephant is here 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.790
 for the figures that we are cutting in 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.980
 yes we have this and this one 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.109
 with figures that at first glance look 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.199
 ok but detailing a bit you can 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:23.280
 get your errors like nothing happens and 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:28.250
 for the latest tool 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.250
 let's use elephant work 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.729
 let's use the plotting tool and 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.729
 our name is already called the name 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.380
 sorry forgiveness and really from the area 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.000
 clearly what it does is take a 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.510
 fragment 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.510
 Y 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.490
 from that image takes what 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.460
 have 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:05:00.470
 so let's take for example these 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.470
 elephants like that and frees her 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.460
 here 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.120
 we take this part acan de male 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.940
 foundations as you see it is taking more 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.710
 towards the sides little by little the 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.710
 of cuts we are going to give 10 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:23.329
 double control x 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.539
 the fading I have 10 left in the 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.940
 image you do not notice much what you want 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.319
 reduce fading in this way 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.319
 because we have multiple cuts 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.700
 picture explaining the three tools 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:41.620
 is 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.000
 and the other 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.000
 the pen and 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.259
 the selection 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.580
 and this is practically already too much 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.169
 easy to do it with any image you 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.300
 can go also with person only remains 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.879
 practice especially with the feather the 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.979
 dotted point very well zoom 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:05.090
 zoom to score as best as possible is a 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:07.979
 they do it with the alt key and the scroll 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:11.400
 thanks for up to down so that 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:13.800
 not having to be getting close with the 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.569
 program with the keys normally 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.569
 I hope you serve them and this
