you<00:03:36.409> don't<00:03:36.590> really<00:03:36.739> notice<00:03:37.069> any<00:03:37.549> any<00:03:38.480> top-end

you don't really notice any any top-end

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.289 
you don't really notice any any top-end
gone<00:03:39.530> you<00:03:39.950> just<00:03:39.980> end<00:03:40.340> up<00:03:40.430> cutting<00:03:40.879> out<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.120> low

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
gone you just end up cutting out the low

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.309 
gone you just end up cutting out the low
end<00:03:41.540> so<00:03:42.549> this<00:03:43.549> is<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.760> universal<00:03:44.420> high-pass

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
like without the filter this is what it

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.720 
like without the filter this is what it
