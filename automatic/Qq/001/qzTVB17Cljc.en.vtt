00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.819 
but I think they're quite fun they do do
what<00:01:27.420> they<00:01:27.540> say<00:01:27.720> they<00:01:27.960> get<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.200> adieu<00:01:28.439> content

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
you don't normally do and it's generally

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
obviously normally you just buy all the

obviously this time you had to actually

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.210 
obviously this time you had to actually
make<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.880> all<00:01:51.210> yourself<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.829> pretty<00:01:52.950> fun

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
it useful for touchscreens while if you

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.680 
it useful for touchscreens while if you

but<00:05:12.690> not<00:05:13.560> really<00:05:13.889> more<00:05:14.759> so<00:05:14.820> you'll<00:05:15.060> want<00:05:15.210> to

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
but not really more so you'll want to

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.150 
but not really more so you'll want to
use<00:05:15.330> a<00:05:15.419> mouse<00:05:15.660> and<00:05:16.380> more<00:05:16.620> more<00:05:16.889> people<00:05:17.009> are

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
and frankly this should have just been

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.950 
and frankly this should have just been
two<00:05:20.280> versions<00:05:20.729> of<00:05:20.789> Windows<00:05:21.060> it<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.539> standard

Windows<00:05:23.669> 8<00:05:23.820> that<00:05:24.000> you<00:05:24.389> could<00:05:24.539> use<00:05:24.750> for

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
Windows 8 that you could use for

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.960 
Windows 8 that you could use for
touchscreens<00:05:25.500> and<00:05:25.590> say<00:05:25.710> oh<00:05:25.979> well<00:05:26.160> I've

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
touchscreens and say oh well I've

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.360 
touchscreens and say oh well I've
blabbed<00:05:27.509> on<00:05:27.690> quite<00:05:27.990> a<00:05:28.020> while<00:05:28.289> now<00:05:28.320> and<00:05:28.949> this<00:05:29.220> is

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
computer so it's gonna be interesting to

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.510 
computer so it's gonna be interesting to
know<00:05:33.659> how<00:05:33.870> fast<00:05:34.080> it<00:05:34.289> renders<00:05:34.710> in<00:05:34.860> comparison

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
know how fast it renders in comparison

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.789 
know how fast it renders in comparison
