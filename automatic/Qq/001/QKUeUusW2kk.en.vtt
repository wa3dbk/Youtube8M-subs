00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.239
 The goal is more than 20 years. 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.340
 passed and the park is finally 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.440
 open my great concern to this 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.220
 movie is just that argument 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.440
 central 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.870
 how to justify the opening of the park 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.720
 after the catastrophe that was the project 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.909
 of the first film response implants 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.790
 this time they inserted chips for 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.820
 control dinosaurs sing in the 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.570
 beginning of the film some dialogues almost 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.269
 metalinguistic approaches that address the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.220
 that 22 years later people no longer 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.650
 impress with dinosaurs as 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.780
 easily a clear double reference 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.159
 on the one hand pointing to the public that 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.590
 will watch the movie 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.479
 on the other hand justifying the plot that 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.820
 genetically engineered dinosaurs 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.750
 modified to be larger and more 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.920
 scary 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.750
 the movie starts following some 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.880
 characters separately until the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.430
 their paths cross of course that almost 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.799
 everything goes wrong immediately and chaos 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.450
 install in many aspects of the group s 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.670
 represents a serious problem in 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.770
 hollywood the creative failure of 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.990
 culture fed by 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.600
 a generation that is content every time with 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.610
 less as a director is a film with 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.860
 a fantastic story and a direction 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.470
 flawless wrapped by effects 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.300
 spectacular visuals during that goal is 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.330
 a film with an empty story and a 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.700
 direction blaser disguised by effects 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.159
 spectacular visuals and today's audience 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.750
 enough is michael bay syndrome 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.670
 This movie will be watched by the world. 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.010
 whole will be an absurd success of 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.990
 box office and this criticism is 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.870
 will get a lot of alex year 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.700
 the direction of the colon entered and without vision or 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.200
 ambition to do something beyond 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.420
 diagnose a problem is that it does not 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.519
 Do you know or do not want to solve the cast? 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.649
 competent interpretive terms but 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.120
 suffers greatly with the script that presents 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.190
 the characters in the most 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.840
 Artificial Possible No One Looks Like 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.730
 human truth all 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.099
 characters are projections of 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.290
 stereotypes that it represents the gray is 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.000
 the typical super intelligent child who 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.680
 knows absolutely everything about 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.739
 dinosaurs a character that by the way already 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.019
 It was made and the best in this franchise is joe 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.299
 The typical grumpy teenager is 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.180
 always with a headset looking in the 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.920
 phone looking at pretty girls 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.840
 12 shows any empathy 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.450
 I especially remember that later 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.989
 eight - minute film and thought it 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.239
 this character died now would not 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.000
 a horrible thing bryce dallas howard 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.159
 makes an orca roll methodical too much 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.620
 questions some priorities that it 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.629
 established in life the actress is good and does 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.639
 a respected work to muddy some 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.099
 archetypes within a film that falls 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.290
 Chris pratt has charisma in them. 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.209
 in addition he conducts very well his 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.760
 portion of the movie even though it has to speak 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.620
 some horrible dialogues he convinces 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.010
 Incidentally the movie has some games that are 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.129
 worthy of vincent d'onofrio makes the 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.750
 the most affected and deceased villain 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.909
 years, the only way to leave this 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.909
 character with an eye patch 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:27.030
 subtopic it's pathetic what he wants 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:29.489
 to do is something that no one on the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.040
 he made people more evil and evil 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.379
 the world would not think that 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.060
 it could one day it works there is a 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.680
 thing that I like to call stupid 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.780
 cinema is very common in 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.540
 terror but they have all the genres is when 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.639
 for example the innocent girl descends the 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.680
 dark basement to investigate a noise 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.989
 mysterious in the middle of the night this movie 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.430
 uses film stupidity in proportions 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.280
 catastrophic 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.620
 and if that is his plan after 20 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.879
 guys died 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.650
 this idea is what they are going to do 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.510
 to try it's hard to criticize 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.720
 specifically 100 from the school but 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.500
 There are so many scenes there are no faces. 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:13.049
 They entered there and bidet and 10 minutes will pick up 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:15.030
 the italy 22 years the dwarf in the old 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.759
 The film's most serious problem is that it 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.220
 never finds your mood movie tone 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:22.169
 does not work and even works in moments 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.539
 few jokes that 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.460
 individually they are funny but they 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.009
 do not work in context because the movie 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.889
 try to make some serious moments 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.870
 sad melancholics at the same time as 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.250
 they play the childlike jokes then 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.750
 He does not know the tone he wants. 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.699
 to establish but okay, I do not want 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.590
 to make the impression that I hated the movie 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:42.570
 because it 's not true he has some 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.039
 Let's talk about them as it was 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.770
 to be expected the film is visually 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.390
 very beautiful ideals is flawless and 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.970
 sequences of action very well 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.770
 directed to the continuous soundtrack linda 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.750
 and conveys a sense of nostalgia 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.760
 very nice the movie does some 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.620
 Legal references to classic there 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.210
 moments where he turns almost a movie 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.890
 homage when they are made of 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.810
 subtle way they work very well 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.910
 but sometimes they get too expensive 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.500
 and gives the impression that the film is 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.780
 more concerned with trying to capitalize 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.130
 with economic scenes of the past than 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.380
 create your own 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.940
 Another very cool element is the park in 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.920
 yes it's cool to be able to imagine 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.720
 possibility of disney with 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.970
 dinosaurs and the film does this 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.250
 competent manner the final 20 minutes 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.860
 they are very exciting the movie has a twist 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.720
 which although not totally unexpected is 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.430
 Well cool, I liked to see it was 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.190
 hoping to happen and one 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:36.570
 very fucking moment in the movie a it 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:40.830
 That's what this said was cool. 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:43.920
 I'll remember that and it's about 3d 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.590
 I do not need reinsurance. 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.200
 dose of nostalgia and escapist fun 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.050
 The film is technically proficient but the 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.720
 script is poor, the tone has evolved too 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:58.680
 There is suspense not the imagination there is nothing 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.010
 very relevant to be said here note 5.8 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.770
