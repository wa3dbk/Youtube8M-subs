00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
one where have we seen those metal

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.869 
one where have we seen those metal
frames<00:00:38.690> eh<00:00:38.960> it's<00:00:39.650> in<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:39.920> product<00:00:40.309> of<00:00:40.430> a<00:00:40.550> rival

company<00:00:41.089> that<00:00:41.510> you<00:00:41.659> can<00:00:41.809> guess<00:00:42.049> for<00:00:42.850> yourself

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
company that you can guess for yourself

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.000 
company that you can guess for yourself
but<00:00:44.570> it's<00:00:44.750> also<00:00:44.960> in<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:45.440> leaks<00:00:45.650> for<00:00:45.920> the
