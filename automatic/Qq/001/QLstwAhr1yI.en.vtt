00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.790
 passion 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.950
 lamps no 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.950
 [Music] 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.660
 the idea runners have when 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.429
 I got caught in a little more area 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.710
 was able to get comfortable again with 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.240
 this with this quartet but good 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.160
 tell charly that all the helmets 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.900
 they are good that you already know what is 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:33.129
 very good mandatory but they are all very 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:34.269
 similar to us as now happens and 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.470
 has to be some definite 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.650
 probably also open that is the 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:43.289
 fastest runner we said he wins 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:46.870
 a stage in when 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.520
 that leak in the Belgian corridor and this 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.420
 respect as we said the sandra 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.280
 you yes that 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.280
 legs from downing 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:04.520
 as for the law is very very very 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.770
 technique where lowering casualties with tension 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.990
 and also the muscles remain tense 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:14.890
 and they grabbed ports and a waste and 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.890
 surely the leg hurts 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.090
 if it had been in this play 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.090
 Thank you 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.969
 [Music] 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.570
 for the screen now you can go new 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:33.950
 hard 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:45.430
 sure I think he was talking about the 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:47.660
 port but I did not know why 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.920
 [Applause] 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.610
 500 meters 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.790
 meters this difference 6 more than a minute 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.830
 it's almost two minutes of lightning ascension 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.220
 clear to us for what they would be 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.040
 five minutes 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.930
 Carlos follows Juan Carlos 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.910
 to tell you that that little group that you 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.590
 commented on the one that came to daniele 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.140
 Bennati of about 12 units has already 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.850
 contacted with the igor leader group 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.590
 where all the favorites go and 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.180
 there in that group of about 12 units has 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.970
 entered important people also like 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.500
 filippo pozzato and the one who was I think a 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.150
 total of 5 days leader of this round 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.330
 cyclist to spain the Belgian of omega 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.010
 pharma lotto philippe gilbert 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.400
 anyway 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.750
 two and a half if it 's a pretty group 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.860
 big helper I think it's hard 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.840
 that the peloton can reach 1 035 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.489
 group of barrero let's say that I frei these 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.829
 and then a normal one since it's two and a half 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.150
 of over the peloton should not 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.030
 have some team that really knows what 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.829
 will take very much desire from there they are 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.060
 coming also in this respect of can 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.230
 grau 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.940
 the men 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.860
 of the peloton with 14 effectively that of 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.350
 moment becomes a controlled and the 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.970
 race 2 16 now 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.190
 is cautiously effectively having a 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.190
 good representation in that in that group 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.010
 [Applause] 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.960
 the names of 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.450
 of liquigás that nobody goes willems 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.920
 paterski plus the Polish profile returning 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.160
 to suffer after having entered the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.050
 decline in this high of the rat penat 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.530
 already enough people arrived as I said before 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.600
 frank but 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.180
 I do not know, I think it will be difficult, but 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.040
 someone is organized to cast is not 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.500
 it is a favorable land to organize 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.000
 that's why I commented that any leak 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.630
 there could be attacks because then 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.370
 it is very difficult to organize a hunt as 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.020
 what we have or are used to 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.040
 to see on our road type here 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.720
 you have strength and you have skill you know 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.410
 the terrain can make way as 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.870
 we are looking at the case of de joffré that 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.580
 as you know this site has jumped it has 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.580
 gone and going way 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.630
 and the pretty face and very good little star 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.930
 show also for you that we 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.880
 follow and is also launching looking 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.590
 your opportunity from afar there you have 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.850
 effectively head of career for the 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.980
 navarro runner of the set that 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.450
 separate winner in the rozas and a 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.830
 stage in the cycling round spain 20 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.510
 kilometers to the end and has plotted 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.070
 very fast as you can see this curve 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.870
 with a lot of confidence 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.400
 the set that is of bread that already 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.510
 he found victory with david lopez in 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.160
 alcohol and that victory that both 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.300
 chased on the tour de france and not 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.300
 could reach
