00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:07.110
 Hi, my name is Laura, and well, if we start 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.960
 a design 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:17.220
 that are kawaii are cupcakes and I have 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.430
 learned I wanted to teach 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.150
 you already have to do 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.380
 it was in the part of the base 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.470
 you have to make the bed of half 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.470
 put it here 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.660
 and to make count 8 squares and 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.460
 put them in black color of the palette 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.460
 looks teaches balance 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.610
 that color 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.719
 well, those are the colors the base 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.719
 as I was saying a black color 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:36.500
 with the cases 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:41.780
 8 squares in black color from here 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.440
 it's done if you have to take chagas 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.590
 On the line 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.690
 put this well and public oil after 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.870
 here you have to do 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.870
 6 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.650
 here 2 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.790
 and now I want you have to do is 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.790
 this is going to be like this 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.960
 so that the stories 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.300
 and then the dots would be the same here 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:27.120
 it would have to be the same three dots 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:29.400
 the six of line 2 and make the line 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.819
 diagonal 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.120
 in the line of classrooms and then what 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:40.140
 ends up doing 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:44.720
 the horizontal line to finish 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.720
 then take the pink color done 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.540
 Y 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.540
 I took from here I am like that 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.140
 the signal is already on the line 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:05.000
 and the same again on the line 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:08.930
 so it's finished with cuÃ© 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.950
 with filling the same color you do 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.520
 this 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.520
 one 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.459
 we catch the slightly darker color 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.420
 and we go over the edge 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.260
 easy to give as more vidilla 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.900
 A) Yes 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.700
 after 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.840
 with this color 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.680
 fill the bottom of the cake 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.829
 kawaii cake 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.549
 and connect with is darker but it happens 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.549
 As before 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:25.060
 then the part that we have started 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:28.230
 you have to make the little eyes they are very 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.230
 simple are squares 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:36.729
 see well of four dots 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.729
 leaving it slowly here 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.120
 and can 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:45.080
 16 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.080
 whitish 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.490
 the mouth 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:56.729
 it would be this 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:59.090
 of 44 points saw what was the little piquito 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:02.440
 beautiful beige 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.440
 measure the smile 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.190
 and the cheeks now what 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.080
 and what do you need? 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.150
 counted with two white points and so a 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.680
 dot between 0 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.680
 phase 2 lin 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.380
 and 4 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.590
 another little 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.760
 two 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.760
 piti is here 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.220

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:01.009
 and I added dot 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:06.409
 then here to do as a touch of 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:07.399

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:09.909
 6 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.500
