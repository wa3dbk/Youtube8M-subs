00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello how about my name is melisa rocha 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.580
 I am pro master organic name and in this 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.649
 occasion I bring for a design with 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.350
 our new collection of myths accompany me 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.350
 to do it 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.330
 let's use the triad color that is 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.090
 a green water tone 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.380
 we will place it 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.380
 as follows 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.090
 under the right side of the smile 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:32.300
 we're going to take it to anchor tension 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.500
 and we are going to make him think a little and 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.500
 slightly to the left 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.149
 we limit what are the skirts 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.399
 and no smiles 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.740
 we press to leave it completely 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.690
 flat 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.690
 I will place one more pearl 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.870
 and likewise I'm going to take it 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.440
 slightly 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.500
 or it will be left 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.250
 to form as a wave if my curve in 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.250
 this part 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.820
 and press to make it completely 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.820
 flat 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.580
 now we are going to work from our 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.300
 new cosmos leader 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:31.030
 the color ground cosmos which is a tone 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.700
 bronze for which I applied two parts 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.180
 acrylic glass with a part of 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.310
 great cosmos 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.880
 I will apply this color to 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.840
 complete the smile line 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.840
 on the left side 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.960
 taking it also until completing the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.960
 Tension angle 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.240
 and very careful not to stain 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.660
 what is our collection color 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.660
 Myths 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.570
 pressing it to leave it as flat 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.570
 possible as I said 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.360
 let's sweep it lightly so that 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.190
 all the leaders are completely 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.740
 upwards and reflect light better 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.250
 therefore it is much brighter 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.380
 once finished and encapsulated 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.900
 To complete our tip we are going to 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.800
 work a marbling with the organic 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.200
 lorne on plum and neon pitch that this neon 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.470
 pitch its very intense orange and it's what 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.560
 that will give a lot of life to our design 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.760
 and our neon plum is a purple much 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.590
 softer 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.840
 let's work them with moisture 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.840
 necessary to be able to marble and ar 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.300
 placing first neon pitch 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.200
 have a plan 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.490
 again lion pitch 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.460
 and in the upper part not a plus 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.490
 with the tip of the brush we are going to pull 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:25.830
 upwards 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.830
 and slightly down 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.440
 let's try 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.830
 when we are directing it to the 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.830
 side 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:49.180
 we do not get to erase the veins 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.160
 that we form medically by pressing without 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.130
 sweep the brush over the acrylic 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.880
 of our new art decoration line 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.880
 in fossil 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.220
 with the white siren litmus that the 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.140
 we can find as a tablecloth 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.510
 then to take an acrylic pearl 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.170
 small crystal 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.750
 I will place it 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.450
 over the marbling area 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.710
 and a little bit about the collection 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.720
 myths our color triad 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.960
 this way if you notice the I'm 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.520
 placing very saturated and I'm also going to 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:35.150
 place of our artime such a color 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.150
 bronze 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:41.440
 the bolsters 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.950
 in the same way placing acrylic 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.360
 glass and with the tip of the brush 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.370
 we take the studs and we're going 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.590
 We locating in the area where we will 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.360
 want to work this time I 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.990
 I'm doing a bit to segment 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.340
 our grid 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.340
 from our collection 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.630
 Once the design is done, we will 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:08.000
 proceed in capsules 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.000
 taking a big pearl 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.260
 depositing the one below the area of 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:15.230
 smile 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.750
 and we vanish towards the technique of 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.160
 reverse and so on until completing all the 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.200
 encapsulated 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.240
 Once the encapsulation is dry, we will 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.460
 remove form for sculpture by pressing 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.880
 on the left side of the right side and 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.100
 we release the form for sculpture 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.490
 we are going to give structure with our lime 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.880
 zebras and in 100 pink edge starting with 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.880
 the laterals 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.979
 skirt 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.169
 tip 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:55.240
 and surface with a filing at the time 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:57.129
 until you finish giving structure once 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.110
 that we gave structure with the lime zebras 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:01.749
 and in 100 we proceed to polish with the line 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.330
 exposes 180 180 to remove all 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:05.889
 scratches left by the previous abrasive 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.100
 let's also take advantage to remove 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.380
 edges at the tip 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.800
 and we remove the excess powder with a 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.800
 brush 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.040
 later with a house soaked 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.420
 of synergy wild let's clean up 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.420
 complete the excess powder 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.510
 by the top and also by the 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:29.449
 lower part of the nail we will apply pro 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.820
 tempore in cuticle area for 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:32.969
 ensure the adherence of our jersey 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.309
 nets 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:37.139
 remember that finished products 

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:39.569
 as the jersey nets are designed to 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:41.009
 adhere to the keratin of the nail by 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:42.329
 what if we get to touch the skin in 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:44.969
 some point we can have 

00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:49.099
 premature detachments we are going to 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:49.099
 place from cuticle area to tip 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.340
 and also in what will be our 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.340
 skirt 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.490
 and let's be full 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.110
 and we put to cure the lamp for 30 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.110
 seconds 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.330
 once the curing time has elapsed 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.039
 this is how our design is my 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.509
 name is melisa roche I am pro master 

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:23.960
 organic nice and it was a pleasure to be with 

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:23.960
 your
