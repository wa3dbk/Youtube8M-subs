00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.170
 lee 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.370
 it 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.549
 the one who wants is that the penalties for a new commented video 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:11.899
 and today we are not 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:16.500
 on modern warfare 2 we are on black ops this black ice the game as any 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:17.210
 the world knows it 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.779
 I just love it 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.689
 this fiscal tightening yes 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.769
 it's a set of keys I do not appreciate at all 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.289
 children are in any case in the online mode 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.619
 I really find 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.130
 we do not have any unsatisfactory 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.680
 what I find he has 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.079
 I do not know I really can not hang with 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.320
 except that treyarch offered us a year 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.629
 a very bad game 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.810
 customers anyway 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.609
 no 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.750
 Following the medef 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.790
 it's called the weapons game mode 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.200
 today this video so I'm in my quest for weapons it was an ace 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.610
 matches in paris 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.180
 and they released a video january she realizes her clients and 17 years old 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.290
 it's true at a break 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.480
 their comments live 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.480
 but unfortunately I can not do it badly 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.770
 on the software his software 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.340
 so many big 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.730
 We have to do 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.730
 all the way here finally the singer another comment 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.390
 so here I like playing black ops relief 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.340
 the arm for the match model in paris 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.410
 but also for the zombie zombie mode but also the big return after 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.550
 after the first incident only five who he was really not bad bernard 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.980
 perrin matuidi nene who blake 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.610
 it's a pleasure we laugh because I like playing with stone 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.500
 with the British that I covered or folded 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.890
 that's really nice 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.950
 and specify on a map that I hate that's called being active 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.370
 I dare to believe I'm not sure we go over 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.180
 it only does you see this module persists actually not bad what does that 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.900
 everybody 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.900
 that is to say in edf laughs 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.949
 the character 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.370
 more we advance in the ideas in the trees 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.979
 and that's it and it goes on like that until before ten years later it's 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.379
 like a house 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.379
 cruel is echoing 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:32.599
 except that it's exactly the same and it's dany boon does not make you win 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.249
 experience 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:39.019
 but Thursday the Argentine the first nuclear file third and benoît 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.039
 cerexhe 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:43.499
 3 to the inverted the principle 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.409
 this weapons change at sheffield it's true that I'm very often at 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:47.859
 first in this game mode 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.659
 jean-marie land in general at the beginning i'm fourth about six 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.309
 sites I really have a lot of trouble at first and I catch up in the end the 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:57.719
 only problem is still 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:00.879
 and quickly hoped that blacksad lose then I knew it was necessary 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.879
 that I speak and share the rating really 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.219
 it's a choice 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.219
 he is especially the very arch thank you very much very hurry 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:13.739
 remove the annoying ones 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.939
 so it's super motivating the flashcodes I can not do more than say that 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.469
 but the world is so 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.859
 it is necessary that the sector as employee who is of course there is no password 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.289
 pro so 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:30.409
 so for that at 4 pm 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.150
 the ways I think back I thought of a something but I got back to 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.769
 colette duty 4 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.159
 in fact I bought this game 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.779
 posted to a friend if you buy who had bought at the same time as 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:43.409
 Merchant 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.879
 a year ago so and 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.329
 and for those women a lot play it because I was not very strong so 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.449
 clear 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:53.449
 I played very little and I still remained without their contribution of 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.089
 discs 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:56.949
 and it turns out that 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.829
 muller I'm elected I know atheist Buddhists as I was not 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.689
 very strong in infancy and not too hooked 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:02.539
 finishing 

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:05.780
 taken separately a pleasure that happened is incredible 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.419
 cqfd super good 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:09.910
 so you said in the name 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.469
 the sender penalty 40 to 3 shots between the flashcodes really 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:15.159
 in an incredible way 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.069
 many have been surprised by what I have right now 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.489
 left called n96 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.499
 new failure I skipped copé 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:28.189
 to do this as soon as it is still noticed a lot of quickly marked with this 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:29.319
 sport 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:31.749
 and the city silhouette 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:35.529
 the breeding estimates that 800 jobs and the licra as much as in 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:37.759
 we can say that in modern warfare 2 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.680
 I think it's huge just 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.639
 the corner half 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:44.789
 Caesar 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.659
 you watch France these lines the launchers 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:50.680
 so I told you then that adults 4 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.680
 it's enough just too much fun 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.569
 and percent 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:01.929
 to play with pride all the weapons all the weapons winon for example 

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:07.159
 minisite if a weapon that I can not stand in modern warfare 2 damage this 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:09.039
 rush north 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.639
 in this code 4 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.879
 when fc tablet nantes for me the guns are really not at that 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.759
 the least intoxicated not much in this village 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.759
 finally having said that we say that does not prevent that m 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.279
 perhaps 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:26.439
 these prices imprudence potato feest 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:29.339
 gilbert blanchard approach 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:30.689
 still 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:31.979
 there is 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.639
 lime trees the flamethrower who has paris I'm really a price called 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.469
 it must be said 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:40.620
 see I'm crossbow 5 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.960
 novelty that is frankly dispensable and here I am at 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.330
 the crossbow and the Africans who land and that's where I win 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.750
 when you see I'm done I ended up winning so for it's consists to 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.610
 present this video and I think I'll make you a next video 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.960
 commented on cod4 microsoft at this level of performance 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.509
 you may have to even offer gameplay on black ops goes 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:02.729
 content press 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.710
 in the meantime take care of yourself 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.110
 and I do not say that everything for him 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.539
 new video commented 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:09.719
 and I hope you will subscribe 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.169
 listen to the town halls of others rich enough
