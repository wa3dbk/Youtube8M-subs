arrows<00:00:52.920> storm<00:00:53.309> available<00:01:01.760> because<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:03.030> will

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
arrows storm available because it will

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.969

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.950 

but<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> thing<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.640> arrow<00:01:21.180> storm<00:01:21.630> will<00:01:21.810> not

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
kill all six of them at one time because

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.880 
kill all six of them at one time because
they're<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.410> they're<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.680> far

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
they're that because they're so far

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.420 
they're that because they're so far
apart<00:01:29.510> eros<00:01:30.510> storm<00:01:30.780> won't<00:01:31.020> kill<00:01:31.260> all<00:01:31.440> six<00:01:31.770> so

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
apart eros storm won't kill all six so

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.840
