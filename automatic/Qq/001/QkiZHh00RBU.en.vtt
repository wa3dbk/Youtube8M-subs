let's<00:00:41.690> go<00:00:41.870> down<00:00:42.020> again<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:42.440> target

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
let's go down again the target

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.640 
let's go down again the target
two-headed<00:00:43.340> roofs<00:00:43.490> we've<00:00:43.700> got

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
two-headed roofs we've got

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.310 
two-headed roofs we've got
all<00:00:45.220> right<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.520> 14

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
all right the 14

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.630 
all right the 14
we

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
we

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.540 
we
the<00:00:47.820> earth

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
the earth

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.080 
the earth
there<00:00:50.090> was<00:00:50.239> a<00:00:50.270> far<00:00:50.629> shot<00:00:50.960> group

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
there was a far shot group

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.680 
there was a far shot group
for<00:00:53.240> easier<00:00:53.870> to<00:00:53.960> learn

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.240 

an<00:00:57.200> 18-gauge<00:00:57.920> a<00:00:58.220> traditional<00:00:58.760> yards

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.330 

gave<00:01:01.790> us

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.930 

for<00:01:07.880> two<00:01:08.270> two<00:01:08.479> nine<00:01:08.950> four<00:01:09.950> five<00:01:10.159> shocking

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.310 

all<00:01:13.840> right<00:01:13.960> this<00:01:14.290> is<00:01:14.470> our<00:01:14.590> first<00:01:14.980> comparison

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
all right this is our first comparison

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.720 
all right this is our first comparison
five<00:01:18.750> pellet<00:01:19.750> shot<00:01:19.990> group<00:01:20.290> so<00:01:21.280> we<00:01:21.370> can<00:01:21.550> see

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
five pellet shot group so we can see

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.670 
five pellet shot group so we can see
this<00:01:21.940> is<00:01:22.920> 65<00:01:23.920> feet<00:01:24.660> so<00:01:25.660> this<00:01:25.930> is<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.140> little

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
this is 65 feet so this is a little

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.950 
this is 65 feet so this is a little
longer<00:01:27.340> than<00:01:28.500> 20<00:01:29.500> yards<00:01:29.920> actually<00:01:30.280> as<00:01:30.960> 21.6

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
longer than 20 yards actually as 21.6

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.260 
longer than 20 yards actually as 21.6
yards<00:01:33.660> as<00:01:34.660> we<00:01:34.960> walked<00:01:35.500> out<00:01:35.680> here<00:01:36.060> twenty<00:01:37.060> one

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
yards as we walked out here twenty one

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.130 
yards as we walked out here twenty one
point<00:01:37.600> six<00:01:37.690> yards<00:01:38.580> be<00:01:39.580> able<00:01:39.820> to<00:01:39.880> see<00:01:40.360> exactly

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
point six yards be able to see exactly

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.610 
point six yards be able to see exactly
not<00:01:41.710> taking<00:01:42.190> the<00:01:43.290> measurements<00:01:44.290> from<00:01:44.440> a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
not taking the measurements from a

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.190 
not taking the measurements from a
rangefinder<00:01:45.040> but<00:01:45.940> very<00:01:46.750> exact<00:01:47.740> and<00:01:48.100> precise

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
rangefinder but very exact and precise

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.800 
rangefinder but very exact and precise
measurements<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.970> we're<00:01:52.090> gonna<00:01:52.270> shoot<00:01:52.690> that

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
measurements so we're gonna shoot that

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.030 
measurements so we're gonna shoot that
group<00:01:53.110> here<00:01:53.430> at<00:01:54.430> twenty<00:01:54.790> one<00:01:54.820> point<00:01:55.450> six<00:01:56.040> yards

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
group here at twenty one point six yards

00:01:57.040 --> 00:04:23.170 
group here at twenty one point six yards
in<00:01:57.790> comparison

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.930 

that<00:04:24.180> was<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.409> five-shot<00:04:25.409> group<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:26.039> twenty<00:04:26.699> one

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
that was a five-shot group of twenty one

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.290 
that was a five-shot group of twenty one
point<00:04:27.330> six<00:04:27.599> yards<00:04:28.409> first<00:04:28.919> comparison<00:04:29.490> the

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
point six yards first comparison the

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.170 
point six yards first comparison the
next<00:04:30.659> two<00:04:30.810> comparisons<00:04:31.289> will<00:04:31.710> be<00:04:31.889> in<00:04:33.319> 50<00:04:34.319> yards

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
next two comparisons will be in 50 yards

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:43.460 
next two comparisons will be in 50 yards
60<00:04:36.180> yards<00:04:36.659> 40<00:04:37.500> yards<00:04:37.879> bring<00:04:38.879> it<00:04:39.000> on<00:04:42.319> I'm<00:04:43.319> gonna

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
60 yards 40 yards bring it on I'm gonna

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.300 
60 yards 40 yards bring it on I'm gonna
stop<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:43.889> video<00:04:44.039> while<00:04:44.550> go<00:04:44.789> get<00:04:44.970> the

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
stop the video while go get the

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.520 
stop the video while go get the
measuring<00:04:47.310> tools<00:04:48.180> so<00:04:48.960> we<00:04:49.080> can<00:04:49.259> get<00:04:49.379> an

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
measuring tools so we can get an

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.700 
measuring tools so we can get an
accurate<00:04:49.949> measurements<00:04:50.520> of<00:04:51.030> the<00:04:51.210> shuffle

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:42.910 

okay<00:04:55.710> I'm<00:04:55.919> back<00:04:56.159> with<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.870> measurements

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.610 

good<00:05:43.850> luck<00:05:44.030> it's<00:05:44.210> going<00:05:44.420> to<00:05:44.480> be<00:05:44.600> a<00:05:44.630> round<00:05:44.930> point

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
hundred and eighty thousand somewhere

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.600 
hundred and eighty thousand somewhere
around<00:06:08.240> there<00:06:08.720> and<00:06:09.410> you<00:06:09.500> see<00:06:09.650> if<00:06:09.770> I<00:06:09.890> can<00:06:10.070> find<00:06:10.430> a

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
around there and you see if I can find a

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
around there and you see if I can find a
die<00:06:10.820> from<00:06:11.410> measurement<00:06:12.410> purposes<00:06:13.330> so<00:06:14.330> we<00:06:14.360> see

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
die from measurement purposes so we see

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:22.480 
die from measurement purposes so we see
that<00:06:14.810> a<00:06:18.790> measurements<00:06:19.790> of<00:06:19.910> a<00:06:20.000> die<00:06:21.310> let's<00:06:22.310> see

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
that a measurements of a die let's see

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:30.850 
that a measurements of a die let's see
this<00:06:22.670> is<00:06:22.910> a<00:06:23.470> well<00:06:24.470> within<00:06:26.380> that<00:06:27.380> range<00:06:29.650> if<00:06:30.650> you

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
this is a well within that range if you

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.970 
this is a well within that range if you
ask<00:06:31.010> me<00:06:31.280> that's<00:06:31.460> that's<00:06:31.820> really<00:06:32.420> almost<00:06:33.110> a<00:06:33.620> one

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980 
ask me that's that's really almost a one

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.590 
ask me that's that's really almost a one
whole<00:06:34.280> group<00:06:35.170> almost<00:06:36.170> a<00:06:36.440> one<00:06:37.040> whole<00:06:37.460> group<00:06:37.880> at
