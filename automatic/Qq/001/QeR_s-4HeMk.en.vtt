00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.690
 yes 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.370
 all right 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.440
 a non wool keratin is not 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.420
 non- keratin wool keratin is a 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.429
 system capable of creating nano molecules 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.080
 keratin with greater power this 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.970
 technology allows to repair cracks 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.980
 in the hair in a more powerful way 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.540
 a molecule of non - keratin 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.939
 corresponds to one thousandth of a 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.740
 million of a keratin molecule how 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.939
 the nano keratin works 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.010
 procedure is very simple of 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.689
 explain when applying keratin on the hair 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.100
 the hands molecules penetrate the 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.809
 Hair pressures form less 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.790
 keratin deposits that help the 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.170
 Repair it when applying heat 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.790
 on them the procedure is fixed 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.860
 getting a better result 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.379
 it is recommended to brush the hair after 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.150
 of the app application steps 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.960
 the non-creatine to apply it no no 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.610
 keratin 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.680
 you have to follow several important steps 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.420
 the first is to wash the hair with a 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.549
 normal shampoo to eliminate society 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.470
 and the possible waste is not due 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:58.809
 use conditioner just rinse the 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.760
 hair after washing should be dried on 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.360
 hair just enough to remove the 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.760
 moisture then divided into four parts 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.350
 once done this is placed between 3 and 5 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.810
 milliliters of keratin in the container 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.640
 not to people is a small boat that 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.050
 it is placed in the machine that evaporates the 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.390
 keratin converting it 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.830
 no keratin then we apply the 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.830
 keratin while brushing the 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.680
 Hair is better to apply the nape 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.420
 must do slowly and smoothly a 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.980
 Once the application is finished, it should be 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.530
 iron all the hair with an iron 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.630
 for hair to divide the hair into 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.700
 four parts and add from 3 to 5 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.710
 milliliters of the fluid finish tea in the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.420
 same container in a sprinkler gio and 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.700
 spray again on the hair of 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.410
 the same way once the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.020
 previous step it is not necessary to go back to 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.250
 wash the wool non-keratin hair is a 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.230
 new system that helped the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.840
 capillary recovery and offering some 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.250
 amazing results its advantages 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.900
 are countless in the world of 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.940
 aesthetics it is a discovery 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.620
 very innovative that still does not take much 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.210
 time in the beauty market but 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.970
 that undoubtedly represents a breakthrough 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.950
 It is extremely effective and simple 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.810
 perform the realization of a 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.700
 nano keratin treatment will leave you 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.410
 the hair soft and silky at the same time 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.390
 repairs the fissures in the hair and 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.100
 split ends is especially 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.320
 effective in cases where the hair 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.810
 has suffered with dyes discolorations 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.910
 smoothed and permanent as well as in the 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.630
 cases that have been damaged by actions of 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.880
 nature 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.470
 as the wind rain the sun and so on 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.510
 the results can be seen 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.740
 practically the moment after 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.240
 have made the application of 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.280
 treatment that's why you 're 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.660
 becoming so popular this is a 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.910
 quick method but at the same time it is 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.910
 cash is one of the most 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.410
 profitable safe capillary recovery 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.330
 you wonder what the nano is 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.800
 keratinization is the process 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.480
 whereby nano introduced 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.490
 keratin molecules inside of 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.650
 the hair breaks serves to repair 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.120
 the hair is damaged this treatment is 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.680
 especially effective on hair 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.840
 Damaged by dyes or other processes 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.000
 chemistries the treatment of the nano 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.250
 Keratin lasts about 40 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.900
 minutes one of the advantages of the nano 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.550
 keratin is that being a procedure 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.290
 which is applied in spray mode 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.210
 allows a better introduction of the 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.070
 keratin in the hair fissures of 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.320
 this way the hair recovers more 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.600
 fast and better to be a wet process 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.830
 It also prevents dryness of the hair if 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.480
 are you thinking of submitting yourself to a 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.190
 safe non-keratin treatment 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.080
 what are you asking yourself for how long 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.700
 time the results last well 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.690
 once the treatment is done , 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.090
 hair will have been fixed 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.440
 definitely, however, if 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.150
 we continue to submit to the action of 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.790
 chemicals or expose it 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.310
 too much sun to rain etc this 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.959
 will be spoiled again if you wonder if 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.970
 you can apply the non- keratin of 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.790
 continuously the answer is 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.349
 definitely yes however the 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.420
 results will be more spectacular in 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.209
 the first session that will probably be 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.890
 where you have more hair then bathed 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.390
 go make transitions will help you 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.920
 to that the hair does not go spoiling with 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.230
 natural actions like the sun and the 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.819
 rain if you're pregnant so 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.739
 you can perform the treatment but 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.359
 You must wear a protective mask to 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.549
 do not inhale the keratin vapors 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.840
 It is also advisable that you use it in 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.629
 children who are going to submit to 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.190
 process people with dandruff or with 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.290
 hair problems can also 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.060
 undergo this process but you should 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.889
 keep in mind that nano keratin does not 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.870
 will help you with these problems because 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.260
 it only serves to fix the fissures and 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.260
 breaks
