00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.790
 change of political climate in France 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.190
 sharp warming towards russia 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.530
 Nicolas Sarkozy suddenly doing scandalous 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.700
 For the European Union, the statement calls for 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.940
 respect choice 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.100
 Crimean residents themselves chose Russia and 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.050
 we must respect this decision i don't 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.970
 I understand why some of us protect 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.279
 for example kosovo which has separated from 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.650
 Serbia and now accuse Putin 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.779
 And as for Ukraine, her calling 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.940
 remain a bridge between europe and 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.040
 Russia and not to join the European Union 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.350
 after tripartite meetings in the Kremlin 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.660
 the president of france called himself a friend 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.090
 Russia and stressed that he does not want 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.559
 Isolation of Moscow from the whole world is 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.600
 Russian behavior 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.059
 political scientists can be nothing but 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.010
 attempt to gain votes 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.469
 the presidential race started back in 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.780
 last year when the main 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.100
 candidates francois holland nicolas sarkozy 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.870
 and and marin le pen 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.239
 It is obvious that anti-Russian policy 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.859
 french government don't match 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.199
 with the mood of the electorate 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.670
 polls eloquently say most 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.229
 the French do not share the views 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.330
 European politicians 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.939
 Ukraine is of first interest 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.920
 turn for Russia they are for France so 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.290
 50 percent of respondents say 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.790
 only 19 percent stick 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.189
 opposite opinion 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.830
 less than half see Ukraine in NATO about 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.220
 that official paris is against too 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.960
 of this 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.360
 Francois Holland said the day before 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.829
 Friday's visit to Moscow however in 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.560
 Presidentâ€™s peacekeeping behavior 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.079
 say political scientists are nothing new we 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.689
 we see that the views of politicians have changed 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.610
 since nicolas sarkozy when allant 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.619
 became president two years ago he had 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.280
 there was a similar behavior like Nicolas 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.590
 sarkozy 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.509
 right at the beginning he was cold enough to 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.790
 Russia but then the attitude began 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.010
 improve 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.350
 mission of holland in Moscow experts 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.930
 compared with the efforts of Sarkozy to establish 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.820
 dialogue between russia and georgia in august 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.560
 2008 serious differences in 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.450
 Russia and France have appeared 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.790
 after olland announced the decision 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.860
 suspend the delivery of Russia 1 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.320
 Mistral-type helicopter carrier 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.970
 because of the situation in ukraine such an act 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.280
 nothing more than a curtsy before 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.990
 washington but this position considers 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.270
 french president gives paris 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.210
 opportunity to take initiatives in 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.070
 Ukrainian conflict survey key 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.170
 question on mistral in precisely because of 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.210
 that we suspended contracts in France 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.640
 have the opportunity to take a conciliatory 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.100
 position and not be pro-Russian side 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.730
 refusal to supply facilitates negotiations with 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.280
 Russia, however, and this position is extremely 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.260
 unpopular in France according to polls 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.660
 more than sixty percent french 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.730
 Do not support the delay Mistral if 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.890
 follow the election logic then and in 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.959
 this question the policy of france can 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.430
 swap angelica carriage soon
