 using my tutorials today in 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.949
 particular will go to make a 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.500
 pendant in the shape of a cross to make it me 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.980
 you need a big Swarovski head with 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:34.710
 reference 10 28 of 6 mm light formalities 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:38.030
 rose its bezel a hook for 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.030
 pendant like this 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:48.510

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.000
 rigid tacks in 925 silver 4 cm 5 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.050
 bicone swarovski crystals 6 mm in 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.079
 light rose shade with the suite in fa 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:03.050
 pony tips that first thing 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.050
 I insert two crystals on a nail 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.790
 the cardboard 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.460
 an additional crystal 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.960
 and explain the nail by 90 degrees 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:42.319
 but the wire about a centimeter from the 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:46.149
 crystal and with the pliers tips cones that 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.149
 only one needs to be realized 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.650
 before closing it, I insert the hook 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.650
 for pendant 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.830
 now I take the other tack 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.860
 I insert a crystal and go to 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.660
 insert it in the cast one 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.140
 perpendicular to the first violin 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.140
 added 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.980
 I'm going to put the bigwigs 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.490
 and close the clips 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:55.840
 now always on the same tack I go 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.990
 to insert the last remaining crystal e 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:12.520
 cut the nail about 3 mm from the set 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:14.080
 I go with the clean glue 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.800
 first of all to block the taste of 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.800
 hate open 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.049
 koprol ends with a shell 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:00.209
 and then I go to cover the pages of 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.209
 violins with as many shells 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.259
 this is our finished pendant 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.060
 I always wait for the glue to dry 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.949
 at least a dozen hours per year 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.199
 be sure that I take the maximum 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:47.940
 I hope you enjoyed the tutorial 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.940
