00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.729
 flour down and we start to lie down 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:09.390
 we have to make a rectangle enough 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:13.170
 stretched a little as is done for i 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:18.020

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.540
 I put a little in a bowl 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.650
 tomato puree this and basil 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.729
 and it is very fragrant and we put it upstream 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.090

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.090

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:47.060

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:53.030
 a little bit of salt and if we put it on 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.410
 on our dough and save as 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.670
 forming we are going to use the 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.910
 mozzarella cheese 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.340

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.130

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.110

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:32.050
