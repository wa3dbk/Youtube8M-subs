00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.480
 today we will learn to knit 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.590
 pearl pattern or as it is called in 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.830
 There are a lot of people here. 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.000
 the names of this pattern for this you need 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.980
 there will be threads and knitting needles 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.240
 the size of the needles will directly affect 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.240
 at the very size of pearls or drawings for 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.179
 to tie a pearl pattern to us 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.660
 need to type an odd number of loops 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:01:03.570
 let us collect 15 5 for clarity 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:01:07.250
 so 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 here 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.369
 we scored an odd number of 15 loops 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.799
 go directly to the first mating 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.729
 the loop as in all knits rented 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.119
 edge loop and then knit as we 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.540
 begin to knit English gum 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:29.210
 alternately front and back loop 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.210
 facial eyelet purl front 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:41.130
 purl facial purl and so on 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.540
 end of knitting, I remind you that 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.939
 last edge loop we always 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:52.100
 knit purl loop in order 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:56.100
 so that our drawing was with smooth edges 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.140
 after we tied the first row y 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.060
 we were such small here 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.020
 zor 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.729
 bears we turn mating and knit 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.869
 chess order 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.690
 not according to the drawing, that is, those loops that 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.400
 we were seamy we knit 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.940
 face the first loop as always rented 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:26.080
 knotting the back loop 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:31.790
 facial back again facial not on 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:35.500
 drawing me and completely loops which 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.530
 we were in the previous row 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:44.540
 so we knit with you until 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.610
 the end of the row me loop purl on 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.569
 facial and vice versa 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.319
 and the last loop as in each 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.830
 mating 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:03:00.890
 we knit purl loop 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:05.420
 turn the picture and the third row 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:08.150
 knit just as changing the purl loops 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.140
 I hung on my face 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.810
 12 row of pearl pattern look 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:19.849
 what a wonderful mating 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:22.159
 here these are about knit resemble rice 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.069
 so this pattern is frequent financial 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:28.430
 addresses you lakes their size will be 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:31.010
 depend on the thickness of the needles here we have pizza 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.180
 four and a half get such evil 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.489
 but I knit the work of us 53 exactly 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.250
 same pearl pattern as you see it 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.129
 It turns out slightly less whiskey from 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.530
 wounds therefore whichever 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.980
 do you want to knit clothes how thick 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:53.500
 you choose knitting needles and choose sahab 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.500
 knitting pattern
