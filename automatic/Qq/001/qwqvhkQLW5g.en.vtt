sit like that I don't know why they

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.460 
sit like that I don't know why they
couldn't<00:02:21.160> just<00:02:21.250> give<00:02:21.489> him<00:02:21.640> flat<00:02:21.879> feet<00:02:22.150> and

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
couldn't just give him flat feet and

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.949 
couldn't just give him flat feet and
have<00:02:23.470> them<00:02:23.680> sit<00:02:23.950> against<00:02:24.250> this<00:02:24.690> flat<00:02:25.690> instead

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
have them sit against this flat instead

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
for some dynamic design I guess

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.110 
for some dynamic design I guess
just<00:02:32.319> close<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.709> arms<00:02:32.980> up<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:33.790> have<00:02:33.970> him

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
frustrating anyway I'm so he does have

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.250 
frustrating anyway I'm so he does have
this<00:03:21.970> chainsaw<00:03:22.239> and<00:03:22.840> I've<00:03:23.049> seen<00:03:23.200> some

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
this chainsaw and I've seen some

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.990 
this chainsaw and I've seen some
pictures<00:03:23.530> where<00:03:23.769> people<00:03:24.459> have<00:03:24.580> it<00:03:24.700> stuck<00:03:24.880> out

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
pictures where people have it stuck out

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.090 
pictures where people have it stuck out
to<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.180> side<00:03:25.390> so<00:03:25.569> he<00:03:25.660> can<00:03:25.840> mow<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:26.620> down<00:03:26.769> while

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
to the side so he can mow you down while

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.289 
to the side so he can mow you down while
he's<00:03:27.280> driving<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:27.730> that's<00:03:27.850> kind<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.090> cool<00:03:28.209> I

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
he's driving and that's kind of cool I

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.050 
he's driving and that's kind of cool I
guess<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:29.709> then<00:03:30.190> this<00:03:30.280> kind<00:03:30.489> of<00:03:30.549> folds<00:03:30.819> up<00:03:30.940> and

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
guess and then this kind of folds up and

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.970 
guess and then this kind of folds up and
you<00:03:31.330> just<00:03:31.480> put<00:03:31.690> up<00:03:31.840> alongside<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.470> car<00:03:32.680> if<00:03:32.860> you

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
you just put up alongside the car if you

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.340 
you just put up alongside the car if you
don't<00:03:33.160> want<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:33.340> deployed<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:35.140> would<00:03:35.260> have

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
don't want it deployed it would have

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.770 
don't want it deployed it would have
been<00:03:35.380> nice<00:03:35.620> though<00:03:35.950> however<00:03:36.190> if<00:03:36.660> they<00:03:37.660> had

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
been nice though however if they had

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.050 
been nice though however if they had
found<00:03:37.959> a<00:03:38.140> way<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.290> make<00:03:38.560> this<00:03:38.850> fold<00:03:39.850> up

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
found a way to make this fold up

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.120 
found a way to make this fold up
underneath<00:03:40.359> the<00:03:40.630> car<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:41.049> guess<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.739> try<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:41.950> do

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
underneath the car I guess you try to do

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.920 
underneath the car I guess you try to do
that<00:03:42.250> but<00:03:42.519> then<00:03:42.579> it's<00:03:42.880> still<00:03:42.940> it's<00:03:43.660> going<00:03:43.870> to

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
that but then it's still it's going to

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.310 
that but then it's still it's going to
drag<00:03:44.170> so<00:03:45.450> we<00:03:46.450> need<00:03:46.660> to<00:03:46.720> think<00:03:46.810> of<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.019> found<00:03:47.230> a

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
drag so we need to think of the found a

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.349 
drag so we need to think of the found a
way<00:03:47.410> to<00:03:47.470> make<00:03:47.680> it<00:03:47.709> kind<00:03:47.950> of<00:03:48.070> just<00:03:48.940> like<00:03:49.030> this

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
way to make it kind of just like this

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.870 
way to make it kind of just like this
and<00:03:49.630> then<00:03:49.720> fold<00:03:49.959> up<00:03:50.140> you<00:03:50.920> know<00:03:51.070> like<00:03:51.250> this<00:03:51.700> way

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
and then fold up you know like this way

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.640 
and then fold up you know like this way
but<00:03:52.299> if<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:52.630> try<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.870> fold<00:03:53.109> it<00:03:53.260> down<00:03:53.380> like<00:03:53.620> a

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
but if you try to fold it down like a

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.770 
but if you try to fold it down like a
long<00:03:53.859> alongside<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.579> car<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:55.150> pops<00:03:55.510> right<00:03:55.660> out

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
long alongside the car it pops right out

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.949 
long alongside the car it pops right out
so<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:58.000> can<00:03:58.150> kind<00:03:58.359> of<00:03:58.390> fold<00:03:58.570> it<00:03:58.660> under<00:03:58.750> like

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
so you can kind of fold it under like

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.870 
so you can kind of fold it under like
