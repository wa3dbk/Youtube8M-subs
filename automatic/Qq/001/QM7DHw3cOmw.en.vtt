name for that wall out there if there is
let<00:02:54.440> me<00:02:54.560> know<00:02:54.650> in<00:02:54.740> the<00:02:54.770> comments<00:02:55.100> below<00:02:55.190> but

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
let me know in the comments below but

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.760 
let me know in the comments below but
either<00:02:56.150> way<00:02:56.420> we<00:02:56.660> get<00:02:56.750> another<00:02:57.050> home<00:02:57.260> run<00:02:57.410> here

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
either way we get another home run here

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.530 
either way we get another home run here
I<00:02:57.950> think<00:02:58.190> that's<00:02:58.280> our<00:02:58.460> second<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.180> episode

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
I think that's our second of the episode

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.390 
I think that's our second of the episode
so<00:03:00.110> we're<00:03:00.230> really<00:03:00.410> looking<00:03:00.620> good<00:03:00.920> in<00:03:01.040> terms<00:03:01.190> of

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
so we're really looking good in terms of

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.310

currently<00:05:31.630> so<00:05:31.960> there's<00:05:32.500> another<00:05:32.680> situation

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
currently so there's another situation

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:34.560 
currently so there's another situation
where<00:05:33.250> that<00:05:33.340> picture<00:05:33.699> had<00:05:33.820> a<00:05:33.849> very<00:05:34.180> slow

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
where that picture had a very slow

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.360 
where that picture had a very slow
stretch<00:05:34.990> from<00:05:35.110> ocean<00:05:35.409> so<00:05:35.830> we<00:05:35.919> ended<00:05:36.039> up<00:05:36.130> taking

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
stretch from ocean so we ended up taking

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.640 
stretch from ocean so we ended up taking

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
third easily there I were up in the

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.580 
third easily there I were up in the
bottom<00:05:39.009> of<00:05:39.070> the<00:05:39.159> eighth<00:05:39.840> 144<00:05:40.840> so<00:05:41.110> far<00:05:41.380> today

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
bottom of the eighth 144 so far today

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.860

724<00:05:42.370> score<00:05:42.669> we<00:05:43.120> end<00:05:43.240> up<00:05:43.330> taking<00:05:43.570> that<00:05:43.630> one<00:05:43.750> back

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
724 score we end up taking that one back

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.839 
724 score we end up taking that one back
up<00:05:44.020> the<00:05:44.110> middle<00:05:44.229> for<00:05:44.349> a<00:05:44.469> base<00:05:44.500> hit<00:05:44.680> so<00:05:45.400> this<00:05:45.820> is

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
up the middle for a base hit so this is

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:50.670 
up the middle for a base hit so this is
a<00:05:46.090> rematch<00:05:46.389> of<00:05:46.570> the<00:05:46.870> 2011<00:05:47.860> up<00:05:49.289> 2010<00:05:50.289> and<00:05:50.590> I'll

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
asst we're still kind of like an elite

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.399 
asst we're still kind of like an elite
team<00:06:00.550> and<00:06:01.030> this<00:06:01.659> was<00:06:01.810> that<00:06:01.960> was<00:06:02.080> the<00:06:02.169> year<00:06:02.259> the

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
they only made the playoffs like the

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.050 
they only made the playoffs like the
last<00:06:05.830> day<00:06:06.009> of<00:06:06.039> the<00:06:06.130> season<00:06:06.340> beating<00:06:06.849> out<00:06:07.030> the

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
there hopefully we can replicate that we

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.189 
there hopefully we can replicate that we
take<00:06:15.669> that<00:06:15.789> one<00:06:15.909> inside<00:06:16.270> we're<00:06:16.870> gonna<00:06:16.960> end<00:06:17.139> up

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 
take that one inside we're gonna end up

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.959 
take that one inside we're gonna end up
