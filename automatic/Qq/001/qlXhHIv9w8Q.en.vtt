 I decide to look for October 8th 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.480
 tsunamis do not generate revival a little lower konko medium average per 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.080
 imitate him and find me 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.420
 manifestations painless post blog position 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.780
 clearly paoul at work 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.810
 and decides to try to mask my mother 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.640
 ah hyperextended target skull product 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.370
 I have to use choice 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.450

 today I can make brown looool on line or on a strong hand like doing 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.300
 women 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.540
 because I say this because 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.470
 bennet let's remember with opponents in position tends to steal the empty plate 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.250
 to lose 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.770
 if it has nothing 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.790
 euronova an opportunity to extend the dish 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.570
 back to mind I have to take the initiative to start how to use 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.570
 the plate 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.570
 and I'm just to understand what the opponent is 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.370
 ready the dish click 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.050
 see in 5 I can put it they don't love people.com too much and sad and women 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.050
 or a ladder. the keynote will most probably build a pain 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.700
 alaska the author has color a4 get to 17 create an absolutely river card 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.590
 let's not change the shipments of the opponents 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.990
 Russian ready and it says dear 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.619
 hello for two reasons. first for winter induction 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.660
 let us remember that my conduct was rather weak 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.310
 secret plot better come back chri vera elau milano so it's very masked 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.370
 center for it would be a good problem affinity do 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.609
 does not seem true 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:29.989
 and supports and also and above all to take real value from the times that 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.989
 year is tresse or the scale 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.510
 let's say that the times I wear a bet 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.450
 that would have paid me with 7 or 8 for a friend then 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:46.019
 play in mind with think of the times when ready in dollars and works there 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.069
 scale has grown 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.770
 10 aiming at what a plate at this point 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.389
 we clearly have eggplant 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.889
 the problem is how much ryan star 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.639
 I think the biggest expectation we went by going from Latin 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.949
 language for several reasons 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:07.379
 even if a real dong shit 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.530
 let's say I was 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.109
 always on 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.879
 we won't straw sonreis well at all 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.129
 sean miller for 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.759
 the pc in mind let's say 10% of the time 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:24.979
 on literature and are present in asp while in cases where ascar beyond the 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:27.979
 dream of a let's say that in 90% of cases 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:30.249
 you pay in full stands 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:34.749
 because it is the umbria resort promotion or so if that is difficult 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:39.239
 he fought his hand let us remember that our conduct was very much 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.179
 weak 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.479
 where the only but I can have you heart 'm 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.479
 women 10 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:53.850
 woman10 because women 8 I tend to avoid it perca 2 8 me that woman 7 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.850
 would have made it known they come back with such a weak click 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.870
 then 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.129
 g site of institutions to go online 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.619
 and he almost calls 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:08.519
 had women heart remains with an absolute kicker 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.199
 clearly mmm a hand proposed with while aiming treat 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.999
 that he was holding a trap for us 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:21.859
 honestly you haven't been in him I would have played another way tomorrow 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.889
 first and foremost i would definately miller women took price not 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.800
 you can limp 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.819
 and I would highlight my tornado's tornado 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:40.199
 given that there were several ibm draws here a trio of women in Italy risks 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.860
 to pay a strong bet vampire 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:43.960
 arrived 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.420
 there is nothing closed any scale has a color 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.590
 p I never paid 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.260
 and especially 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.680
 it is probably not a pity to die laughing because he is good 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.680
 the competition department in this case and a half 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.279
 that is, it does not go beyond a pool in the third hand against 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:07.659
 pro a random opponent says is simply a weak trio and therefore 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:12.769
 clearly with my chikara only neighborhood montres coppi sad wants 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.979
 and this is because he knows he can be beaten by any scale of 1 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.840
 so it's a definite I would have clearly thought my own trieste very strong 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.969
 but with michelasso I would have done if I had made an impression 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:31.789
 I would have done a lot 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:36.169
 if in any case very doubtful of interim vaime I wouldn't know you were beaten 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.430
 so many situations of a second step assinet state tax we have 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:43.720
 forever 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.020
 scale against color scale. mass color 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.919
 they are all drawings 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.919
 there are some very important that appear some way important ebay uprisings 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:54.580
 to understand 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.550
 when it is time to maximize one's mental expectation 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.469
 asrok winning reid in Sardinian 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:05.469
 and therefore consequently our total tasks 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:10.209
 I hope I was clear it is all from Andrea Carini anyway anyway 

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:15.180
 I remain at your disposal for clarifications and your duplo hello ele. sim
