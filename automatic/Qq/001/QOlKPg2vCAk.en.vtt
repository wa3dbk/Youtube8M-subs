00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.049
 Hello UTB psycho artur and today 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.059
 we will be a vidosik poet raw 100 all 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.800
 cars that are in the hangar for me 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.410
 I make up each one 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.039
 the appointment is well justified but why 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.380
 she doesnâ€™t need a pumpman to pump out to 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.720
 moment just when he appeared here 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.300
 because when they appeared at all with m and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.430
 n t 10 level I already had a jagdigr 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.250
 accordingly, as soon as I realized that 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.380
 kitchen in vain, I circulated it to drop dead 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.890
 I thought the car but it was not very 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.969
 awesome so tiger he is good everyone yes 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.329
 that is, he is so full of himself 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.480
 historical everything but my style of play 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.930
 he doesn't quite fit here and how i would be 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.340
 Well, not that would be disappointed 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.070
 I didn't like it a bit in general on it 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.559
 play and when will the game master think 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.239
 Oh, not for nothing, I still pumped out here that is 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.140
 not just like that kind of car that will 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.870
 stand in the role 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.530
 exhibit and they are strong i something you 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.809
 swing on will ride something but 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.700
 then exactly when pulled out for the first time 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.740
 the panther began to roll him realized that it was 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.680
 roll out a little sandpaper on it 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.939
 because here is alfach 1000 there is such 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.860
 it is very difficult to play 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.100
 all the time how much does it cost me 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.740
 only 320 hangar like fights on it 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.020
 or a little more, that is, well, 300 something 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.549
 fights of everything on it spent good luck then this 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.250
 a little bit because i have cars 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.189
 which does not appear in the hangar and I 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.890
 just there for the first week and a half I can 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.960
 roll there 500 give them like this 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.450
 as already stands for years in my hangar and 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.060
 only 300 battles from time to time 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.640
 I do vidosiki on it because I want 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.420
 bring here is the salt of this car 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.119
 for an ordinary player who has 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.030
 the hangar of this car is not there 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.210
 meaning why download is that she can 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.189
 heal a wounded man 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.890
 in our game get the storage of the fifth 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.340
 the point is 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.320
 quite real here because the exhausts on 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.830
 Tanchiki think so now I performed 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.260
 lbz lt -15 our clock so easy yes 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.560
 think there 4000 light there I through 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.260
 the battle did it and that's it for 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.870
 months really burn from the same 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.230
 It obtained simply turns it 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.790
 master on some tanks trying to take 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.489
 here or just rolled out with introductory 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.470
 play and there I do not know a bunch of artillery and 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.450
 just does not go play all 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.450
 and it seems like I want to close already 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.989
 you think there is no well ka issued yak pantsyrev 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.290
 pain now 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.860
 I just avenged all I have to clarify for all 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.140
 all this suffering and just hurting 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.250
 to the enemy, that is, you give your pain 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:52.850
 and you get in return the treatment itself and 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.230
 such satisfaction is real here I am not 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.170
 I know what car can 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.040
 similar provide some say 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.920
 that here is a flash drive 183 type it can but here 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.970
 I do not agree because the flash drive is 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.110
 cardboard 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:12.019
 armor further now apnul the tower and now 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:16.730
 many garage here need to be compared 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:19.970
 floor we have century . and tail 83 floor type 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.459
 alternative what the fuck alternative 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.590
 seriously how can you even compare these 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.709
 machines are quite similar 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.519
 the only thing that somehow unites them 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.440
 This alpha guns with this flash drive 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.810
 Well, no matter how much it looks like alpha and 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.700
 because there for the most part everything 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.190
 will shoot cash bombs but 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.900
 adequate people in cad by the way can anyone 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.780
 it is now piling on her but 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.329
 it's still not something completely different 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.959
 the gameplay here gun really for sure and here 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:54.829
 well, you know, the diameter is 17 centimeters 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.480
 and with that barrel diameter she 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.739
 reasonably accurate so you can 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.170
 really for the integrity of some kind of illusion 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.810
 vulnerable point there is not just a silhouette 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:07.579
 Tank and really Katochk you goals there still 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:10.459
 something here in this battle was seen since i 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.390
 of 4 at first googled and just there 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.610
 torn well 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.100
 Of course, he himself is guilty, got ahead. 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.530
 but that's not the point 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.109
 comparing a jagdancer with other machines 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.450
 type alternatives here I do not see at all 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.250
 another alternative because but no 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.680
 really cars with good circular 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.840
 book at the same time and a circular 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.450
 but really his forehead is armor here I am not 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.160
 I know well, not much worse than the mouse 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.310
 Well, the principle is the same as the weave armor 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.080
 in fact, that's the way gun mask too 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.510
 closes almost the most part 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.640
 the upper part of the body most 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.400
 top part 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.590
 Well, you probably understand what he is now I 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.500
 came to capture and could complete this 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.660
 fight but decided to leave a little and 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.200
 shoot all the same when can I greedily and 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.020
 I only have 2500 on this car 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.450
 what is 2600 average I was thinking how can 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.240
 generally by car with an alder a thousand to keep 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:08.120
 such an average damage can be obtained 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.280
 if you shoot at the endless 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.870
 there is one video by the way where I tell 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.940
 about the fact that the Nak armor is fighting in 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.740
 who just have to shoot at 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.650
 shortages here just like evil 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.660
 and there are moments when all the same well 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.910
 it turns out to throw on the flora kim 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:27.110
 lads and this fight by the way is not 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:30.530
 exception here is no garlic ps4 shot 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.960
 there is already enough for 1200 to 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.220
 forget about all the drains about all the explosions there 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.830
 combat styling and stuff 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.260
 Now I will show you the actual layout 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.270
 now stopped many by this not 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.860
 use and generally never in one 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.690
 I haven't heard the video so that you have water 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.850
 any super stitched there 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.550
 Talked about this chip, I probably 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.130
 someone told in general you turn 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.830
 your tank as if overboard the enemy 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.630
 there is now i'm standing like y length 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.610
 companion 7 seriously i'm just and on 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.729
 capture and I turned away looking in 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.440
 wall but you have to do something like that 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:04.940
 but it is necessary to feel the car 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.729
 just understand how fast you are 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.530
 turn around here so that you have time 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:11.630
 dovernut to the moment when the opponent on 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.220
 will he see you turn on 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.250
 reproduction here I look at 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.990
 the enemy, that is, pressed the right button 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.259
 hold the trunk and look at the enemy 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.120
 now we are speed 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:28.220
 x 4 x 2 and here you look sharply 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.870
 I turn around and make a shock like this 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.849
 So 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:34.550
 that is, due to the fact that you are sort of 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:36.500
 turned away the enemy think that he 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.020
 you will be able to impunity and cause damage 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.090
 actually immediately sent to 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.789
 hangar because well it's such a guard 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.270
 it just happens , come on here baby 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:49.160
 here's a sweetie 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:52.130
 In general, I believe that those who do not have 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:55.340
 Jagdpantsser in hangar lose a certain 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:57.440
 such a highlight of this game is nothing to them 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.830
 treat yourself in moments when 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.630
 just there terribly merge and I bomb 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.990
 I think everyone should try this 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.490
 the car is not just there to roll out the test and 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.889
 poking around namely to her 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.780
 walk out from time to time 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:14.570
 Still, pumping to it is not the same 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.820
 sad i think to suffer on the game 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:19.699
 so that then like this to tank 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:22.039
 and distribute the alpha in a thousand it 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:24.349
 worth it thanks for watching 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:26.539
 if this video you liked and showed 

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:28.220
 with something useful put the class and 

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:32.830
 subscribe to my channel not to 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.830
 miss new vidosiki good luck to all
