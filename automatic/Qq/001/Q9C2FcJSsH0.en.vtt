you choose there'll be ten different

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.060 
you choose there'll be ten different
sections<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.359> numbers<00:00:28.349> 1<00:00:28.590> through<00:00:28.830> 10

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
sections so I have numbers 1 through 10

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.920 
sections so I have numbers 1 through 10
for<00:00:29.939> one<00:00:30.060> puzzle<00:00:30.510> numbers<00:00:30.779> 11<00:00:31.170> through<00:00:31.439> 20<00:00:32.930> for

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
for one puzzle numbers 11 through 20 for

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.580 
for one puzzle numbers 11 through 20 for
the<00:00:34.019> second<00:00:34.320> puzzle<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.950> then<00:00:35.070> 21<00:00:35.460> through<00:00:35.940> 30

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
the second puzzle and then 21 through 30

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.630 
the second puzzle and then 21 through 30
for<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.649> third<00:00:37.890> then<00:00:38.160> they<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.370> skip

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
for the third then they have skip

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.020 
for the third then they have skip
counting<00:00:38.969> by<00:00:39.149> fives<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.840> 100<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.559> it'll<00:00:40.739> be

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
counting by fives to 100 so it'll be

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.490 
counting by fives to 100 so it'll be
several<00:00:42.030> sections<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.079> then<00:00:43.260> skip

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
several sections of that and then skip

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.610 
several sections of that and then skip
counting<00:00:43.710> by<00:00:43.860> 10<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.850> 100<00:00:45.540> so<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.350> some

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
counting by 10 to 100 so you have some

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.889 
counting by 10 to 100 so you have some
choices<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.219> there<00:00:47.340> are<00:00:47.430> six<00:00:47.640> colors<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.450> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
sections on here and you would cut

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.900 
sections on here and you would cut
across<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.589> lines<00:01:04.830> after<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.369> laminate<00:01:05.820> it

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
across the lines after you laminate it

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.340 
across the lines after you laminate it
mine<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.240> not<00:01:06.390> laminated<00:01:06.900> because<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.170> didn't

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
mine is not laminated because I didn't

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.520 
mine is not laminated because I didn't
want<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> glare<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:09.260> camera<00:01:10.260> or<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
lights on here so I could show you

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.730 
lights on here so I could show you
better<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.450> puzzle<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.229> would<00:01:13.409> highly

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
better the puzzle but I would highly

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.890 
better the puzzle but I would highly
recommend<00:01:14.180> laminating<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> puzzle<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.780> then

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
recommend laminating the puzzle and then

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.710 
recommend laminating the puzzle and then
cutting<00:01:16.229> across<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.310> lines<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:18.090> our

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
cutting across the lines I do our

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.840 
cutting across the lines I do our
puzzles<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> cookie<00:01:19.920> sheet<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.369> has<00:01:20.580> been

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
puzzles on a cookie sheet that has been

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.730 
puzzles on a cookie sheet that has been
flipped<00:01:21.479> upside<00:01:21.840> down<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
flipped upside down so this is the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.499 
flipped upside down so this is the
bottom<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.310> then<00:01:23.460> at<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.759> top<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
bottom and then at the top and the

bottom of each of the ten pieces I have

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.420 
bottom of each of the ten pieces I have
a<00:01:27.360> magnet<00:01:27.840> attached<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.619> purchased<00:01:29.250> a

a magnet attached that I purchased a

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.640 
a magnet attached that I purchased a
self-adhesive<00:01:30.299> magnets<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.350> know<00:01:31.560> people

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650
