great
style-wise<00:02:33.879> I<00:02:34.239> think<00:02:34.750> this<00:02:34.870> is<00:02:35.049> super<00:02:35.379> stylish

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
it is a little on the heavy side I guess

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.800 
it is a little on the heavy side I guess
that<00:02:38.620> would<00:02:38.709> be<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:38.799> one<00:02:39.010> drawback<00:02:39.250> for<00:02:39.640> me

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
that would be the one drawback for me

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.520 
that would be the one drawback for me
it's<00:02:40.810> solid<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.439> if<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.310> like<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.489> tanto<00:02:43.000> blade

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
it's solid and if you like a tanto blade

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.420 
it's solid and if you like a tanto blade
this<00:02:44.530> is<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.709> great<00:02:44.950> option
