to<00:00:09.889> start<00:00:10.190> this<00:00:10.400> video<00:00:10.639> off<00:00:10.879> on<00:00:11.330> the<00:00:11.570> nucleus<00:00:12.080> I

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 
to start this video off on the nucleus I

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.470 
to start this video off on the nucleus I
thought<00:00:12.980> I'd<00:00:13.129> first<00:00:13.490> do<00:00:13.730> something<00:00:14.179> a<00:00:14.269> little

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
thought I'd first do something a little

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.810 
thought I'd first do something a little
bit<00:00:14.719> different<00:00:15.260> and<00:00:15.440> take<00:00:16.250> you<00:00:16.430> on<00:00:16.550> a<00:00:16.580> brief

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820

truth be told when I first sat down in
my<00:01:09.409> office<00:01:09.649> to<00:01:10.040> prepare<00:01:10.250> this<00:01:10.670> video<00:01:11.090> I<00:01:11.450> was

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
my office to prepare this video I was

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.380 
my office to prepare this video I was
kind<00:01:12.500> of<00:01:12.710> stuck<00:01:13.040> for<00:01:13.280> ideas<00:01:13.310> about<00:01:14.060> how<00:01:14.360> to

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
kind of stuck for ideas about how to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.360 
kind of stuck for ideas about how to
describe<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.200> structure<00:01:15.680> and<00:01:15.830> function<00:01:16.340> of

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
describe the structure and function of

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.990 
describe the structure and function of
the<00:01:16.729> nucleus<00:01:17.710> but<00:01:18.710> then<00:01:18.890> looking<00:01:19.460> around<00:01:19.580> my

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
the nucleus but then looking around my

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.530 
the nucleus but then looking around my
office<00:01:20.180> it<00:01:20.600> dawned<00:01:20.960> on<00:01:21.229> me<00:01:21.290> in<00:01:21.860> many<00:01:22.760> ways<00:01:23.030> my

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:31.769 
in the nucleus the nucleolus is the site
of<00:05:25.659> ribosomal<00:05:26.589> RNA<00:05:27.309> or<00:05:27.610> rRNA<00:05:29.189> synthesis<00:05:30.779> the

of ribosomal RNA or rRNA synthesis the

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:34.619 
of ribosomal RNA or rRNA synthesis the
nucleolus<00:05:32.439> also<00:05:33.099> assembles<00:05:33.759> ribosomal

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:34.629 
nucleolus also assembles ribosomal

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:39.389 
nucleolus also assembles ribosomal

later on this week I'll describe how
proteins<00:05:42.939> are<00:05:43.149> made<00:05:43.389> and<00:05:43.719> discuss<00:05:44.709> the<00:05:44.919> role

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:45.129 
proteins are made and discuss the role

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.649 
proteins are made and discuss the role
of<00:05:45.240> ribosomal<00:05:46.240> RNA<00:05:46.779> in<00:05:47.050> more<00:05:47.439> detail<00:05:48.659> next

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:49.659

let's<00:05:50.259> look<00:05:50.469> at<00:05:50.589> the<00:05:50.800> nucleoplasm<00:05:53.519> the

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:54.519 
let's look at the nucleoplasm the

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:57.119 
let's look at the nucleoplasm the
nucleoplasm<00:05:55.029> is<00:05:55.599> basically<00:05:56.259> everything<00:05:56.919> else

00:05:57.119 --> 00:05:57.129 
nucleoplasm is basically everything else

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:59.759 
nucleoplasm is basically everything else
in<00:05:57.339> the<00:05:57.459> nucleus<00:05:57.969> that<00:05:58.330> isn't<00:05:58.899> chromatin<00:05:59.559> or

00:05:59.759 --> 00:05:59.769 
in the nucleus that isn't chromatin or

00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:03.719 
in the nucleus that isn't chromatin or
the<00:06:00.039> nucleolus<00:06:01.289> most<00:06:02.289> of<00:06:02.529> the<00:06:02.649> nucleoplasm<00:06:03.129> is

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
the nucleolus most of the nucleoplasm is

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.149 
the nucleolus most of the nucleoplasm is
composed<00:06:04.240> of<00:06:04.509> a<00:06:04.599> network<00:06:05.139> of<00:06:05.349> very<00:06:05.769> fine

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.159 
composed of a network of very fine

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:08.879 
composed of a network of very fine
filaments<00:06:06.969> which<00:06:07.719> provides<00:06:08.199> structural

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
filaments which provides structural

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:11.639 
filaments which provides structural
support<00:06:09.039> to<00:06:09.789> the<00:06:09.909> nucleus<00:06:10.419> so<00:06:10.719> that<00:06:11.379> it<00:06:11.469> can

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:11.649 
support to the nucleus so that it can

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:15.360 
support to the nucleus so that it can
maintain<00:06:11.889> its<00:06:12.519> shape<00:06:12.639> and<00:06:13.919> finally<00:06:14.919> we<00:06:15.159> have

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
maintain its shape and finally we have

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.239 
maintain its shape and finally we have
the<00:06:15.550> nuclear<00:06:16.029> envelope<00:06:16.680> the<00:06:17.680> nucleus<00:06:18.219> just

the nuclear envelope the nucleus just

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:20.879 
the nuclear envelope the nucleus just

with a very thin space in between there

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:41.219 
with a very thin space in between there
are<00:06:38.379> small<00:06:38.769> pores<00:06:39.249> or<00:06:39.759> holes<00:06:40.149> within<00:06:40.990> the

are small pores or holes within the
nuclear<00:06:41.680> envelope<00:06:41.969> called

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
nuclear envelope called

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.170 
nuclear envelope called
nuclear<00:06:43.689> pores<00:06:44.339> the<00:06:45.339> function<00:06:45.879> of<00:06:46.060> the

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
nuclear pores the function of the

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.420 
nuclear pores the function of the
nuclear<00:06:46.629> pores<00:06:47.019> is<00:06:47.409> to<00:06:47.680> regulate<00:06:48.249> the

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 
nuclear pores is to regulate the

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.830 
nuclear pores is to regulate the
transport<00:06:49.180> of<00:06:49.269> material

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840
