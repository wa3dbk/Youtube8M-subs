00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:16.550
 Cycling to work without sweating that was for many so far 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.769
 Unthinkable with an electric bike that is quite different as soon as you get into the 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:22.630
 Pedals occurs 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.939
 An electric motor turns on a point which boosts power output 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.369
 Incidentally, the electric bicycle is actually called a pedelec 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.359
 abbreviation 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:35.359
 for Pedro in wartime Corp 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.980
 there what can they say what is the big difference between 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.210
 where a bicycle and a conventional bicycle are placed 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.280
 yes as the word electric bike says the Gap at pouring 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.650
 but electric bike equipped with motor 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.680
 supports pedaling power close to the driver 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.320
 and, of course, is quite interesting for a target audience and for example 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.320
 for professionals who want to cycle to work 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.800
 but for older people who can not move like that anymore 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.100
 Need support 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.100
 certainly interesting target groups for the TuS come into question, it said 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:10.880
 Phil 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.700
 The batteries of the SPD Lex have a charging time of about three hours 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.159
 the range depends on how strong the SG Wildeck riders bring themselves 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.619
 the guide values ​​are between 40 and 50 kilometers 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.800
 People Express are motorized but registration-free driving 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.970
 Sensors measure the pedaling force and the electronics automatically control the pedaling force 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.689
 Increase of balancing power 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.740
 through the team leader up to a speed of 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.320
 20 kilometers per hour 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.580
 Anyone who values ​​a pedelec has the same rights and obligations as a cyclist 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.870
 and if I now want to lay his driver with electric bike 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.490
 what costs should I expect there 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.950
 yes the cost is Ziercke if you have a good bike editor 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.110
 like z like the great quality differences 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.810
 Husband price range between 1200 and Euro know 2000 euros in the range 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.769
 you should expect 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.199
 what does the future of electric bikes Knauss looks like? 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:13.879
 because this sector in Beijing 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.489
 yes, I think that this sector has great potential, especially in the 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.140
 City but also in the rural area even for the highest lurked the mobile 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.479
 want to stay 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.789
 and just want to do their shopping 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:27.789
 and so I think that it has a lot of potential 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:33.319
 Wikileaks 7 promising the shipping movement shortage 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.349
 and sometimes a real alternative to the car 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:41.999
 Incidentally, since the first of September also promotes the in Beaver Creek 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:43.499
 Linen SPD Lex 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.220
 Premium customers received 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.920
