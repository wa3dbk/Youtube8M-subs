this on my twist if I wanted to sort of
give<00:06:51.700> it<00:06:51.820> like<00:06:51.940> a<00:06:51.970> little<00:06:52.300> bit<00:06:52.390> of<00:06:52.510> moisture<00:06:52.660> I

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140 
give it like a little bit of moisture I

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.930 
give it like a little bit of moisture I
didn't<00:06:53.560> put<00:06:53.680> anything<00:06:54.070> over<00:06:54.370> this<00:06:54.670> so<00:06:54.850> it's

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
didn't put anything over this so it's

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.490 
didn't put anything over this so it's
not<00:06:55.000> like<00:06:55.150> I<00:06:55.210> put<00:06:55.420> a<00:06:55.450> butter<00:06:55.720> on<00:06:55.960> and<00:06:56.200> my<00:06:56.290> hair

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
not like I put a butter on and my hair

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.540 
not like I put a butter on and my hair
so<00:06:56.920> feels<00:06:57.190> really<00:06:57.910> soft<00:06:58.240> so<00:06:58.930> so<00:06:59.920> far<00:07:00.100> so<00:07:00.160> good

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
so feels really soft so so far so good

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.570 
so feels really soft so so far so good
if<00:07:01.390> this<00:07:01.780> works<00:07:02.290> I<00:07:02.530> would<00:07:02.890> keep<00:07:03.070> using<00:07:03.310> it

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
if this works I would keep using it

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.220 
if this works I would keep using it
because<00:07:03.760> of<00:07:03.970> the<00:07:04.090> soap<00:07:04.420> protein<00:07:04.870> i<00:07:04.960> don't<00:07:05.110> know

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.230 
because of the soap protein i don't know

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:14.320 
because of the soap protein i don't know
if<00:07:05.290> i<00:07:05.380> would<00:07:05.440> use<00:07:05.710> it<00:07:05.860> every<00:07:06.070> day

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.330 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.200 

you

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.210 
you

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.120 
you
I<00:07:16.330> really<00:07:17.110> think<00:07:17.259> it<00:07:17.410> does<00:07:17.590> give<00:07:17.800> it<00:07:17.919> a<00:07:17.979> little

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.130 
I really think it does give it a little

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.070 
I really think it does give it a little
bit<00:07:18.280> of<00:07:18.370> shine<00:07:18.520> but<00:07:19.000> I<00:07:19.240> don't<00:07:19.630> know<00:07:19.870> if<00:07:19.900> it's

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 
bit of shine but I don't know if it's

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.570
