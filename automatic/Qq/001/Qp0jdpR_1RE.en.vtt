 I like this one and I also like Otaru and that always 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:10.740
 It seems like I'm going to put on a stand with a dj booth 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:15.070
 If you notice something, you can eat it 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.260

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.800
 In How Well 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:26.310
 The band feels like this 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:32.840
 Well a little bit here in the head part 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:38.100
 It is made of fluffy material so that it does not hit 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:40.230
 This is cool yes this logo of denon dj is 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:46.500
 Yes 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:47.090
 It's a stunned glow, it's a metal chrome-like feeling . 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.109
 Yes 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.109
 feel like chrome 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.909
 When folding in 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.740
 Well like this 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:03.060
 Easy to build 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:08.350
 Quite that in Tsu It is after the headphone in 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:11.520
 Bet that here why Yes I think I or broken 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:15.510
 or the like do the dj 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.020
 I am not gonna do this but I'm doing by everyone somehow 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.290
 I 'm going to stretch a little 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.349
 I guess you're doing this 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.300
 In this way 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.390
 In doing this 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:31.280
 Also in against meeting with and it will ne short one ear and go 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.280
 Raw sugar and right ear 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.909
 When I hear the sound outside 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:41.610
 In this as it is fixed to the current picture book as it is 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:45.920
 I will try to take it as it is 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.920
 I will be like this 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.310
 I think you have quite entered this 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.580
 So how 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.310
 here 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.310
 Is best seen amazing it means tension is applied 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:04.320
 Something 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:06.800
 Pretty I'd but it is often I bookkeeping in that over Tamar and bought immediately broken up Tet Iun 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.569
 It is I and is under load in Dari it 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:15.180
 I mean 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:20.760
 It is here that Edon hp 700 of denon dj enters here 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:24.920
 Accident of the sides I'm overwhelmingly less we have that contains iron 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:30.280
 That's fine dj head tax as headphones 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.280
 It is a feeling that it may be good as a proud point 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.410
 I feel called 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.950
 Did Ja' 8 von But of course from the beginning 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.950
 About 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.230
 To do 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.960
 Seram 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.840
 Also become 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.910
 It means that 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:57.600
 Beep or Let's hear the news of the seasonal pattern 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:04:00.950
 Of course, it is a feeling that the price is 10,000 yen a little darker 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.950
 I just insist on you 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:08.050
 It's been a while ago, not Denon denon dj 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.860
 headphones from the denon brand 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.629
 It is to gulp 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.690
 Ten 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:19.329
 There is a tongue that in Fitch Toka to 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:24.789
 No Masuyo I like to do anything even above I review video 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:30.790
 The clay that did the review everything to come sent a total of Seriously If you wait too long and blurted out or mow mow 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:34.040
 But say part I think in the roots reminded me I remember it 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.510
 I feel like I've put it on my neck 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.070
 What 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.800
 It is not visible on your own 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.639
 In in Well 8 one ear 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.479
 Well, when it is 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.479
 Such feeling 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.860
 It is in a place that is put 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:00.400
 How about being 8 pretty dj 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:05.310
 A person who practices 3 hours and 4 hours before marriage 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.810
 And he will not hurt his ears if this tightness is strong 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.190
 that 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:14.129
 Why do you think that this pretty tight point is so important 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:19.800
 Well, in the case of 700 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:23.449
 Yes it is that Tsuyokara not a good does not change and outstanding Anbai 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.230
 I feel called Naa is good amazing balance 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.320
 I hear that it is abolition 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:33.460
 Hey that 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.460
 I listen to a wide band song intentionally to make it easy to continue the performance 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.700
 I do not understand 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.660
 It is 8 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:55.120
 For now 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:56.140
 I know I know I've been selling it for a long time, but I know it again 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.680
 But 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:02.660
 Very much 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:06.249
 From wide area attention from television 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.240
 There is no place that was fun that really 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:09.480
 serious 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.880
 I mean 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:19.700
 I feel that there is no unreasonable 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:21.980
 It's strange to say that from a wide area from caution to regular 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.200
 Well or rather tune-up 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.480
 Toka or went Press personality with 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.800
 I think I'm doing 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.139
 It is basically 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.600
 And a flat feeling 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.190
 However 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.190
 Just a little bit 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:43.660
 How good 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:48.449
 I also feel mellow 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.800
 In short the headphones just like the problem 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:54.150
 Not 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.340
 No wonder headphones in dj for dance music 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.220
 Ryonan duck 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:04.550
 In fact this that I feel seen 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:08.900
 Where in the school are you already using for about 3 years at the dj booth ? 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:13.580
 About three years I feel much like this is gone or occasionally degrees 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:17.630
 Basic This is I'd or changed to house arrangement 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:22.390
 Say In short this in doing good in this other or the other complain say that there is no 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:27.170
 If there is a feeling do not anyway this is bored 

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:30.580
 If you say that there is no personality, there is also no personality 

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.580
 In everyday use 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:39.870
 That you really good headphones also something the day of to no problem s 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:42.129
 Again to Fu that after all Do not there just are selling 

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:46.160
 Reconfirmed 

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:49.460
 It looks like the denon dj's 700 

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:53.249
 Well headphones of the class of around 3000 4000 yen 5000 yen 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.180
 Yes I guess this is how people something is you are using 

00:07:53.249 --> 00:07:58.639
 By say 

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.639
 denon diesel hp was 7 minutes
