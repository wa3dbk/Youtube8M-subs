at what else is in the box this here is

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.709 
at what else is in the box this here is
the<00:01:54.570> new<00:01:54.840> earpods<00:01:55.259> took<00:01:56.189> Apple<00:01:56.579> 23<00:01:57.210> years<00:01:57.420> to

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
the new earpods took Apple 23 years to

the new earpods took Apple 23 years to
develop<00:01:58.700> let's<00:01:59.700> pick<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.969> sign<00:02:00.270> come<00:02:00.509> back<00:02:00.659> to

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
develop let's pick a sign come back to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.709 
develop let's pick a sign come back to
it<00:02:00.899> later<00:02:01.070> this<00:02:02.070> year<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.820> may<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.540> already

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
it later this year you may have already

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.040 
it later this year you may have already
seen<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.860> charger<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.630> of<00:02:06.630> course<00:02:07.039> the<00:02:08.039> you

faster than the 30-pin connector but as
I've<00:02:28.860> already<00:02:29.160> mentioned<00:02:29.280> it's<00:02:29.940> more<00:02:30.210> durable

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
I've already mentioned it's more durable
