I knew where these precincts came from

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.920 
I knew where these precincts came from
if<00:04:45.400> they<00:04:45.520> were<00:04:45.610> general<00:04:46.000> statewide<00:04:46.270> I'd<00:04:46.690> say

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
if they were general statewide I'd say

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.480 
if they were general statewide I'd say
definitely<00:04:47.140> I<00:04:47.470> have<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.740> feeling<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.250> great

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
definitely I have a feeling the great

so<00:04:52.300> you<00:04:52.360> think<00:04:52.600> that<00:04:52.750> it's<00:04:53.200> not<00:04:53.290> too

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
so you think that it's not too

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.750 
so you think that it's not too

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.490 
significant for Humphrey at this point
well<00:04:54.910> I<00:04:54.940> think<00:04:55.120> it<00:04:55.390> it's<00:04:55.840> certainly<00:04:55.960> not<00:04:56.290> good

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
well I think it it's certainly not good

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.800 
well I think it it's certainly not good
but<00:04:56.800> it's<00:04:56.950> not<00:04:57.160> fatal<00:04:57.760> if<00:04:58.330> all<00:04:58.510> of<00:04:58.630> these<00:04:58.750> are

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
but it's not fatal if all of these are
