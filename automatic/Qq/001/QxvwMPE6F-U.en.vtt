00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.870 

mind<00:05:21.610> into<00:05:22.270> left<00:05:22.480> scenter<00:05:22.810> and<00:05:23.500> that<00:05:24.280> is<00:05:24.580> going

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
mind into left scenter and that is going

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:33.049 
mind into left scenter and that is going
to<00:05:24.940> be<00:05:25.030> a<00:05:25.060> base<00:05:25.300> hit

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:33.059 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:35.429 

well<00:05:34.059> a<00:05:34.090> lot<00:05:34.389> of<00:05:34.419> switch<00:05:34.719> hitters<00:05:35.020> like<00:05:35.169> to<00:05:35.289> use

00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:35.439 
well a lot of switch hitters like to use

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.019 
well a lot of switch hitters like to use
the<00:05:35.620> whole<00:05:35.770> field<00:05:35.800> and<00:05:36.340> this<00:05:36.580> guy's<00:05:36.819> no

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:37.029 
the whole field and this guy's no

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.619 
the whole field and this guy's no
different

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:37.629 
different

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.149 
different
he<00:05:37.779> just<00:05:37.930> sprays<00:05:38.319> this<00:05:38.559> thing<00:05:38.740> the<00:05:38.860> other<00:05:39.009> way

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
he just sprays this thing the other way

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:50.380 
he just sprays this thing the other way
and<00:05:39.279> he's<00:05:39.400> got<00:05:39.610> himself<00:05:39.759> a<00:05:40.029> one-out<00:05:40.330> single

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.120 

so<00:05:51.390> we<00:05:51.510> runner<00:05:51.720> at<00:05:51.900> first<00:05:52.170> with<00:05:52.380> one<00:05:52.620> man<00:05:52.830> gone

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
so we runner at first with one man gone

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.340 
so we runner at first with one man gone
and<00:05:53.670> here's<00:05:53.850> the<00:05:54.000> ever<00:05:54.210> dangerous<00:05:54.540> Carlos

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
and here's the ever dangerous Carlos

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:07.720 
and here's the ever dangerous Carlos
Beltran

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.370 

can<00:06:08.730> you<00:06:08.850> look<00:06:09.030> at<00:06:09.210> a<00:06:09.300> fastball<00:06:09.540> that<00:06:09.990> doesn't

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
can you look at a fastball that doesn't

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.680 
can you look at a fastball that doesn't
miss<00:06:10.530> by<00:06:10.740> a<00:06:10.770> whole<00:06:11.010> lot<00:06:11.280> it's<00:06:11.550> one<00:06:11.820> a<00:06:11.850> no<00:06:12.060> and

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
miss by a whole lot it's one a no and

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.000 
miss by a whole lot it's one a no and
when<00:06:12.810> you<00:06:12.900> need<00:06:13.050> to<00:06:13.140> double<00:06:13.290> play<00:06:13.560> ball<00:06:13.770> I

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
when you need to double play ball I

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.500 
when you need to double play ball I
don't<00:06:14.340> see<00:06:14.460> the<00:06:14.550> logic<00:06:14.700> of<00:06:14.940> working<00:06:15.210> this<00:06:15.300> guy

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
don't see the logic of working this guy

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:16.720 
don't see the logic of working this guy
up<00:06:15.690> in<00:06:15.840> the<00:06:15.930> zone

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730 
up in the zone

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:24.840 
up in the zone
runner<00:06:17.730> at<00:06:17.820> first<00:06:17.970> year<00:06:18.480> one<00:06:18.690> man<00:06:18.930> out

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.550 

now<00:06:25.850> a<00:06:25.880> double<00:06:26.389> play<00:06:26.419> ball<00:06:26.840> here<00:06:27.050> is<00:06:27.229> this<00:06:27.380> is

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
now a double play ball here is this is

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.100 
now a double play ball here is this is
on<00:06:27.740> the<00:06:27.860> ground<00:06:28.130> to<00:06:28.280> third<00:06:28.570> throw<00:06:29.570> onto<00:06:29.780> Huff

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
on the ground to third throw onto Huff

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:41.530 
on the ground to third throw onto Huff
now<00:06:30.320> and<00:06:30.560> there<00:06:30.650> are<00:06:30.740> two<00:06:30.949> down

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.690 

so<00:06:42.200> a<00:06:42.230> runner<00:06:42.440> in<00:06:42.620> scoring<00:06:42.650> position<00:06:43.490> with<00:06:43.520> two

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
so a runner in scoring position with two

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.060 
so a runner in scoring position with two
men<00:06:44.060> gone<00:06:44.300> and<00:06:44.690> standing<00:06:45.410> in<00:06:45.530> is<00:06:45.650> one<00:06:45.860> of<00:06:46.010> the

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
men gone and standing in is one of the

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.010 
men gone and standing in is one of the
best<00:06:46.280> young<00:06:46.520> hitters<00:06:46.910> in<00:06:47.120> the<00:06:47.210> game<00:06:47.240> David

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
best young hitters in the game David

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:59.520 
best young hitters in the game David
Wright

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.310 

and<00:07:00.280> now<00:07:00.520> here's<00:07:00.760> a<00:07:00.850> ball<00:07:01.000> grounded<00:07:01.660> foul<00:07:01.960> over

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320 
and now here's a ball grounded foul over

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:13.149 
and now here's a ball grounded foul over
toward<00:07:02.710> third

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:13.159 

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:16.329 

and<00:07:13.849> this<00:07:14.270> is<00:07:14.479> like<00:07:14.749> past<00:07:15.110> Molina<00:07:15.800> and<00:07:15.919> back<00:07:16.129> to

00:07:16.329 --> 00:07:16.339 
and this is like past Molina and back to

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:19.300 
and this is like past Molina and back to
the<00:07:16.459> screen

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.310 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:27.040 

but<00:07:20.310> surprisingly<00:07:21.030> no<00:07:21.270> advance<00:07:21.630> here

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.050 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.680 

fooled<00:07:27.650> them<00:07:27.889> badly<00:07:28.190> there<00:07:28.639> I<00:07:28.669> mean<00:07:29.030> badly

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:29.690 
fooled them badly there I mean badly

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.469 
fooled them badly there I mean badly
it's<00:07:30.020> one<00:07:30.379> and<00:07:30.530> two<00:07:31.000> that<00:07:32.000> look<00:07:32.150> like<00:07:32.240> one<00:07:32.449> of

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 
it's one and two that look like one of

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:38.469 
it's one and two that look like one of
Dave's<00:07:32.780> golf<00:07:33.080> swings<00:07:33.409> there

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:41.350 

and<00:07:38.960> breaking<00:07:39.889> ball<00:07:40.099> swung<00:07:40.400> on<00:07:40.729> and<00:07:40.939> missed<00:07:41.150> on

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 
and breaking ball swung on and missed on

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.300 
and breaking ball swung on and missed on
the<00:07:41.389> side<00:07:41.719> is<00:07:41.930> retired

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:44.310 

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.370 

so<00:07:44.790> they<00:07:44.910> get<00:07:45.060> a<00:07:45.120> man<00:07:45.360> to<00:07:45.510> second<00:07:46.020> here<00:07:46.170> in<00:07:46.290> the

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.380 
so they get a man to second here in the

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.980 
so they get a man to second here in the
top<00:07:46.620> half<00:07:46.920> but<00:07:47.220> he's<00:07:47.340> stranded<00:07:48.000> there<00:07:48.240> now

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:48.990 
top half but he's stranded there now

00:07:48.990 --> 00:08:00.270 
top half but he's stranded there now
it'll<00:07:49.320> be<00:07:49.350> the<00:07:49.440> Giants<00:07:50.040> turn<00:07:50.280> no<00:07:50.820> school

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.280 

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.340 

you
