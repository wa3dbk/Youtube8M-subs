last one connects the second headphone

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.630 
last one connects the second headphone
port<00:02:32.989> because<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.680> have<00:02:33.890> two<00:02:34.099> headphone<00:02:34.400> port

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
port because I have two headphone port

you<00:02:37.879> can<00:02:38.030> buy<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.180> splitter<00:02:38.599> like<00:02:38.780> this<00:02:38.959> on<00:02:39.079> eBay

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
you can buy a splitter like this on eBay

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.289 
you can buy a splitter like this on eBay
for<00:02:39.379> like<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.709> dollar<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:40.579> know<00:02:41.030> but<00:02:41.209> it

doesn't<00:02:41.900> come<00:02:42.019> with<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:43.299> it<00:02:44.299> just<00:02:44.510> comes

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
doesn't come with that it just comes

with the two rear to front speakers
Center<00:02:48.650> subwoofer<00:02:49.599> and<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:51.260> remote<00:02:51.650> control

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
and it also comes to one other cable

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.490 
and it also comes to one other cable
it's<00:02:55.129> really<00:02:55.760> unnecessary<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.780> comes<00:02:57.019> with<00:02:57.260> um

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
it's really unnecessary it comes with um

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.849 
it's really unnecessary it comes with um
a<00:02:57.829> left<00:02:58.819> and<00:02:59.030> right<00:02:59.239> or<00:02:59.510> red<00:03:00.379> and<00:03:00.530> white<00:03:02.859> female

to a audio out female um cable

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.550 
to a audio out female um cable
I<00:03:11.060> guess<00:03:11.480> just<00:03:11.840> for<00:03:11.930> extension<00:03:12.410> or<00:03:12.530> something

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
I guess just for extension or something

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.330 
I guess just for extension or something
but<00:03:12.980> um<00:03:13.780> yeah<00:03:14.780> so<00:03:14.810> that's<00:03:15.620> that's<00:03:16.010> what<00:03:16.220> the

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
but um yeah so that's that's what the

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.610 
but um yeah so that's that's what the
back<00:03:16.459> of<00:03:16.609> it<00:03:16.730> looks<00:03:16.760> like<00:03:16.970> now<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.810> remote<00:03:18.440> is

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
back of it looks like now the remote is

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.520 
back of it looks like now the remote is
pretty<00:03:19.250> simple<00:03:19.489> it's<00:03:19.819> awesome<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:21.019> a<00:03:21.260> lot<00:03:21.410> of

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
pretty simple it's awesome and a lot of

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.050 
pretty simple it's awesome and a lot of
people<00:03:21.889> might<00:03:22.069> be<00:03:22.190> confused<00:03:22.400> with<00:03:22.639> the<00:03:22.760> matrix

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
people might be confused with the matrix

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.990 
people might be confused with the matrix
button<00:03:23.769> power<00:03:24.769> turns<00:03:25.069> it<00:03:25.220> off<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:25.340> on<00:03:25.519> simple

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
button power turns it off and on simple

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.229 
button power turns it off and on simple
base<00:03:26.930> adjust<00:03:27.349> the<00:03:27.470> base<00:03:27.650> now<00:03:28.130> ignore<00:03:29.030> that

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
base adjust the base now ignore that

because<00:03:29.419> my<00:03:30.079> mind<00:03:30.680> came<00:03:30.950> without<00:03:31.370> a<00:03:31.579> knob<00:03:31.819> for

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
because my mind came without a knob for

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.589 
because my mind came without a knob for
some<00:03:32.720> weird<00:03:33.109> reason<00:03:33.579> so<00:03:34.579> I'm<00:03:34.970> getting<00:03:35.239> a

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
some weird reason so I'm getting a

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.670 
some weird reason so I'm getting a
replacement<00:03:35.959> sent<00:03:36.769> out<00:03:36.889> soon<00:03:37.669> and<00:03:38.569> the<00:03:39.349> matrix

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
replacement sent out soon and the matrix

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.930 
replacement sent out soon and the matrix
button<00:03:39.919> it's<00:03:40.849> for<00:03:41.359> when<00:03:42.250> whenever<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:43.639> have

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
button it's for when whenever you have

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.680 
button it's for when whenever you have
let's<00:03:44.840> say<00:03:45.250> only<00:03:46.250> one<00:03:46.910> of<00:03:47.030> those<00:03:47.150> connected

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
let's say only one of those connected

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.830 
let's say only one of those connected
and<00:03:48.370> let's<00:03:49.370> say<00:03:49.519> you<00:03:49.579> only<00:03:49.880> had<00:03:50.090> one<00:03:50.359> connected

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
and let's say you only had one connected

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.640 
and let's say you only had one connected
right<00:03:51.799> if<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.340> only<00:03:52.430> had<00:03:52.579> one<00:03:52.609> connected<00:03:53.180> then

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
right if you only had one connected then

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.930 
right if you only had one connected then
it's<00:03:54.650> not<00:03:55.040> it's<00:03:55.250> obviously<00:03:55.609> not<00:03:55.730> going<00:03:55.879> to

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
it's not it's obviously not going to

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.349 
it's not it's obviously not going to
come<00:03:56.090> out<00:03:56.180> of<00:03:56.299> every<00:03:56.510> speaker<00:03:56.900> right<00:03:57.109> it<00:03:58.359> so

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
come out of every speaker right it so

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.659 
come out of every speaker right it so
it's<00:04:00.230> only<00:04:00.620> going<00:04:00.950> to<00:04:01.010> come<00:04:01.129> out<00:04:01.280> of<00:04:01.370> probably

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:01.669 
it's only going to come out of probably

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:03.759 
it's only going to come out of probably
just<00:04:01.940> only<00:04:02.239> a<00:04:02.750> couple<00:04:02.989> speakers<00:04:03.470> and<00:04:03.680> then

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
just only a couple speakers and then

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.220 
just only a couple speakers and then
that's<00:04:03.950> it<00:04:04.129> well<00:04:04.910> if<00:04:05.180> you<00:04:05.299> turn<00:04:05.480> on<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.780> matrix

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
that's it well if you turn on the matrix

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.289 
that's it well if you turn on the matrix
then<00:04:06.799> it'll<00:04:07.280> come<00:04:07.459> out<00:04:07.489> of<00:04:07.760> all<00:04:07.910> of<00:04:08.180> the

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
then it'll come out of all of the

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:14.470 
then it'll come out of all of the
speakers<00:04:09.849> whether<00:04:10.849> or<00:04:11.060> not<00:04:11.470> it's<00:04:12.470> it's<00:04:13.280> a<00:04:13.549> it's

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
speakers whether or not it's it's a it's

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.240 
speakers whether or not it's it's a it's
just<00:04:14.660> connected<00:04:15.079> to<00:04:15.109> one<00:04:15.470> so<00:04:15.889> if<00:04:16.010> it's<00:04:16.130> just

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
just connected to one so if it's just

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.219 
just connected to one so if it's just
connected<00:04:16.579> to<00:04:16.639> one<00:04:16.820> it's<00:04:16.970> okay<00:04:17.239> you<00:04:17.780> just<00:04:17.959> turn

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
connected to one it's okay you just turn

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.210 
connected to one it's okay you just turn
on<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.560> matrix<00:04:18.889> button

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
on the matrix button

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.250 
on the matrix button
and<00:04:19.430> it<00:04:19.940> makes<00:04:20.120> it<00:04:20.329> virtual<00:04:20.810> surround<00:04:21.049> sound

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
and it makes it virtual surround sound

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.080 
and it makes it virtual surround sound
so<00:04:21.620> it'll<00:04:21.890> come<00:04:22.190> out<00:04:22.310> of<00:04:22.460> all<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.700> speakers

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
so it'll come out of all the speakers

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.860 
so it'll come out of all the speakers
and<00:04:23.330> that's<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.260> volume<00:04:24.620> knob<00:04:24.800> and

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
and that's the volume knob and

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.830 
and that's the volume knob and
that's<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.770> base<00:04:27.980> matrix<00:04:28.630> simple<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:29.750> then

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
that's the base matrix simple and then

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.680 
that's the base matrix simple and then
it<00:04:29.990> has<00:04:30.110> an<00:04:30.520> ED<00:04:31.520> phone<00:04:31.699> jack<00:04:31.970> for<00:04:32.210> private

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
it has an ED phone jack for private

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.730 
it has an ED phone jack for private
listening<00:04:32.870> so<00:04:33.770> that's<00:04:33.919> pretty<00:04:34.070> cool<00:04:34.250> um<00:04:35.740> well

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
listening so that's pretty cool um well
