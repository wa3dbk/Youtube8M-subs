is it upside right is it sideways or is
it<00:00:04.140> upside<00:00:04.589> down<00:00:04.620> all<00:00:05.100> together<00:00:05.339> yes<00:00:06.330> sir

folks<00:00:06.839> this<00:00:07.140> is<00:00:07.319> MC<00:00:07.859> Escher<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.550> Minecraft<00:00:09.679> if

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
folks this is MC Escher in Minecraft if

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.230 
folks this is MC Escher in Minecraft if
you're<00:00:10.860> not<00:00:10.980> familiar<00:00:11.099> with<00:00:11.400> his<00:00:11.610> work<00:00:11.639> MC

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
you're not familiar with his work MC

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.690 
you're not familiar with his work MC
Escher<00:00:12.420> took<00:00:12.960> staircases<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:14.070> similar<00:00:14.490> such

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
Escher took staircases and similar such

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.890 
Escher took staircases and similar such
objects<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.509> use<00:00:16.350> them<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:17.570> apparently<00:00:18.570> defy

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
objects and use them to apparently defy

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.290 
objects and use them to apparently defy
the<00:00:18.960> laws<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.289> physics<00:00:19.500> for<00:00:20.070> example<00:00:20.300> this

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
the laws of physics for example this

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.290 
the laws of physics for example this
seems<00:00:21.570> like<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.109> correct<00:00:22.350> way<00:00:22.560> here<00:00:22.890> but<00:00:23.789> if

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
seems like the correct way here but if

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.200 
seems like the correct way here but if
you<00:00:24.480> come<00:00:24.720> right<00:00:25.019> around<00:00:25.140> here<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.680> corner

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
you come right around here to the corner

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.269 
you come right around here to the corner
this<00:00:27.210> also<00:00:27.480> looks<00:00:27.779> like<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.260> could<00:00:28.470> be<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
this also looks like it could be the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.080 
this also looks like it could be the
correct<00:00:30.080> mmm<00:00:31.520> orientation<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.700> looking<00:00:32.969> at

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
correct mmm orientation for looking at

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.420 
correct mmm orientation for looking at
it<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.570> even<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.899> sideways<00:00:34.350> forest<00:00:34.770> or

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
it and you even have sideways forest or

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.450 
it and you even have sideways forest or
you<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.059> even<00:00:36.239> come<00:00:36.480> over<00:00:36.719> here<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.920> look<00:00:38.309> at

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
you can even come over here and look at

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.740 
you can even come over here and look at
it<00:00:38.610> from<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.850> completely<00:00:39.210> different<00:00:39.329> angle

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
it from a completely different angle

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.790 
it from a completely different angle
come<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.440> these<00:00:40.649> steps<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:42.620> you<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.770> a

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
come up these steps and you have a

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.700 
come up these steps and you have a
sideways<00:00:44.370> little<00:00:45.239> entryway<00:00:45.809> with<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.320> gravel

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
sideways little entryway with the gravel

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.229 
sideways little entryway with the gravel
nice<00:00:46.920> gravel<00:00:47.340> road<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:48.320> did<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.620> fun<00:00:49.800> and

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
nice gravel road I did this for fun and

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.639 
nice gravel road I did this for fun and
just<00:00:51.239> want<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.510> show<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.989> texture<00:00:52.410> pack

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
just want to show you the texture pack

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.770 
just want to show you the texture pack
it<00:00:52.829> came<00:00:52.980> up<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:54.270> on-the-fly<00:00:54.660> to

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
it came up with it just on-the-fly to

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.340 
it came up with it just on-the-fly to
make<00:00:55.020> it

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
give each of these blocks that correct

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.750 
give each of these blocks that correct
lighting<00:01:02.879> effect<00:01:03.149> when<00:01:03.449> it's<00:01:03.600> dark<00:01:03.809> out<00:01:04.049> and

wool<00:01:12.930> blocks<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:13.770> see<00:01:13.950> here<00:01:14.420> that<00:01:15.420> are

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
wool blocks as you can see here that are

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.410 
wool blocks as you can see here that are
each<00:01:16.170> different<00:01:16.439> torch<00:01:16.830> direction<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:18.090> then

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
each different torch direction and then

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.450 
each different torch direction and then
I<00:01:18.450> add<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.080> torch<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.950> give<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> proper

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
I add on the torch to give it the proper

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.999 
I add on the torch to give it the proper
lighting<00:01:20.820> effect<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:23.909> then<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.240> also<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.750> my

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.350 

four-sided<00:01:29.009> grass<00:01:29.340> block<00:01:29.670> which<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:29.880> also

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
four-sided grass block which is also

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.310 
four-sided grass block which is also
just<00:01:30.570> wolf<00:01:31.759> and<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:33.509> use<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.140> make<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
just wolf and I use this to make the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.679 
just wolf and I use this to make the
grass<00:01:34.710> at<00:01:34.920> sideways<00:01:35.189> angles<00:01:35.850> or<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.360> wanted

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
grass at sideways angles or if I wanted

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.590 
grass at sideways angles or if I wanted
to<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.869> could<00:01:37.140> even<00:01:37.290> make<00:01:37.909> grass<00:01:38.909> upside<00:01:39.390> down

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
to I could even make grass upside down

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.639 
to I could even make grass upside down
and<00:01:40.409> then<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.680> also<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:41.100> my<00:01:42.229> log<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.409> blocks

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and then I also have my log of blocks

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.969 
and then I also have my log of blocks
which<00:01:44.369> enable<00:01:45.270> need<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.780> make<00:01:46.770> logs<00:01:47.220> sideways

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
which enable need to make logs sideways

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.060 
which enable need to make logs sideways
and<00:01:50.420> make<00:01:51.420> little<00:01:51.630> trees<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.530> whatnot

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
and make little trees and whatnot

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.999 
and make little trees and whatnot
sideways<00:01:54.030> without<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.810> bottom<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.829> top<00:01:55.950> of

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
sideways without the bottom and top of

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.130 
sideways without the bottom and top of
the<00:01:56.219> logs<00:01:56.430> showing<00:01:56.759> through<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:57.930> I'd

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
the logs showing through so just I'd

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.139 
the logs showing through so just I'd
show<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.680> link<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> description<00:01:59.969> if
