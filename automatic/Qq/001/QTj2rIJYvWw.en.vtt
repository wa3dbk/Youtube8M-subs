00:00:06.115 --> 00:00:10.551
 Welcome to the fast course on the Survival Hunter. 

00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:14.563
 In this video, we'll show you a brief summary of what to do 

00:00:14.563 --> 00:00:17.873
 to start playing with a level 90 Survival Hunter. 

00:00:18.642 --> 00:00:22.635
 Like other hunters, he uses Concentration as a resource. 

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:29.149
 It resets itself slowly, but you can use Cobra Shot 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.362
 to speed up the process when you do not have the ability to use strong skills. 

00:00:33.362 --> 00:00:37.103
 Before you start the fight, activate your helper 

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:40.875
 with Call Helper or Revive Helper if he is dead. 

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:44.401
 In fights, spend concentration whenever possible 

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:46.248
 with these three skills: 

00:00:46.248 --> 00:00:50.800
 the most important is the Explosive Shot, its most damaging skill. 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.051
 Use it immediately whenever you can. 

00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:58.861
 Then comes the Black Arrow, which deals a lot of time damage 

00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:02.569
 in addition to having a chance to activate Release the Finger, allowing you to 

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:06.220
 shoot three explosive shots in a row. 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.023
 Keep the Black Arrow always active. 

00:01:09.023 --> 00:01:13.629
 Or spend Concentration with Arcane Shot, but remember 

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:19.156
 to save Concentration to use Explosive Shot and Black Arrow as soon as possible. 

00:01:19.156 --> 00:01:23.171
 There is much more to learn to master the Hunter 

00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:26.921
 we hope to have taught you the minimum necessary to get you on the right track. 

00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:29.282
 Once you have mastered the basics, 

00:01:29.282 --> 00:01:34.568
 spend some time studying the library, the talents and glyphs 

00:01:34.568 --> 00:01:37.959
 to meet other skills not mentioned here. 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.601
 Thanks for watching, and see you in Draenor!
