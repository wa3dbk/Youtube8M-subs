forwards<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.250> think<00:02:47.730> it's<00:02:47.850> been<00:02:47.970> pretty<00:02:48.150> good

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
forwards I think it's been pretty good

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.410 
forwards I think it's been pretty good
it's<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:49.230> know<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.519> fans<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:50.910> crowd

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
it's you know the fans and the crowd

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.789 
it's you know the fans and the crowd
isn't<00:02:51.630> big<00:02:51.959> enough<00:02:52.079> that<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.410> can't<00:02:52.590> hear

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
isn't big enough that you can't hear

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.170 
isn't big enough that you can't hear
each<00:02:52.889> other<00:02:53.100> right<00:02:53.310> now<00:02:53.340> but<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.819> could<00:02:53.910> be<00:02:54.150> a

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
each other right now but it could be a

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.580 
each other right now but it could be a
factory<00:02:54.569> later<00:02:54.690> on<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.079> it's<00:02:55.200> important<00:02:55.560> to

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
factory later on so it's important to

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.530 
factory later on so it's important to
constantly<00:02:55.889> talk<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.459> each<00:02:56.579> other<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.940> sort

constantly talk to each other and sort

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.720 
constantly talk to each other and sort

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
of prepare for what that could feel like

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.890 
of prepare for what that could feel like
in<00:02:59.880> a<00:02:59.970> big<00:03:00.120> game<00:03:00.239> where<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.480> couldn't<00:03:00.690> hear

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
in a big game where you couldn't hear

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.949 
in a big game where you couldn't hear
anything<00:03:01.079> how<00:03:01.920> does<00:03:02.100> this<00:03:02.790> NHL<00:03:03.420> sighs<00:03:03.720> ice

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
anything how does this NHL sighs ice

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.920 
anything how does this NHL sighs ice
change<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.680> game<00:03:05.269> it<00:03:06.269> creates<00:03:06.569> a<00:03:06.630> totally

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
change the game it creates a totally

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.509 
change the game it creates a totally
different<00:03:07.230> game<00:03:07.260> actually<00:03:07.709> playing<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.459> the

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
different game actually playing on the

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.280 
different game actually playing on the
big<00:03:08.639> ice<00:03:08.819> there's<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.510> lot<00:03:09.630> more<00:03:09.660> space<00:03:10.049> out

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
big ice there's a lot more space out

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.620 
big ice there's a lot more space out
there<00:03:10.319> on<00:03:11.310> an<00:03:11.430> NHL<00:03:11.819> sighs<00:03:12.030> ice<00:03:12.209> it's<00:03:12.450> going<00:03:12.569> to

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
there on an NHL sighs ice it's going to

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.420 
there on an NHL sighs ice it's going to
be<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.720> lot<00:03:12.840> more<00:03:12.900> physical<00:03:13.500> you're<00:03:14.250> gonna<00:03:14.340> have

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
be a lot more physical you're gonna have

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.390 
be a lot more physical you're gonna have
to<00:03:14.519> make<00:03:14.639> plays<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.209> much<00:03:15.359> quicker<00:03:15.600> and

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
to make plays that much quicker and

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.880 
to make plays that much quicker and
so<00:03:16.909> it's<00:03:17.329> fun<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:17.689> makes<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.930> game<00:03:18.079> a<00:03:18.650> little

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
so it's fun it makes a game a little

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.800 
so it's fun it makes a game a little
quicker<00:03:19.189> I<00:03:19.280> think<00:03:19.519> at<00:03:19.610> times<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:20.510> game<00:03:20.659> is

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
quicker I think at times the game is

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.660 
quicker I think at times the game is
faster<00:03:20.959> for<00:03:21.319> sure<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:21.739> think<00:03:21.950> it's<00:03:22.099> make

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
faster for sure and I think it's make

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.970 
faster for sure and I think it's make
the<00:03:22.849> difference<00:03:23.030> between<00:03:23.420> good<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.409> little

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
the difference between good and a little

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.699 
the difference between good and a little
bit<00:03:25.129> worse<00:03:25.370> seem<00:03:25.640> like<00:03:26.299> more<00:03:26.480> even<00:03:26.840> did<00:03:27.620> you

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
bit worse seem like more even did you

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.319 
bit worse seem like more even did you
say<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.010> women's<00:03:28.370> game<00:03:28.549> is<00:03:28.730> much<00:03:28.939> different

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
say the women's game is much different

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.170 
say the women's game is much different
from<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.540> men<00:03:29.739> it's<00:03:30.739> a<00:03:30.920> lot<00:03:31.069> more<00:03:31.129> I'd<00:03:31.909> say

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
from the men it's a lot more I'd say

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.690 
from the men it's a lot more I'd say
skill<00:03:32.540> skill<00:03:33.409> oriented<00:03:34.040> we<00:03:34.430> don't<00:03:34.549> have

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
skill skill oriented we don't have

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.789 
skill skill oriented we don't have
anybody<00:03:34.909> checking<00:03:35.329> we<00:03:35.810> do<00:03:35.900> a<00:03:35.930> body<00:03:36.109> contact<00:03:36.650> so

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
anybody checking we do a body contact so

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.229 
anybody checking we do a body contact so
i<00:03:36.859> think<00:03:36.950> people<00:03:37.189> would<00:03:37.400> be<00:03:37.459> surprised<00:03:37.909> to<00:03:38.090> see

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
i think people would be surprised to see

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.819 
i think people would be surprised to see
how<00:03:38.329> much<00:03:38.450> contact<00:03:38.840> there<00:03:39.019> actually<00:03:39.349> is<00:03:39.500> in<00:03:39.739> a
