00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
so if I could do a review on these the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.710 
so if I could do a review on these the
only<00:01:28.560> thing<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.950> found<00:01:29.329> for<00:01:30.329> these<00:01:30.479> is

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
only thing that I found for these is

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.580 
only thing that I found for these is
that<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.500> USB<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.250> really<00:01:32.549> particular<00:01:32.909> in

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
that the USB is really particular in

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.929 
that the USB is really particular in
making<00:01:34.590> sure<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.189> connected<00:01:35.700> just

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
making sure that it's connected just

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.940 
making sure that it's connected just
right<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.420> there<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:37.290> looks<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.710> it's

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
right in there and it looks like it's

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.530 
right in there and it looks like it's
finicky<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.150> want<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.390> make<00:01:39.509> sure

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
finicky and so you want to make sure

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.359 
finicky and so you want to make sure
that<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.930> don't<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.470> budget<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.130> move<00:01:41.250> it

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
that you don't like budget you move it

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.649 
that you don't like budget you move it
around<00:01:41.490> too<00:01:41.850> much<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.360> could<00:01:42.479> probably

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
around too much as it could probably

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.960 
around too much as it could probably
break<00:01:42.990> pretty<00:01:43.290> easily<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.430> under<00:01:44.640> 100

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
break pretty easily but for under 100

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.920 
break pretty easily but for under 100
bucks<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.259> these<00:01:46.500> glasses<00:01:46.770> really<00:01:47.520> cool
