they try and look the part and that's

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.929 
they try and look the part and that's
what<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> tag<00:01:39.570> heuer<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:41.100> looks<00:01:41.579> like<00:01:41.909> a

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
what a tag heuer here is it looks like a

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.889 
what a tag heuer here is it looks like a
real<00:01:42.450> watch<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.920> smells<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.090> real<00:01:45.450> watch

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
real watch it smells like a real watch

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.069 
real watch it smells like a real watch
but<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.950> ain't<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.340> fucking<00:01:48.000> real<00:01:48.240> watch<00:01:48.659> and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
but it ain't a fucking real watch and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.010 
but it ain't a fucking real watch and
that's<00:01:49.200> why<00:01:49.500> Tag<00:01:49.950> Heuer<00:01:50.399> has<00:01:51.180> such<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> large

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
that's why Tag Heuer has such a large

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.499 
that's why Tag Heuer has such a large
academic<00:01:52.460> following<00:01:53.460> because<00:01:53.850> they<00:01:54.119> love

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
academic following because they love

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.530 
academic following because they love
those<00:01:54.780> fuck<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.380> there<00:01:55.619> they<00:01:56.460> couldn't<00:01:56.850> get<00:01:57.240> a

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
those fuck is there they couldn't get a

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.859 
those fuck is there they couldn't get a
real<00:01:58.170> job<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.920> private<00:01:59.430> enterprise<00:01:59.610> if<00:02:00.450> they

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
real job in private enterprise if they

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.060 
real job in private enterprise if they
tried<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:02.750> that's<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.020> whole<00:02:04.290> thing<00:02:04.770> there

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
tried and that's the whole thing there

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.730 
tried and that's the whole thing there
so<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:06.090> reason<00:02:06.570> why<00:02:06.780> they<00:02:07.020> do<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.530> is

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
so the reason why they do it is is

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.619 
so the reason why they do it is is
because<00:02:08.160> that's<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.610> type<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.090> people<00:02:09.450> they

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
because that's the type of people they

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.830 
because that's the type of people they
are<00:02:09.899> they're<00:02:10.319> pretty

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840
