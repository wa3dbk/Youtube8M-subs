00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.819 
ease his top speed isn't good enough so
he<00:01:42.030> will<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.390> our<00:01:42.540> peers<00:01:42.780> from<00:01:42.899> defenders<00:01:43.590> and

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
he will get our peers from defenders and

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.280 
he will get our peers from defenders and
his<00:01:44.280> stamina<00:01:44.610> he<00:01:45.329> just<00:01:45.570> seems<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.990> run<00:01:46.110> out<00:01:46.229> of

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
his stamina he just seems to run out of

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.230 
his stamina he just seems to run out of
steam<00:01:46.560> towards<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> end<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.310> games<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.970> it

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
steam towards the end of games and it

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.480 
steam towards the end of games and it
takes<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.750> while<00:01:48.960> for<00:01:49.350> him<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.770> reach<00:01:50.100> his<00:01:50.130> top

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
takes a while for him to reach his top

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.969 
takes a while for him to reach his top
speed<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.119> overall<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:52.020> lose<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.680> stamina

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
speed so overall you lose in stamina

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.160 
speed so overall you lose in stamina
inch<00:01:53.399> by<00:01:53.579> inch<00:01:53.759> every<00:01:54.540> single<00:01:54.780> time<00:01:54.960> you

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
inch by inch every single time you

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.569 
inch by inch every single time you
trying<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.560> hit<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.799> top<00:01:55.979> speed<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.430> by<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
trying to hit that top speed and by the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.160 
trying to hit that top speed and by the
time<00:01:56.700> you've<00:01:56.969> hit<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.149> top<00:01:57.329> speed<00:01:57.600> you've

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
time you've hit the top speed you've

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.050 
time you've hit the top speed you've
lost<00:01:58.409> your<00:01:58.649> stamina<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.189> he<00:01:59.340> slowed<00:01:59.670> down<00:01:59.850> to

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
lost your stamina and he slowed down to

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.359 
lost your stamina and he slowed down to
kind<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.570> walking<00:02:00.990> pace<00:02:01.170> towards<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> end

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
kind of a walking pace towards the end

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.270 
kind of a walking pace towards the end
of<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.610> game<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.630> terms<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.350> his<00:02:04.500> corns<00:02:04.890> laws

get<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.300> chance<00:02:43.599> he<00:02:44.050> tends<00:02:44.350> to<00:02:44.560> find<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.920> back

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
get the chance he tends to find the back

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.880 
get the chance he tends to find the back
of<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.640> net<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.209> his<00:02:46.630> movement<00:02:47.170> is<00:02:47.350> great

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890

ball<00:02:50.140> every<00:02:50.350> single<00:02:50.680> time<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.160> you<00:02:51.220> can<00:02:51.370> do

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
he is a good card but I don't think he

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.720 
he is a good card but I don't think he
should<00:02:55.989> be<00:02:56.440> as<00:02:56.560> hyped<00:02:56.799> as<00:02:57.069> he<00:02:57.220> is<00:02:57.370> in<00:02:57.580> the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730
