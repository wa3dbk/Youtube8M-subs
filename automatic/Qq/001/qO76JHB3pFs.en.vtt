00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
lot of speculation as to what being a

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.380 
lot of speculation as to what being a
next<00:02:15.770> update<00:02:16.100> hopefully<00:02:16.610> it's<00:02:17.030> going<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.210> be

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
next update hopefully it's going to be

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.260 
next update hopefully it's going to be
you<00:02:17.990> know<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.140> next<00:02:18.410> feature<00:02:18.710> update<00:02:19.250> we<00:02:20.030> were

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
really not sure but you know I'm sort of

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.410 
really not sure but you know I'm sort of
pointing<00:02:24.110> towards<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:25.090> because<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.390> know

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
pointing towards that because you know

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.570 
pointing towards that because you know
Jap<00:02:26.750> that<00:02:26.990> that<00:02:27.200> just<00:02:27.440> really<00:02:27.710> really<00:02:28.070> just<00:02:28.370> it

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580

shows<00:04:56.900> are<00:04:57.050> static<00:04:57.500> it<00:04:57.710> can<00:04:58.040> be<00:04:58.280> added<00:04:58.520> into

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
shows are static it can be added into

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.690 
shows are static it can be added into
the<00:04:58.850> game<00:04:58.910> and<00:04:59.350> now<00:05:00.350> it<00:05:00.410> should<00:05:00.680> be<00:05:00.830> a<00:05:00.860> most

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
the game and now it should be a most

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.310 
the game and now it should be a most
likely<00:05:02.090> because<00:05:02.420> you<00:05:02.690> know<00:05:02.780> if<00:05:02.900> it<00:05:03.050> follows

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
likely because you know if it follows

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.410 
likely because you know if it follows
the<00:05:03.470> way<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:04.040> updating<00:05:04.550> has<00:05:04.670> been<00:05:04.850> then<00:05:05.180> you

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
the way the updating has been then you

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.060 
the way the updating has been then you
know<00:05:05.510> it<00:05:05.720> will<00:05:05.900> be<00:05:06.140> in<00:05:06.230> the<00:05:06.290> next<00:05:06.470> update<00:05:06.650> but

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
know it will be in the next update but

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.420 
know it will be in the next update but
yeah<00:05:07.220> guys<00:05:07.730> it's<00:05:07.970> just<00:05:08.150> all<00:05:08.270> speculation<00:05:08.930> so

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
yeah guys it's just all speculation so

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.920 
yeah guys it's just all speculation so
anything<00:05:10.430> can't<00:05:10.640> really<00:05:10.910> be<00:05:11.030> confirmed<00:05:11.420> but

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
anything can't really be confirmed but

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.570 
anything can't really be confirmed but
we<00:05:12.170> do<00:05:12.380> need<00:05:12.590> to<00:05:12.710> know<00:05:12.830> is<00:05:12.950> that<00:05:13.160> in<00:05:13.280> the<00:05:13.370> next

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
we do need to know is that in the next

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.240
