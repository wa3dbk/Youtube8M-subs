again<00:00:17.640> mr.<00:00:18.000> Fisher<00:00:18.779> just<00:00:19.109> there<00:00:20.000> seems<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.119> be

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
again mr. Fisher just there seems to be

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.150 
again mr. Fisher just there seems to be
more<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.779> more<00:00:22.020> 30<00:00:22.260> pound<00:00:22.470> bags<00:00:22.710> weight<00:00:22.980> in

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
more of a more 30 pound bags weight in

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.490 
more of a more 30 pound bags weight in
local<00:00:23.519> events<00:00:23.820> right<00:00:23.970> now<00:00:24.180> I've<00:00:25.019> ever<00:00:25.199> seen

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
local events right now I've ever seen

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.150 
local events right now I've ever seen
and<00:00:26.539> so<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> potential<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.260> having<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
and so the potential of having the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.089 
and so the potential of having the
record<00:00:29.550> or<00:00:30.480> some<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.960> records<00:00:31.109> fall<00:00:31.560> is

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
record or some of the records fall is

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.650 
record or some of the records fall is

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
t-shirt as we speak so the water

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.010 
t-shirt as we speak so the water
temperatures<00:00:45.210> have<00:00:45.329> been<00:00:45.420> very<00:00:45.690> consistent

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
temperatures have been very consistent

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.310
