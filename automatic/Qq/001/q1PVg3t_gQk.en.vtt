00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.040
 so the tasting looks good 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.290
 complicated what to remember is 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.050
 that tasting happens in three 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.320
 time each related to a sense one starts 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.710
 through the eyes then the nose ends with 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.360
 the mouth 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.720
 so if I understand correctly we start 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.230
 to taste with the eyes exactly 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.940
 we are going to watch the wine in the light we are going 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.210
 examine her dress 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.540
 ie its color and its reflections 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.120
 which varies according to the origin and the jo sign 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.460
 then young red wines in 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.860
 bright shades of purplish red that go 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.210
 towards the red-brown when growing older 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.610
 the whites themselves vary from a green yellow 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.680
 until the yellow yellows of the yellows 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.810
 dock re 1 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.670
 look at the intensity the pain if she 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.670
 is deep and dance 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.030
 the wine will certainly be full-bodied powerful 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.610
 1 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.520
 on the contrary if it is clearer the 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.899
 wine will probably be lighter by 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.789
 against if you see brown reflections 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.880
 in there it's bad sign that's 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:30.369
 certainly that your wine is oxidized and 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.710
 then exactly we go now 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.830
 taste the wine with the nose we will look for 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.299
 to recognize the tastes and aromas and 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.250
 it happens in two stages first of all 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:45.400
 had melgven without stirring it in order to 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:49.990
 measure the intensity of the aromas it is this 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.420
 called the firstborn then done 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.840
 turn the wine into the glass so 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.590
 in the air this is called the 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.189
 second born one tries to recognize the 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.400
 aroma okay so what's this is the 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.970
 strawberry banana 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.450
 waze there are a lot of them 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.130
 other 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.880
 first you go what's called the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.040
 primary aromas white wines 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.540
 develops aromas of flowers aromas of 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.510
 fruits for red wines 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.760
 and then there are the aromas says 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.190
 secondary for wines a little bit 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.380
 older fruit flavors for them 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.250
 white wines of peach and apricot 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.890
 citrus weights when we go a red 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.740
 they developed jams from 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.550
 horrified notes of udder mushrooms 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.410
 there is an infinity of sensations 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.470
 to the older wines he develops 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.990
 so what's called the bouquet is 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.320
 to say a richer mix and more 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.610
 melted all the aromas of agreement and 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.970
 well all this makes us want to 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.760
 to taste 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.680
 so we go yes now we're going 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.690
 appreciate the taste ie the 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.050
 mixture between them the aromas and the 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.760
 flavors 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.870
 so I remind you that there are four 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.150
 basic flavors sweet salty bitter acid and 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.019
 in fact an infinity of combinations 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.120
 so you have noted sweet salty acid and 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.650
 bitter but all that seems still 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.260
 very subjective and what is the 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.970
 objective criteria was of course made in 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.450
 depending on the type of wines we will look for 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.030
 typical flavors 1 is also a 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.940
 certain harmony then for the wines 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.570
 whites for example we will look for 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.890
 flowers fruit aromas 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.320
 the balance between mellowness and 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.510
 freshness between the sweet acid if you 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.769
 despite for the red wines a 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.780
 third component come online 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.670
 counting are the tannins so there we 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.340
 will look for the balance between the word 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.440
 and freshness and the robustness 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.260
 for example on the côtes du rhône 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.459
 we will search for mellowness on wines 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.940
 Touraine and Beaujolais 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.480
 we will focus on freshness and on 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.700
 Medoc 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.070
 we will appreciate the tannins that will 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.930
 allow the wines to age well and 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.730
 to develop the bouquet we were talking about 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.500
 just now and the final on the palate 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.140
 it is true that we often hear about 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.310
 wines that can be long in the mouth 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.019
 what does it mean exactly 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.060
 vincent you are well length in the mouth 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.720
 it's just time while 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.480
 which you keep 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.360
 the sensations of wine in the mouth eh 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.590
 well thank you vincent for a first 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.300
 approach we have already learned 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.710
 many and I invite you to come to us 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.540

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.790
 the minute of the wine merchant and in the meantime 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.800
 Come and ask your cellar for advice 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.800
