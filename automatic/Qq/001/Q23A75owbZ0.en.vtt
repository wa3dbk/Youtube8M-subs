00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
some vehicles can be easier to gain

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.969 
some vehicles can be easier to gain
access<00:00:52.659> to<00:00:52.900> behind<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:53.350> grill<00:00:53.620> and<00:00:53.860> then

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:53.979 
access to behind the grill and then

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:55.439 
access to behind the grill and then
compared<00:00:54.309> to<00:00:54.339> others<00:00:54.640> materials<00:00:55.210> which<00:00:55.299> can

compared to others materials which can
again<00:00:55.659> be<00:00:55.720> used<00:00:55.989> for<00:00:56.140> a<00:00:56.170> barrier<00:00:56.500> include

this<00:00:59.440> particular<00:00:59.710> vehicle<00:01:00.040> it<00:01:00.339> does<00:01:00.369> have<00:01:00.640> a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
this particular vehicle it does have a

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.520 
this particular vehicle it does have a
hood<00:01:00.879> latch<00:01:01.119> in<00:01:01.420> behind<00:01:01.839> the<00:01:01.960> grille<00:01:02.199> which

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
hood latch in behind the grille which

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.660 
hood latch in behind the grille which
does<00:01:02.739> work<00:01:02.890> on<00:01:03.040> a<00:01:03.100> spring-loaded<00:01:03.519> mechanism

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
does work on a spring-loaded mechanism

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.760 
does work on a spring-loaded mechanism
and<00:01:04.299> does<00:01:04.390> pop<00:01:04.629> out<00:01:04.809> automatically<00:01:05.470> what<00:01:05.650> I'm

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
and does pop out automatically what I'm

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.410 
and does pop out automatically what I'm
doing<00:01:06.010> here<00:01:06.190> is<00:01:06.250> applying<00:01:06.549> an<00:01:06.729> elastic<00:01:07.180> band

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
doing here is applying an elastic band

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.060 
doing here is applying an elastic band
which<00:01:07.659> allows<00:01:07.930> it<00:01:08.140> to<00:01:08.170> pull<00:01:08.470> it<00:01:08.619> back<00:01:08.799> into

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
which allows it to pull it back into

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.740 
which allows it to pull it back into
place<00:01:09.280> which<00:01:09.820> doesn't<00:01:10.180> cause<00:01:10.299> any<00:01:10.570> issues

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
place which doesn't cause any issues

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.450 
place which doesn't cause any issues
when<00:01:11.170> I'm<00:01:11.290> applying<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.740> flash<00:01:11.920> dip<00:01:12.250> to<00:01:12.430> the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
when I'm applying the flash dip to the

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.190 
when I'm applying the flash dip to the
grill<00:01:12.729> next<00:01:13.060> I'll<00:01:13.330> apply<00:01:13.360> a<00:01:13.600> couple<00:01:13.990> small

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
grill next I'll apply a couple small

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.020 
grill next I'll apply a couple small
blocks<00:01:14.530> under<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.220> hood<00:01:15.400> wrapped<00:01:15.790> in<00:01:15.939> the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
blocks under the hood wrapped in the

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.340 
blocks under the hood wrapped in the
cloth<00:01:16.240> so<00:01:16.510> it<00:01:16.570> doesn't<00:01:16.780> scratch<00:01:16.900> the<00:01:16.990> pane

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
cloth so it doesn't scratch the pane

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.690 
cloth so it doesn't scratch the pane
this<00:01:17.590> will<00:01:17.740> ensure<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.070> hood<00:01:18.220> doesn't<00:01:18.400> close

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
this will ensure the hood doesn't close

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.310 
this will ensure the hood doesn't close
which<00:01:19.120> won't<00:01:19.540> allow<00:01:19.780> me<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:19.990> open<00:01:20.260> it

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
which won't allow me to open it

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.080 
which won't allow me to open it
afterwards<00:01:20.830> considering<00:01:21.460> I<00:01:21.490> do<00:01:21.550> have<00:01:21.820> this

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
afterwards considering I do have this

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.880 
afterwards considering I do have this
spring-loaded<00:01:22.720> latch<00:01:22.960> hidden<00:01:23.470> behind<00:01:23.590> the

vary<00:01:27.430> depending<00:01:27.700> on<00:01:28.060> what<00:01:28.180> type<00:01:28.240> of<00:01:28.390> vehicle

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
vary depending on what type of vehicle

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.720 
vary depending on what type of vehicle
you<00:01:28.870> do<00:01:29.020> have<00:01:29.230> therefore<00:01:29.770> masking<00:01:30.250> techniques

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
you do have therefore masking techniques

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.190 
you do have therefore masking techniques
will<00:01:31.150> vary<00:01:31.390> as<00:01:31.540> well<00:01:31.750> for<00:01:31.990> this<00:01:32.080> particular

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
will vary as well for this particular

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.170 
will vary as well for this particular
vehicle<00:01:32.620> the<00:01:33.010> grill<00:01:33.190> is<00:01:33.310> located<00:01:33.760> on<00:01:33.910> the<00:01:34.060> hood

assembly<00:01:34.540> therefore<00:01:34.960> I'll<00:01:35.050> be<00:01:35.170> leaving<00:01:35.470> about

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
assembly therefore I'll be leaving about

I<00:02:50.330> left<00:02:50.600> mine<00:02:50.810> for<00:02:51.020> about<00:02:51.200> 45<00:02:51.680> minutes<00:02:51.710> and<00:02:52.130> it

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
I left mine for about 45 minutes and it

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.100 
I left mine for about 45 minutes and it
was<00:02:52.370> still<00:02:52.610> slightly<00:02:53.090> soft<00:02:53.390> if<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.900> coating

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
was still slightly soft if the coating

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.720 
was still slightly soft if the coating
is<00:02:54.320> still<00:02:54.530> soft<00:02:54.860> it<00:02:55.010> does<00:02:55.190> make<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.490> a<00:02:55.550> lot

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
is still soft it does make it a lot

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.310 
is still soft it does make it a lot
harder<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:56.120> remove<00:02:56.420> as<00:02:56.630> compared<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.140> when

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
harder to remove as compared to when

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.780 
harder to remove as compared to when
it's<00:02:57.440> fully<00:02:57.650> cured<00:02:57.980> because<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:58.460> will<00:02:58.580> break

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
it's fully cured because it will break

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.850 
it's fully cured because it will break
off<00:02:59.030> into<00:02:59.210> small<00:02:59.570> little<00:02:59.930> portion<00:03:00.440> instead<00:03:00.770> of

off into small little portion instead of

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.830 
off into small little portion instead of
coming<00:03:01.130> off<00:03:01.280> in<00:03:01.520> one<00:03:01.700> solid<00:03:02.030> piece<00:03:02.060> as<00:03:02.480> you<00:03:02.570> can

coming off in one solid piece as you can

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.270 
coming off in one solid piece as you can
see<00:03:02.990> there<00:03:03.140> will<00:03:03.200> be<00:03:03.320> a<00:03:03.350> clean<00:03:03.620> transition
