00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.050 
going back and adding things as you wish
it's<00:03:04.750> quite<00:03:04.900> nice<00:03:05.579> aside<00:03:06.579> from<00:03:06.640> this<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:07.000> only

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
it's quite nice aside from this the only

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.520 
it's quite nice aside from this the only
other<00:03:07.269> thing<00:03:07.329> involved<00:03:07.840> is<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.140> search

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
other thing involved is the search

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.199 
other thing involved is the search
function<00:03:09.069> which<00:03:09.489> you<00:03:09.640> can<00:03:09.760> go<00:03:09.879> in<00:03:10.000> here<00:03:10.180> and

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
function which you can go in here and

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.650 
function which you can go in here and
then<00:03:10.420> type<00:03:10.629> things<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:12.370> obviously<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.269> could<00:03:13.569> go

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
then type things so obviously I could go

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.050 
then type things so obviously I could go
in<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.049> type<00:03:14.169> for<00:03:14.470> people<00:03:14.799> which<00:03:15.700> I<00:03:15.819> may<00:03:15.940> or

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
in and type for people which I may or

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.400 
in and type for people which I may or
may<00:03:16.120> not<00:03:16.150> do<00:03:17.549> now<00:03:18.549> let's<00:03:18.940> give<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.349> you<00:03:20.349> know

it's<00:03:20.709> a<00:03:20.829> search<00:03:21.010> function<00:03:21.220> you<00:03:21.549> know<00:03:21.669> how<00:03:21.819> it

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
it's a search function you know how it

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.059 
it's a search function you know how it
works<00:03:22.470> obviously<00:03:23.470> we<00:03:23.560> like<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.799> design<00:03:24.010> of

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
works obviously we like the design of

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.890 
works obviously we like the design of
this<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:24.280> lot<00:03:24.579> it's<00:03:24.790> extremely<00:03:25.299> intuitive<00:03:25.569> and

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
this a lot it's extremely intuitive and

this a lot it's extremely intuitive and
we<00:03:26.019> just<00:03:26.590> enjoy<00:03:26.889> the<00:03:27.069> way<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.430> works<00:03:27.549> this

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
we just enjoy the way that it works this

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.240

is simple we love the simplicity of the

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.180 
is simple we love the simplicity of the
posting<00:03:30.700> that's<00:03:30.940> extremely<00:03:31.389> cool

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
posting that's extremely cool

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.349

furthermore<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.370> gesture<00:03:33.700> controls<00:03:34.060> just

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
furthermore the gesture controls just

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.059 
furthermore the gesture controls just
makes<00:03:34.630> sense<00:03:34.930> on<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.290> iphone<00:03:35.620> it's<00:03:35.799> something

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
makes sense on the iphone it's something

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.650 
makes sense on the iphone it's something
that<00:03:36.190> we<00:03:36.280> like<00:03:36.459> in<00:03:36.639> apps<00:03:36.819> and<00:03:37.120> it<00:03:37.209> just<00:03:37.450> it

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
that we like in apps and it just it

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.949 
that we like in apps and it just it
works<00:03:37.840> perfectly<00:03:38.319> so<00:03:38.709> why<00:03:39.370> not<00:03:39.549> do<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:39.910> we<00:03:40.599> kind

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
nice furthermore a smoother way to mess

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.420 
nice furthermore a smoother way to mess
with<00:03:58.989> our<00:03:59.109> pages<00:03:59.349> since<00:03:59.709> I<00:03:59.859> do<00:03:59.919> happen<00:04:00.250> to

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
with our pages since I do happen to

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.800 
with our pages since I do happen to
operate<00:04:00.730> a<00:04:00.760> ton<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.060> your<00:04:01.269> pages<00:04:01.450> would<00:04:01.660> be

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
operate a ton of your pages would be

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.349 
operate a ton of your pages would be
good<00:04:02.310> but<00:04:03.310> then<00:04:03.459> again<00:04:03.579> all<00:04:03.730> these<00:04:04.060> are<00:04:04.209> just

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
good but then again all these are just

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.650 
good but then again all these are just
more<00:04:04.720> sort<00:04:05.049> of<00:04:05.340> streamlining<00:04:06.340> efforts<00:04:06.879> on<00:04:07.209> to

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
more sort of streamlining efforts on to

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.970 
more sort of streamlining efforts on to
what<00:04:07.810> is<00:04:07.900> already<00:04:07.989> an<00:04:08.319> incredible<00:04:08.799> app

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
what is already an incredible app

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.619 
what is already an incredible app
furthermore<00:04:09.519> it<00:04:09.639> only<00:04:09.760> costs<00:04:09.970> a<00:04:10.090> buck<00:04:10.329> and<00:04:10.569> of

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
furthermore it only costs a buck and of

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.210 
furthermore it only costs a buck and of
course<00:04:10.870> you<00:04:11.019> could<00:04:11.319> use<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.650> Facebook<00:04:12.040> app

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
course you could use the Facebook app

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.830 
course you could use the Facebook app
that<00:04:12.459> comes<00:04:12.579> native<00:04:12.970> with<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.150> iphone<00:04:13.510> for

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
that comes native with the iphone for

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.080 
that comes native with the iphone for
free<00:04:13.870> so<00:04:14.829> the<00:04:15.010> value<00:04:15.190> of<00:04:15.489> this<00:04:15.609> largely

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
free so the value of this largely

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.250 
free so the value of this largely
depends<00:04:16.479> on<00:04:16.570> how<00:04:16.660> much<00:04:16.810> you<00:04:16.959> want<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.169> use

facebook and how beautifully you want to
do<00:04:20.320> it<00:04:20.440> so<00:04:20.739> for<00:04:20.919> instance<00:04:20.979> if<00:04:21.370> you<00:04:21.489> like<00:04:21.669> the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
do it so for instance if you like the

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.440 
do it so for instance if you like the
look<00:04:21.940> of<00:04:22.030> this<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:22.330> you

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
look of this and you

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.880 
look of this and you
it<00:04:22.510> can<00:04:22.660> be<00:04:22.780> worth<00:04:23.290> it<00:04:23.500> just<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:23.680> have<00:04:23.800> the

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
it can be worth it just to have the

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.290 
it can be worth it just to have the
gesture<00:04:24.220> controls<00:04:24.610> for<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.880> dollar<00:04:25.060> which

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
gesture controls for a dollar which

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.300 
gesture controls for a dollar which
certainly<00:04:25.720> would<00:04:25.990> be<00:04:26.020> then<00:04:26.680> go<00:04:27.100> ahead<00:04:27.160> and

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
certainly would be then go ahead and

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.810 
certainly would be then go ahead and
jump<00:04:27.490> on<00:04:27.670> it<00:04:27.790> and<00:04:28.590> that<00:04:29.590> is<00:04:29.950> basically<00:04:30.280> all<00:04:30.580> we

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
jump on it and that is basically all we

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.760 
jump on it and that is basically all we
have<00:04:31.060> to<00:04:31.210> say<00:04:31.240> about<00:04:31.480> it<00:04:31.630> other<00:04:31.900> than<00:04:31.990> we<00:04:32.680> are

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
have to say about it other than we are

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.500 
have to say about it other than we are
going<00:04:32.890> to<00:04:32.950> give<00:04:33.040> it<00:04:33.100> a<00:04:33.160> 4.5<00:04:33.730> out<00:04:34.000> of<00:04:34.030> 5<00:04:34.270> star

going to give it a 4.5 out of 5 star

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.970 
going to give it a 4.5 out of 5 star
rating<00:04:34.540> we<00:04:34.930> think<00:04:35.140> it's<00:04:35.260> rather<00:04:35.530> brilliant
