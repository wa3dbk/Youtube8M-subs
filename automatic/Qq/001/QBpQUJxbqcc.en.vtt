00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
there we go this whole entire part is

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.329 
there we go this whole entire part is
basically<00:01:04.019> getting<00:01:04.199> two<00:01:04.470> items<00:01:05.040> we<00:01:05.129> haven't

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.800 
think it's only because I was four
levels<00:06:51.670> higher<00:06:51.880> but<00:06:52.210> I<00:06:52.240> didn't<00:06:52.540> think<00:06:52.630> I'd<00:06:52.780> be

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:52.810
