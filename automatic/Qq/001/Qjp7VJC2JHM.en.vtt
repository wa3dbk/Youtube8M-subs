00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.210
 Hello everyone and welcome julian moore 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:14.280
 in the final chapter of hunger games 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:18.150
 I tell you everything after the video praise on board 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.619
 and ready for connection the action in the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.669
 movie what you would have dreamed of 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.680
 see when you had 11 eyeliner is 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.950
 really really great movie 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.950
 adventure 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.440
 in the very near future of creatures 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.440
 they begin to emerge or massari 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.350
 we are gigantic and brutal 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:50.230
 need weapons that are capable of 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:52.989
 opposing the live shows we have equipped intel 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.790
 i7 because vibrasse roe trembled for 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:59.079
 give you the real feeling of what 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.620
 every movie happens inside the robot 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.239
 it must have a part of concrete effects 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:10.869
 to convey the sense of reality 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:13.240
 film physics in pacific rim 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.210
 we built the robot head e 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.409
 between construction scaffolding resulted 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.409
 about four stories high 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.470
 the whole set had to be able to move e 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.270
 had to be able to go down 4 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.610
 and a half meters very quickly for the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.710
 movement of the head all the actors 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.549
 they wanted to show us around it was like a 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.549
 small amusement park 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.040
 the simplest thing would have been 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.229
 place birdie markers on 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.479
 their arms on their shoulders and shoulders 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.640
 their feet in the actors would have had 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.229
 completely free movements but I have 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.920
 thought there was a need for one 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.990
 resistance 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.119
 so we set up a machine 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.280
 which weighs a couple of tons on 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.470
 their shoulders on their legs over theirs 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.210
 arms we wear a breastplate and below 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.890
 a sling your feet 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.929
 we are on these platforms we need 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.209
 to move the wow robot's legs that 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:13.769
 they poured 800 liters of water on them 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:17.010
 in a mineros everything had to be 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.630
 incredibly waterproof because it was 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.190
 really dangerous to work with 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.190
 current leadri crock machine 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.930
 I invented a torture machine 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.970
 I thought it would be nice for i 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.740
 fighting use larger cockpits 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.550
 like those of tech pilots 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.470
 in the Second World War though 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.490
 they stayed in a small cabin yes 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.600
 they would feel rather comfortable assure 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.730
 but the pieces of walls that come 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.680
 ripped the floor shaken the 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.510
 windshield so to speak that it comes 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.520
 shattered all this from 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.890
 an interaction that is more immediate and 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.800
 visceral place that if they were able 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.900
 to react so aligned not even every 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.060
 time they fight football must 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.700
 hope for the whole 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.280
 equipment pulls that punch with and 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.720
 when they are hit by cai over all 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.420
 the equipment is thrown out 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.960
 back and are tossed by email 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.960
 and the choices 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.670
 I wanted it to be a very long movie 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.420
 intense during battles so that 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.740
 the real sentiments that they involved 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.540
 to transport in the cabin of 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.100
 pilotage 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.740
 we will make you feel as if you were dead 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.990
 after having it more 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.990
 take your seat and get ready to leave 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.239
 pacific rim 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.630
 the red julian moore would be in 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.730
 negotiations for acting in hunger games 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.590
 the song of the revolt 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.349
 part 1 and part ii in the role of 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.030
 leader of the district 13 alma coin capo 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.310
 of the rebellion against capitol city 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.170
 the two films are taken from the third e 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.800
 last novel of the suzanne trilogy 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.019
