and<00:00:15.030> normally<00:00:15.270> I<00:00:15.330> probably<00:00:15.510> wouldn't<00:00:15.750> mess

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
and normally I probably wouldn't mess

with this on the peaking cycle but you

with this on the peaking cycle but you
guys<00:00:17.370> know<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.610> am<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.120> figured<00:00:18.630> 495<00:00:19.170> would

guys know I am and I figured 495 would
not<00:00:19.530> only<00:00:19.680> just<00:00:19.860> look<00:00:20.040> better<00:00:20.220> but<00:00:20.400> make<00:00:20.520> me

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
not only just look better but make me

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.460 
not only just look better but make me
feel<00:00:20.880> better<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.360> have<00:00:21.780> the<00:00:21.900> tendency<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.350> kind

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
feel better I have the tendency to kind

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.990 
feel better I have the tendency to kind
of<00:00:22.590> let<00:00:22.680> my<00:00:22.770> mind<00:00:22.980> play<00:00:23.160> tricks<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.610> me<00:00:23.789> when<00:00:23.970> I

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
of let my mind play tricks on me when I

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.850 
of let my mind play tricks on me when I
see<00:00:24.240> lots<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.750> weight<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.380> bar<00:00:25.620> and

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
see lots of weight on the bar and

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.290 
see lots of weight on the bar and
honestly<00:00:26.490> when<00:00:26.700> the<00:00:26.789> weights<00:00:26.940> spread<00:00:27.180> out

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
honestly when the weights spread out

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.240 
honestly when the weights spread out
further<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.810> just<00:00:28.050> looks<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.619> feels<00:00:28.890> heavier

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
further it just looks and feels heavier

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.730 
further it just looks and feels heavier
to<00:00:29.490> me<00:00:29.640> if<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.240> true<00:00:30.449> or<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:30.600> I<00:00:31.020> will<00:00:31.619> never

to me if it's true or not I will never
know<00:00:31.920> but<00:00:32.310> for<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.030> particular<00:00:33.239> day<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.660> had

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
weights somewhere around 455 the problem

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.700 
weights somewhere around 455 the problem
is<00:01:34.149> as<00:01:34.300> you<00:01:34.330> see<00:01:34.600> from<00:01:34.750> this<00:01:34.960> warm-up<00:01:35.410> set<00:01:35.619> of

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
is as you see from this warm-up set of

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.100 
is as you see from this warm-up set of
455<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.729> weight<00:01:36.880> moves<00:01:37.090> very<00:01:37.300> slow<00:01:37.690> and<00:01:37.960> in

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
455 the weight moves very slow and in

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.440 
455 the weight moves very slow and in
fact<00:01:38.380> on<00:01:38.590> my<00:01:38.740> last<00:01:39.009> warm-up<00:01:39.280> set<00:01:39.490> of<00:01:39.580> 495<00:01:40.210> as

fact on my last warm-up set of 495 as

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.290 
fact on my last warm-up set of 495 as
you<00:01:40.600> guys<00:01:40.750> saw<00:01:40.930> in<00:01:41.050> the<00:01:41.140> intro<00:01:41.500> I<00:01:41.740> failed<00:01:42.729> it<00:01:42.940> so

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
you guys saw in the intro I failed it so

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.480 
you guys saw in the intro I failed it so
I<00:01:43.330> didn't<00:01:43.720> even<00:01:43.930> get<00:01:44.140> to<00:01:44.200> my<00:01:44.440> working<00:01:44.890> sets<00:01:45.250> and

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
I didn't even get to my working sets and

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.389 
I didn't even get to my working sets and
I'm<00:01:45.820> failing<00:01:46.270> reps<00:01:46.750> already<00:01:47.259> not<00:01:47.830> a<00:01:47.860> very<00:01:48.190> good

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
I'm failing reps already not a very good

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.880 
I'm failing reps already not a very good
sign<00:01:48.610> and<00:01:48.940> the<00:01:49.420> big<00:01:49.630> mindfuck<00:01:50.110> for<00:01:50.380> me<00:01:50.500> is<00:01:50.680> that

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
sign and the big mindfuck for me is that

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.040 
sign and the big mindfuck for me is that
just<00:01:51.190> last<00:01:51.399> week<00:01:51.610> I<00:01:51.820> did<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.240> same<00:01:52.509> weight<00:01:52.750> for

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
just last week I did the same weight for

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.529 
just last week I did the same weight for
4<00:01:53.320> sets<00:01:53.619> of<00:01:53.710> 3<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.550> although<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.270> weight<00:01:55.390> was

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
4 sets of 3 and although the weight was

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.540 
4 sets of 3 and although the weight was
heavy<00:01:55.750> because<00:01:56.080> it's<00:01:56.229> 90%<00:01:56.710> of<00:01:57.039> my<00:01:57.190> one<00:01:57.340> rep<00:01:57.520> max

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
heavy because it's 90% of my one rep max

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.450 
heavy because it's 90% of my one rep max
it<00:01:58.060> still<00:01:58.450> moved<00:01:58.780> fairly<00:01:59.110> well<00:01:59.470> on<00:01:59.679> each<00:02:00.130> set

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
it still moved fairly well on each set

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.999 
it still moved fairly well on each set
at<00:02:00.640> each<00:02:00.880> rep<00:02:01.180> so<00:02:01.840> this<00:02:02.110> really<00:02:02.470> screwed<00:02:02.890> with

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
at each rep so this really screwed with

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.800 
at each rep so this really screwed with
my<00:02:03.130> mind<00:02:03.340> so<00:02:03.580> much<00:02:03.729> so<00:02:03.909> in<00:02:04.000> fact<00:02:04.030> that<00:02:04.450> after<00:02:04.630> I

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
my mind so much so in fact that after I

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.240 
my mind so much so in fact that after I
failed<00:02:05.080> this<00:02:05.229> rep<00:02:05.439> actually<00:02:05.799> went<00:02:05.950> back<00:02:06.070> and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
failed this rep actually went back and

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.039 
failed this rep actually went back and
attempt<00:02:06.580> at<00:02:06.670> 495<00:02:07.240> again<00:02:07.570> and<00:02:07.689> got<00:02:07.780> it<00:02:07.869> for<00:02:07.960> a

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
attempt at 495 again and got it for a

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:09.690 
attempt at 495 again and got it for a
single<00:02:08.229> didn't<00:02:08.979> record<00:02:09.280> it<00:02:09.369> for<00:02:09.519> some<00:02:09.670> reason

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
single didn't record it for some reason

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.520 
single didn't record it for some reason
I<00:02:10.119> think<00:02:10.360> I<00:02:10.479> was<00:02:10.600> just<00:02:10.780> embarrassed<00:02:10.959> that<00:02:11.380> I'd

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
I think I was just embarrassed that I'd

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.789 
I think I was just embarrassed that I'd
fail<00:02:11.860> again<00:02:12.660> but<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:13.690> did<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:14.079> and<00:02:14.230> then<00:02:14.709> I

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
fail again but I did it and then I

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.199 
fail again but I did it and then I
decided<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.190> try<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.430> salvage<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.970> rest<00:02:16.120> of

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
decided to try to salvage the rest of

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.610 
decided to try to salvage the rest of
the<00:02:16.269> workout<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.810> still<00:02:17.019> hit<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.200> numbers

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
the workout and still hit the numbers

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.560 
the workout and still hit the numbers
but<00:02:17.829> maybe<00:02:18.070> just<00:02:18.190> not<00:02:18.489> as<00:02:18.610> many<00:02:18.790> reps<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.299> I<00:02:19.329> got

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
but maybe just not as many reps so I got

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.330 
but maybe just not as many reps so I got
515<00:02:20.350> for<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.620> single<00:02:21.040> which<00:02:21.160> you'll<00:02:21.310> see

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
515 for a single which you'll see

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.000 
515 for a single which you'll see
followed<00:02:22.209> by<00:02:22.329> 545<00:02:23.140> for<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.440> single<00:02:23.769> which<00:02:23.890> will

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
followed by 545 for a single which will

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.220 
followed by 545 for a single which will
also<00:02:24.220> see<00:02:24.670> now<00:02:25.209> these<00:02:25.420> reps<00:02:25.690> are<00:02:25.840> pretty<00:02:25.989> grimy

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
also see now these reps are pretty grimy

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.350 
also see now these reps are pretty grimy
and<00:02:26.560> in<00:02:26.650> fact<00:02:26.920> they're<00:02:27.130> all<00:02:27.280> fairly<00:02:27.760> high<00:02:28.060> as

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
and in fact they're all fairly high as

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.509 
and in fact they're all fairly high as
well<00:02:28.750> but<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.500> really<00:02:29.590> just<00:02:29.829> need<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.220> get<00:02:30.340> my

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
well but I really just need to get my

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.759 
well but I really just need to get my
mind<00:02:30.790> right<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.209> fix<00:02:31.810> my<00:02:32.019> programming<00:02:32.650> so

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
mind right and fix my programming so

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.229 
mind right and fix my programming so
this<00:02:32.920> is<00:02:33.070> one<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.370> reasons<00:02:33.760> why<00:02:33.880> I<00:02:33.910> haven't

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
this is one of the reasons why I haven't

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.940 
this is one of the reasons why I haven't
released<00:02:34.600> this<00:02:34.840> program<00:02:35.290> yet<00:02:35.500> this<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:35.829> the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
released this program yet this is the

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.250 
released this program yet this is the
first<00:02:36.160> time<00:02:36.310> I've<00:02:36.519> run<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:37.000> peaking<00:02:37.480> phase<00:02:37.840> in

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
first time I've run a peaking phase in

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.310 
first time I've run a peaking phase in
conjunction<00:02:39.070> with<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.640> normal<00:02:40.120> work<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:41.230> I'm

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
conjunction with the normal work so I'm

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.990 
conjunction with the normal work so I'm
still<00:02:41.680> trying<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.010> figure<00:02:42.160> things<00:02:42.489> out<00:02:42.610> just<00:02:42.670> a

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
still trying to figure things out just a

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.550 
still trying to figure things out just a
little<00:02:43.030> bit<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.540> what<00:02:43.660> this<00:02:43.810> tells<00:02:44.049> me<00:02:44.170> really

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
little bit and what this tells me really

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.770 
little bit and what this tells me really
is<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:44.769> need<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.040> tweak<00:02:45.280> things<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.820> little<00:02:46.690> bit

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
is I need to tweak things a little bit

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.750 
is I need to tweak things a little bit
on<00:02:46.870> this<00:02:47.049> week<00:02:47.260> definitely<00:02:47.680> but<00:02:48.430> more<00:02:48.610> than

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
on this week definitely but more than

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.940 
on this week definitely but more than
likely<00:02:49.000> more<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.810> previous<00:02:50.230> week<00:02:50.410> because<00:02:50.769> as

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
likely more the previous week because as

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.500 
likely more the previous week because as
you<00:02:51.100> guys<00:02:51.250> heard<00:02:51.400> from<00:02:51.459> my<00:02:51.700> commentary<00:02:52.239> that

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
you guys heard from my commentary that

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.199 
you guys heard from my commentary that
straight<00:02:52.930> kicked<00:02:53.410> my<00:02:53.769> ass<00:02:54.010> doing<00:02:54.610> four<00:02:54.970> sets

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
straight kicked my ass doing four sets

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.569 
straight kicked my ass doing four sets
of<00:02:55.360> three<00:02:55.570> with<00:02:55.720> 90%<00:02:56.440> so<00:02:56.950> maybe<00:02:57.190> I'll<00:02:57.340> cut<00:02:57.549> down

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
of three with 90% so maybe I'll cut down

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.490 
of three with 90% so maybe I'll cut down
on<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.910> volume<00:02:58.150> or<00:02:58.450> maybe<00:02:58.630> even<00:02:58.750> just<00:02:59.079> tweak

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
on the volume or maybe even just tweak

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.380 
on the volume or maybe even just tweak
the<00:02:59.650> intensity<00:03:00.130> just<00:03:00.160> a<00:03:00.459> little<00:03:00.670> bit<00:03:00.850> it's

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
the intensity just a little bit it's

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.060 
the intensity just a little bit it's
gonna<00:03:01.570> have<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:02.019> give<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.320> some<00:03:02.350> play<00:03:02.709> to<00:03:02.769> see

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
gonna have to give it some play to see

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.770 
gonna have to give it some play to see
how<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.310> feels<00:03:03.519> only<00:03:03.910> because<00:03:04.239> for<00:03:04.630> this

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
how it feels only because for this

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.530 
how it feels only because for this
peaking<00:03:05.320> phase<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:06.430> should<00:03:06.730> be<00:03:06.850> overreaching

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
peaking phase you should be overreaching

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.970 
peaking phase you should be overreaching
a<00:03:07.630> bit<00:03:07.840> but<00:03:08.049> not<00:03:08.199> to<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.470> point<00:03:08.650> where<00:03:08.769> you're

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
a bit but not to the point where you're

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.110 
a bit but not to the point where you're
burning<00:03:09.310> out<00:03:09.400> like<00:03:09.609> I<00:03:09.730> did<00:03:09.790> on<00:03:10.030> this

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
burning out like I did on this

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.040 
burning out like I did on this
particular

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
particular

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.420 
particular
so<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.290> rest<00:03:11.470> of<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.650> week<00:03:11.770> I'm<00:03:11.950> gonna<00:03:12.100> change

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
so the rest of the week I'm gonna change

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.980 
so the rest of the week I'm gonna change
things<00:03:12.700> up<00:03:12.850> a<00:03:12.910> little<00:03:13.030> bit<00:03:13.270> see<00:03:13.510> how<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.810> goes

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
things up a little bit see how that goes

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.320 
things up a little bit see how that goes
the<00:03:14.770> third<00:03:15.010> week<00:03:15.220> I'm<00:03:15.460> still<00:03:15.760> gonna<00:03:15.880> stick<00:03:16.210> to

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
the third week I'm still gonna stick to

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.330 
the third week I'm still gonna stick to
my<00:03:16.420> plan<00:03:16.480> which<00:03:16.900> is<00:03:17.050> basically<00:03:17.380> just<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.950> two

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
my plan which is basically just a two

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.170 
my plan which is basically just a two
day<00:03:18.820> workout<00:03:19.660> week<00:03:19.990> full<00:03:20.500> of<00:03:20.560> D<00:03:20.980> loads<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:21.640> 3<00:03:22.060> by

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
day workout week full of D loads so 3 by

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.360 
day workout week full of D loads so 3 by
3<00:03:22.330> s<00:03:22.510> with<00:03:22.600> 50%<00:03:22.930> leading<00:03:23.620> up<00:03:23.740> to<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:23.980> meet<00:03:24.160> and

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
3 s with 50% leading up to the meet and

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.340 
3 s with 50% leading up to the meet and
I<00:03:24.700> think<00:03:24.910> I'll<00:03:25.000> still<00:03:25.210> be<00:03:25.360> in<00:03:25.480> good<00:03:25.510> shape<00:03:25.900> the

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
I think I'll still be in good shape the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.900 
I think I'll still be in good shape the
good<00:03:26.530> thing<00:03:26.710> for<00:03:26.890> me<00:03:27.040> in<00:03:27.190> my<00:03:27.340> opinion<00:03:27.460> is<00:03:27.880> that

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
good thing for me in my opinion is that

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.720 
good thing for me in my opinion is that
I<00:03:28.030> was<00:03:28.180> still<00:03:28.390> able<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.690> get<00:03:28.840> 545<00:03:29.710> which<00:03:30.040> is<00:03:30.220> my

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
I was still able to get 545 which is my

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.000 
I was still able to get 545 which is my
