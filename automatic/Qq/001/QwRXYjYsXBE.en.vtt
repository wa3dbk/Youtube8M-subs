00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
a removable slap I suggest rechargeables

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.300 
a removable slap I suggest rechargeables

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
other people around me on the enemy team

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.700 
other people around me on the enemy team
and<00:01:11.340> such<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> very<00:01:12.810> nice<00:01:13.020> feature<00:01:13.229> it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
and such it's a very nice feature it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.210 
and such it's a very nice feature it
also<00:01:13.950> has<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.490> worst<00:01:15.420> way<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.869> future<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:17.009> if

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
also has a worst way the future so if

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.859 
also has a worst way the future so if
the<00:01:17.400> blood<00:01:17.549> volume<00:01:17.909> goes<00:01:18.090> up<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.360> ton<00:01:18.600> and

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the blood volume goes up a ton and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.749 
the blood volume goes up a ton and
normally<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.070> wouldn't<00:01:20.280> be<00:01:20.400> able<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.640> hear

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.149 
normally you wouldn't be able to hear
your<00:01:20.880> teammates<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:22.049> one<00:01:22.320> rises<00:01:22.799> up<00:01:22.950> with
