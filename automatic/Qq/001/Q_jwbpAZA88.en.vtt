00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.869
 importo pinto beccue saves a 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.170
 bible of faith, there is nothing left but I know that 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:29.039
 I have a short life in your question 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.320
 of my duo is formed by talent is 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.510
 owner of one of the most admired voices in 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.610
 the backcountry circuit, besides being 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.640
 expert in composing hits 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.800
 the other is very common. 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.579
 most respected musical producers in the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.500
 neighborhood 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.200
 We are talking to Fernando and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.329
 Create alert 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.879
 now they only come for the first time 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.879
 lack of the spa and increase my 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.090
 Wow 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.880
 On the 11th we wanted the drawer already 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.150
 and spent 7 million views on 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.530
 youtube where the idea of the clip came 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.159
 so for the first time the composers 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.409
 It's me and Bruno Caliman is at least in the 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.690
 our scheme came up with our office 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.790
 the whole script of the song and even this 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.259
 opened the head of other artists 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.720
 only because the composer when he 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.790
 does the song have it has more or 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.799
 least hawaii where you want to mind 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.780
 of the person when you make music is 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.149
 logical that it is somewhat abstract is the 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.880
 fifth drawer people passing by 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.740
 shipwrecked nÃ© who has accompanied knows more 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.869
 is one of the highlights is that I 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.450
 I can say this is the first time that 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.039
 composers who used 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.890
 Alex who did the filming but who 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.319
 used the paths there of the clip 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.080
 fifth is burst on the net is a clip 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.390
 that draws attention 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.159
 it's worth checking our show drawer 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.929
 on the road that has always been highly praised 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.720
 is one of the highlights of our career 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:10.569
 is the way it presents itself is the 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.220
 not only the wea mix and music one 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.959
 pinch of magic with a pinch of 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.630
 technology then I think the video was 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.820
 Incredible and logical music status 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.870
 like the drawer that today is among the top 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.080
 Five of Brazil is then 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.280
 the cool repertoire but really was 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.280
 has printed our master's degree 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.840
 that alone we spoke everything to us is accurate to 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.330
 a dvd so do not show that really 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.590
 What is the show of fernando and sorocaba and 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.989
 I think we managed to convey 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:45.269
 on this record with some songs 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.010
 totally unpublished songs that also 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.220
 I still did not know how 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.299
 cruelly touched the drawer that came out 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.579
 pulling this DVD is sure to be the 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.319
 landmark is more expensive but also known 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.060
 by group 8 is not but is the first time 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.069
 that you play together here today in 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.299
 spa not with the expectation of the show 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.670
 of today 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.489
 the expectation is total we are very 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.200
 happy because it's the house was one of 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.230
 pioneers here in camboriu resort 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.609
 to really bring the backcountry award 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.150
 to the city right? 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.159
 so it's a house that really brings 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.140
 nice people to people who form opinions and 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.060
 from brazil the bonnaroo as wilson 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.750
 tourist spot is a lot of people pass by 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.090
 on here 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.980
 So this house for me is not a 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.660
 sertaneja music is a milestone for the 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.829
 sertaneja music in brazil 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.750
 I'm very happy with what's coming 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.760
 happening to the country music here 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.400
 in Santa Catarina and here in Monaco as 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.200
 I hope it spreads more and more 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.349
 by regions such as northeast and river 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.030
 January she keep giving very pro 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.829

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.090
 in addition all the houses have in the super well 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.760
 the guys are not taking our music 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.599
 farther back 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.640
 it's a way to love I want to be yours 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.840

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.840
 People go there alone. 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.990
 this was more super real estate show 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:20.100

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:22.710

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.250
 social 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.460
 It's my way of being, but if I 'm going to 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.840
 that way not a bit 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.840
 I know you do not want to see 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:44.500
