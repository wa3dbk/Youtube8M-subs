here first give us a little more cable

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.220 
here first give us a little more cable
to<00:02:21.220> work<00:02:21.400> with<00:02:21.610> then<00:02:22.480> when<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:22.780> slide<00:02:23.079> it

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
to work with then when I slide it

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:30.670 
to work with then when I slide it
through<00:02:23.260> this<00:02:23.470> hole<00:02:23.709> here

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.140 

don't<00:02:31.680> want<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.920> go<00:02:32.010> on<00:02:32.100> into<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.400> spring<00:02:32.820> want

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
don't want to go on into the spring want

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.380 
don't want to go on into the spring want
to<00:02:33.210> come<00:02:33.330> out<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.840> side<00:02:34.790> there<00:02:35.790> we<00:02:35.910> go<00:02:38.390> see

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
to come out to the side there we go see

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.120 
to come out to the side there we go see
so<00:02:39.720> now<00:02:40.290> what<00:02:40.530> we're<00:02:40.620> going<00:02:40.740> to<00:02:40.770> do<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.040> going

I'll<00:03:10.680> make<00:03:10.860> sure<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.280> break<00:03:11.490> is<00:03:11.700> almost

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
I'll make sure the break is almost

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.040 
I'll make sure the break is almost
touching<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.540> will<00:03:12.750> down<00:03:12.930> here<00:03:13.610> okay<00:03:15.050> we

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.100 

so<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.700> just<00:03:24.030> tighten<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.330> up

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.070 

now<00:03:29.090> now<00:03:30.090> we're<00:03:30.300> going<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.540> going<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.780> try<00:03:31.020> it

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
now now we're going to going to try it

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.620 
now now we're going to going to try it
we're<00:03:31.230> going<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.410> squeeze<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.770> handle<00:03:32.630> let's

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
we're going to squeeze the handle let's

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.770 
we're going to squeeze the handle let's
see<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.930> wheels<00:03:34.110> not<00:03:34.290> moving<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:35.700> now<00:03:36.630> we're

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
see the wheels not moving and now we're

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.820 
see the wheels not moving and now we're
going<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.930> try<00:03:37.050> to<00:03:37.110> make<00:03:37.320> sure<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.620> when<00:03:37.740> you

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
going to try to make sure that when you

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.920 
going to try to make sure that when you
push<00:03:38.010> down<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.370> lock<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.880> lock<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.450> wheel

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
push down the lock the lock the wheel

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.320 
push down the lock the lock the wheel
it's<00:03:40.200> easy<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.590> lock<00:03:40.740> see<00:03:41.010> how<00:03:41.130> easy<00:03:41.340> does<00:03:41.580> it

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
it's easy to lock see how easy does it

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.730 
it's easy to lock see how easy does it
see<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.600> wheels<00:03:42.780> lock<00:03:42.990> so<00:03:43.260> that's<00:03:43.410> actually

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
see the wheels lock so that's actually

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.070 
see the wheels lock so that's actually
perfect<00:03:44.190> then<00:03:45.120> what<00:03:45.270> we'll<00:03:45.390> do<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:45.630> we'll<00:03:45.780> take

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
perfect then what we'll do is we'll take

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.590 
perfect then what we'll do is we'll take
a<00:03:46.140> nice<00:03:46.440> pair<00:03:46.710> of<00:03:46.770> pliers<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.940> side<00:03:48.210> cutters

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
a nice pair of pliers the side cutters

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.240 
a nice pair of pliers the side cutters
and<00:03:48.720> just<00:03:48.780> make<00:03:49.050> a<00:03:49.080> clean<00:03:49.350> cut<00:03:49.430> like<00:03:50.430> that

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
and just make a clean cut like that

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.300 
and just make a clean cut like that
these<00:03:53.250> are<00:03:53.400> little<00:03:53.550> end<00:03:53.760> caps<00:03:54.090> right<00:03:54.930> here<00:03:55.310> the

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
these are little end caps right here the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.960 
these are little end caps right here the
crimp<00:03:56.700> ends<00:03:57.030> part<00:03:57.750> number<00:04:00.740> pc2<00:04:01.740> focus<00:04:02.310> but

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
crimp ends part number pc2 focus but

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.000 
crimp ends part number pc2 focus but
anyways<00:04:03.770> what<00:04:04.770> we<00:04:04.860> do<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:06.350> get<00:04:07.350> these<00:04:07.530> caps<00:04:07.830> out

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
anyways what we do is get these caps out

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.040 
anyways what we do is get these caps out
if<00:04:08.160> they<00:04:08.250> want<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.459> come<00:04:08.640> out<00:04:11.330> put<00:04:12.330> around<00:04:12.540> over

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
if they want to come out put around over

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:18.370 
if they want to come out put around over
the<00:04:13.170> cable<00:04:14.090> whoops

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.550 

slide<00:04:18.950> it<00:04:19.100> right<00:04:19.130> over<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.580> cable<00:04:20.200> man<00:04:21.200> keep

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
slide it right over the cable man keep

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.160 
slide it right over the cable man keep
dropping<00:04:21.950> it<00:04:22.750> these<00:04:23.750> are<00:04:23.900> really<00:04:24.110> small<00:04:24.410> so<00:04:26.170> if

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
dropping it these are really small so if

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.760 
dropping it these are really small so if
you<00:04:27.320> drop<00:04:27.590> it<00:04:27.620> that's<00:04:27.980> okay<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:28.940> don't<00:04:28.970> break

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
you drop it that's okay you don't break

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.550 
you drop it that's okay you don't break
you<00:04:30.770> slide<00:04:31.010> it<00:04:31.130> over<00:04:31.220> the<00:04:31.340> cable<00:04:31.760> like<00:04:31.970> that

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
you slide it over the cable like that

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.990 
you slide it over the cable like that
then<00:04:33.560> you<00:04:33.740> just<00:04:35.260> crimp<00:04:36.260> it<00:04:36.730> and<00:04:37.730> what<00:04:37.880> that

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
then you just crimp it and what that

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.360 
then you just crimp it and what that
does<00:04:38.150> it<00:04:38.360> keeps<00:04:38.570> it<00:04:38.750> from<00:04:38.900> a<00:04:39.050> friend<00:04:39.800> there's

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
does it keeps it from a friend there's

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.390 
does it keeps it from a friend there's
still<00:04:40.610> cable<00:04:41.030> coming<00:04:41.390> undone<00:04:41.660> and<00:04:41.840> fraying

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
still cable coming undone and fraying

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.620 
still cable coming undone and fraying
otherwise<00:04:43.660> it<00:04:44.660> will<00:04:44.900> fray<00:04:45.230> okay<00:04:46.220> and<00:04:47.060> that's

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
otherwise it will fray okay and that's
