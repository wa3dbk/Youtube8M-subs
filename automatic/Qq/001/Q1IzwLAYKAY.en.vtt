00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.980
 natural selection was the first 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.469
 adequate explanation of the evolution without 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.070
 However, with that theory, he failed to explain 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:17.620
 some very important aspects why 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.230
 the theory of evolution that he formulated 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.630
 Darwin has been enriched with 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.240
 numerous investigations for example 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.920
 the students of genetics have 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.170
 showed that the variations of the 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.810
 organisms arise by mutation and 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.820
 genetic recombination between 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.770
 geneticists who contributed most to 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.620
 formulate synthetic theory 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.670
 evolution highlights the biologist of origin 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.290
 Russian theodore tots sants and biologists 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.630
 who study the distribution of 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.760
 species have found that they present themselves 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.460
 differences between them according to the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.880
 region that they inhabit like this began to 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.460
 understand reproductive isolation 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.870
 the results of these investigations 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.290
 they were integrated into the synthetic theory 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.869
 by researchers like Ernesto means 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.000
 This mode is enriched day by day 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.820
 explanations given by the various branches 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.730
 of biology to synthesize it into a 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.310
 most complete and solid theory theory 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.770
 synthetic of evolution when they are born 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.770
 new living beings each one has 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.780
 particular characteristics is to say 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.510
 presents great variation among 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.360
 individuals of the population this fact is 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.860
 check to see that each individual 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.770
 even if he looks like his parents or 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.290
 brothers have some characteristics 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.170
 own and distinct for example in their 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.330
 size this variation is presented in 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.950
 all populations and is due to 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.649
 differences in genetic information 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.200
 of each individual which occur by 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.119
 mutation and recombination on that 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.640
 variation between the organisms of a 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.220
 same species acts natural selection 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.080
 of all the individuals that form a 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.030
 population or living in a place 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.850
 determined only some achieve 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.670
 survive and reproduce for example 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.619
 some die when they are small 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.050
 be able to withstand the effects of the environment 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.509
 others fail to escape their 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.870
 predators 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.480
 some more can not get enough 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.159
 food in this way the environment goes 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.989
 selecting the organisms with 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:21.599
 variations that make them 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.180
 adapted to the environment at the time of 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.120
 reproduction and those characteristics are 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.849
 inherit the descendants so little to 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.010
 little the population is changing until 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.170
 its members are very different from the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.269
 living elsewhere when 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.819
 organisms are so different that they no longer 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.769
 you can play this then 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.579
 means that a new one has been formed 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.579
 species
