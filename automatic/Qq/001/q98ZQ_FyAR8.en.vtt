00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.639
 there are battles in which you want to fight and 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.389
 battles that seek to avoid this is a 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.389
 in which you have to fight 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.710
 when I was elected mayor this was a 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.920
 city â€‹â€‹in crisis who says that that has 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.920
 changed 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.680
 step by step and has been raising the 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.770
 he says he has not changed 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.750
 Mr. Mayor, you see a hero in my eyes 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.750
 thank you, you like hunting 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.880
 but it would not look very good 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.260
 I do not know if you understand it well you find the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.260
 bastard who sleeps with my wife 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:04.960
 the spirit tell me is that we have 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.960
 and the view and you'll like to come 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.270
 you have an envelope with photographs 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.100
 and I paid them 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.390
 when he called me he thought it was for another 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.340
 thing 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.360
 then we will see what this 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.050
 and that you do now prepare for executions 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.540
 and he gave him some pictures and I did not do anything else 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.020
 they are sad 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.680
 you asked yourself why I chose you 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.680
 because I have you 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.650
 talk 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.990
 that's something that the ordinary citizen does not 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.990
 I would come to understand 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.220
 is a dangerous man, others are the ones 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.220
 they kill for him 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.840
 that is the line makes a curtain
