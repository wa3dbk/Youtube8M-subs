00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.520 
able to KO it after even plat +6 I'd be
really<00:02:00.390> struggling<00:02:00.719> because<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.170> think<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.500> a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
really struggling because I think is a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.249 
really struggling because I think is a
massive<00:02:02.130> special<00:02:02.490> defense<00:02:02.759> tank<00:02:03.119> okay<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.079> I

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
massive special defense tank okay so I

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.690 
massive special defense tank okay so I
hope<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.560> don't<00:02:04.770> get<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.920> don't<00:02:05.340> actually

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
hope you don't get I don't actually

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.969 
hope you don't get I don't actually

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.400 
quite get credit here which is good so
I'm<00:02:08.399> thinking<00:02:08.849> it'll<00:02:09.060> probably<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.750> I'd

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
I'm thinking it'll probably have I'd

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.260 
I'm thinking it'll probably have I'd
said<00:02:10.830> probably<00:02:11.099> have<00:02:11.250> natural<00:02:11.580> cure<00:02:11.790> over<00:02:12.090> to

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
said probably have natural cure over to

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.370 
said probably have natural cure over to
serene<00:02:12.750> grace<00:02:12.959> so

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
serene grace so

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.700 
serene grace so
I<00:02:13.440> put<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.010> sleep<00:02:14.130> there<00:02:15.710> regardless

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
I put it to sleep there regardless

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.950 
I put it to sleep there regardless
rather<00:02:17.010> stays<00:02:17.400> in<00:02:17.640> or<00:02:17.910> was<00:02:18.240> which<00:02:18.450> out<00:02:18.660> doesn't

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
rather stays in or was which out doesn't

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.630 
rather stays in or was which out doesn't
really<00:02:19.110> matter<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.860> can<00:02:20.160> get<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:20.370> bet<00:02:20.610> and

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
really matter I can get this bet and

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.470 
really matter I can get this bet and
pass<00:02:20.910> off<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.420> go<00:02:21.690> into<00:02:21.720> Combee<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:24.330> the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
pass off and go into Combee and so the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.170 
pass off and go into Combee and so the
opponent<00:02:24.780> does<00:02:24.930> go<00:02:25.710> into<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.100> victreebel<00:02:26.880> as

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
opponent does go into the victreebel as

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.460 
opponent does go into the victreebel as
I<00:02:27.270> thought<00:02:27.390> they<00:02:27.540> would<00:02:27.570> because<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.080> get

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
I thought they would because of a get

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.270 
I thought they would because of a get
rid<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.800> spice<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:30.050> yeah<00:02:31.070> let's<00:02:32.070> go<00:02:32.250> a

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
rid of the spice and yeah let's go a

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.790
