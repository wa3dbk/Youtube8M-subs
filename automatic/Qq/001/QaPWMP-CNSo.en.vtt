00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.830
 Today I'm going to show you a couple of 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.640
 new tools and utensils 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.290
 we have 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.940
 it's about although it seems simple it's very 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.620
 to think and tighten the knots on 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.510
 all when we use very fat nylon 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.160
 or when we put hooks and some 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.910
 typical pearl practices 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.520
 interchangeable that will allow us 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.410
 have the mothers mounted and add or 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.869
 remove hooks depending on the bait on 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.630
 fish that we go fishing or the nylon that 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.790
 we want to use lame the nylon and 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.630
 I make a glasses and take the hook and I 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.630
 I put in the same position 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.910
 at this time all the fingers and what 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.280
 I do is think this yellow up 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.980
 that is there to be able to not be left 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.539
 very long to pass with your fingers 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.100
 in the center because what I do is 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.420
 open your fingers and go for a spin 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.420
 around the fishhook 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.630
 to tie this type of soil to the 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.630
 least I give it seven or eight laps 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.790
 came to the end and left a finger inside the 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.720
 subjects from here and pulled him 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.309
 from the other party 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.640
 and I have not finished yet 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.640
 think 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.979
 that the tense pulling the part 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.049
 Now is when I need to tighten the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.570
 hook for the knot to be strong 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.479
 strong and that's when I'm going to use this 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.759
 practice starts that we're going to get 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.520
 avoid sticking the hook to prevent 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.020
 they are fastened to the table good before 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.420
 did in many ways with another hook 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.159
 big tied with a fat thread for this 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.460
 It is very practical because I come here subject 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.619
 took the knot 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.979
 at the head of the hook and only what 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.979
 what do i do 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.290
 all the security 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.730
 until the end and we can start the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.730
 perlite Fund 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.090
 we can do it before what happens to 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.040
 good as it is tiny with fingers 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.860
 fat is a problem 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.989
 before doing the knot butt I like 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.209
 put a micro bead is a micro 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.370
 perlita of these that will help us 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.200
 make the stop so that the knot is not 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.680
 that hits right against the pearl and give it 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.680
 greater resistance 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.819
 as well 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.319
 at this point I make the new top 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.120
 I have explained some more but good 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.629
 I 'm going to repeat it 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.629
 a loop 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.680
 the thinner the nylon and the fatter 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.930
 we want to do it we do this operation 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.900
 more times to another loop and what I do is 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.960
 catch with nylon 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.230
 and past 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.830
 the two loops at once 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.240
 if this new yale I close 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.160
 what I'm going to get is that I stay 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.600
 a nylon ball 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.180
 as a pearlite it is as if 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.180
 stuck a pearlite and so we would mount 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.459
 so many hooks with 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.240
 if you want to rig a rig 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.880
 I'm going to ride alone 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.200
 a couple of stops to put the allow 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.959
 that you see 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.450
 in we take the mother and we make the knot 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.260
 what we do whenever it is 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.260
 one round here 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.650
 and instead of closing it we would stay 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.240
 twisted the knot 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.960
 we passed him twice 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.960
 this knot 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.970
 and we will make a cap 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.910
 and we are going to do the following 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.140
 it's a knot 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.140
 and we passed him again 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.010
 I'm going to catch a needle behind the bait 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.170
 because in the end what I want is that 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.050
 the pearl is in a certain space 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.730
 from the mother line 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.530
 I'm going to address it and now I close the 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.170
 knot I can not fall where he 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.550
 however, helping me with a little needle and 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.150
 of the fingers I carry a knot up 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.150
 where I want 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.270
 in the place that I want 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.300
 correct stay to put it to the 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.919
 pearlite quick coupler and you have only 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.450
 it has been traveled and then it is very 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.790
 simple once we have the rig 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:43.490
 we take it like this folded 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.220
 we take the pearlite and as you see in a 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.700
 long part that is ready for 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.890
 I hold it with my fingers 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.960
 I go to the line I simply look for the 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.700
 mother line and what I do is a small 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.760
 tension until it clicks 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.000
 and I have the line stuck in the pearlite 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.000
 menu 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.610
 from here the subject is subject and what 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.039
 I do it backwards 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.710
 he took it off and put it on as many times as 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.659
 necessary is very practical and will give us 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.080
 many times weakness in our 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:22.080
 rigging 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.839
