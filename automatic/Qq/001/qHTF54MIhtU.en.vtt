00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
with the Denver Broncos I look at the

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.180 
with the Denver Broncos I look at the

defense<00:00:54.040> as<00:00:54.220> far<00:00:54.400> as<00:00:54.489> stop<00:00:54.699> at<00:00:54.850> a<00:00:54.909> run<00:00:55.089> but<00:00:55.510> when

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
defense as far as stop at a run but when

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:56.850 
defense as far as stop at a run but when
you<00:00:55.720> look<00:00:55.870> at<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.050> offensive<00:00:56.470> side<00:00:56.739> the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
you look at the offensive side the

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.469 
you look at the offensive side the
football<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.580> only<00:00:57.790> thing<00:00:57.970> that<00:00:58.089> has<00:00:58.299> to<00:00:58.330> be

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
football the only thing that has to be

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:59.910 
football the only thing that has to be
said<00:00:58.809> is<00:00:59.019> that<00:00:59.199> they<00:00:59.409> got<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.620> get<00:00:59.739> back<00:00:59.860> to

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
said is that they got to get back to

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.460 
said is that they got to get back to
what<00:01:00.190> made<00:01:00.430> Peyton<00:01:00.970> Manning<00:01:01.330> special<00:01:01.930> I<00:01:02.049> think

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
what made Peyton Manning special I think

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.110 
what made Peyton Manning special I think
they<00:01:02.589> can<00:01:02.769> do<00:01:02.920> so<00:01:03.100> let's<00:01:03.309> go<00:01:03.430> inside<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.970> lads

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
they can do so let's go inside the lads

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.580 
they can do so let's go inside the lads
and<00:01:04.269> see<00:01:04.420> how<00:01:04.600> that<00:01:04.659> you<00:01:04.900> get<00:01:05.080> back<00:01:05.260> to<00:01:05.409> basics

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
and see how that you get back to basics

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.760 
and see how that you get back to basics
I<00:01:06.060> think<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.240> Denver<00:01:07.540> Broncos<00:01:07.570> can<00:01:08.290> have<00:01:08.560> some

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
I think the Denver Broncos can have some

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.380 
I think the Denver Broncos can have some
success<00:01:08.799> versus<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.610> oakland<00:01:09.970> raiders<00:01:10.240> if

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
success versus to oakland raiders if

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.420 
success versus to oakland raiders if
they<00:01:10.540> go<00:01:10.780> to<00:01:10.840> an<00:01:11.049> ace<00:01:11.290> formation<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.100> it's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
they go to an ace formation and it's

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.430 
they go to an ace formation and it's
almost<00:01:12.909> getting<00:01:13.240> back<00:01:13.600> to<00:01:13.810> what<00:01:13.960> paid<00:01:14.229> man

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
almost getting back to what paid man

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.620 
almost getting back to what paid man
used<00:01:14.680> to<00:01:14.710> do<00:01:14.860> within<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:15.700> first<00:01:15.940> five<00:01:16.600> years

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
used to do within the first five years

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.450 
used to do within the first five years
or<00:01:17.230> so<00:01:17.350> when<00:01:17.530> he<00:01:17.650> was<00:01:17.680> with<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:17.920> Indianapolis

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
or so when he was with the Indianapolis

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.740 
or so when he was with the Indianapolis
post<00:01:18.670> which<00:01:18.820> is<00:01:18.850> why<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:19.210> play<00:01:19.390> action<00:01:19.540> was

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
post which is why that play action was

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.510 
post which is why that play action was
so<00:01:19.870> deadly<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.590> reason<00:01:20.860> why<00:01:20.980> i<00:01:21.010> like<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.370> ace

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
so deadly the reason why i like the ace

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.520 
so deadly the reason why i like the ace
get<00:01:22.000> balance<00:01:22.450> on<00:01:22.600> both<00:01:22.780> sides<00:01:23.050> you<00:01:23.200> have<00:01:23.230> two

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
get balance on both sides you have two

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.100 
get balance on both sides you have two
tight<00:01:23.770> ends<00:01:23.980> so<00:01:24.460> you<00:01:24.940> force<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:25.510> defensive

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
tight ends so you force the defensive

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.840 
tight ends so you force the defensive
play<00:01:26.290> a<00:01:26.320> certain<00:01:26.620> weight<00:01:27.010> so<00:01:27.400> now<00:01:27.550> you<00:01:27.610> got

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
play a certain weight so now you got

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.790 
play a certain weight so now you got
equal<00:01:28.270> over<00:01:28.540> here<00:01:28.780> equal<00:01:29.260> over<00:01:29.440> there<00:01:29.560> you<00:01:29.650> got

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
equal over here equal over there you got

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.980 
equal over here equal over there you got
four<00:01:30.070> guys<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.520> defend<00:01:30.820> over<00:01:31.000> here<00:01:31.240> for<00:01:31.750> guys

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
four guys to defend over here for guys

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.710 
four guys to defend over here for guys
to<00:01:32.140> defend<00:01:32.470> over<00:01:32.650> there<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.550> i<00:01:33.700> like<00:01:34.150> this<00:01:34.390> for

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
to defend over there and i like this for

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.720 
to defend over there and i like this for
me<00:01:34.900> and<00:01:34.930> i<00:01:35.170> think<00:01:35.410> this<00:01:35.560> can<00:01:35.770> have<00:01:35.980> a<00:01:36.190> huge

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
me and i think this can have a huge

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.700 
me and i think this can have a huge
effect<00:01:37.000> on<00:01:37.300> that<00:01:37.450> Raiders<00:01:37.960> defense<00:01:37.990> because

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
effect on that Raiders defense because

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.260 
effect on that Raiders defense because
you<00:01:38.740> widen<00:01:39.160> everything<00:01:39.610> out<00:01:39.760> and<00:01:39.790> you<00:01:40.060> take

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
you widen everything out and you take

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.450 
you widen everything out and you take
advantage<00:01:40.720> of<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:41.110> individual<00:01:41.830> matchups<00:01:42.100> and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
advantage of the individual matchups and

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.070 
advantage of the individual matchups and
let's<00:01:42.850> be<00:01:43.030> honest<00:01:43.300> these<00:01:43.420> receivers<00:01:43.750> the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
let's be honest these receivers the

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.080 
let's be honest these receivers the
Demaryius<00:01:44.620> Thomas<00:01:44.650> and<00:01:45.190> Eric<00:01:45.430> Decker<00:01:45.760> they're

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
Demaryius Thomas and Eric Decker they're

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.180 
Demaryius Thomas and Eric Decker they're
big<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.630> physical<00:01:46.930> guys<00:01:47.410> they<00:01:47.920> probably

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
big and physical guys they probably

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.210 
big and physical guys they probably
would<00:01:48.910> do<00:01:49.030> better<00:01:49.300> out<00:01:49.900> of<00:01:49.960> a<00:01:50.320> base<00:01:50.590> set<00:01:50.950> like

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
would do better out of a base set like

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.010 
would do better out of a base set like
this<00:01:51.430> and<00:01:51.850> let's<00:01:52.030> say<00:01:52.120> you've<00:01:52.360> run<00:01:52.600> you<00:01:52.810> want

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
this and let's say you've run you want

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.420 
this and let's say you've run you want
to<00:01:53.080> run<00:01:53.230> this<00:01:53.380> stretch<00:01:53.740> out<00:01:53.980> here<00:01:54.310> this

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
to run this stretch out here this

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.950 
to run this stretch out here this
outside<00:01:54.909> zone<00:01:55.180> you<00:01:55.300> want<00:01:55.480> to<00:01:55.540> run<00:01:55.659> his<00:01:55.840> own

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
outside zone you want to run his own

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.070 
outside zone you want to run his own
paid<00:01:56.560> man<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.890> opens<00:01:57.280> up<00:01:57.400> and<00:01:57.870> play<00:01:58.870> action

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
paid man it opens up and play action

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.620 
paid man it opens up and play action
pass<00:01:59.290> so<00:01:59.560> he<00:01:59.620> drops<00:01:59.920> back<00:02:00.159> one<00:02:00.520> if<00:02:00.790> you<00:02:01.390> keep

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
pass so he drops back one if you keep

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.050 
pass so he drops back one if you keep
everybody<00:02:02.170> entertain<00:02:02.860> man<00:02:03.159> and<00:02:03.370> that's<00:02:03.550> why<00:02:03.760> I

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
everybody entertain man and that's why I

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.060 
everybody entertain man and that's why I
think<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:04.780> can<00:02:04.990> have<00:02:05.260> an<00:02:05.440> effect<00:02:05.530> you<00:02:05.890> have

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
think you can have an effect you have

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.130 
think you can have an effect you have
guys<00:02:06.250> entertained<00:02:06.700> this<00:02:07.360> guy's<00:02:07.630> running<00:02:07.930> out

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
guys entertained this guy's running out

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.830 
guys entertained this guy's running out
here<00:02:08.409> so<00:02:08.830> in<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.940> back<00:02:10.149> would<00:02:10.390> come<00:02:10.690> in

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
here so in the back would come in

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.229 
here so in the back would come in
essentially<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:11.830> chip<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.489> defensive<00:02:13.060> end

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
essentially and chip that defensive end

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.839 
essentially and chip that defensive end
but<00:02:13.750> then<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.050> have<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.590> guy's<00:02:15.400> peeling

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
but then you have that guy's peeling

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:16.979 
but then you have that guy's peeling
back<00:02:15.940> on<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.269> picking<00:02:16.510> up<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.659> end<00:02:16.780> but<00:02:16.900> you

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
back on and picking up the end but you

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.690 
back on and picking up the end but you
have<00:02:17.170> paid<00:02:17.739> man<00:02:17.890> is<00:02:18.040> setting<00:02:18.340> up<00:02:18.430> back

the look of max protectors you can

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.479 
the look of max protectors you can
either<00:02:22.510> keep<00:02:23.260> Tammy<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.830> backs<00:02:24.069> out<00:02:24.250> on<00:02:24.459> a

either keep Tammy and backs out on a

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.520 
either keep Tammy and backs out on a

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
delayed block a slow block the release

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.430 
delayed block a slow block the release
them<00:02:26.890> out<00:02:27.040> in<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.610> flat<00:02:27.849> also<00:02:28.629> have<00:02:28.870> your<00:02:29.230> tight

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
them out in a flat also have your tight

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.750 
them out in a flat also have your tight
injury<00:02:29.800> see<00:02:29.860> coming<00:02:30.160> down<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:30.310> way<00:02:30.459> Thomas

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
injury see coming down this way Thomas

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.309 
injury see coming down this way Thomas
working<00:02:31.239> his<00:02:31.330> way<00:02:31.360> up<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.810> way<00:02:31.959> down<00:02:32.170> the

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
working his way up that way down the

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.320 
working his way up that way down the
scene<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.769> it<00:02:33.220> puts<00:02:33.459> this<00:02:33.580> guy<00:02:33.790> in<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.090> bind

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
scene and it puts this guy in the bind

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.300 
scene and it puts this guy in the bind
and<00:02:34.690> I<00:02:34.870> think<00:02:35.110> that's<00:02:35.380> what<00:02:35.680> they<00:02:35.800> have<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.190> do

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
and I think that's what they have to do

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.680 
and I think that's what they have to do
they<00:02:36.459> have<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.790> find<00:02:37.030> ways<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.390> put<00:02:37.569> the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
they have to find ways to put the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.330 
they have to find ways to put the
secondary<00:02:38.230> players<00:02:38.470> in<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.709> bar<00:02:38.920> because

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
secondary players in the bar because

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.949 
secondary players in the bar because
when<00:02:39.519> you're<00:02:39.640> in<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.819> spread<00:02:40.209> formation<00:02:40.780> it

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
when you're in a spread formation it

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.170 
when you're in a spread formation it
kind<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.560> makes<00:02:41.739> yourself<00:02:42.160> easier<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.880> defend

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
kind of makes yourself easier to defend

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.970 
kind of makes yourself easier to defend
cuz<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:43.510> can<00:02:43.660> zone<00:02:43.959> it<00:02:44.110> up<00:02:44.230> but<00:02:44.620> right<00:02:44.769> here

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
cuz you can zone it up but right here

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.920 
cuz you can zone it up but right here
you<00:02:45.190> can<00:02:45.370> dictate<00:02:45.640> what<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.060> defense<00:02:46.510> does<00:02:46.720> with

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
you can dictate what a defense does with

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.570 
you can dictate what a defense does with
that<00:02:47.049> ace<00:02:47.200> formation<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:47.799> widens<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.250> out<00:02:48.370> and

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
that ace formation it widens it out and

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.160 
that ace formation it widens it out and
gives<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.150> more<00:02:49.360> of<00:02:49.390> an<00:02:49.540> advantage<00:02:49.840> of<00:02:50.019> the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
gives you more of an advantage of the

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.259 
gives you more of an advantage of the
Broncos<00:02:50.530> can<00:02:50.709> utilize<00:02:51.160> this<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:52.000> week

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
Broncos can utilize this this week

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.059 
Broncos can utilize this this week
versus<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.840> Raiders<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:53.349> think<00:02:53.739> they<00:02:53.799> can<00:02:53.830> have

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
versus the Raiders I think they can have

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.940 
versus the Raiders I think they can have
a<00:02:54.099> chance<00:02:54.459> now<00:02:55.349> let's<00:02:56.349> move<00:02:56.500> over<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.799> the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
a chance now let's move over to the

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.470 
a chance now let's move over to the
Oakland<00:02:57.340> Raiders<00:02:57.489> you<00:02:57.760> look<00:02:57.880> at<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.120> interior

that<00:03:27.910> defense<00:03:28.209> he<00:03:28.329> ought<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.480> make<00:03:28.600> the<00:03:28.720> right

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
make plays but I offensively I think

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.740 
make plays but I offensively I think
they<00:03:33.280> can<00:03:33.310> get<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.819> running<00:03:34.090> game<00:03:34.180> going<00:03:34.239> and

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
they can get the running game going and

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.180 
they can get the running game going and
I<00:03:34.959> want<00:03:35.260> them<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.530> get<00:03:35.650> more<00:03:35.920> creative

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
I want them to get more creative

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.309 
I want them to get more creative
utilizing<00:03:36.880> terrelle<00:03:37.120> pryor<00:03:37.450> in<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:38.079> red<00:03:38.290> zone

so let's go back into the life and see

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.960 
so let's go back into the life and see
how<00:03:40.120> they<00:03:40.299> can<00:03:40.359> do<00:03:40.540> that<00:03:40.569> this<00:03:40.900> week<00:03:41.970> i've

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
how they can do that this week i've

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.819 
how they can do that this week i've
already<00:03:43.239> said<00:03:43.690> i<00:03:43.720> think<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:44.200> raiders<00:03:44.590> could

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829

on<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.769> defense<00:03:53.920> let's<00:03:54.340> say<00:03:54.459> they're<00:03:54.670> on<00:03:54.760> the

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
on the defense let's say they're on the

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.819 
on the defense let's say they're on the
shotgun<00:03:55.329> this<00:03:55.810> is<00:03:55.959> your<00:03:56.109> tail<00:03:56.290> back<00:03:56.530> right

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
shotgun this is your tail back right

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.440 
shotgun this is your tail back right
there<00:03:57.069> so<00:03:57.310> whoever<00:03:57.579> that<00:03:57.760> run<00:03:58.060> it<00:03:58.180> back<00:03:58.299> it's

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
there so whoever that run it back it's

there so whoever that run it back it's
going<00:03:58.600> to<00:03:58.690> be<00:03:58.810> and<00:03:59.109> we're<00:03:59.350> going<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.530> give<00:04:00.160> the

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
going to be and we're going to give the

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.210 
going to be and we're going to give the
motion<00:04:00.819> this<00:04:01.209> way<00:04:01.540> why<00:04:02.290> because<00:04:02.859> we're<00:04:03.040> trying

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
motion this way why because we're trying

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.710 
motion this way why because we're trying
to<00:04:03.280> isolate<00:04:03.489> we're<00:04:03.910> trying<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.150> read<00:04:04.329> off<00:04:04.540> the

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
to isolate we're trying to read off the

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.750 
to isolate we're trying to read off the
backside<00:04:05.170> defensive<00:04:05.739> end<00:04:05.920> and<00:04:06.130> this<00:04:06.400> is<00:04:06.579> what

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
backside defensive end and this is what

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.890 
backside defensive end and this is what
happens<00:04:07.180> when<00:04:07.239> you<00:04:07.450> have<00:04:07.599> a<00:04:07.630> mobile

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
happens when you have a mobile

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.720 
happens when you have a mobile
quarterback<00:04:08.440> back<00:04:08.680> there<00:04:08.950> so<00:04:09.430> let's<00:04:09.639> say

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
quarterback back there so let's say

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.289 
quarterback back there so let's say
we're<00:04:10.450> going<00:04:10.599> to<00:04:10.660> either<00:04:11.410> give<00:04:11.889> it<00:04:12.040> or<00:04:12.250> keep<00:04:13.150> it

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
we're going to either give it or keep it

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.300 
we're going to either give it or keep it
so<00:04:13.450> this<00:04:13.599> is<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.900> mesh<00:04:14.109> point<00:04:14.410> right<00:04:14.590> there<00:04:14.620> so

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
so this is the mesh point right there so

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.430 
so this is the mesh point right there so
this<00:04:15.489> is<00:04:15.519> this<00:04:15.910> is<00:04:16.060> where

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
this is this is where

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.870 
this is this is where
want<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.680> go<00:04:16.830> so<00:04:17.250> this<00:04:17.400> is<00:04:17.489> how<00:04:17.580> we're<00:04:17.730> going<00:04:17.820> to
