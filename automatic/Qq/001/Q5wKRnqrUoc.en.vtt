00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.679 
the first one here it's about two feet
long<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:26.939> I'm<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.180> try<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.330> get<00:01:27.540> two

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
long and so I'm going to try to get two

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.510 
long and so I'm going to try to get two
cuttings<00:01:28.049> out<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.130> first<00:01:29.250> thing<00:01:29.340> I

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
cuttings out of it and the first thing I

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.920 
cuttings out of it and the first thing I
do<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.759> strip<00:01:29.939> all<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.150> leaves<00:01:30.329> off<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.840> then

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
do is strip all the leaves off and then

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.350 
do is strip all the leaves off and then
I'll<00:01:31.020> cut<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.259> down<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.470> size<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:32.729> hopefully

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
I'll cut it down to size so hopefully

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.350 
I'll cut it down to size so hopefully
y'all<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.720> see<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.470> kind<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> awkward

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
y'all can see this it's kind of awkward

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.789 
y'all can see this it's kind of awkward
but<00:01:36.360> let's<00:01:37.110> hold<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.320> down<00:01:37.409> here<00:01:37.560> over<00:01:37.710> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
but let's hold it down here over the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.560 
but let's hold it down here over the
bucket<00:01:38.329> and<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.570> break<00:01:39.750> off<00:01:39.960> each<00:01:40.290> leaf<00:01:40.890> stem

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
bucket and just break off each leaf stem

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.950 
bucket and just break off each leaf stem
right<00:01:42.570> below<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.920> bud<00:01:44.159> node<00:01:44.479> be<00:01:45.479> careful<00:01:45.869> not

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
right below that bud node be careful not

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.330 
right below that bud node be careful not
to<00:01:46.140> actually<00:01:46.229> damage<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:46.920> when<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.159> do

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
to actually damage the but when you do

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.179 
to actually damage the but when you do
it<00:01:47.960> maybe<00:01:48.960> I'd<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.229> faster<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.710> do<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.920> if<00:01:50.070> I

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
it maybe I'd be faster to do this if I

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.480 
it maybe I'd be faster to do this if I
were<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.610> use<00:01:51.409> my<00:01:52.409> printers<00:01:52.799> but<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.100> don't<00:01:53.369> know

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
were to use my printers but I don't know

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.730 
were to use my printers but I don't know
and<00:01:54.149> I'm<00:01:54.630> being<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.990> little<00:01:55.020> bit<00:01:55.200> more<00:01:55.350> careful

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
and I'm being a little bit more careful

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.230 
and I'm being a little bit more careful
I<00:01:55.770> think<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.100> need<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:56.460> for<00:01:56.820> sure

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
I think that I need to be for sure

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.179 
I think that I need to be for sure
Texas<00:01:58.229> prepper<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.770> kind<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.920> ran<00:01:59.070> his

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
Texas prepper to just kind of ran his

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.440 
Texas prepper to just kind of ran his
hand<00:01:59.369> down<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.640> stalk<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.060> rip<00:02:00.210> them<00:02:00.360> off

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
hand down the stalk and rip them off

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.380 
hand down the stalk and rip them off
like<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.810> but<00:02:01.340> we'll<00:02:02.340> see<00:02:02.549> good<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.149> show<00:02:03.299> you

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
like that but we'll see good to show you

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.620 
like that but we'll see good to show you
how<00:02:03.509> I'm<00:02:03.570> doing<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:05.210> break<00:02:06.210> all<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> leaves

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
how I'm doing this break all the leaves

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.180 
how I'm doing this break all the leaves
off<00:02:06.840> they<00:02:07.229> don't<00:02:07.350> need<00:02:07.530> these<00:02:07.710> leaves<00:02:07.920> because

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
off they don't need these leaves because

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.080 
off they don't need these leaves because
the<00:02:08.220> plant<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.550> dormant<00:02:08.819> anyway<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:10.649> so

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
the plant is dormant anyway and so

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.580 
the plant is dormant anyway and so
they're<00:02:12.420> not<00:02:12.600> really<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.020> photo<00:02:13.230> senses

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
they're not really in the photo senses

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.630 
they're not really in the photo senses
anything<00:02:13.830> going<00:02:13.980> on<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.370> then<00:02:14.520> these

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
anything going on and so then these

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.900 
anything going on and so then these
leaves<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:15.090> provide<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> source<00:02:15.780> of

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
leaves just provide a source of

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.559 
leaves just provide a source of
transpiration<00:02:17.910> for<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.120> plant<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:18.420> you're

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
transpiration for the plant so you're

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.970 
transpiration for the plant so you're
losing<00:02:18.660> moisture<00:02:18.930> anyway<00:02:19.350> I'm<00:02:19.620> gonna<00:02:19.740> cut<00:02:19.860> off

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
losing moisture anyway I'm gonna cut off

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.760 
losing moisture anyway I'm gonna cut off
that<00:02:20.069> last<00:02:20.340> little<00:02:20.459> bit<00:02:20.670> there<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:22.290> just<00:02:22.620> as<00:02:22.740> a

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
that last little bit there and just as a

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.710 
that last little bit there and just as a
rule<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:23.040> thumb<00:02:23.100> for<00:02:23.280> propagating<00:02:23.970> just<00:02:24.630> so

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
rule of thumb for propagating just so

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.490 
rule of thumb for propagating just so
you<00:02:24.810> can<00:02:24.900> keep<00:02:25.050> up<00:02:25.170> with<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.380> cut<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.280> top<00:02:27.500> have

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
you can keep up with it cut the top have

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.830 
you can keep up with it cut the top have
your<00:02:28.650> cuts<00:02:28.890> when<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.250> do<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.489> here<00:02:29.790> see<00:02:30.720> where

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
your cuts when you do it here see where

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.910 
your cuts when you do it here see where
I<00:02:30.959> can't<00:02:31.200> see<00:02:31.380> which<00:02:31.530> often<00:02:31.860> see<00:02:33.650> take<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.739> top

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
I can't see which often see take the top

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.380 
I can't see which often see take the top
you're<00:02:35.100> cutting<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.550> do<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.760> at<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.880> 45<00:02:36.360> degree

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
you're cutting and do it at a 45 degree

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.660 
you're cutting and do it at a 45 degree
angle<00:02:36.690> just<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:38.010> kind<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.190> tell<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.610> you

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
angle just to kind of tell you that you

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.180 
angle just to kind of tell you that you
know<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.910> angle<00:02:39.840> points<00:02:40.050> towards<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.319> sky<00:02:40.530> of

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
know the angle points towards the sky of

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.180 
know the angle points towards the sky of
course<00:02:41.400> that's<00:02:41.550> not<00:02:41.700> going<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.880> work<00:02:41.940> it's

course that's not going to work it's

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.600 
course that's not going to work it's
there<00:02:44.190> we<00:02:44.280> go

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
there we go

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.250 
there we go
angle<00:02:45.239> point<00:02:45.420> toward<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.660> sky<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.050> cut<00:02:46.170> the

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
angle point toward the sky and cut the

angle point toward the sky and cut the
base<00:02:46.440> flat<00:02:46.769> so<00:02:47.190> I'll<00:02:47.310> go<00:02:47.430> over<00:02:47.489> here<00:02:47.640> from<00:02:47.880> a

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
base flat so I'll go over here from a

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.449 
base flat so I'll go over here from a
pot<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:49.260> y'all<00:02:49.410> can't<00:02:49.650> see<00:02:49.830> but<00:02:50.130> I'm<00:02:50.370> just

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
pot and y'all can't see but I'm just

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.040 
pot and y'all can't see but I'm just
going<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.670> cut<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:52.230> bottom<00:02:52.640> flat<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:54.050> then

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
going to cut the bottom flat and then

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.150 
going to cut the bottom flat and then
I'm<00:02:55.140> going<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.290> go<00:02:55.410> ahead<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.709> make<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:55.860> second

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
I'm going to go ahead and make a second

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.830 
I'm going to go ahead and make a second
cut<00:02:56.280> at<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.760> same<00:02:56.910> time<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.450> cut<00:02:57.630> an<00:02:57.720> angle

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
cut at the same time and cut an angle

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.449 
cut at the same time and cut an angle
again<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.380> top<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.769> second<00:02:59.100> one<00:02:59.220> so

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
again on the top of the second one so

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:06.710 
again on the top of the second one so
what<00:03:00.420> I'm<00:03:00.510> left<00:03:00.630> with<00:03:00.780> now<00:03:01.050> is<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:05.480> scions<00:03:06.480> that
