00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.309
 This very important salt mateo cuateo 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.310
 existing 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.379
 possibly from the year 800 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.489
 after Christ and long before 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:15.489
 the empire that threw on foot will make up lime 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.650
 this is part of our work 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.810
 of epo lennon cultural value 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.460
 the pre-internal constructions 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.300
 not only pre-Hispanic pre-Incas 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.050
 that exist in the city of Lima 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.399
 rate it percent the true story 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.490
 of lime from the valley of the rim valley sea here 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.660
 which is of enormous importance throughout the two thousand years of existence 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.590
 of lima cultures and isma culture 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.520
 the lima cultures the isna associated 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.240
 to the temple of pachacamac and the oracle 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.920
 for almost two thousand years 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.120
 rex did much before 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280
 what the chavines will come with their influence 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.470
 what place and will arrive and certainly from 1500 500 years before they arrived 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.280
 the Incas to this area 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.630
 then put in value 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.640
 all these rich vestiges 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.330
 It is very important to recover the true history of the city of Lima 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.390
 and the valley 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.480
 of the rimac 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.980
 we are then 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.410
 a salted mateo 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.660
 a fourth time that exists since the year 800 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.660
 or at the latest one thousand after Christ 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.380
 and that this is part of the isma culture 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.800
 that would later become the same place in nine 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.250
 the influence that threw out a thousand late 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.710
 470 possibly 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.700
 has been discovered under the accumulation of debris and material 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.700
 the original walls that you can see 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.930
 the salt mateo wadding 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.829
 and in this way through cleaning work restoration 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.829
 of replacement of material on your site 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.469
 in the city of Lima is beauty 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:16.799
 what is a monument that is 1200 years old 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.609
 of existence and demonstrates continuity 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.389
 of cultural history 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.739
 I've been four of salted mateo 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.589
 is obviously linked 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:31.309
 from what they call guaca de san marcos, which is actually the a6 huaca 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:33.979
 pyramids that existed 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:37.609
 and that they were eliminated to build the university asylum there 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:39.829
 from the guaca de la felcc pyramids 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.309
 to the huaca de maranga and the huaca pucllana 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:46.309
 that are well of malanga influence 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:49.359
 on another side of Lima 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.359
 let's also work what is called 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:57.069
 cadivi cuba and tan de pariachi tienda alias a whole city 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:59.189
 little known 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.189
 with 69 hectares 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.099
 what's wrong with it 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.339
 Huge wheat influence from the year min 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:13.179
 pique we hope along with cajamar that she deliver thus restored 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.399
 of clean 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:16.909
 what silva 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.479
 d witness students to tourists 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:24.819
 this city of Lima that has 273 vestiges like this 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.319
 what we have to rescue one by one to prove it 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.850
 the cultural force 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.479
 that the city of Lima had 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.479
 announce them too 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:37.889
 what in the sanctuary of pachacamac we are beginning 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.859
 works this prayer of replenishment and 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.499
 reinforcement 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:45.479
 to give it more value 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.360
 and to be burned 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.099
 school promotions 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.639
 they will be present 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.879
 being the pasha bed 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.739
 and finally announce them with these 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.689
 three important projects matte salty cool can of pariachi 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.759
 pachacámac 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:06.789
 shortly within a month or so we will deliver to 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:07.499
 country 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:10.659
 the national museum of chavín 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.329
 this is a long-awaited work we have concluded with help 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.739
 of the Japanese government 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.539
 that will allow to show 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.889
 This is the first major message and the first statement 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.550
 cultural 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.249
 with an expansive vocation throughout our territory 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:31.309
 And that is 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:33.419
 since thousands of years ago 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.099
 the first force 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:36.849
 of the vigor 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:38.669
 but not on this earth 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.050
 with all these 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.000
 cultural issues 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.999
 I would like to tell you that we have completed a chapter 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:47.680
 the historical cultural chapter 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.469
 regarding the city of Lima 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:51.980
 in Jesus 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.789
 cultural research area in the media 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.580
 will verify the importance of this work 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.180
 its connection with the wadding of the pyramids in san marcos with the huaca 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.949
 pucllana 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.520
 and others although they denote the enormous cultural importance that Lima has 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.259
 although it is not the one that teaches us in schools 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.729
 I insist and I always defend that the VAT has a validity of two thousand years in 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:15.979
 the history of Peru 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.309
 supported 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:21.109
 in the validity of his great by accord the spiritual religious center more 

00:05:21.109 --> 00:05:22.279
 important 

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:25.279
 of the Peruvian territory of then that was 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.090
 so that 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.449
 I am satisfied 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.479
 that we have concrete plans d is beautiful to be our city 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.539
 in the communication routes of the green coast that the cleaning of its waters 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.469
 and in the cultural revaluation 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:41.579
 of all these extraordinary vestiges
