 Hello everyone , copy it is the third part 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.800
 Deadpool comics destroy the universe 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.590
 marvel and if you somehow 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.630
 missed the first or second part then on 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.330
 your how the icon appeared on which you 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.210
 you can click and see the missed 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.039
 you parts in the third comic we will understand 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.930
 that tpu doesn't just randomly kill 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.449
 heroes and villains about what he has 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.549
 specific motivation so to say goal 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.250
 he has something that no one has and is strong and 

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:42.500
 margo what exactly now we learn everything 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.839
 begins with the fact that the task master is still 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.549
 deadpool already what day and we understand what it is 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:49.100
 already managed to kill a few more members 

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:51.080
 marvel such as veins which flows along 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.690
 bell green goblin 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.610
 Jimmy matrox and I do not know who he is 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.280
 unfortunately so interesting to the master 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.739
 what reason does he do it he can 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.350
 there is a plan but it is more important to convince him 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.140
 meanwhile, our crash has been torturing 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.060
 poor professor x century charles xavier 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.830
 and the interesting thing is that wade 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.690
 nothing charles 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.550
 show how his ward will die 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.950
 the professor is trying to help somehow 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.680
 calm down understand what's wrong with deadpool 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.110
 but his is purple it is necessary to 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.000
 charles called his charges to him 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.310
 so that they fall into the trap which 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.700
 prepared a deadpool in advance one of the people 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.220
 X 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.850
 namely, 7 and the kate cycle falls into this 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.620
 trap 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.900
 it is this trap for everyone 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.390
 present we see as a professor 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.640
 it hurts when all such students and this 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.580
 there was only 1 pass from it follows 2 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.100
 and 3 in which some more people die 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.750
 X here comes the third voice which 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.270
 advises chat with professor a 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.190
 exactly let him in the head you yes yes he 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.270
 lets him in his head but because 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.970
 what did he see there 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.950
 Deadpool Head Professor X is just 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.450
 dying I don't know what he could there 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.280
 see but like if you like 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.070
 interesting and I will try to find out 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.799
 besides, white managed to kill another enemy 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.560
 charles namely magnets in jelly 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.390
 acid- like ghostly girl he 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.610
 stuck in a mirror cube from where she 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.010
 actually can not leave this cube from 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.730
 some kind of d40 that creates 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.220
 four-dimensional space 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.049
 you just started chatting by yourself 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.700
 as a wolverine suddenly appears 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.370
 trying to help arcade 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.319
 logan understands that he is involved in everything but 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.629
 arcade in his defense rejoice those 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.640
 what's all over deadpool since he 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.430
 made make these traps naturally 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.260
 Deadpool could not think of this myself 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.420
 until the last thought he would save a lot 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.769
 arcade on everything happened just the opposite 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.290
 he just killed 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.720
 at this moment wolverine sniffed something 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.750
 there was a dead body of 2 mutants namely 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.879
 x23 little idea on essentially they both had 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.640
 the healing factor is the same as hers 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:52.590
 deadpool but computers namely 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.810
 chemical weapons sprayed them up 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.480
 while not looking for some healing 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.310
 factors and until they themselves die on it 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.290
 the moment deadpool appears in a suit 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.230
 blue forests and it seems this is a link to 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.950
 that the forest wants to wolverine correct if 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.340
 I am wrong 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.530
 forth are the two best members of the marvel world 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.489
 fighting deadpool has a sword which 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.650
 will be able to overcome 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.720
 logan's healing factor due to this 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.910
 sword deadpool cuts off wolverine head 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.430
 next we meet the task wizard which 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.069
 came to doctor strange rather to his 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.109
 beat he knows where goes deadpool goes by 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.700
 on the heels he is not just tagging on he 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:29.190
 reveals a plan to notice what 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.349
 the library is completely ruined and we 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.660
 we understand that deadpool found what I was looking for 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.970
 namely the entrance to connect with others 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.370
 realities and it is natural not to 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.109
 well here are the guys here are the pies if 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.169

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:45.739
