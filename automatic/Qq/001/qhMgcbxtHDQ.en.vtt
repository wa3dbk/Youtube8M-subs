yarn over yarn over slip slip knit so
it's<00:00:24.210> pretty<00:00:24.539> easy<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:25.199> mean<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:26.340> part<00:00:26.670> wasn't

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
it's pretty easy I mean this part wasn't

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.679 
it's pretty easy I mean this part wasn't
too<00:00:27.210> hard<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.480> figure<00:00:27.599> out

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689

Karen over then after the tea yarn-overs
sometimes<00:01:26.630> if<00:01:26.810> I<00:01:26.930> have<00:01:27.020> to<00:01:27.140> put<00:01:27.290> my<00:01:27.410> work<00:01:27.620> down

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
sometimes if I have to put my work down

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.420 
sometimes if I have to put my work down
in<00:01:28.010> the<00:01:28.100> middle<00:01:28.340> of<00:01:28.430> it<00:01:28.580> I<00:01:28.790> just<00:01:29.000> look<00:01:29.210> for

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
in the middle of it I just look for

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.360 
in the middle of it I just look for
where<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.550> hole<00:01:31.760> is<00:01:31.900> which<00:01:32.900> is<00:01:33.110> where<00:01:33.370> your

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
where the hole is which is where your

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.350 
where the hole is which is where your
yarn<00:01:35.150> over<00:01:35.510> should<00:01:35.780> be<00:01:36.490> your<00:01:37.490> two<00:01:37.730> yarn<00:01:38.000> overs

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
yarn over should be your two yarn overs

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.890 
yarn over should be your two yarn overs
rather<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:38.960> then<00:01:39.110> your<00:01:39.260> slip<00:01:39.500> slip<00:01:39.710> knit<00:01:43.900> so

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
rather and then your slip slip knit so

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.380 
rather and then your slip slip knit so
you're<00:01:45.020> pretty<00:01:45.200> much<00:01:45.320> working<00:01:45.740> with<00:01:46.390> four

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
you're pretty much working with four

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.360 
you're pretty much working with four
stitches<00:01:47.750> every<00:01:48.260> time<00:01:50.890> so<00:01:51.890> these<00:01:52.040> four

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
stitches every time so these four

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:01.270 
stitches every time so these four
stitches<00:01:56.710> in<00:01:57.710> a<00:01:57.890> two<00:01:58.160> together<00:02:00.040> and<00:02:01.040> then<00:02:01.130> in

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
stitches in a two together and then in

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.250 
stitches in a two together and then in
between<00:02:01.540> you<00:02:02.540> yarn<00:02:02.780> over<00:02:03.080> yarn<00:02:03.290> over<00:02:05.260> slip

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
between you yarn over yarn over slip

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:14.140 
between you yarn over yarn over slip
slip<00:02:06.410> knit

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:23.130 

one<00:02:14.750> more<00:02:15.019> time<00:02:20.650> knit<00:02:21.650> two<00:02:21.920> together<00:02:22.099> yarn

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
one more time knit two together yarn

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:37.390 
one more time knit two together yarn
over<00:02:24.280> yarn<00:02:25.280> over<00:02:26.980> slip<00:02:27.980> slip<00:02:28.069> knit

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.250 

and<00:02:37.910> then<00:02:38.030> you<00:02:38.180> just<00:02:38.360> one<00:02:38.510> turn<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:38.810> off<00:02:39.019> the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
and then you just one turn it off the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.990 
and then you just one turn it off the
last<00:02:39.470> one<00:02:42.190> here's<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.280> fun<00:02:43.640> part<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:46.790> took

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
last one here's the fun part that took

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000 
last one here's the fun part that took
me<00:02:47.239> forever<00:02:47.629> to<00:02:48.440> figure<00:02:48.590> out<00:02:48.920> how<00:02:49.129> to<00:02:49.190> do<00:02:54.010> so

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
me forever to figure out how to do so

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.070 
me forever to figure out how to do so
pretty<00:02:55.340> much<00:02:56.140> your<00:02:57.140> purling<00:02:57.819> everything<00:02:59.080> but

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
pretty much your purling everything but

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.089 
pretty much your purling everything but
it<00:03:00.200> says<00:03:00.410> to<00:03:00.590> purl<00:03:00.860> one<00:03:03.549> out<00:03:04.549> of<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.819> way<00:03:06.099> and

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
it says to purl one out of the way and

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.030 
it says to purl one out of the way and
then<00:03:07.340> here<00:03:07.580> we<00:03:07.700> go

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
then here we go

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.440 
then here we go
purl<00:03:10.040> one<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:12.220> then<00:03:13.220> purl<00:03:13.610> one<00:03:13.940> through<00:03:14.329> the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
purl one and then purl one through the

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.289 
purl one and then purl one through the
first<00:03:15.160> yarn<00:03:16.160> over<00:03:16.519> and<00:03:18.370> then<00:03:19.370> it<00:03:19.700> says<00:03:19.849> purl<00:03:20.120> to

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
first yarn over and then it says purl to

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:26.949 
first yarn over and then it says purl to
the<00:03:20.420> back<00:03:20.690> of<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:24.200> next<00:03:24.530> join<00:03:24.739> over<00:03:25.959> and

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
the back of the the next join over and

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.530 
the back of the the next join over and
we<00:03:27.170> go<00:03:27.349> like<00:03:27.560> this<00:03:27.769> carry<00:03:31.120> you<00:03:32.120> stick<00:03:32.390> it

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
we go like this carry you stick it

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.539 
we go like this carry you stick it
through<00:03:33.579> the<00:03:34.579> back<00:03:36.099> right<00:03:37.099> there<00:03:38.260> then<00:03:39.260> you

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
through the back right there then you

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.050 
through the back right there then you
curl<00:03:40.549> it<00:03:41.049> not<00:03:42.049> like<00:03:42.230> that<00:03:42.730> so<00:03:43.730> there's<00:03:43.910> gonna

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
curl it not like that so there's gonna

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.479 
curl it not like that so there's gonna
be<00:03:44.269> like<00:03:44.450> a<00:03:44.480> long<00:03:44.900> I<00:03:47.319> guess<00:03:48.319> piece<00:03:48.950> of<00:03:49.100> yarn<00:03:49.370> in

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
be like a long I guess piece of yarn in

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.759 
be like a long I guess piece of yarn in
between<00:03:49.850> there<00:03:50.090> which<00:03:50.900> looks<00:03:51.230> funny<00:03:51.530> at<00:03:51.739> first

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
between there which looks funny at first

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.550 
between there which looks funny at first
but<00:03:52.660> you'll<00:03:53.660> see<00:03:53.840> that<00:03:53.870> it<00:03:54.170> works<00:03:54.319> out<00:03:54.590> later

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
but you'll see that it works out later

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:04.300 
but you'll see that it works out later
so<00:03:57.560> purl<00:03:59.319> purl<00:04:02.260> then<00:04:03.260> here's<00:04:03.590> your<00:04:03.829> two<00:04:04.069> yarn

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
so purl purl then here's your two yarn

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.629 
so purl purl then here's your two yarn
overs<00:04:04.670> you<00:04:04.970> can<00:04:05.150> see<00:04:06.639> purl<00:04:07.639> into<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.090> first

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
overs you can see purl into the first

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:16.210 
overs you can see purl into the first
the<00:04:10.639> front<00:04:11.000> side<00:04:12.400> and<00:04:13.400> let<00:04:13.549> that<00:04:13.730> out

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.630 

back<00:04:18.519> like<00:04:19.519> that<00:04:19.959> see<00:04:20.959> that<00:04:21.080> if<00:04:21.890> you<00:04:22.040> pull<00:04:22.310> it<00:04:22.460> a

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
back like that see that if you pull it a

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.140 
back like that see that if you pull it a
