00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.980
 well arrived at this window what we 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.810
 is requesting that we insert the 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:22.390
 disk in this case installation of 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.390
 windows 2003 server well we insert it 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.610
 and in this case what must happen is 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.390
 without touching anything you should start to catch 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.730
 all the necessary files of the cd-rom 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.590
 of installation 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.809
 well let's really expect here 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.650
 is copying it has already detected the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.540
 cd insert 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.230
 since it looks like the typical window that 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.490
 appears of auto start we come out of this 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.490
 window that is bothering us 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.940
 one click here on leaving 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.719
 well in this case follows the process of 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.180
 installation what is right now 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:02.350
 choosing the files and configuring 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.690
 the services that we comment because 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.460
 install the Active Directory what 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.940
 does it also automatically is to install 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.140
 the dns service and the hcp service 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.479
 therefore we will wait 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.920
 finish well here has indicated that has 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.180
 finished the assistant for the 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.470
 installation of the active directory 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.470
 we click on the end button 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.890
 and does not indicate that we owe in this case 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.420
 to restart the active directory 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.429
 we must restart the machine so that 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.439
 arise in the new changes that have 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.899
 produced and we finish installing 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.159
 Active Directory correctly as 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.240
 well we are going to click on 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.979
 the reset button now 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.820
 and let's wait for the machine to 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.820
 restart 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.080
 they are already saying it again 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.220
 a little bit 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.560
 well here we have the windows 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.739
 welcome again the crazy ones 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.890
 let's insert let's start the 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.890
 session 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.660
 we type the passwords of 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.140
 the session is starting 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.070
 and this window is telling us that 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.170
 right now this server is now a 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.170
 domain controller okay 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.069
 in finalize 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.920
 and how can we check 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.400
 in this case we have the directory 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.900
 active is valid and also in form 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.980
 Automatic server has been installed 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.630
 It seems to me that I commented that the 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.340
 hcp service was also installed 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.900
 Well, I do not remember, it will have been a 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.250
 mistake as you can check the 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.640
 active directory what it does is 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.780
 automatically install the server dns 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.240
 well in this case what are we going to do 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.350
 we are also adding the server 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.440
 dhcp which is a service 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.020
 very important and very simple 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.240
 configure in our case the purpose 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.120
 is to provide our customers 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.280
 IP addresses automatically as 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.730
 ok let's go to configure the 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.069
 server as is 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.920
 with the configuration that we have 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.599
 Well, we're going to start the 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.769
 same procedure as any of 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.989
 these other services that have been 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.620
 installed we will add or remove 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.620
 function 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.870
 we click on the next button 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.220
 Well, with this video tutorial we have 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.870
 finished configuring in this case of 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.690
 register the directory service 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.630
 active in the following video tutorial what 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:41.780
 What we are going to see is how to register the 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.780
 hcp voucher service come up later
