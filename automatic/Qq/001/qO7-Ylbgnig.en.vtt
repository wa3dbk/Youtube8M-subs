than it hurts me we'll get to that in a
little<00:00:51.059> bit<00:00:51.149> but<00:00:51.660> basically<00:00:51.780> aim

little bit but basically aim
acceleration<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.890> where<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.070> turn<00:00:53.250> faster

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
acceleration is where you turn faster

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.130 
acceleration is where you turn faster
the<00:00:53.850> longer<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.270> continue<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.690> turn<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.050> if

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the longer you continue to turn so if

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.720 
the longer you continue to turn so if
you're<00:00:55.260> aiming<00:00:55.530> right<00:00:55.680> as<00:00:55.890> you're<00:00:56.460> aiming

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
right you pick up a little bit of speed

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.479 
right you pick up a little bit of speed
to<00:00:58.260> get<00:00:58.379> there<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.680> an<00:00:58.800> acceleration<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.430> aim

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
to get there and an acceleration and aim

assist they coexist and aim assist is

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.170 
assist they coexist and aim assist is
the<00:01:02.219> amount<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.430> slowdown<00:01:02.730> your<00:01:02.850> crosshair<00:01:03.090> is

the amount of slowdown your crosshair is

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.490 
the amount of slowdown your crosshair is
gonna<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.510> when<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.809> hover<00:01:03.960> over<00:01:04.049> an<00:01:04.350> enemy

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
think about like a magnet so you're

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.190 
think about like a magnet so you're
aiming<00:01:06.420> down<00:01:06.479> sights<00:01:06.720> at<00:01:06.810> nothing<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
aiming down sights at nothing in the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.750 
aiming down sights at nothing in the
corner<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.590> see<00:01:07.770> an<00:01:07.830> enemy<00:01:07.920> start<00:01:08.610> move

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
corner I you see an enemy start move

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.890

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
the red hand is right behind at 89 and a

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.820 
the red hand is right behind at 89 and a
lot<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.360> people<00:02:33.750> talk<00:02:34.020> about<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.470> red<00:02:34.590> hand

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
lot of people talk about the red hand

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.620

that 89 assists that is an underlying

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.870 
that 89 assists that is an underlying
reason<00:02:36.870> why<00:02:37.620> it's<00:02:37.770> so<00:02:37.890> popular<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.460> why<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.640> lot

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
reason why it's so popular and why a lot

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.760 
reason why it's so popular and why a lot
of<00:02:38.910> weapons<00:02:39.120> in<00:02:39.330> general<00:02:39.780> are<00:02:39.930> popular<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.620> if

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
of weapons in general are popular and if

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.410 
of weapons in general are popular and if
not<00:02:40.890> it's<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.340> very<00:02:41.610> very<00:02:42.030> interesting

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
not it's a very very interesting

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.020 
not it's a very very interesting
coincidence<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:44.010> Amos<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:44.490> is<00:02:44.640> how<00:02:44.730> hard<00:02:44.910> you

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
coincidence so Amos this is how hard you

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.370 
coincidence so Amos this is how hard you
slow<00:02:45.180> down<00:02:45.360> when<00:02:45.540> snapping<00:02:45.870> at<00:02:45.960> your<00:02:46.080> target

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
slow down when snapping at your target

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.960 
slow down when snapping at your target
in<00:02:46.500> my<00:02:46.620> very<00:02:46.860> first<00:02:47.160> crucible<00:02:47.550> TED<00:02:47.700> video<00:02:47.790> I

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
in my very first crucible TED video I

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.700 
in my very first crucible TED video I
went<00:02:48.210> over<00:02:48.420> simplifying<00:02:48.900> your<00:02:49.050> aim<00:02:49.200> remember

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
went over simplifying your aim remember

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.970 
went over simplifying your aim remember
that

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
that

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.350 
that
think<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.370> like<00:02:50.460> a<00:02:50.550> clock<00:02:50.790> your<00:02:51.000> reticle<00:02:51.270> in

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
think of it like a clock your reticle in

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.760 
think of it like a clock your reticle in
the<00:02:51.450> middle<00:02:51.660> numbers<00:02:52.020> on<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.200> outside<00:02:52.260> make

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
the middle numbers on the outside make

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.440 
the middle numbers on the outside make
very<00:02:53.040> smooth<00:02:53.430> deliberate<00:02:53.880> movements<00:02:54.240> at<00:02:54.330> your

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
very smooth deliberate movements at your

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.880 
very smooth deliberate movements at your

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.150

o'clock

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
eating now if you look back at any one

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.700 
eating now if you look back at any one
of<00:03:00.270> my<00:03:00.390> videos<00:03:00.690> where<00:03:00.960> I'm<00:03:01.080> sniping<00:03:01.470> or<00:03:01.530> aiming

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
of my videos where I'm sniping or aiming

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.590 
of my videos where I'm sniping or aiming
in<00:03:01.890> general<00:03:02.160> I'm<00:03:02.340> doing<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.150> can<00:03:03.270> see

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
in general I'm doing this you can see

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.330 
in general I'm doing this you can see
that<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:03.990> am<00:03:04.110> doing<00:03:04.410> this<00:03:04.560> if<00:03:04.770> you<00:03:04.980> pause<00:03:05.160> this

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
that I am doing this if you pause this

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.980 
that I am doing this if you pause this
video<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:05.700> watch<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:06.000> with<00:03:06.090> no<00:03:06.240> sound<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.750> am

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
video and watch it with no sound I am

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.630 
video and watch it with no sound I am
doing<00:03:07.350> this<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:08.040> there<00:03:08.190> are<00:03:08.250> two<00:03:08.340> types<00:03:08.550> of

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
doing this so there are two types of

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.920 
doing this so there are two types of
sniping<00:03:08.940> one<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.390> where<00:03:09.570> you're<00:03:09.690> standing

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
sniping one is where you're standing

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.720 
sniping one is where you're standing
fairly<00:03:10.080> still<00:03:10.470> aiming<00:03:11.100> down<00:03:11.280> sights<00:03:11.580> like

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
fairly still aiming down sights like

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.250 
fairly still aiming down sights like
right<00:03:11.910> now<00:03:12.060> like<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.360> cornered<00:03:12.750> or<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> open

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
right now like a cornered or a open

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.660 
right now like a cornered or a open
field<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.620> people<00:03:13.770> call<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.010> hardscoping

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
field and people call that hardscoping

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.920 
field and people call that hardscoping
what<00:03:14.850> do<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:14.970> want<00:03:15.090> what<00:03:15.210> do<00:03:15.270> you<00:03:15.330> expect<00:03:15.570> you

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
what do you want what do you expect you

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.810 
what do you want what do you expect you
have<00:03:15.990> a<00:03:16.050> sniper<00:03:16.200> round<00:03:16.470> right<00:03:16.800> but<00:03:17.430> from<00:03:17.640> here

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
have a sniper round right but from here

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.550 
have a sniper round right but from here
it's<00:03:18.000> small<00:03:18.330> precision<00:03:18.870> aiming<00:03:18.990> your<00:03:19.290> reticle

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
it's small precision aiming your reticle

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.960 
it's small precision aiming your reticle
is<00:03:19.710> about<00:03:19.860> head<00:03:20.040> level<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.520> you<00:03:20.610> make<00:03:20.730> small

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
is about head level and you make small

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.270 
is about head level and you make small
movements<00:03:21.330> take<00:03:21.450> your<00:03:21.600> shot<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.890> second<00:03:23.190> type

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
movements take your shot the second type

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.130 
movements take your shot the second type
of<00:03:23.310> sniping<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.970> everything<00:03:24.570> else<00:03:24.720> but<00:03:24.870> method

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
of sniping is everything else but method

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.540 
of sniping is everything else but method
one<00:03:25.260> but<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.560> goal<00:03:25.710> is<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.070> get<00:03:26.160> back<00:03:26.370> to

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
one but the goal is to get back to

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.830 
one but the goal is to get back to
method<00:03:26.820> one<00:03:26.970> kind<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.210> hard<00:03:27.360> scoping<00:03:27.660> it'll

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
method one kind of hard scoping it'll

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.330 
method one kind of hard scoping it'll
make<00:03:27.960> sense<00:03:28.050> in<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.260> second<00:03:28.560> no<00:03:28.950> matter<00:03:29.130> what

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
make sense in a second no matter what

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.800 
make sense in a second no matter what
sensitivity<00:03:30.000> you're<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.270> this<00:03:30.480> is<00:03:30.600> going<00:03:30.750> to

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
sensitivity you're on this is going to

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.980 
sensitivity you're on this is going to
work

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
work

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.530 
work
I<00:03:31.200> use<00:03:31.860> a<00:03:32.070> acceleration<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:32.970> aim<00:03:33.120> assist<00:03:33.240> to

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
I use a acceleration and aim assist to

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.760 
I use a acceleration and aim assist to
my<00:03:33.630> advantage<00:03:33.900> this<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.200> kind<00:03:34.530> of<00:03:34.590> why<00:03:34.680> I've

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
my advantage this is kind of why I've

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.020 
my advantage this is kind of why I've
been<00:03:34.830> shoved<00:03:35.040> down<00:03:35.190> your<00:03:35.280> throat<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.850> past

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
been shoved down your throat the past

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.610 
been shoved down your throat the past
couple<00:03:36.210> minutes<00:03:36.600> but<00:03:36.990> this<00:03:37.110> is<00:03:37.260> how<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:37.410> do<00:03:37.530> it

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
couple minutes but this is how I do it

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.900 
couple minutes but this is how I do it
how<00:03:37.830> a<00:03:37.860> lot<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.130> people<00:03:38.340> do<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.550> I'm<00:03:38.670> just<00:03:38.700> not

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
how a lot of people do it I'm just not

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.550 
how a lot of people do it I'm just not
sure<00:03:39.030> if<00:03:39.300> it's<00:03:39.360> ever<00:03:39.600> been<00:03:39.930> explained<00:03:40.290> before

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
sure if it's ever been explained before

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.990 
sure if it's ever been explained before
so<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.710> really<00:03:40.770> hope<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:41.550> makes<00:03:41.670> sense<00:03:41.760> to

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
so I really hope that it makes sense to

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.180 
so I really hope that it makes sense to
you<00:03:42.060> guys<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.450> make<00:03:43.080> two<00:03:43.320> movements<00:03:43.530> sometimes

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
you guys I make two movements sometimes

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.250 
you guys I make two movements sometimes
just<00:03:44.430> one<00:03:44.580> but<00:03:45.120> they're<00:03:45.240> very<00:03:45.420> fast<00:03:45.720> movements

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
just one but they're very fast movements

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.420 
just one but they're very fast movements
and<00:03:46.440> here's<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.650> slow<00:03:46.800> breakdown<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.160> how<00:03:47.370> it

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
and here's a slow breakdown of how it

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.350 
and here's a slow breakdown of how it
works<00:03:47.580> now<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.760> background<00:03:48.120> I'm<00:03:48.210> just

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
works now the background I'm just

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.120 
works now the background I'm just
strafing<00:03:48.750> left<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.350> right<00:03:49.500> but<00:03:49.650> you<00:03:49.740> see<00:03:49.950> the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
strafing left and right but you see the

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.530 
strafing left and right but you see the
aim<00:03:50.250> assist<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:50.640> see<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.850> magnetism<00:03:51.240> when<00:03:51.510> I

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
aim assist you see the magnetism when I

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.750 
aim assist you see the magnetism when I
go<00:03:51.690> over<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.870> Vandals<00:03:52.230> that's<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.310> kicking<00:03:53.640> in

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
go over the Vandals that's it kicking in

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.330 
go over the Vandals that's it kicking in
and<00:03:54.090> PvE<00:03:54.620> campaign<00:03:55.620> enemies<00:03:55.920> always<00:03:56.190> have<00:03:56.310> a

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
and PvE campaign enemies always have a

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.740 
and PvE campaign enemies always have a
greater<00:03:56.580> amount<00:03:56.850> of<00:03:57.120> aim<00:03:57.300> assist<00:03:57.420> and

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
greater amount of aim assist and

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.120 
greater amount of aim assist and
multiplayer<00:03:57.990> but<00:03:58.350> multiplayer<00:03:58.740> still<00:03:58.920> has<00:03:59.010> it

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
multiplayer but multiplayer still has it

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.530 
multiplayer but multiplayer still has it
too<00:03:59.250> so<00:03:59.460> you<00:03:59.820> have<00:03:59.910> your<00:04:00.000> sniper<00:04:00.300> out<00:04:00.390> you're
