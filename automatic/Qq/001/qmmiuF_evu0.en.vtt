00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.390
 everyone is happy today we will have 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.980
 Another unpacking review of the package but 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.520
 unfortunately it will be interesting only 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.890
 to those users who are interested in 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.500
 models why the thing is that I have 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.900
 until at the moment the package arrives 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:36.220
 my model and two are also sending 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.110
 with ebay aliexpress there is an action camera to 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.119
 For example, there will all be there 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:45.580
 decided to hold a contest on the channel 

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:48.600
 asked for some subscriber 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.379
 so I will be there to play all sorts of things 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.199
 therefore except 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.110
 parts for these we consider will come and 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.650
 a lot of everything else would be a little break 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:03.869
 on orders because there were difficulties well 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.950
 at all with regards to the review to take, as it were 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.970
 videos especially because worriment 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.140
 I'm writing a diploma now 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.110
 Here is the load of work and today I 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.870
 got sick so have time to take off 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.820
 review and unpacking and put it all 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.360
 Well, well, so let's look at it 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.610
 that there is everything there is here 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.800
 such a small prescription seller then 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.540
 what left that inside does not contain it 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.850
 Parcels fly about batteries because 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.280
 that you understand what they will shoot with these 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:39.310
 will bring you to subsidization have mail 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:41.590
 wheels here they are somewhere 30 4 together 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.210
 I'll open it now with disks 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.800
 there will be such a short review and at the end 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.140
 show you how it looks on the car 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.140
 but then later on how it will be 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.140
 to look like 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:00.740
 on the track and someone all of us 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.189
 I pack already knives 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.799
 ordered them get out and try on ebay 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.569
 there in all sorts of all sorts of things 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.140
 interesting 2 in the yard will also be 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:16.910
 interesting 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:20.989
 of technology and so our tires wheels like 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.989
 addict resale ordered oh wont 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:32.840
 such small is no more than we 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:38.599
 stock so that's visible 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:41.110
 show how the stock looks like this 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.110
 wheels 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:03:02.329
 how generally straight did not expect the disc diameter 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:03:08.959
 small rubber soft and here at 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:13.069
 holes were these here just to 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.669
 amortize so better tell 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.669
 like a falcon 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:25.680
 Comparison with this will still be ordered 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:28.290
 old wheels for two models i.e. 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.510
 one such option is like a highway there 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.540
 over the grass through the mud and will be with more 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:40.980
 big tread let's compare 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:43.020
 deposited so here are the stock they are a little bit ah 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.300
 yes a little bit more in fact 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.630
 almost one to one is the same 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:53.610
 just I think this can not go on 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:56.400
 a little more did not affect that 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:01.130
 Straight significantly just seems well 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:05.000
 awesome such wheels what tires 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:11.820
 looks will feel gorgeous 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:14.540
 electrons of course here as he has 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:20.810
 mother and window a couple 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.810
 wow damn they need to glue them 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.669
 start glue as our 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.419
 tires now see how it all 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.419
 looks on model 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.829
 well, it all looks like 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:54.629
 slightly compare this session here 

00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:59.039
 with such here with those wheels here 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:05:00.689
 more i.e. larger diameter sandisk 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.809
 goes that is and 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:06.599
 but there are generally quite good stock 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:09.209
 there is even no foam and the machine beats by itself 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.989
 a little discount on the tip 

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:14.339
 obstacles 

00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:17.579
 here winter is already completely different then 

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:20.879
 eat and will compensate as blows 

00:05:17.579 --> 00:05:23.729
 yourself directly there while jumping here 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:26.159
 0 before and the clutch is much better that is 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.869
 it looks like this is how all 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.529
 Thank you all for your attention.
