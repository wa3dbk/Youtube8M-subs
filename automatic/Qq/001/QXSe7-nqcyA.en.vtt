00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 and so for a start we boil potatoes 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:11.179
 we will need half a kilo of boiled 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:15.179
 potato flour somewhere 130 150 grams by 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:17.870
 consistency of potato and there is a cat with 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.870
 a fork 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:27.829
 it is possible to add 1 more egg but since 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.829
 I do not eat eggs I will not add 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.860
 pour everything on the table and knead the dough 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.670
 when such are the tubes 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.150
 now we take every single one 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.660
 slice 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.660
 we make such boxes and 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.880
 such a movement with your thumb on 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:48.250
 have a little bit doing so here's the pocket 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:51.510
 that is, so that a little bit drove by 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.510
 the table rolled 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:13.040
 so all the remaining pieces are 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:16.959
 we got to cook and literally a couple 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.959
 minutes until they come up 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.130
 enjoy your meal
