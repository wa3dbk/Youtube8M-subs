evolution start on on the play better

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.160 
evolution start on on the play better
menu<00:00:26.480> of<00:00:26.680> chessboard<00:00:27.680> net<00:00:28.449> so<00:00:29.449> the<00:00:29.779> roadmap<00:00:30.140> is

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
menu of chessboard net so the roadmap is

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.680 
menu of chessboard net so the roadmap is
is<00:00:30.500> itself<00:00:31.010> subject<00:00:31.220> to<00:00:31.490> change<00:00:31.820> so<00:00:32.360> it's<00:00:32.480> on

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
is itself subject to change so it's on

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.410 
is itself subject to change so it's on
play<00:00:32.870> better<00:00:33.940> evolution<00:00:34.940> of<00:00:35.059> style<00:00:35.410> and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
play better evolution of style and

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.889 
play better evolution of style and
you'll<00:00:38.420> see<00:00:38.690> here<00:00:39.019> that<00:00:39.970> I've<00:00:40.970> mentioned<00:00:41.809> the

you'll see here that I've mentioned the

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.420 
you'll see here that I've mentioned the
link<00:00:42.110> to<00:00:42.290> the<00:00:42.380> glossary<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:42.920> schools<00:00:43.220> of

link to the glossary the schools of

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.120 
link to the glossary the schools of
chess<00:00:44.079> so<00:00:45.079> that's<00:00:45.260> fairly<00:00:45.559> important<00:00:45.980> because

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
chess so that's fairly important because

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.280 
chess so that's fairly important because
a<00:00:46.670> school<00:00:47.090> of<00:00:47.270> chess<00:00:47.480> is<00:00:47.660> like<00:00:47.809> a<00:00:47.840> group<00:00:48.110> of

a school of chess is like a group of
players<00:00:48.440> with<00:00:48.680> similar<00:00:49.040> stylistic

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
players with similar stylistic

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
attributes and the world champions are

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.280 
attributes and the world champions are
also<00:00:54.680> a<00:00:54.920> major<00:00:55.520> impacts<00:00:56.210> on<00:00:56.360> styles<00:00:56.750> sometimes

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
also a major impacts on styles sometimes

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.040 
also a major impacts on styles sometimes
for<00:00:58.100> example<00:00:58.160> if<00:00:58.760> we<00:00:59.270> never<00:00:59.450> get<00:00:59.660> down<00:00:59.840> and

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
for example if we never get down and

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.680 
for example if we never get down and
look<00:01:00.140> at<00:01:00.260> Stein<00:01:00.620> it's<00:01:00.829> I<00:01:01.100> mean<00:01:01.850> he<00:01:02.090> was<00:01:02.480> the

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
look at Stein it's I mean he was the

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.560 
look at Stein it's I mean he was the
kind<00:01:03.110> of<00:01:03.230> founder<00:01:03.620> of<00:01:03.800> the<00:01:03.950> idea<00:01:04.220> of<00:01:04.570> position

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
kind of founder of the idea of position

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.760 
kind of founder of the idea of position
will<00:01:05.660> play<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.930> accumulation<00:01:06.530> of<00:01:06.619> small

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
will play the accumulation of small

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.749 
will play the accumulation of small
advantages<00:01:07.580> to<00:01:08.149> just<00:01:08.360> win<00:01:08.539> a<00:01:08.570> game<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.520> later

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
advantages to just win a game and later

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.600 
advantages to just win a game and later
you<00:01:10.940> know<00:01:11.030> his<00:01:11.539> ideas<00:01:11.960> were<00:01:12.110> refined<00:01:12.619> by

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
you know his ideas were refined by

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.600 
you know his ideas were refined by
Tarrasch<00:01:14.149> and<00:01:15.110> it<00:01:15.800> was<00:01:15.890> against<00:01:16.220> Tarrasch

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
Tarrasch and it was against Tarrasch

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.690 
Tarrasch and it was against Tarrasch
that<00:01:16.910> he<00:01:17.360> had<00:01:17.509> a<00:01:17.539> fierce<00:01:17.869> rival<00:01:18.440> in<00:01:19.399> the<00:01:19.520> form

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
that he had a fierce rival in the form

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.480 
that he had a fierce rival in the form
of<00:01:19.789> nimzowitsch<00:01:20.619> who<00:01:21.619> was<00:01:22.160> one<00:01:22.310> of<00:01:22.399> the

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
of nimzowitsch who was one of the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.219 
of nimzowitsch who was one of the
members<00:01:22.700> of<00:01:22.940> that<00:01:23.119> school<00:01:23.600> called<00:01:23.899> the<00:01:23.990> hyper

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
members of that school called the hyper

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.650 
members of that school called the hyper
modern<00:01:24.679> school<00:01:25.490> but<00:01:25.640> there<00:01:25.759> was<00:01:25.880> also<00:01:26.000> richard

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
modern school but there was also richard

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.020 
modern school but there was also richard
reti<00:01:26.869> and<00:01:27.380> actually<00:01:28.280> i've<00:01:28.340> checked<00:01:28.520> out<00:01:28.789> some

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
reti and actually i've checked out some

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.089 
reti and actually i've checked out some
references<00:01:29.509> about<00:01:29.690> hyper<00:01:30.229> modernism<00:01:30.890> because

00:01:31.089 --> 00:01:31.099 
references about hyper modernism because

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:32.589 
references about hyper modernism because
that's<00:01:31.310> that's<00:01:31.640> like<00:01:31.849> the<00:01:32.209> most<00:01:32.390> radical

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:32.599 
that's that's like the most radical

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:35.350 
that's that's like the most radical
school<00:01:33.259> against<00:01:34.069> the<00:01:34.160> classical<00:01:34.640> school<00:01:34.970> and

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
school against the classical school and

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.690 
school against the classical school and
i<00:01:36.080> think<00:01:36.319> there<00:01:36.440> is<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.560> little<00:01:36.800> misconception

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
i think there is a little misconception

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.240 
i think there is a little misconception
that<00:01:37.910> it<00:01:38.300> was<00:01:38.420> all<00:01:38.539> about<00:01:38.690> some<00:01:39.259> you<00:01:40.039> know<00:01:40.130> the

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
that it was all about some you know the

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.680 
that it was all about some you know the
change<00:01:40.520> in<00:01:40.700> perception<00:01:40.970> of<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.330> center

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
change in perception of the center

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.210 
change in perception of the center
occupying<00:01:42.140> central<00:01:42.590> pawns<00:01:42.800> that<00:01:42.920> that<00:01:43.099> was

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
occupying central pawns that that was

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.940 
occupying central pawns that that was
only<00:01:43.310> one<00:01:43.640> part<00:01:43.970> of<00:01:44.330> nimzowitsch<00:01:45.140> my<00:01:45.500> system

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
only one part of nimzowitsch my system

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.190 
only one part of nimzowitsch my system
there's<00:01:46.190> also<00:01:46.310> other<00:01:46.670> aspects<00:01:47.240> that<00:01:47.750> names<00:01:48.080> of

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
there's also other aspects that names of

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.779 
there's also other aspects that names of
actually<00:01:48.440> introduced<00:01:48.830> so<00:01:48.920> I<00:01:48.979> think<00:01:49.039> for

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
actually introduced so I think for

moment<00:02:12.739> he<00:02:13.580> invented<00:02:14.360> like<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.630> reti<00:02:14.810> system

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
moment he invented like the reti system

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.870 
moment he invented like the reti system
with<00:02:15.349> Knight<00:02:15.530> f3<00:02:15.709> which<00:02:16.130> obviously<00:02:16.400> doesn't

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
with Knight f3 which obviously doesn't

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.080 
with Knight f3 which obviously doesn't
occupy<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.719> center<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.290> then<00:02:18.549> Alekhine<00:02:19.549> has

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
occupy the center and then Alekhine has

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.300 
occupy the center and then Alekhine has
got<00:02:20.269> his<00:02:20.420> Alekhine's<00:02:21.019> defense

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
got his Alekhine's defense

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.540 
got his Alekhine's defense
but<00:02:22.910> I<00:02:22.940> think<00:02:23.200> for<00:02:24.200> me<00:02:24.349> that's<00:02:24.560> not<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.950> full

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
but I think for me that's not the full

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.220 
but I think for me that's not the full
extent<00:02:25.940> of<00:02:26.000> what<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:26.180> quads<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:26.750> Anderson<00:02:27.080> is

so<00:03:11.870> alekhine<00:03:12.410> was<00:03:12.590> kind<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:13.280> know<00:03:13.310> when<00:03:13.940> he

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
so alekhine was kind of you know when he

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.880 
so alekhine was kind of you know when he
beat<00:03:14.299> cab<00:03:14.540> blank<00:03:14.810> he<00:03:14.959> showed<00:03:15.200> that<00:03:15.230> by<00:03:15.590> members

beat cab blank he showed that by members

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.860 
beat cab blank he showed that by members
of<00:03:15.920> was<00:03:16.099> still<00:03:16.310> in<00:03:16.519> existence<00:03:16.940> maybe<00:03:17.510> kappa

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.140

blanka<00:03:18.140> was<00:03:18.470> saying<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:19.760> know<00:03:19.849> even

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
blanka was saying you know even

blanka was saying you know even
suggesting<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:20.840> chess<00:03:21.440> has<00:03:21.590> been<00:03:21.739> exhausted

suggesting that chess has been exhausted

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.789 
suggesting that chess has been exhausted
so<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.459> was<00:03:22.549> good<00:03:22.670> that<00:03:22.730> we<00:03:22.910> had<00:03:23.150> this<00:03:23.470> this<00:03:24.470> era

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
so it was good that we had this this era

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.830 
so it was good that we had this this era
that<00:03:25.160> we<00:03:25.640> could<00:03:25.819> challenge<00:03:26.060> you<00:03:26.510> know<00:03:26.600> kappa

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
that we could challenge you know kappa

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.319 
that we could challenge you know kappa
blanka<00:03:27.109> who<00:03:27.890> really<00:03:28.220> took<00:03:28.489> you<00:03:28.850> know<00:03:28.940> the

principles of stylist to the enth level

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.400

and<00:03:31.730> became<00:03:32.269> like<00:03:32.450> a<00:03:32.510> chess<00:03:32.810> machine<00:03:33.019> and

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
and became like a chess machine and

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.199 
and became like a chess machine and
almost<00:03:34.040> an<00:03:34.130> invincible<00:03:34.579> chess<00:03:34.820> machine<00:03:35.090> for

almost an invincible chess machine for
many<00:03:35.390> years<00:03:35.950> so<00:03:36.950> we<00:03:37.040> had<00:03:37.190> that<00:03:37.340> challenge

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
many years so we had that challenge

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.170 
many years so we had that challenge
later<00:03:38.299> which<00:03:39.290> for<00:03:39.890> me<00:03:40.010> kind<00:03:40.280> of<00:03:40.340> mirrors<00:03:40.670> cup

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
later which for me kind of mirrors cup

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.870 
later which for me kind of mirrors cup
of<00:03:41.329> life<00:03:41.690> much<00:03:41.900> in<00:03:42.109> much<00:03:42.560> later<00:03:42.799> years<00:03:43.160> then<00:03:43.790> we
