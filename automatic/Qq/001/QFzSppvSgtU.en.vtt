the circle lenses what makes them
uniquely<00:00:20.970> different<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.810> diameter

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
uniquely different is that the diameter

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.650 
uniquely different is that the diameter
of<00:00:22.439> these<00:00:22.650> lenses<00:00:23.010> are<00:00:23.130> much<00:00:23.340> larger<00:00:23.699> than<00:00:24.359> a

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
of these lenses are much larger than a

diameter in the contact lens the less

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.810

oxygen<00:00:30.060> gets<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.410> eye<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.460> if<00:00:32.669> you're

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
oxygen gets to the eye and so if you're

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.760 
oxygen gets to the eye and so if you're
covering<00:00:33.360> up<00:00:33.600> more<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.200> eye<00:00:34.230> with<00:00:34.590> this

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
covering up more of the eye with this

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.069 
covering up more of the eye with this
plastic<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.149> what<00:00:36.360> makes<00:00:36.570> these<00:00:36.780> more

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
plastic that is what makes these more

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.650 
plastic that is what makes these more
detrimental<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.550> other<00:00:38.730> thing<00:00:39.000> too<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
detrimental the other thing too is the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.720 
detrimental the other thing too is the

these lenses that are that are made that
people<00:01:24.840> are<00:01:24.930> buying

again flea markets and other places

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.560

often<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.799> lens<00:01:28.979> material<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.490> made<00:01:29.850> offshore

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
often the lens material is made offshore

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.660 
often the lens material is made offshore
pain<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.439> not<00:01:31.619> anything<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.340> currently

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
pain it's not anything that is currently

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.490 
pain it's not anything that is currently
used<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.030> United<00:01:33.270> States<00:01:33.540> for<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> reason<00:01:34.290> it's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
used the United States for a reason it's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.260 
used the United States for a reason it's
material<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.189> doesn't<00:01:35.369> breathe<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:35.850> well<00:01:36.030> as

material that doesn't breathe as well as

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
a much higher risk of infection and so

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.340 
a much higher risk of infection and so
when<00:01:39.000> you're<00:01:39.119> using<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.840> lens<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.229> that

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
when you're using the lens in that

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.289 
when you're using the lens in that
scenario<00:01:40.530> you're<00:01:41.460> really<00:01:41.759> not<00:01:42.060> only

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
scenario you're really not only

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.130 
scenario you're really not only
increasing<00:01:42.720> your<00:01:42.810> risk<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.049> infection

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
increasing your risk of infection

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.160 
increasing your risk of infection
because<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:45.030> lack<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.540> knowledge<00:01:45.899> of

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
because of the the lack of knowledge of

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.749 
because of the the lack of knowledge of
how<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.290> use<00:01:46.500> them<00:01:46.649> safely<00:01:46.950> but<00:01:47.460> they're<00:01:47.610> also

how to use them safely but they're also
