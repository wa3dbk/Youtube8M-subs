00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
take apart on xbox 360 controller with a

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.580 
take apart on xbox 360 controller with a
battery<00:00:10.559> drill<00:00:11.599> very<00:00:12.599> attractive<00:00:13.380> drill

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
battery drill very attractive drill

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.860 
battery drill very attractive drill
Black<00:00:14.040> &amp;<00:00:14.219> Decker<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:15.450> way<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.750> did

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
Black &amp; Decker and the way that I did

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.840 
Black &amp; Decker and the way that I did
this<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.859> basically<00:00:17.039> just<00:00:17.340> find<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
this is you basically just find the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.150 
this is you basically just find the
smallest<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:19.080> possible<00:00:19.560> drill<00:00:19.830> bit<00:00:19.980> as<00:00:20.070> you

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
smallest it's possible drill bit as you

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.700 
smallest it's possible drill bit as you
can<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.840> this<00:00:21.840> basically<00:00:22.140> just<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
can and this basically just the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.290 
can and this basically just the
technique<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.220> work<00:00:23.340> for<00:00:23.550> me<00:00:23.670> from<00:00:24.060> what<00:00:24.269> I

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
technique that work for me from what I

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.750 
technique that work for me from what I
had<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.289> got<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.010> my<00:00:26.220> original<00:00:26.550> plan

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
had so I got that and my original plan

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.480 
had so I got that and my original plan
was<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.300> got<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.769> don't<00:00:29.099> really<00:00:29.310> remember

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
was I got this I don't really remember

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.189 
was I got this I don't really remember
what<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.910> called<00:00:29.970> but<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.420> fits<00:00:30.720> perfect

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
what it's called but it fits perfect

control of two so and there they have
special<00:00:40.710> tool<00:00:40.860> kids<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.280> are<00:00:41.340> like<00:00:41.460> five

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
special tool kids that are like five

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.959 
special tool kids that are like five
dollars<00:00:41.879> with<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:43.040> screwdriver<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:44.700> this

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
dollars with a screwdriver like this

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.319 
dollars with a screwdriver like this
that<00:00:45.660> thingy<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> hole<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.329> then

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
that thingy with a hole in it then

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.970 
that thingy with a hole in it then
because<00:00:48.750> there's<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.960> little<00:00:49.170> safety<00:00:49.410> now<00:00:49.739> been

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
because there's a little safety now been

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.439 
because there's a little safety now been
there<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.370> then<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.579> guess<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.879> can't<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.360> or

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
there so then I guess we can't do it or

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.049 
there so then I guess we can't do it or
so<00:00:51.600> because<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.530> guess<00:00:52.649> Xbox<00:00:53.070> wants<00:00:53.430> us<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:53.789> I

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
so because I guess Xbox wants us to be I

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.189 
so because I guess Xbox wants us to be I
don't<00:00:54.539> know<00:00:54.629> powerless<00:00:55.520> against<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.640> stuff

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
don't know powerless against that stuff

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.580 
don't know powerless against that stuff
but<00:00:58.199> anyways<00:00:59.039> and<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.350> was<00:01:01.500> originally

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
but anyways and so I was originally

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.310 
but anyways and so I was originally
going<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:01.980> drill<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.309> little<00:01:02.550> hole<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.760> but

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
going to drill that little hole in but

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.899 
going to drill that little hole in but
then<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.890> didn't<00:01:05.220> really<00:01:05.309> work<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.670> too<00:01:05.880> well

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
then it didn't really work out too well

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.600 
then it didn't really work out too well
and<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.180> got<00:01:06.210> kind<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.570> bored<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.930> then<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.110> just
