everybody gets Brian I'm here with a
really<00:00:57.720> cool<00:00:58.080> scale<00:00:58.500> project<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.130> is<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
really cool scale project this is a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.750 
really cool scale project this is a
model<00:01:00.090> from<00:01:00.330> aerodrome<00:01:01.080> RC<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.580> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
model from aerodrome RC and it is the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.210 
model from aerodrome RC and it is the
fokker<00:01:03.270> eindecker<00:01:04.730> III<00:01:05.730> and<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:07.170> 66<00:01:07.830> 6u

fokker eindecker III and the 66 6u
version<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.820> they<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:09.840> have<00:01:09.990> two<00:01:10.140> versions

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
version of it they do have two versions

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.380 
version of it they do have two versions
there's<00:01:10.560> an<00:01:10.650> easy<00:01:10.770> build<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.520> then<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.210> one

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
there's an easy build and then this one

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.600 
there's an easy build and then this one
which<00:01:12.540> has<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.720> under<00:01:12.990> cambered<00:01:13.350> wings<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.890> a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
which has the under cambered wings and a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.540 
which has the under cambered wings and a
lot<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.440> got<00:01:16.440> the<00:01:16.500> under<00:01:16.650> camber<00:01:16.979> wing<00:01:17.190> version

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
lot I got the under camber wing version

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.310 
lot I got the under camber wing version
that<00:01:18.000> I've<00:01:18.120> removed<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.630> other<00:01:18.720> ones<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
that I've removed the other ones and

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.350 
that I've removed the other ones and
I've<00:01:19.470> added<00:01:19.680> wing<00:01:20.280> warping<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.880> that's<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.180> bit

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
I've added wing warping so that's a bit

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.640 
I've added wing warping so that's a bit
more<00:01:21.479> scale<00:01:21.750> about<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.110> few<00:01:22.260> more<00:01:22.440> scale

first<00:02:51.459> of<00:02:51.520> all<00:02:51.610> let's<00:02:51.730> talk<00:02:51.790> about<00:02:52.030> how<00:02:52.120> it

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
first of all let's talk about how it

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.010 
first of all let's talk about how it
flew<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:54.040> Wigmore<00:02:54.220> if<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.520> works<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:55.120> was<00:02:55.870> able

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
flew the Wigmore if it works it was able

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.930 
flew the Wigmore if it works it was able
to<00:02:56.080> control<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.709> aircraft<00:02:56.740> well<00:02:57.580> enough<00:02:57.790> that

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
to control the aircraft well enough that

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.520 
to control the aircraft well enough that
I<00:02:58.000> could<00:02:58.209> fly<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.510> left<00:02:59.320> to<00:02:59.410> right<00:03:01.110> fine<00:03:02.110> Pishin

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
I could fly it left to right fine Pishin

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.640 
I could fly it left to right fine Pishin
and<00:03:03.160> rudder<00:03:03.640> control<00:03:04.000> but<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:05.110> Proclaimers

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
and rudder control but the Proclaimers

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.080 
and rudder control but the Proclaimers
bit<00:03:05.770> of<00:03:05.830> vibration<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.280> what<00:03:06.550> happened<00:03:06.940> was

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
bit of vibration and what happened was

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.240 
bit of vibration and what happened was
the<00:03:07.540> cow<00:03:07.720> started<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.290> repeats<00:03:08.860> propeller

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
the cow started to repeats propeller

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.370 
the cow started to repeats propeller
it's<00:03:09.760> held<00:03:09.970> on<00:03:10.090> my<00:03:10.300> magnets<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.900> probably

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
it's held on my magnets I probably

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.750 
it's held on my magnets I probably
should<00:03:11.560> have<00:03:11.590> tied<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.130> down<00:03:12.310> with<00:03:12.459> tape<00:03:12.640> or

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
should have tied it down with tape or

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.010 
should have tied it down with tape or
something<00:03:12.940> like<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:13.270> but<00:03:13.420> once<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.780> cowl

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
something like that but once the cowl

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.770 
something like that but once the cowl
went<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.730> motor<00:03:15.940> was<00:03:16.090> attached<00:03:16.330> to<00:03:16.480> that<00:03:16.600> held

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
went the motor was attached to that held

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.990 
went the motor was attached to that held
the<00:03:16.840> dummy<00:03:17.110> engine<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:18.250> stayed<00:03:18.970> with

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
the dummy engine and that stayed with

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.060 
the dummy engine and that stayed with
the<00:03:19.360> motor<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.870> real<00:03:20.080> motor<00:03:20.350> and<00:03:20.770> spent

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
the motor the real motor and spent

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.160 
the motor the real motor and spent
around<00:03:21.130> of<00:03:21.459> course<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:22.480> balance<00:03:23.020> was

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
around of course the balance was

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.740 
around of course the balance was
completely<00:03:23.620> lost<00:03:23.800> at<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:23.980> point<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.750> and

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
completely lost at that point and and

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.720 
completely lost at that point and and
then<00:03:25.900> essentially<00:03:26.770> they<00:03:26.980> were<00:03:27.010> electric

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
then essentially they were electric

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.010 
then essentially they were electric
motor<00:03:27.910> tour<00:03:28.450> itself<00:03:28.630> loose

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
motor tour itself loose

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.260 
motor tour itself loose
and<00:03:29.110> that's<00:03:29.620> when<00:03:29.800> it<00:03:30.190> went<00:03:30.310> down<00:03:30.430> doesn't

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
and that's when it went down doesn't

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.540 
and that's when it went down doesn't
seem<00:03:31.360> to<00:03:31.450> be<00:03:31.540> any<00:03:31.720> real<00:03:32.230> damage<00:03:32.470> except<00:03:33.400> for

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
seem to be any real damage except for

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.280 
seem to be any real damage except for
just<00:03:33.730> to<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:33.970> front<00:03:34.180> end<00:03:34.360> here<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.930> maybe<00:03:35.140> a

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
just to the front end here and maybe a

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.600 
just to the front end here and maybe a
little<00:03:35.500> bit<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.769> red<00:03:35.860> I'm<00:03:35.980> not<00:03:36.130> sure<00:03:36.340> I

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
little bit to the red I'm not sure I

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.910 
little bit to the red I'm not sure I
think<00:03:37.000> some<00:03:37.120> item<00:03:37.299> just<00:03:37.450> loosened<00:03:37.780> up<00:03:37.900> yeah<00:03:38.860> I

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
think some item just loosened up yeah I

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.729 
think some item just loosened up yeah I

overall<00:03:43.840> as<00:03:44.049> far<00:03:44.230> as<00:03:44.320> the<00:03:44.500> wing<00:03:44.920> warping

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
overall as far as the wing warping

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.340 
overall as far as the wing warping
experiment<00:03:45.850> goes<00:03:46.000> I'm<00:03:46.209> going<00:03:46.330> to<00:03:46.390> call<00:03:46.540> it<00:03:46.630> XSS

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
experiment goes I'm going to call it XSS

and<00:03:47.650> this<00:03:48.340> is<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.640> aerodrome<00:03:49.030> RC<00:03:49.450> 66<00:03:50.260> inch

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
and this is the aerodrome RC 66 inch

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.550 
and this is the aerodrome RC 66 inch
