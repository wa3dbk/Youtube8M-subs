sector but can you really make an

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.839 
sector but can you really make an

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.870 

short<00:00:28.460> answer<00:00:28.910> no<00:00:29.320> and<00:00:30.320> the<00:00:30.920> slightly<00:00:31.430> longer

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
short answer no and the slightly longer

short answer no and the slightly longer
answer<00:00:32.860> still<00:00:33.860> no<00:00:34.130> this<00:00:34.820> is<00:00:35.120> an<00:00:35.390> impressive

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
answer still no this is an impressive

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.520 
answer still no this is an impressive
effort<00:00:36.230> by<00:00:36.620> Mazda<00:00:37.130> but<00:00:37.820> then<00:00:38.050> every<00:00:39.050> other<00:00:39.170> car

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530

in<00:00:39.739> this<00:00:39.830> sector<00:00:40.160> that's<00:00:40.400> worth<00:00:40.699> buying<00:00:41.120> is

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
in this sector that's worth buying is

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.880 
in this sector that's worth buying is
also<00:00:41.840> very<00:00:42.230> neat<00:00:42.620> to<00:00:42.860> drive<00:00:44.350> so<00:00:45.350> what<00:00:45.559> else<00:00:45.739> is

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
also very neat to drive so what else is
