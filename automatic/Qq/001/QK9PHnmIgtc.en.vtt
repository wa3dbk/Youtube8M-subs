00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.550 

it's<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.700> one<00:03:17.849> dove<00:03:18.000> time<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:19.109> make<00:03:19.230> this<00:03:19.379> you

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
it's the one dove time to make this you

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.229 
it's the one dove time to make this you
need<00:03:19.680> white<00:03:20.250> one<00:03:20.459> in<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.639> middle<00:03:20.849> and<00:03:21.209> roll

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
top button and feathers on either side

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.679 
top button and feathers on either side
and<00:03:24.900> all<00:03:25.049> this<00:03:25.200> does<00:03:25.469> is<00:03:25.739> creates<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.909> two

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:27.689 
and all this does is creates it two

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.140 
and all this does is creates it two
different<00:03:27.780> times<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.760> you're<00:03:29.760> right<00:03:29.909> clicking

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
different times so you're right clicking

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
it you'll change the time for you all

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.449 
it you'll change the time for you all
right<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:33.329> guess<00:03:33.599> I<00:03:34.010> think<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.159> just<00:03:35.310> have<00:03:35.430> a

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
right I guess I think you just have a

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.879 
right I guess I think you just have a
bed<00:03:35.730> that<00:03:35.760> much<00:03:36.150> easier<00:03:36.680> so<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.769> one

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
bed that much easier so the one

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.710 
bed that much easier so the one
disappear<00:03:38.340> serves<00:03:38.909> around<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.269> edge<00:03:39.389> and

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
disappear serves around the edge and

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.099 
disappear serves around the edge and
Puntland<00:03:40.650> in<00:03:40.859> the<00:03:40.950> middle<00:03:44.870> keeping<00:03:45.870> hold<00:03:46.019> of

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
Puntland in the middle keeping hold of

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.479 
Puntland in the middle keeping hold of
it<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.260> lets<00:03:46.469> you<00:03:46.650> speed<00:03:47.519> up<00:03:48.919> so<00:03:49.919> let's<00:03:50.310> just
