00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.130 

I'm<00:00:02.639> going<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.879> get<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.210> taillight<00:00:03.629> started

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
I'm going to get the taillight started

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.560 
I'm going to get the taillight started
here<00:00:04.350> I<00:00:05.060> made<00:00:06.060> my<00:00:06.270> first<00:00:08.240> bolt<00:00:09.380> stand<00:00:10.380> off

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
here I made my first bolt stand off

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.160 
here I made my first bolt stand off
you<00:00:12.570> know<00:00:12.660> which<00:00:12.900> gives<00:00:13.349> me<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.590> plain<00:00:15.049> stick<00:00:16.049> a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
you know which gives me a plain stick a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.290 
you know which gives me a plain stick a
backing<00:00:16.619> on<00:00:19.460> and<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.609> course<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:21.060> is

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
backing on and of course this is

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.890 
backing on and of course this is
symmetrical<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.320> I'll<00:00:22.439> be<00:00:22.619> able<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:23.689> use<00:00:24.689> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
symmetrical so I'll be able to use the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.980 
symmetrical so I'll be able to use the
same<00:00:25.170> template<00:00:25.980> from<00:00:26.939> one<00:00:27.150> side<00:00:27.420> as<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.660> do<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
same template from one side as I do the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.669 
same template from one side as I do the
other<00:00:28.170> I'll<00:00:28.380> just<00:00:28.529> flip<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.920> over<00:00:29.160> too

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
other I'll just flip that over too

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.910 
other I'll just flip that over too
because<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.920> can<00:00:31.949> do<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> other<00:00:32.940> side

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
because I can do that for the other side

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:44.180 
because I can do that for the other side
and<00:00:34.920> then<00:00:35.100> still<00:00:35.610> got<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:36.000> one<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.420> do<00:00:43.190> so

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
and then still got this one to do so

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.610 
and then still got this one to do so
I'll<00:00:44.370> take<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.879> piece<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.300> fiberglass<00:00:48.620> probably

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
I'll take a piece of fiberglass probably

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.740 
I'll take a piece of fiberglass probably
cut<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.219> similar<00:00:50.610> shape<00:00:51.180> as<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:53.750> and

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
cut it to similar shape as that and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.630 
cut it to similar shape as that and
that'll<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.500> back<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.780> then<00:00:58.489> got<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
that'll be the back and then got to

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.179 
that'll be the back and then got to
create<00:00:59.879> some<00:01:00.270> sides<00:01:02.449> for<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:05.100> then

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
create some sides for that and then

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.810 
create some sides for that and then
after<00:01:05.580> that's<00:01:05.700> done<00:01:06.060> that'll<00:01:06.450> be<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> pocket

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
after that's done that'll be a pocket

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:15.530 
after that's done that'll be a pocket
which<00:01:08.820> I'll<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:09.659> able<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:13.820> stick<00:01:14.820> inside<00:01:15.000> there

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
which I'll be able to stick inside there

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.200 
which I'll be able to stick inside there
so

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:31.560 

that's<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.390> plan<00:01:21.600> anyway

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.790 

and<00:01:32.020> I<00:01:32.110> got<00:01:32.320> this<00:01:32.560> done<00:01:32.950> up<00:01:33.220> here<00:01:34.800> underneath

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
and I got this done up here underneath

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.300 
and I got this done up here underneath
the<00:01:36.040> hood<00:01:36.220> that<00:01:37.560> leaves<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.710> nice<00:01:38.890> little

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
the hood that leaves a nice little

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.180 
the hood that leaves a nice little
pocket<00:01:39.550> for<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.030> wheel<00:01:40.210> in<00:01:40.450> there<00:01:41.190> hopefully

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
pocket for the wheel in there hopefully

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.990 
pocket for the wheel in there hopefully
this<00:01:42.640> isn't<00:01:42.880> too<00:01:43.830> close<00:01:44.830> if<00:01:45.130> it<00:01:45.280> is<00:01:45.430> I'll<00:01:45.640> move

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
this isn't too close if it is I'll move

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.450 
this isn't too close if it is I'll move
it<00:01:48.120> yeah

that way you know when I peel that out
of<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:16.110> fiberglass<00:02:17.110> they'll<00:02:17.650> be<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:18.130> know

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
of the fiberglass they'll be you know

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.100 
of the fiberglass they'll be you know
about<00:02:18.460> that<00:02:18.670> much<00:02:18.880> gap<00:02:19.150> in<00:02:19.360> between<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.900> light

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
about that much gap in between the light

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:27.290 
about that much gap in between the light
and<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:22.420> little<00:02:22.660> shell<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:25.959> don't<00:02:26.230> know

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
and this little shell so I don't know

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.220 
and this little shell so I don't know
I'm<00:02:28.300> just<00:02:28.360> winging<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:30.780> I've<00:02:31.780> never<00:02:31.990> really

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
I'm just winging it I've never really

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.290 
I'm just winging it I've never really
done<00:02:32.440> anything<00:02:32.800> like<00:02:33.010> this<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:33.850> we'll<00:02:34.120> see

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
done anything like this so we'll see

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.600 
done anything like this so we'll see
what<00:02:34.450> happens<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:38.459> here's<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.640> third<00:02:39.880> one

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
what happens so here's the third one

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.949 
what happens so here's the third one
starting<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.670> figure<00:02:42.850> out<00:02:43.090> how<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.540> do<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.900> a

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
starting to figure out how to do it a

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.590 
starting to figure out how to do it a
little<00:02:44.080> bit<00:02:44.260> better<00:02:44.910> I've<00:02:45.910> got<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.209> pieces

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
little bit better I've got the pieces

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.850 
little bit better I've got the pieces
cut<00:02:46.840> out<00:02:46.870> I'm<00:02:47.530> only<00:02:47.739> going<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.310> layers<00:02:49.860> deep

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
cut out I'm only going to layers deep

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.300 
cut out I'm only going to layers deep
this<00:02:51.790> one<00:02:52.120> is<00:02:52.390> two<00:02:52.690> layers<00:02:53.019> deep<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.709> it's

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
this one is two layers deep and it's

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.790 
this one is two layers deep and it's
gonna<00:02:57.489> be<00:02:57.730> plenty<00:02:58.030> thick<00:02:58.390> enough<00:03:01.800> pretty

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
gonna be plenty thick enough pretty

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.100 
gonna be plenty thick enough pretty
sturdy<00:03:03.130> pretty<00:03:03.730> strong<00:03:06.510> this<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.780> first

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
sturdy pretty strong this is the first

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.640 
sturdy pretty strong this is the first
one<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:08.380> did<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:12.459> it's<00:03:12.670> beefy<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:14.410> thing

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
one I did and and it's beefy the thing

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.800 
one I did and and it's beefy the thing
turned<00:03:14.860> out<00:03:15.100> way<00:03:15.280> too<00:03:15.340> thick<00:03:16.830> but<00:03:17.830> whatever

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
turned out way too thick but whatever

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.199 
turned out way too thick but whatever
I'm<00:03:19.810> not<00:03:19.870> gonna<00:03:20.140> redo<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.880> that's<00:03:21.880> what<00:03:22.090> it

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
I'm not gonna redo it that's what it

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.350 
I'm not gonna redo it that's what it
looks<00:03:22.420> like<00:03:22.630> turned<00:03:23.140> out<00:03:23.260> pretty<00:03:23.410> good<00:03:24.360> you

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.850 

I'm<00:04:43.880> not<00:04:44.000> sure<00:04:44.240> how<00:04:44.480> far<00:04:44.810> apart<00:04:45.230> I<00:04:45.380> want<00:04:45.590> those

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
I'm not sure how far apart I want those

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.190 
I'm not sure how far apart I want those
I<00:04:46.130> might<00:04:46.310> have<00:04:46.520> to<00:04:46.670> cut<00:04:46.940> into<00:04:47.180> there<00:04:47.480> bring<00:04:48.170> it

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
I might have to cut into there bring it

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.860 
I might have to cut into there bring it
together<00:04:48.530> more<00:04:51.910> maybe<00:04:52.910> that's<00:04:53.210> as<00:04:53.450> far<00:04:53.750> apart

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
together more maybe that's as far apart

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.440
