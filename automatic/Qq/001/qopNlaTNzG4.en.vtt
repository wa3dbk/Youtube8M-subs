00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.060

 talk video I have the last times too 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.369
 two actually made and talk videos 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.470
 I thought it was nice to be there once 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.179
 say a subject to grab true 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.920
 quite often talked about and 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.390
 which quite a lot of people think about 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.370
 actually before they start 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.010
 youtube suffers from the title already seen 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.480
 youtube at my school i'm gonna say man 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.370
 tell my experience with hjoed 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.110
 how to deal with maud schools 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.789
 people look at you what is thought of what 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.530
 become an everything and say mine 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.760
 experience with that as I said I 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.500
 also like to hear from you how you 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.570
 experience at school and whether you find yourself one 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.520
 can recognize something in this and the same 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.379
 have feelings like me well let me 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.879
 at least start at the beginning and 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.770
 at least when i started with youtube 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.539
 that was very much from the end of the second 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.520
 class I was really afraid of 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.589
 responses how people would think of 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.000
 he does youtube he is ready and me 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.590
 I didn't know how to do that 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.420
 had to deal with I was really scared 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.159
 what other people would think of it and 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.780
 you would be looked at at you 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.850
 anyone who starts with youtube that is 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.350
 also just as afraid of no I'm going 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.970
 don't start with youtube i'm scared 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.490
 the reactions of people with school 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.990
 everyone judges each other so quickly 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.700
 that is also so natural in the language and 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.200
 you are probably scared yourself too 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.759
 try to keep it a secret at school 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.530
 that you do with youtube also creates it 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.720
 tried the start at given time 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.880
 I just had a shit and goodbye 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.710
 let's go box this is my thing me 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.430
 think it's great fun and everything and I'm going to 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.600
 just do it 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.159
 well so at the start of my 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.380
 I made the YouTube channel real 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.759
 pussy videos and i already told you to 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.040
 my friends there it was anyway 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.479
 started with my friends and she laughed 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.570
 say a bit off they were 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.340
 mocking with your name so from their group xl 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.780
 and everything you know look this will be from cup 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.640
 then you so much my channel where they 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.439
 I laughed at me, spotting one 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.240
 bit along and you know where to say one 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.950
 bit harassed and they said of 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.079
 you make very coast are idiots 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.390
 you have to stop this coming out there 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.590
 never well and I just thought yes 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.149
 you will probably think but it makes me 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.679
 it really doesn't matter i like this 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.390
 is my hobby I really like it 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.090
 create videos and on a given 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.400
 moment my channel started to grow and 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.680
 hope wait wait wait 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.150
 then comes the master day people really go 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.530
 call for your tone in one 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.120
 Well at some point always come 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.870
 more people with the behind that you pick 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.940
 to youtube 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:29.709
 more and more friends we always 2 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.480
 pets and I also explain more and more 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.370
 reactions say hey jesse with me 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.020
 at school i know you i recognize you and 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.489
 you come in a bit in the 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.349
 kind of circuit where more and more 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.819
 people get to know you and that's how I got it 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.480
 but more and more people who went to me 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.160
 your whatsapp 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.690
 always people who started following 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.310
 of course and especially of course mine 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.410
 school and then you could just say hi 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.760
 in the attic and then it was supposedly yep 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.989
 just about youtube and i know there too 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.910
 say what has been for a year and that 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.230
 it further and I have a climb and 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.790
 talked further against natural total 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.260
 not but I just watched your videos 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.049
 that's super nice just say one 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.150
 apart world us apart in some people 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.650
 if you do not understand what youtube people 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.940
 do say or what they say we 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.260
 you can reach all you need 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.519
 that also just don't say about it 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.269
 You just have to judge your fucking mouth 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.190
 keep shut 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.569
 but anyway the are so many people 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.650
 you probably also think of it 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.269
 no i don't want to meet my friends 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.769
 tell no this is just secret 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.330
 reveal to think the turn once 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.250
 yes of course i had it too i have it 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.080
 always had but the last year 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.730
 just not in the last 18 months 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.049
 more that just comes from it would be that 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.459
 feeling just comes naturally that you are there 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.560
 shit days we have and think of oh 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.209
 fuck this range right after one on one 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.099
 At a certain moment your subscribers go up 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.329
 take your followers on twitter rising and 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.739
 people think of their why take tits 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.700
 on his personal account I can 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.829
 of course also one 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.760
 so doctor account and then we agree their he 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.200
 has stopped and he has a new one 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.700
 account and so often discover people 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.440
 from school that you say so one 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.120
 another twitter account people want 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.470
 naturally think of why he is like that 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.810
 then one is why has is in 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.010
 for example 1500 followers on twitter 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.180
 but that suddenly was confused 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.980
 just a boy who ran to school and 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.690
 how can it suddenly have 1500 according to 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.640
 we will indeed start all your tweets 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.870
 to read and she looked at your instagram me 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.430
 I also had a few times, for example 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.290
 there people seems to be an instagram photo and 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.400
 then in seeming they knew exactly right 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.139
 what i don't see 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.310
 that they like my photo but I see it 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.780
 of course no I think it is 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.370
 of course very nice as people just 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.350
 you go for school costs first that 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.299
 I really like oh no people will follow me 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.160
 from school I do n't want this public 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.269
 and those with whom you continue to follow that 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.350
 just likes it then you get it 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.000
 for example, such a message from a you 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.190
 makes really nice videos man and then think 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.870
 I really like them but I never had that 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.609
 you expect that you say to 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.350
 my channel looks but then the ones are too 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.160
 of those people among them 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.930
 of those in 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.900
 I'm interested in showing you so oh 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.880
 nice you this and youtube what seemed like a and 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.710
 and what do you earn with that compare the 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.540
 first question do you know or had courses 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.040
 there please go away or anything but ordinary 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.570
 pretending to be someone else's 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.640
 you are interested in that person go 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.200
 just fleece away but I got the 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.360
 burden and also for more and more 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.490
 reactions from a nice man I am with you 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.050
 at school this because i know you hey me 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.550

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.350
 shoe, and the last time that I say 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.690
 increasingly called after and school of 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.640

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.560
 a mockery of their tim flower xl 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.090

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.580
 even my teacher comes to me and 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.030
 that it says about what I am free 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.310

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.590

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.890
 to do something with youtube and me 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.850
 really like it youtube is just 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.350
 my hobby 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.790
 this is my thing and i can just do it 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.470

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.660
 school i had to pass i had to 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.880
 hand out signatures to a girl 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.770
 because her sister give me my youtube channel 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.970
 I think cake is really awful 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.100
 nice box to hand out signatures 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.360
 remains of course something very special for sure 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.770
 if it's at your school I had to 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.150
 namely also experienced what I know 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.010
 namely from the class 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.300
 because a boy in addition wanted mine 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.990
 and I got the signature there 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.930
 so in 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.610
 nice spring day i am ok ok ok ok it is 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.830
 just all very new is visible 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.240
 a very new thing to experience because 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.100
 say you were a normal first 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.620
 very normal boy and now suddenly want 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.419
 people signatures of you that it is 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.130
 just it's just weird and fucking 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.480
 for example also in the bus side was in 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.220
 because the you hear them talking about you is called 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.840
 it's that chio that's di gio 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.400
 and i want it all just like i like it 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.780
 don't know you were and then stayed 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.060
 but talking I think it's funny 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.580
 well and actually i have none at all 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.380
 I regret that youtube and ge 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.810
 do it is so super cool to say so 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.460
 all to do at school and me 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.310
 was really scared in the beginning 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.840
 for school responses but now I have 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.520
 I really don't like that at all 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.650
 I just think it's super cool and everything 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.810
 and when people laugh at you or what an oh 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.340
 if you know what God said support vessels 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.479
 just it's your stuff and if you like that 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.110
 lives and then it will just do then 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:45.400
 you should not 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.470
 thinking of what other people 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.240
 find it then you just go 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.010
 but I'm actually curious 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.600
 how you think about this or how scared you are 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.040
 are for the people at school how they do 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.960
 react because usually as it is 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.699
 Then ask someone why do you start 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.860

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:01.330

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.580
 gone 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.900
 at least I found it once 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.310

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.350
