00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.020 
out the Warped vinyl and I never heard
of<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> looked<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.580> found<00:01:11.580> their

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
of it so I looked it up and found their

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.359 
of it so I looked it up and found their
website<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.690> saw<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> couple<00:01:13.350> videos<00:01:13.619> oh<00:01:13.920> wow

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
website and saw a couple videos oh wow

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.540 
website and saw a couple videos oh wow
that<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.330> pretty<00:01:15.930> amazing<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.920> basically<00:01:17.340> it's

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
that is pretty amazing so basically it's

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.080 
that is pretty amazing so basically it's
an<00:01:17.640> analogue<00:01:18.240> effect<00:01:19.080> your<00:01:19.649> your<00:01:20.009> your<00:01:20.700> signal

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
an analogue effect your your your signal

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.520 
an analogue effect your your your signal
never<00:01:21.360> goes<00:01:21.660> into<00:01:21.869> digital<00:01:22.140> world<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.800> the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
never goes into digital world it's the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.740 
never goes into digital world it's the
what<00:01:25.530> happens<00:01:26.039> with<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.460> signal<00:01:26.940> is<00:01:27.149> what

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
what happens with your signal is what

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.779 
what happens with your signal is what
the<00:01:27.899> digital<00:01:28.110> where<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:28.920> digital<00:01:29.100> comes<00:01:29.520> in

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
the digital where the digital comes in

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.870 
the digital where the digital comes in
but<00:01:30.539> your<00:01:30.899> signal<00:01:31.289> is<00:01:31.350> always<00:01:31.560> analog<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.490> so

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
but your signal is always analog and so

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.120 
but your signal is always analog and so
it's<00:01:33.149> you<00:01:33.780> know<00:01:33.899> kind<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.320> vibrato<00:01:34.680> kind<00:01:35.039> of

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
it's you know kind of vibrato kind of

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.600 
it's you know kind of vibrato kind of
chorus<00:01:35.430> e8<00:01:35.640> modulate<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.320> really<00:01:38.250> wild

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
chorus e8 modulate but it's really wild

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.550 
chorus e8 modulate but it's really wild
like<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.240> know<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.479> has<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.869> these<00:01:40.050> circular

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
like you know it has that these circular

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.040 
like you know it has that these circular
motions<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.190> sound<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:41.550> warp<00:01:41.850> mile<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.780> I'm

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
motions that sound like warp mile so I'm

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.960 
motions that sound like warp mile so I'm
not<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.679> to<00:01:43.770> talk<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> lot<00:01:44.280> about<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.700> pedal

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
not going to talk a lot about the pedal

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.600 
not going to talk a lot about the pedal
because<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.750> has<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.900> lot<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.140> knobs<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.770> think

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
because it has a lot of knobs I think

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.710 
because it has a lot of knobs I think
it's<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:47.880> easier<00:01:48.030> if<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.360> go<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.540> their

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
it's just easier if you go to their

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.330 
it's just easier if you go to their
website<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.170> read<00:01:49.409> exactly<00:01:49.920> what<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.159> does

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
website and read exactly what it does

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.850 
website and read exactly what it does
I'm<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:50.790> going<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:50.939> play<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.630> go<00:01:52.619> through

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
I'm just going to play and go through

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.289 
I'm just going to play and go through
some<00:01:52.890> knob<00:01:53.159> settings<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:54.090> hear<00:01:54.270> what

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
some knob settings and you can hear what

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.469 
some knob settings and you can hear what
it<00:01:54.450> sounds<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.229> then<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:57.390> know

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
it sounds like and then you can you know

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.819 
it sounds like and then you can you know
make<00:01:57.659> your<00:01:57.780> decision<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.290> whether<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.650> want

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
make your decision on whether you want

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.920 
make your decision on whether you want
to<00:01:58.979> research<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.790> further<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.420> then<00:02:00.900> I

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
to research this further and then I

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.390 
to research this further and then I
stuck<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.820> tea<00:02:02.820> SVG<00:02:03.509> bubbling<00:02:04.350> flower<00:02:04.680> ahead<00:02:05.250> of

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
stuck a tea SVG bubbling flower ahead of

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.539 
stuck a tea SVG bubbling flower ahead of
it<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.790> fuzz<00:02:06.150> so<00:02:07.009> we<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.340> here

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
it it's like a fuzz so we can have here

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:09.979 
it it's like a fuzz so we can have here
what<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:08.820> sounds<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:09.209> going<00:02:09.509> into<00:02:09.840> this

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
what this sounds like going into this

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.590 
what this sounds like going into this
I'm<00:02:10.259> going<00:02:10.380> to<00:02:10.440> put<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.910> pedal<00:02:11.910> into<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.180> fuzz

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
I'm going to put this pedal into a fuzz

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.390 
I'm going to put this pedal into a fuzz
wars<00:02:12.900> but<00:02:13.260> for<00:02:13.590> now<00:02:13.739> I'm<00:02:13.950> not<00:02:14.100> going<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.280> focus

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
wars but for now I'm not going to focus

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.800 
wars but for now I'm not going to focus
on<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.820> I<00:02:14.880> just<00:02:15.060> wanted<00:02:15.299> to<00:02:15.390> have<00:02:15.540> some

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
on that I just wanted to have some

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.840 
on that I just wanted to have some
higher<00:02:16.200> gain<00:02:16.590> going<00:02:16.920> into<00:02:17.190> this<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.730> could

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
higher gain going into this so you could

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:18.680 
higher gain going into this so you could
see<00:02:18.060> what<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.209> sounds<00:02:18.390> like

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
see what it sounds like

00:02:18.690 --> 00:03:26.020 
see what it sounds like
here<00:02:19.620> we<00:02:19.709> go<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.579> e<00:02:20.610> note

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.729 

so<00:03:27.030> as<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.299> can<00:03:27.420> hear<00:03:27.480> man<00:03:27.900> it's<00:03:28.139> taking<00:03:28.620> that

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
so as you can hear man it's taking that

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.520 
so as you can hear man it's taking that
signal<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.280> it's<00:03:29.459> pushing<00:03:29.879> it<00:03:30.090> around<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:30.989> I'm

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
signal and it's pushing it around so I'm

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.080 
signal and it's pushing it around so I'm
going<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.739> mess<00:03:31.859> around<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.190> little<00:03:32.220> as<00:03:32.579> you<00:03:32.970> can

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
going to mess around a little as you can

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.479 
going to mess around a little as you can
see<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.359> has<00:03:33.449> a<00:03:33.480> tap<00:03:33.810> tempo<00:03:34.099> it's<00:03:35.099> bumping

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
see it has a tap tempo it's bumping
