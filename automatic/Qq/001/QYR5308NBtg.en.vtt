00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.569
 important good yes because they are 

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:23.999

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:25.259
 long so let's start this 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:29.099

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.629

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.320
 I know if he has already done well here 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.360
 map on this side but it looks like that 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.950
 There ends I do not not think so maybe I 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.440
 I think the biggest one on the map but 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.940
 well there we have that and good to work and 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.369
 It should be mentioned that here we have 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.710
 from this stone in burgos to I'm not 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.250

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.250

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.750
 I do not know anymore about biomes but 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.630
 good is this stone that tell you the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.000
 shadow thing I do not know I do not know if it's like that 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.560

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.300
 if someone plays appendix to that then that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.039

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.319

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.020
 the new types of the new 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.690
 earth is that it seems like that with 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.759

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.840

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.149
 giant the giant pines and here 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.770
 we have a field that you can see so 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.450
 good that image more than anything the first 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.130
 of the officer of main crespi because the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.690
 next I think fish plans of 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.100
 minecraft and I think it's fish but 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.100
 good is something interesting 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.030
 as you can see this top says now this 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.030
 I already showed the image 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.099
 and we keep destroying 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.590
 good a quartet of musicians and good 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.930
 after that little one I'm going to take out 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.030
 the photos and well basically we have the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.450
 second tuit this money one via twitter 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.250
 what the cavas were finally counted 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.040
 they agreed as silos were cut to the 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.010
 natural surface of the blocks is 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.480
 say that you're walking and now it's going to be 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.180
 more possible let's say that finding the 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.459
 caves at a natural level of height like this 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.950
 as you can see here the floor the floor is 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.620
 all say that is smooth or by 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.510
 misfortune does not have hard hike anymore in 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.970
 you lift good as you want to say 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.319
 as rather you have to see it as that the 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.569
 which is not above or 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:05.239
 down if it is not at the same level 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:07.370
 of what is this then the normal floor and 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.810
 with that he also tells us here not to eat 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.180
 all that also in mind to espn 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.430
 the goats are finally cut in the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.440
 tenderloin to the most natural or the most 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.209
 the rubbish is to say the closest thing 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.099
 to the normal floor 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.200
 I think this image is not standing 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.519
 is from pc but good this video as 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.220

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.760
 doing so scored 9.0 and basically from those 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.650
 Boys 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.780
 the most significant image of this 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.400
 video and more than anything these guys because 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.739
 the video is no longer a very short video 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.959

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.280
 that today I'm going to record pixel and more is 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.579

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.769
