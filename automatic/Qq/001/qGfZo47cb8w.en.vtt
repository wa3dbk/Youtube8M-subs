00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.010
 minutes to apple she cares a lot for 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.109

 market varies from 1,499 to 1,699

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.050
 this hood is a hood that the owner 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:20.599
 phone he bought at the mall 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.699
 he seems to have paid 30 reais in the 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.770
 I'm not mistaken and what I can say 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:31.880
 for the next day the finish 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:36.169

 off the camera with a type 1 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.789
 I think it 's to be another microphone and a 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.889
 LED flash on the side the button to let 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.630

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.440
 sir the device is a lot of people criticized 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.950
 in that it is made of plastic casing 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.020
 huh 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.810

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.880
