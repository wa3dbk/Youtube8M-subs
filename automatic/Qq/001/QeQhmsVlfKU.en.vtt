let's begin the first tweak is known as

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.170 
let's begin the first tweak is known as
awk<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.560> now<00:00:22.800> also<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> switcher

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
awk so now also is a switcher

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.359
