we have to light up our set now up until
now<00:00:31.990> we've<00:00:32.169> generally<00:00:32.439> been<00:00:32.619> using<00:00:32.769> tungsten

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
now we've generally been using tungsten

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.520 
now we've generally been using tungsten
hot<00:00:33.640> lights<00:00:33.910> and<00:00:34.120> hot<00:00:34.239> lights<00:00:34.420> are<00:00:34.629> great<00:00:34.960> but

hot lights and hot lights are great but

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.259 
hot lights and hot lights are great but
the<00:00:35.620> problem<00:00:35.890> has<00:00:35.980> always<00:00:36.280> been<00:00:36.610> keeping<00:00:37.180> the

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
the problem has always been keeping the

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.240 
the problem has always been keeping the
production<00:00:37.449> area<00:00:37.870> cool<00:00:38.230> while<00:00:38.590> not<00:00:38.830> running

fans<00:00:39.580> or<00:00:39.879> a/c<00:00:40.059> that's<00:00:40.360> going<00:00:40.480> to<00:00:40.540> interfere

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
fans or a/c that's going to interfere

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.049 
fans or a/c that's going to interfere
with<00:00:41.019> recording<00:00:41.739> clean<00:00:42.040> audio<00:00:42.460> now<00:00:42.820> this<00:00:42.940> is

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
with recording clean audio now this is

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.369 
with recording clean audio now this is
actually<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:43.420> problem<00:00:43.660> that<00:00:43.870> probably<00:00:44.290> the

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
actually the problem that probably the

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.590 
actually the problem that probably the
largest<00:00:44.559> delimit<00:00:45.100> actually<00:00:45.430> that<00:00:45.610> comes<00:00:46.450> when

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
largest delimit actually that comes when

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.810 
largest delimit actually that comes when
trying<00:00:46.930> to<00:00:46.989> light<00:00:47.230> any<00:00:47.500> production<00:00:48.010> set<00:00:48.399> the

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
trying to light any production set the

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.220 
trying to light any production set the
room<00:00:49.000> that<00:00:49.149> we<00:00:49.239> actually<00:00:49.390> record<00:00:49.899> in<00:00:50.050> is<00:00:50.200> very

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
room that we actually record in is very

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.229 
room that we actually record in is very
small<00:00:50.829> and<00:00:51.010> so<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:51.250> heat<00:00:51.520> is<00:00:51.640> actually

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
small and so the heat is actually

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.299 
small and so the heat is actually
unbearable<00:00:52.690> with<00:00:53.079> tungsten<00:00:53.500> lights<00:00:53.710> so<00:00:54.219> we

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
unbearable with tungsten lights so we

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:55.920 
unbearable with tungsten lights so we
look<00:00:54.489> towards<00:00:54.760> inexpensive<00:00:55.449> fluorescent

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
look towards inexpensive fluorescent

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.420 
look towards inexpensive fluorescent
alternatives<00:00:56.440> that<00:00:56.590> don't<00:00:56.860> put<00:00:57.010> out<00:00:57.129> nearly

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
alternatives that don't put out nearly

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.130 
alternatives that don't put out nearly
as<00:00:57.610> much<00:00:57.760> heat<00:00:58.059> now<00:00:58.570> that's<00:00:58.750> when<00:00:58.899> we<00:00:58.989> found

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
as much heat now that's when we found

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.319 
as much heat now that's when we found
the<00:00:59.289> impact<00:00:59.860> octa<00:01:00.219> cool<00:01:00.399> lighting<00:01:00.940> kit<00:01:01.149> which

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
the impact octa cool lighting kit which

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.240 
the impact octa cool lighting kit which
uses<00:01:01.600> compact<00:01:02.140> fluorescent<00:01:02.590> light<00:01:02.770> bulbs<00:01:03.070> or

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
uses compact fluorescent light bulbs or

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.850 
uses compact fluorescent light bulbs or
cfls<00:01:03.899> now<00:01:04.899> the<00:01:04.960> primary<00:01:05.320> concern<00:01:05.590> when<00:01:05.740> you're

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
cfls now the primary concern when you're

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.160 
cfls now the primary concern when you're
using<00:01:06.009> a<00:01:06.190> cfl<00:01:06.700> bulb<00:01:06.910> is<00:01:07.149> the<00:01:07.330> quality<00:01:07.780> of<00:01:07.810> light

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
using a cfl bulb is the quality of light

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.270 
using a cfl bulb is the quality of light
but<00:01:08.350> we're<00:01:08.440> going<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.619> talk<00:01:08.770> about<00:01:09.009> that<00:01:09.160> in

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
but we're going to talk about that in

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.859 
but we're going to talk about that in
just<00:01:09.610> a<00:01:09.759> moment<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:10.270> reason<00:01:10.600> that<00:01:10.660> we<00:01:10.780> were

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
just a moment the reason that we were

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.660 
just a moment the reason that we were
attracted<00:01:11.289> to<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.440> impact<00:01:11.920> lighting<00:01:12.310> kit<00:01:12.550> is

bulbs 9 for each head and while you can

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.770 
bulbs 9 for each head and while you can
use<00:01:33.520> these<00:01:33.670> bulbs<00:01:33.940> when<00:01:34.090> you<00:01:34.179> first<00:01:34.390> start<00:01:34.660> out

the quality of color rendition on these
stock<00:01:36.910> bulbs<00:01:37.300> isn't<00:01:38.020> very<00:01:38.229> good<00:01:38.319> so<00:01:39.039> we're

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
stock bulbs isn't very good so we're

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.830 
stock bulbs isn't very good so we're
actually<00:01:39.369> recording<00:01:40.060> in<00:01:40.179> this<00:01:40.330> video<00:01:40.539> right

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
actually recording in this video right

actually recording in this video right
now<00:01:40.899> with<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.709> stock<00:01:41.920> CFLs<00:01:42.489> which<00:01:43.030> put<00:01:43.209> out

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
now with the stock CFLs which put out

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.059 
now with the stock CFLs which put out
quite<00:01:43.690> a<00:01:43.720> bit<00:01:44.110> of<00:01:44.229> green<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:44.739> so<00:01:44.830> we're<00:01:44.950> having

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
quite a bit of green and so we're having

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.219 
quite a bit of green and so we're having
to<00:01:45.250> compensate<00:01:45.849> for<00:01:46.000> that<00:01:46.060> in<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.690> camera<00:01:47.110> and

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
to compensate for that in the camera and

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.499 
to compensate for that in the camera and
in<00:01:47.380> post<00:01:47.649> but<00:01:48.009> still<00:01:48.670> even<00:01:48.940> with<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.270> stock

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
in post but still even with the stock

worth<00:02:11.770> of<00:02:11.920> time<00:02:12.129> they<00:02:12.400> also<00:02:12.580> require<00:02:13.150> some

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
worth of time they also require some

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.970 
worth of time they also require some
knowledge<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:14.020> electrical<00:02:14.530> wiring<00:02:14.739> in

fire due to basically incorrect
wiring<00:02:24.470> well<00:02:24.890> it's<00:02:25.040> probably<00:02:25.130> gonna<00:02:25.400> be<00:02:25.580> too

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
wiring well it's probably gonna be too

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.270 
wiring well it's probably gonna be too
much<00:02:26.030> for<00:02:26.300> most<00:02:26.390> people<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.170> for<00:02:27.530> 600<00:02:27.980> bucks<00:02:28.069> we

150 bucks and we have a rockin indie
lighting<00:02:39.260> kit<00:02:39.470> now<00:02:40.100> we<00:02:40.160> have<00:02:40.310> two<00:02:40.490> other<00:02:40.640> sets

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
lighting kit now we have two other sets

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.020 
lighting kit now we have two other sets
of<00:02:41.180> higher<00:02:41.540> CRI<00:02:42.200> CFL<00:02:43.040> bulbs<00:02:43.459> that<00:02:43.520> are<00:02:43.670> on<00:02:43.820> the

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
of higher CRI CFL bulbs that are on the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.400 
of higher CRI CFL bulbs that are on the
way<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.330> we're<00:02:44.420> going<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.570> do<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.720> review<00:02:45.140> of

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
way and we're going to do a review of

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.380 
way and we're going to do a review of
their<00:02:45.530> color<00:02:45.800> rendition<00:02:46.070> soon<00:02:46.459> so<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.300> the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
their color rendition soon so in the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.820 
their color rendition soon so in the
meanwhile<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:47.900> would<00:02:48.050> recommend<00:02:48.410> just<00:02:48.440> use

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
meanwhile I would recommend just use

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.260 
meanwhile I would recommend just use
that<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.100> kit<00:02:49.310> bulbs<00:02:49.670> if<00:02:49.820> you<00:02:49.910> decide<00:02:50.239> that

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
that the kit bulbs if you decide that

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.390 
that the kit bulbs if you decide that
you<00:02:50.630> don't<00:02:50.900> like<00:02:51.230> them<00:02:51.500> then<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.100> can<00:02:52.220> upgrade

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
you don't like them then you can upgrade

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.040 
you don't like them then you can upgrade
the<00:02:52.640> bulbs<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.030> we'll<00:02:53.180> have<00:02:53.390> that<00:02:53.540> review<00:02:53.870> up

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
the bulbs and we'll have that review up

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.600 
the bulbs and we'll have that review up
soon<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.739> is<00:02:54.800> worth<00:02:55.040> mentioning<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:55.430> when

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
soon it is worth mentioning that when

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.520 
soon it is worth mentioning that when
you<00:02:55.730> get<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.120> impact<00:02:56.540> optical<00:02:57.020> kid<00:02:57.260> there<00:02:57.500> is

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
you get the impact optical kid there is

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.860 
you get the impact optical kid there is
a<00:02:57.739> bit<00:02:58.160> of<00:02:58.250> assembly<00:02:58.459> required<00:02:58.970> but<00:02:59.660> it's

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
a bit of assembly required but it's

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.780 
a bit of assembly required but it's
quite<00:03:00.110> simple<00:03:00.530> I<00:03:00.739> would<00:03:01.220> note<00:03:01.459> that<00:03:01.489> when

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
quite simple I would note that when

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.580 
quite simple I would note that when
inserting<00:03:02.390> if<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.600> rods<00:03:02.870> for<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.200> octave

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
inserting if the rods for the octave
