the egg and continue stirring add
conflicts<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.899> elements<00:00:55.500> into<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.949> mixture

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
conflicts and elements into the mixture

and keep stirring the conflicts and

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.150 
and keep stirring the conflicts and
elman<00:00:59.969> should<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.329> crushed<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.379> reason<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.949> if

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
elman should be crushed the reason is if

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.399 
elman should be crushed the reason is if
it<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.489> not<00:01:02.730> crash<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.480> difficult<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:04.080> need

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
it is not crash it is difficult to need

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.100 
it is not crash it is difficult to need
and<00:01:04.619> roll<00:01:04.890> later<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:06.180> if<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.510> too<00:01:06.840> fine

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
and roll later on but if it is too fine

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.260 
and roll later on but if it is too fine
then<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.950> won't<00:01:08.159> get<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.580> crunchiness<00:01:08.970> in

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
then you won't get the crunchiness in

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.450 
then you won't get the crunchiness in
the<00:01:09.450> elmer<00:01:09.750> crunchies<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.409> feel<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.430> is

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
the elmer crunchies I feel that it is

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.219 
the elmer crunchies I feel that it is
really<00:01:11.760> personal<00:01:12.090> preference<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.840> which<00:01:13.080> you

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
prefer that is how the end result should

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.770 
prefer that is how the end result should
look<00:01:15.780> like<00:01:16.490> use<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.759> remaining<00:01:18.119> conflicts

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
look like use the remaining conflicts

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.200
