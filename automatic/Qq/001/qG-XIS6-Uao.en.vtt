00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 bernard alonso hello you are 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.520
 Quebecois is also a facilitator 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.500
 international permaculture 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.320
 so for you to enlighten us on the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.420
 permaculture I will try in a few 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.109
 words then permaculture is a 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.510
 attempt to recreate ecosystems the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.820
 planet earth is an ecosystem where 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.039
 india ecosystems are interrelated 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.890
 to each other the design in 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.019
 permaculture is the observation of 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.869
 existing ecosystems where I live and 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.960
 how by good observation by my 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.129
 landscape reading but also of the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.710
 economic social life mineral plant 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.010
 hannibal I can create 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.230
 interrelations in order to create 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.680
 of energy then in what sense 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.039
 can we apply permaculture then 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:56.789
 the human needs one of three fields 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.649
 basic for how would I say I could 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.449
 to be able to operate from a 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.510
 natural way 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.199
 he needs to be reassured about his way 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.170
 to feed 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.110
 so there is the field of agriculture of 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.210
 feeding the water to drink he has 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.400
 need to be reassured about his buzz about 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.840
 his house he needs to build himself 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.090
 a house of spades the human and on 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.939
 earth it is created a hut a cabin 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.280
 a house so lodge so we can 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.430
 see all aspects of eco construction 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.540
 alternative energy materials 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.340
 renewable energy 1 and then 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.470
 they socialize the huma is not made for 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.430
 live alone he needs to recreate himself a 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.390
 group to be able to benefit from 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.899
 the energy of the group 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.159
 so we forgot the wealth of 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.280
 the energy of the group in our world 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.439
 industrial where we separated things 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.869
 permaculture is an attempt to 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.880
 recreate plans where we reinstall the 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.829
 things together a person works 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.780
 as a person but two people 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.219
 or three people together that's 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.700
 exponential the energy that can 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.540
 produce 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.939
 Permaculture is a plan 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.500
 smart of several people who 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.429
 get together to rebuild 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.330
 viable ecosystem 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.269
 so for you maybe give us a 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.370
 example of permaculture in the world 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.689
 current good then in today's world we 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.400
 is realizing that he 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.810
 there is an awakening then there are people 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.069
 who group together to live on 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.110
 call it a shared habitat 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.370
 we also see that there are people 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.329
 who come together to make gardens 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.239
 1 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:31.640
 so the idea is that by separating 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:36.530
 each one makes his little garden and creates a 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.780
 minimum of energy in vegetables each 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.519
 builds his house and uses 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.480
 a lot of energy to build his 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:47.450
 home when we group this group 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.109
 with our full potential potential 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.299
 we study by observing to recreate 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.370
 it's full potential so a habitat 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.620
 shared we put together as well 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.440
 monetary resources that 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.680
 skills then there is this big notion of 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.129
 role everyone has an easy role to express 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.959
 and in this interrogation we produce 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.470
 energy where we save 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.000
 energy 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.669
 that's why the interest of 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.299
 group together create habitat right now 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:19.310
 shared then there is the ability to 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.410
 feed yourself to create resources 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.290
 food in this habitat 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.819
 shared but also from for example a 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.040
 nobody can keep the kids from 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.370
 all the shared habitat there can be 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.090
 school groups instead of doing 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.160
 the food 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.079
 twelve families who make food on 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.699
 can do each of touroua two 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.560
 people the food once or twice 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:41.419
 a week so much that there is a 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.340
 saving energy is a creation so 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.260
 when I save less energy for 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.449
 to be able to express everything I am 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.709
 able to do in life I do not lose 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:51.280
 less energy and I'm more 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.620
 available to create what I am 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.879
 obviously done why then you 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.349
 enjoy your stay in the country 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.359
 bigouden to animate a conference 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:03.019
 debated debate on permaculture 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:04.790
 human yes so ben yes so that's a 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.169
 singing that is to develop we have 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.199
 realized for 40 years that the 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:11.090
 Permaculture exists that it is not 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:13.220
 something that may not be in 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.900
 changing the outside that we will succeed in 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.739
 change this world in which we have a 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.500
 little bit misguided 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.539
 I will not go back to this debate debate so 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.299
 there are skills and qualities 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.389
 human 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.919
 that it is interesting to develop and 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.379
 I will tell you about the notion of role 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.539
 or niche then in nature all 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:32.639
 the systems when we are we observe a 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.919
 ecosystem all systems have a role 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.520
 and a specific function 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:41.340
 the ladybug she is made to eat 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.009
 the aphids and she is formatted for 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.789
 discover them and themselves 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.819
 physiologically 1 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.710
 how would I say designed she asked 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:52.379
 bull extremely well made to cut 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.180
 the wellhead will be so she is 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:56.550
 made in this ecosystem for 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.219
 balance aphids and the human 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.710
 does not escape this role from this idea of 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:02.400
 niche role that is interesting to 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.919
 rediscover 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.199
 so our industrial system has us 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.639
 installed in roles that are not 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.560
 necessarily ours what is the 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.830
 role of the human the role of the human 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.409
 in his in context 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.020
 on the planet he has a role and a 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:22.650
 ability to recreate ecosystems 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:26.310
 do you see theirs the other species the 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.349
 animal world life and the plant life world 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.139
 and the mineral band life they do not have the 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:33.000
 choice they express what they are without 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.250
 to be able to create other ecosystems 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.830
 while the human him he is able 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.360
 create living viable ecosystems 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.099
 the proof we created a world 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.500
 industrial good we got a little bit 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:47.069
 cheated we will learn we went too 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.440
 far and too much in a way ie 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.819
 that of oil but we are able to 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.250
 recreate ecosystems permaculture 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:55.409
 tell us attention using the 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.509
 human potential and recreating 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.789
 new ecosystems to recreate a 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:02.430
 life system of abundance 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:04.949
 harmonious and viable what is not the 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.349
 case of our industrial band then you 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:08.580
 are currently here at abbot's bridge for 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:10.710
 writing a book with a pom 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.879
 labiste yes then as that's what 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.669
 will release this book 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:17.370
 well we hope we have a goal 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:19.830
 from June so that in summer we can 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.909
 take out the book and then launch it in 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.520
 fall 2013 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:24.870
 an ab international launch absolutely 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.190
 yes it's a but against 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.900
 francophones because there are a lot of 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.349
 age dover who are written in English 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.620
 and nothing but English translations 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:36.960
 or very little in French so that's fine 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.899
 to be a first what a book that goes 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.659
 demystify all the stages of the 

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:44.070
 rebuilding an ecosystem so that 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:45.210
 is going to be a toolbox for all the 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.979
 world sir and madam everyone 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.539
 who will say well ben ok I want 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:50.159
 changed my industrial world 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:54.690
 I want to change my way of life 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:56.250
 with oman and with 7.7 toolbox that 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.740
 is going to be this book they will be able 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:01.440
 initiate and understand how to change 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:05.089
 how to change here is bernard 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.089
 alonso thank you very much
