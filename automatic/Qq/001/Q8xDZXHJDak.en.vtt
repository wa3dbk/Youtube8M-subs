okay<00:00:05.819> building<00:00:06.540> frames<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:07.140> really<00:00:07.710> simple

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
okay building frames is really simple

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.129 
okay building frames is really simple
most<00:00:09.000> people<00:00:09.330> think<00:00:09.480> that<00:00:09.660> what<00:00:09.809> you<00:00:09.959> should

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
most people think that what you should

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.110 
most people think that what you should
do<00:00:10.290> first<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.860> glue<00:00:11.129> so<00:00:11.490> put<00:00:11.760> this<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.090> a

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
do first is glue so put this is a

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.509 
do first is glue so put this is a
Walther<00:00:12.540> T<00:00:12.690> Kelly<00:00:12.960> frame<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.040> most<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.370> your

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
Walther T Kelly frame and most of your

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.770 
Walther T Kelly frame and most of your
frames<00:00:14.730> are<00:00:14.910> not<00:00:15.059> going<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.299> look<00:00:15.420> like<00:00:15.450> this

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
frames are not going to look like this

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.019 
frames are not going to look like this
because<00:00:16.320> Washington<00:00:17.189> Kelly<00:00:17.369> feels<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.790> kind<00:00:18.000> of

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
because Washington Kelly feels a kind of

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.689 
because Washington Kelly feels a kind of
unique<00:00:18.330> frame<00:00:18.689> so<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.349> bottom<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.490> frame

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
unique frame so the bottom of the frame

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.790 
unique frame so the bottom of the frame
and<00:00:21.000> glue<00:00:21.300> onto<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.930> end<00:00:22.189> of<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.400> bottom<00:00:24.800> part

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
and glue onto the end of the bottom part

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.099 
and glue onto the end of the bottom part
of<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.010> frame<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.849> same<00:00:27.300> thing<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.660> put<00:00:27.869> glue

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
of the frame and same thing I put glue

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:36.820 
of the frame and same thing I put glue
on<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.949> other<00:00:29.130> side<00:00:33.980> put<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.510> other

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
on the other side put that on the other

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.660 
on the other side put that on the other
and<00:00:38.839> put<00:00:39.839> the<00:00:39.960> bottom<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.530> frame<00:00:40.769> nothin

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
and put the bottom of the frame nothin

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.840 
and put the bottom of the frame nothin
to<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.089> far<00:00:42.470> then<00:00:43.470> we<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.769> to<00:00:43.920> get<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.370> top

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
to it so far then we have to get the top

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:54.290 
to it so far then we have to get the top
bar<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:47.299> put<00:00:48.299> glue<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.839> that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.000 

because<00:00:55.300> I'm<00:00:55.449> kind<00:00:55.660> of<00:00:55.780> a<00:00:55.899> slob<00:00:56.110> I<00:00:56.410> always<00:00:56.770> keep

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
because I'm kind of a slob I always keep

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.279 
because I'm kind of a slob I always keep
a<00:00:57.309> wet<00:00:57.730> rag<00:00:58.000> around<00:00:58.180> to<00:00:58.480> get<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.719> glue<00:00:58.899> off<00:00:58.930> my

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
a wet rag around to get the glue off my

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.209 
a wet rag around to get the glue off my
hands<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:01.090> then<00:01:01.180> I<00:01:01.360> take<00:01:01.539> the<00:01:01.719> top<00:01:02.160> part<00:01:03.160> of

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
hands and then I take the top part of

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.910 
hands and then I take the top part of
the<00:01:03.280> frame<00:01:04.560> and<00:01:05.560> slide<00:01:06.009> it<00:01:06.040> into<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.659> preclude

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the frame and slide it into the preclude

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:21.960 
the frame and slide it into the preclude
slot<00:01:19.049> now<00:01:20.049> what<00:01:20.290> we<00:01:20.380> have<00:01:20.409> to<00:01:20.560> do<00:01:20.799> is<00:01:21.040> nail<00:01:21.610> in

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
slot now what we have to do is nail in

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.850 
slot now what we have to do is nail in
the<00:01:22.180> bottom<00:01:22.509> of<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.720> frame<00:01:22.960> today<00:01:23.320> this<00:01:23.619> we

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
the bottom of the frame today this we

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.590 
the bottom of the frame today this we
get<00:01:24.009> shorter<00:01:24.430> nails<00:01:24.670> three<00:01:25.030> quarters<00:01:25.360> of<00:01:25.420> an

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
get shorter nails three quarters of an

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
inch nail there will be two of them that

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.900 
inch nail there will be two of them that
go<00:01:28.030> into<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.420> end<00:01:28.570> of<00:01:28.720> each<00:01:28.869> off<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.910> bottom

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
of the end bar is one now I'm

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.809 
of the end bar is one now I'm
construction<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.929> challenge<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:39.640> rarely

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
construction the challenge it rarely

glad you're watching a very easy job
some<00:02:11.120> people<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:11.510> build<00:02:11.780> my<00:02:11.990> frames<00:02:12.410> set<00:02:12.710> up

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
some people that build my frames set up

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.690 
some people that build my frames set up
a<00:02:14.080> jig<00:02:15.080> for<00:02:15.350> building<00:02:15.710> their<00:02:15.830> frames<00:02:16.130> which<00:02:16.550> is

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
a jig for building their frames which is

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.670 
a jig for building their frames which is
a<00:02:16.730> pretty<00:02:16.940> good<00:02:17.150> idea<00:02:17.270> so<00:02:18.110> that<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.320> can<00:02:18.500> build

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
a pretty good idea so that you can build

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.350 
a pretty good idea so that you can build
a<00:02:18.770> bunch<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:19.130> them<00:02:19.250> at<00:02:19.370> once<00:02:22.060> now<00:02:23.060> we're<00:02:23.209> going

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
a bunch of them at once now we're going

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.270 
a bunch of them at once now we're going
down<00:02:23.810> at<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.140> top<00:02:24.380> of<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.650> frame<00:02:24.830> with<00:02:25.100> the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
down at the top of the frame with the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.040 
down at the top of the frame with the
nail<00:02:25.820> on<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:26.000> top<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.540> Walter<00:02:26.840> Kelly

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
nail on the top and the Walter Kelly

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.530 
nail on the top and the Walter Kelly
says<00:02:27.410> just<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.190> put<00:02:28.310> one<00:02:28.490> nail<00:02:28.700> on<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:28.970> top<00:02:29.180> so

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
says just to put one nail on the top so

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.290 
says just to put one nail on the top so
that's<00:02:29.720> what<00:02:29.870> I'm<00:02:29.959> gonna<00:02:30.080> do<00:02:31.060> some<00:02:32.060> of<00:02:32.180> the

that's what I'm gonna do some of the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.690 
that's what I'm gonna do some of the
companies<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.410> do<00:02:33.560> by<00:02:33.739> frames<00:02:34.070> if<00:02:34.310> Roman

so<00:03:17.420> I'll<00:03:17.480> put<00:03:17.630> one<00:03:17.660> of<00:03:17.870> those<00:03:17.989> in<00:03:18.049> each<00:03:18.470> end<00:03:19.130> of

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
so I'll put one of those in each end of

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:27.180 
so I'll put one of those in each end of
the<00:03:19.489> frame<00:03:19.730> I<00:03:23.290> spell<00:03:24.290> it<00:03:24.320> out<00:03:24.590> slight<00:03:24.950> angle
