00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.640
 Morgenstern I thought I 'll take it 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.080
 short with on my breakfast trip what 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.639
 I gossip so much what I'm for 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.590
 molli is probably just now 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.049
 would like to build up a bit of mass 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.190
 I want to track that a bit 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.719
 controlled everything pure I come 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.550
 Show you that briefly I hope in 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.869
 tripod gets that in julias on the way 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.910
 improvise a bit and just have 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.230
 my little kitchen niche giganten 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.210
 look around so as said the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.590
 kitchen scales a small very important one 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.869
 to give a bit of the overview 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.940
 i think it's alright now if 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.860
 you have certain goals like a mask 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.180
 phase up before a bit or 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.160
 usually wants to lose weight is a bit 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.870
 controls and stretches and now how 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.610
 First of all, let me know here now 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.579
 have a bit of fruits in there 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.390
 muesli and a banana banal about 100 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.770
 gram then fruits muesli are still approx 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.980
 170 grams 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.440
 yes there we are already at 650 altogether 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.199
 to 700 kilocalories what I then 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.420
 also like to do it then so here 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.829
 he helped as easy for taste the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.690
 There's cologne but I have it now 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.400
 it does not matter of roots 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.960
 50 market for me a bit south 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.210
 sweeter than a bit of sugar in it 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.369
 Of course banana is great fruit sugar 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.610
 potassium just a bit too energy 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.170
 and then that's terrible that we're in the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.479
 rule then always scanned in this 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.729
 code now knows this with an app 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.740
 I exactly what is in it here 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.430
 we now at hp now you go again 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.020
 to zero 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.430
 looks how much gram I get from the nh 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.509
 Acts clap and there is only just 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:42.290
 46 grams in now 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:45.210
 of these h then goes for taste 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:52.710
 bio cornflakes quite simply the scanner 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:54.390
 there are many there and then again 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.869
 on gram as I said makes with shape up 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.909
 could of course work any apps 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.170
 We use you then I come 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.869
 Just do it a bit for the 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.969
 Survey me it is synonymous human really 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.140
 that's why at 100 percent exactly 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.670
 Know how much calories 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.009
 I have but that I have the overview 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.610
 white and around 100 calories 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.660
 kilocalories exactly white 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.520
 I want to have eaten or now 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.540
 not a day impression that a bit 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.460
 to be able to control 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.870
 because I want to grow a little now too 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.730
 do not want to get very fat 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.890
 but rather small steps really 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:41.230
 Do it here and there on the top right 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:42.580
 on it and of course very big 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.060
 breakfast is good but i am a type 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.040
 which is actually driving very well with it 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.020
 tomorrow, I will cleanse the energy 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.239
 I need to be hungry in the morning 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.770
 then have a very good start in the 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.630
 day when i just have the energy 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.400
 From then on there is usually against 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.239
 in the afternoon or around noon I say 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.540
 times against yes we only have hamburg 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.040
 10 and 20 and late breakfast student 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.100
 you know and then I'll do it 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.840
 usually around 13.14 o'clock again the 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.739
 small things then goes an hour 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.989
 later to the training now exactly me 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.900
 the cornflakes still something completely 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:23.350
 Also important is good fatty acids 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.000
 vettel I just like me so much 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.580
 we have to have a little bit 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.420
 I know how to look and mix 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.420
 it is like to return soon a sack 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.680
 and he just got me one 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:44.709
 little bit less pure than a 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:47.799
 Handful like bunnies almonds japan 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.570
 everything and so on because number 26 gram 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.700
 I give it number 1, of course, is good 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.519
 energy now we have 165 here 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.780
 kilocalories last but not least easy 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.549
 Again for all milk haters I am 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.700
 a guy i like me i have to go all the way 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.560
 honestly say I drink already 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.120
 Almost always milk is one can 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.950
 Of course, about the health of 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.110
 I have not discussed so far 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.280
 I do not have to complain allergy either 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.390
 lactose intolerance 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.400
 many say yes 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.700
 due to the overacidification must the 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.640
 Body calcium from the bones 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.080
 solve blabla dress with safety is 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.720
 Somewhere in it but there are synonymous 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.810
 again many arguments I am me 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.180
 would like to enjoy my breakfast 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.340
 and of course without me but how 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.750
 said my blood levels are okay i was 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.620
 now only at martensson I think 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.020
 as long as I have no big ones right now 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.490
 I'll have health complaints 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.320
 I continue to drink my milk 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.760
 and let me not because'm confused 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.680
 Opponents do not rule so deeply that I do 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.760
 now totally crazy I say 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.190
 I eat 80 to 90 percent 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.660
 healthy and of course there are people who 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.919
 maybe 100 percent healthy 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.919
 Nurture everything 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.600
 i want to enjoy them again and again 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.020
 I think so well you can do it 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.430
 but exaggerate in my eyes, too 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.510
 As I said I was quite good with it 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.750
 fits and even if i give them again 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.040
 I will not perish 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.650
 I think so we have one more 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.050
 a little bit more pure 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.220
 Here we are, I can do it very well 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.010
 the vag is pretty cool 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.840
 do not you put it on milliliter 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:30.750
 then I know exactly how much milk I have 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:31.940
 also in it have some 370 milliliters of milk 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.830
 now again 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.479
 but that is also actually so yes 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.140
 then when I drink milk then has 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:42.240
 usually only for breakfast in the mÃ¼li 370th 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.940
 Millimeters are 170 kilocalories 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.280
 By the way, milk also has very good milk 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.470
 So that with milk sugar in there, then 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.880
 to class me very good 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.950
 energy supplier and now I have mine 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.120
 breakfast already finished that are good 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.800
 We are now just over 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.410
 1000 kilocalories 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.390
 but it does a good job of pure people and it holds 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.590
 me sick for a long time we have shows here 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:09.030
 you again through the must 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:11.270
 oatmeal yes through the havel very good 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:16.410
 fiber as I said 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:18.300
 Good fats through the nuts with banana 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.850
 with potassium for example also very good 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.220
 for glycogen storage for the 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.020
 energy of the muscles and I have mine 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.120
 the time now just once 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.830
 to see how it looks like to me yes 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:34.729
 said it saw 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.729
 I let myself taste and 30
