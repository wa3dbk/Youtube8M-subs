areas<00:01:24.370> to<00:01:24.760> a<00:01:24.790> warm<00:01:25.030> up<00:01:25.210> firstly<00:01:26.020> there's<00:01:26.320> a

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
areas to a warm up firstly there's a

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.400 
areas to a warm up firstly there's a
pulse<00:01:26.680> razor<00:01:27.150> secondly<00:01:28.150> there's<00:01:28.600> mobility

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
pulse razor secondly there's mobility

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.950 
pulse razor secondly there's mobility
mobility<00:01:29.740> basically<00:01:30.670> means<00:01:30.940> moving<00:01:31.870> your

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
mobility basically means moving your

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.360 
mobility basically means moving your
joints<00:01:32.260> and<00:01:32.380> mimicking<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.920> movement<00:01:33.280> you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
joints and mimicking the movement you

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.980 
joints and mimicking the movement you
about<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.760> perform<00:01:33.910> so<00:01:34.450> if<00:01:34.570> you're<00:01:34.690> going<00:01:34.900> to

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
about to perform so if you're going to

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.960 
about to perform so if you're going to
be<00:01:35.080> running<00:01:35.350> you<00:01:35.830> need<00:01:35.979> to<00:01:36.100> be<00:01:36.190> moving<00:01:36.640> you

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
be running you need to be moving you

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.210 
be running you need to be moving you
need<00:01:37.120> to<00:01:37.210> be<00:01:37.300> mobilizing<00:01:37.780> them<00:01:38.110> key<00:01:38.350> areas<00:01:38.770> so

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
need to be mobilizing them key areas so

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.480 
need to be mobilizing them key areas so
it<00:01:39.460> needs<00:01:39.759> your<00:01:40.090> hips<00:01:40.390> back<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.800> pelvic<00:01:42.250> floor

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
it needs your hips back the pelvic floor

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.070 
it needs your hips back the pelvic floor
muscles<00:01:42.880> these<00:01:43.060> are<00:01:43.180> all<00:01:43.300> really<00:01:43.509> important

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
muscles these are all really important

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.960 
muscles these are all really important
because<00:01:44.170> of<00:01:44.470> that<00:01:44.650> quite<00:01:45.220> tight<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:45.759> that's

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
because of that quite tight and that's

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.850 
because of that quite tight and that's
going<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.270> restrict<00:01:46.660> your<00:01:46.840> movement<00:01:47.259> so<00:01:47.710> for

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
going to restrict your movement so for

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.490 
going to restrict your movement so for
example<00:01:47.920> if<00:01:48.430> i<00:01:48.759> was<00:01:48.910> going<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.090> mimic<00:01:49.420> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
example if i was going to mimic the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.859 
example if i was going to mimic the
running<00:01:50.500> movement<00:01:50.860> I<00:01:50.979> would<00:01:51.340> take<00:01:51.580> this<00:01:51.869> new

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
running movement I would take this new

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.590 
running movement I would take this new
york's<00:01:53.850> distraction<00:01:54.850> is<00:01:54.940> really<00:01:55.150> important

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
york's distraction is really important

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.510 
york's distraction is really important
but<00:01:55.690> only<00:01:55.960> after<00:01:56.050> you've<00:01:56.320> warmed<00:01:56.619> up<00:01:56.770> so<00:01:57.250> as

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
but only after you've warmed up so as

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
usual strategies do key areas quads

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.620 
usual strategies do key areas quads

hamstrings these are the two major
muscle<00:02:05.050> groups<00:02:05.200> you'll<00:02:05.350> be<00:02:05.470> using<00:02:05.680> when

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
muscle groups you'll be using when

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.219 
muscle groups you'll be using when
you're<00:02:06.040> running<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.910> last<00:02:07.119> area<00:02:07.479> of<00:02:07.930> your

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
you're running so the last area of your

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.680 
you're running so the last area of your
of<00:02:08.830> your<00:02:08.890> warming<00:02:09.369> up<00:02:09.489> would<00:02:09.850> be<00:02:09.880> component<00:02:10.630> on

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
of your warming up would be component on

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.600 
of your warming up would be component on
the<00:02:10.720> floor<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:11.290> that's<00:02:11.590> your<00:02:11.830> second<00:02:12.370> pulse

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610

reason<00:02:13.090> what<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.570> lot<00:02:13.810> of<00:02:13.840> people<00:02:14.050> tend<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.739> do

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
reason what a lot of people tend to do

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.280 
reason what a lot of people tend to do
is<00:02:15.160> have<00:02:15.580> very<00:02:15.910> stiff<00:02:16.269> legs<00:02:16.570> before<00:02:16.840> they<00:02:17.140> go

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
is have very stiff legs before they go

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.410 
is have very stiff legs before they go
into<00:02:17.470> running<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.340> just<00:02:18.670> before<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:19.090> start

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
into running so just before you start

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.720 
into running so just before you start
your<00:02:19.510> more<00:02:20.019> intensive<00:02:20.560> exercise<00:02:21.010> make<00:02:21.700> sure

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
your more intensive exercise make sure

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.460 
your more intensive exercise make sure
that<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.269> do<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.420> little<00:02:22.780> bit<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:22.959> a<00:02:23.019> warm<00:02:23.230> will

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
that you do a little bit of a warm will
