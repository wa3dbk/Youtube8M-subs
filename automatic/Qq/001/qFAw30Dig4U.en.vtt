00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.670
 hi to all the boys and welcome back up 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.759
 those two on the server or we come 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.139
 finally talking about card smac card 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.359
 reincarnation we must not tell you that 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.039
 we are lovers of the saga now you know it 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.289
 we must not tell you we were waiting 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.720
 you have known this title for a long time now 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.060
 does not give you means we have it 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.740
 just bought it and we tried it 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.969
 we recorded it well we want 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.750
 talk yes we are talking about a pre 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.790
 alpha of 24 euros 24 euros which I am not 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.790
 few, however, we must say that we are 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.440
 in front of perhaps a real high because 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.780
 the alphas of recent years are of the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.120
 castrated demos this probably is 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.620
 really an alpha and now let's go to 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.660
 see why we must first of all 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.140
 talk about this project that was born from 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.859
 kickstarter that has been taken very well 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.699
 from the community that has reached i 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.129
 $ 620,000 so a nice one 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.799
 nest egg to start the short one for 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.630
 programming that and reporting 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.850
 let's say the spirit or dic armageddon 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.310
 in life yes because there were gods 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.960
 there are attempts to emulate in the samp 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.270
 clutch state of which we have also done 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.240
 a review that was not as bad as 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.590
 game however was not kardon in this case 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.170
 we are faced with a real 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.020
 armageddon with more than one reference to 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.990
 original saga and that however it would like in 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.259
 somehow waking up we don't hide 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.720
 that opening this high our first 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.310
 reactions were not of jubilation yes in 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.630
 effects we expected different things things 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.700
 several that have not been there but 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.520
 let's see them calmly then before 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.590
 all the graphics you know we do 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.659
 we keep the graphics certain 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.630
 so obviously this being a title 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.659
 that comes out many years after the first one 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.939
 and the second chapter of armageddon is 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.600
 there are many better features 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.920
 more graphic tricks 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.630
 more beautiful, etc. etc. but the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.500
 graphics are very clean and linear 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.830
 is too clean and linear 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.440
 we hope it's just let's say 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.330
 thus a conformation due to the 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.110
 alpha structure of the game because we a 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.489
 karma gaydon we expect much more 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.180
 much more true dirt a lot more 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:24.250
 aggressive in tones here we are witnessing 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.230
 car with reflections there is not a drop 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.010
 of oil there is not a stain of 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.600
 rust in the shadows are only accurate to 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.760
 guys is too clean it really is 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.980
 too clean that armageddon has to give 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.110
 the sense of violent and sports 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.959
 if before it was very difficult to make one 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.180
 similar thing completely with the graphics 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.190
 leica etcetera etc. than that 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.280
 graphic you see in car magazine on 2 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.959
 was created because there were no 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.049
 for to make configuration tools 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.120
 improvements that we can now finally 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.610
 do to tell you also killing floor ha 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.310
 understood that the grain should be put on a 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.709
 horror game and see the grain on this 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.140
 game in our opinion would conform everything to 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.970
 something a little more horror a little more 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.920
 dirty so there is a little more 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.870
 naughty also because carmack and not 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.579
 certainly arises as a game for 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.650
 raise money for hungry children 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.640
 and a violent game that makes the 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.980
 violence 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.380
 its reason to exist is also one 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.329
 certain goliardic vein if we want to 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.250
 it is not a serious game but also a game 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.780
 the vein of violence short 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.060
 the reason of not existing because the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.440
 pissed moms we know they have us 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.570
 given against this game 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.250
 yes yes let's go and see what is there 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.900
 we were expecting from this one we do not 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.630
 we were waiting for who knows what, though 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.690
 expecting a quick game more 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.570
 playable that in the past framerate to 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.220
 stars is a graphic after all not 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.049
 surprising of that we do not care 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.319
 a dick when we talk about karma candle 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.200
 however the playability was 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.150
 obviously a disappointment because why 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.969
 taking the game we have 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.439
 already tried on the joypad because being a 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:03.209
 machine game up is more enjoyable 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:06.389
 the control is however oily e 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.420
 if you tell me ok you were they were the things 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:12.239
 also the control of carmageddon 2 e 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.889
 also in the first if we want in this 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.190
 you have to try to understand the difference 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:19.440
 because it is difficult to explain a lot 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.800
 very strange also the fact that on a 7 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.169
 80th the game needs details 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.729
 medium and low of eliminations 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.710
 of eliminating anti-aliasing 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.470
 of environmental and post occlusion 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.810
 processing to run at a 40 fps 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.849
 yes this is a very big issue 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.860
 heavy but we think it is given by 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.800
 poor compatibility they have entered 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.330
 now the developers and remember that 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.360
 it's a pre alpha so we're not 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.340
 pressing too hard to say it's a shit no 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.110
 they were absolutely done 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.599
 also very nice choices for 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.580
 to modernize the saga of carmageddon in 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.500
 primis very nice the possibility of 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.090
 choose weapons with a radial menu 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.789
 that we can easily reach 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.460
 those stick of the game fair very cute 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:04.680
 and being able to rebuild with this little one 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.659
 stylistic addition that is very cool yes 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.550
 that is going to recover the pieces you have 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:10.380
 to be lost, strange as it were 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.070
 magnetic the car and this is one thing 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.690
 we especially liked it and also the 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.620
 machines have been updated 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.509
 perhaps adding the possibility of 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.669
 I ask for the aileron that gets up if 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.919
 Kit and faster or if 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.509
 braking makes another movement the opening 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.430
 in short, there have been many goalkeepers 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:31.530
 the additions on cars and so on 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.870
 tearfully when we have 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.539
 having seen the cars in the race because they are the 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.120
 perfect reproduction of the cars of the 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.919
 therefore the first carmack is its own 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.259
 tear because they are spit out though 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.500
 obviously better done as is 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.720
 a game of 2000 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.850
 16 2004 if we want to talk about 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.100
 tears came to our eyes 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:54.910
 as soon as we saw the pedestrians who 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.160
 inexperienced are a bit ugly they are 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.380
 ugly means you were ugly 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.750
 even in the car but they ask for it in the two there 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.120
 they were made because we remember that 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.000
 we were a few years ago and not 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.100
 they could be different from what they are 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.140
 Dimensional creative states here are 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:14.770
 three-dimensional however they live by 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:17.080
 ugly animations not ridiculous or made a 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.090
 board own router without motion 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.740
 capture definitely because they don't have 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.330
 sense the animations 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.760
 the models are all the same and all 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.550
 very ugly however we say that we must 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.930
 also here to keep us a little brained because 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.250
 we are talking about pre alpha not 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.410
 still there is not even the ground 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:35.110
 texturized under our feet often 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.650
 so here we must always go with 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.410
 caution 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.030
 however we are still big 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.700
 trust in this case magallon 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:45.310
 reincarnation we hope you don't 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.320
 bare we leave you as usual in the 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.060
 gameplay description let us know 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.110
 in the comments if the video you liked 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.110
 and if he wanted to know more
