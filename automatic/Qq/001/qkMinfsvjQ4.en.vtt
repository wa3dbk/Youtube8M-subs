00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.000 
with and then it kind of disappeared
then<00:03:53.750> they<00:03:53.840> brought<00:03:53.989> it<00:03:54.140> back<00:03:54.230> out<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:54.620> left

then they brought it back out and left
it<00:03:55.220> permanently<00:03:55.670> I'm<00:03:56.330> kind<00:03:56.600> of<00:03:56.660> hoping<00:03:56.900> they

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
it permanently I'm kind of hoping they

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.920 
it permanently I'm kind of hoping they
do<00:03:57.080> that<00:03:57.350> with<00:03:57.470> both<00:03:57.650> of<00:03:57.680> these<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:59.630> mountain

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
do that with both of these the mountain

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.979 
do that with both of these the mountain
dew<00:04:00.050> I<00:04:00.080> don't<00:04:00.350> care<00:04:00.500> about<00:04:00.620> as<00:04:00.830> much<00:04:01.100> which

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
dew I don't care about as much which

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.570 
dew I don't care about as much which
still<00:04:02.989> even<00:04:03.470> saying<00:04:03.709> it<00:04:03.860> it<00:04:04.010> kind<00:04:04.340> of<00:04:04.400> feels

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
still even saying it it kind of feels

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.690 
still even saying it it kind of feels
weird<00:04:04.970> but<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:06.050> Pepsi<00:04:06.440> I<00:04:06.470> absolutely<00:04:07.370> love

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
weird but the Pepsi I absolutely love

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.350 
weird but the Pepsi I absolutely love
and<00:04:09.070> I'm<00:04:10.070> not<00:04:10.340> sure<00:04:10.370> I'm<00:04:10.700> guessing<00:04:11.090> this<00:04:11.180> is

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
and I'm not sure I'm guessing this is

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.870 
and I'm not sure I'm guessing this is
out<00:04:11.540> in<00:04:11.780> all<00:04:11.930> areas<00:04:12.410> of<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.980> United<00:04:13.100> States<00:04:13.459> I

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
out in all areas of the United States I

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.539 
out in all areas of the United States I
i<00:04:14.390> mean<00:04:14.660> i<00:04:14.870> know<00:04:14.930> sometimes<00:04:15.320> they<00:04:15.830> don't<00:04:16.010> put

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
i mean i know sometimes they don't put

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.670 
i mean i know sometimes they don't put
it<00:04:16.669> down<00:04:16.700> everywhere<00:04:17.209> but<00:04:17.540> if<00:04:17.840> you<00:04:18.290> find<00:04:18.560> this

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
it down everywhere but if you find this

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
it down everywhere but if you find this
stuff<00:04:18.739> i<00:04:19.100> would<00:04:19.220> definitely<00:04:19.489> recommend

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
stuff i would definitely recommend

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.969 
stuff i would definitely recommend
trying<00:04:20.180> this<00:04:20.419> because<00:04:20.780> it's<00:04:21.049> it's<00:04:21.620> a<00:04:21.710> really

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
trying this because it's it's a really

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.529 
trying this because it's it's a really
different<00:04:22.340> feeling<00:04:22.910> when<00:04:22.940> you<00:04:23.180> drink<00:04:23.360> it

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
different feeling when you drink it

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:24.410 
different feeling when you drink it
compared<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.020> you

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420 
compared to you

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.850 
compared to you
even<00:04:24.660> though<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.840> taste<00:04:25.140> is<00:04:25.410> sort<00:04:25.680> of<00:04:25.740> the

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
even though the taste is sort of the

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.120 
even though the taste is sort of the
same<00:04:27.020> you<00:04:28.020> just<00:04:28.230> get<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.410> different<00:04:28.950> feeling

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
same you just get a different feeling

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.010 
same you just get a different feeling
when<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.520> drink<00:04:29.730> it<00:04:29.850> it<00:04:29.970> doesn't<00:04:30.150> have<00:04:30.870> the

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
when you drink it it doesn't have the

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.740 
when you drink it it doesn't have the
same<00:04:31.200> consistency<00:04:31.950> and<00:04:32.280> like<00:04:32.430> I<00:04:32.520> said<00:04:32.580> like

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
same consistency and like I said like

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.640 
same consistency and like I said like
not<00:04:33.750> really<00:04:33.900> texture<00:04:34.470> but<00:04:35.030> aftertaste<00:04:36.650> so

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
not really texture but aftertaste so

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.680 
not really texture but aftertaste so
yeah<00:04:37.800> this<00:04:38.070> is<00:04:38.280> definitely<00:04:39.030> something<00:04:39.360> I

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690
