only have men's basketball and women's

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.490 
only have men's basketball and women's
volleyball<00:02:33.120> our<00:02:34.120> students<00:02:34.600> can<00:02:34.750> walk<00:02:34.989> in<00:02:35.290> and

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
and I can introduce them to our

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.390 
and I can introduce them to our
president<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.810> know<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.680> vice<00:02:38.860> president

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
president you know to the vice president

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.039 
president you know to the vice president
on<00:02:39.430> any<00:02:39.640> given<00:02:40.060> time<00:02:40.239> when<00:02:40.480> they're<00:02:40.630> not<00:02:40.660> busy

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
on any given time when they're not busy

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.319 
on any given time when they're not busy
you<00:02:41.560> can't<00:02:41.799> do<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:42.040> at<00:02:42.220> large<00:02:42.459> school<00:02:42.790> so<00:02:43.299> I

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
you can't do that at large school so I

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.110 
you can't do that at large school so I
think<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.840> we<00:02:44.170> have<00:02:44.350> a<00:02:44.380> much<00:02:45.010> more

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
think that we have a much more

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.460 
think that we have a much more
one-on-one<00:02:46.120> basis<00:02:46.480> with<00:02:46.630> instructors<00:02:47.260> with

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
one-on-one basis with instructors with

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.380 
one-on-one basis with instructors with
coaches<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:48.130> we<00:02:48.579> play<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:48.820> top-flight

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
coaches that we play a top-flight

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.300 
coaches that we play a top-flight
schedule<00:02:50.019> and<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.769> think<00:02:50.950> we're<00:02:51.070> going<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.250> be

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
schedule and I think we're going to be

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.370 
schedule and I think we're going to be
pretty<00:02:51.549> good<00:02:51.760> next<00:02:52.090> year<00:02:52.269> so<00:02:52.540> we're<00:02:53.079> not<00:02:53.230> gonna

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
pretty good next year so we're not gonna

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.050 
pretty good next year so we're not gonna
