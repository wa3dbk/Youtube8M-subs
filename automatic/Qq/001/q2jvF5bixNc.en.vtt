00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.789
 on the iphone 6 also put the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.710
 blender and crushed appliance up 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.949
 almost nothing is left over and also 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.039
 I froze the iphone 6 in nitrogen 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.610
 liquid has gone further still and now he 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.750
 played the iphone 6 from a height of 2 thousand 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.130
 meters 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.500
 The video is passing there for you to have 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.340
 a notion that he did he got on a plane 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.899
 and parachuted with the iphone is on 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.480
 hand when she came there at a time 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.579
 that he had to open the parachute he 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.640
 played the iphone 6 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.129
 then with the help of gps he found 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.270
 the iphone 6 in a half-empty area and the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.670
 device had only a few cracks 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.250
 on the screen but incredible as it may seem 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.799
 machine was still running the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.740
 video is great in four minutes and 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.840
 I highly recommend it worth the trade show link 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:16.229
 to see the video is in the description that the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.409
 Lord of Motorola said that it is high 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.750
 end of the smartphones with prices there of 600 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.729
 to 700 dollars 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.280
 according to it's time for companies 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.799
 to start investing in appliances that 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.590
 have a good quality offer good 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.890
 resources for users ' customers 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.950
 but are affordable 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.680
 this is the new motorola policy and she 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.790
 got to do this with the line is moto 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.700
 motorcycle and motorcycle and for example in the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.579
 she had almost nothing 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.399

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.579

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.429
 worked out and she wants the other 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.310
