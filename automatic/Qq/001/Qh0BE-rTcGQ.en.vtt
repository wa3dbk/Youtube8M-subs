00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.450
 to save the French culture puppy 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.820
 this seam on the right hand side is 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.070
 stitching as if it were a straight seam 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.650
 normal and inside out 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.410
 They are not the sewing that year and not 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.490
 Berlocq needed to clean seam 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.820
 beautiful that can be worn for shirt 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.880
 vests 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.130
 The weak seam is to have an end to a 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.210
 ball of fine fabric 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.910
 transparent 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.760
 usually made with French stitching 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.309
 This one is reinforced here. See here. 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.960
 from inside out is reinforced as 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.200
 imitating for the shirt then I go 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.190
 To explain to you, how is it from here? 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.610
 how to buy a bolerinho so closing 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.980
 this little piece show that now how it is 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.469
 that makes the step by step neither food 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.930
 then the French seam you sew 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.260
 the wrong side of the fabric you see 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.610
 here is the back of the fabric and stitching 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.549
 to see only with the turn of the 1st colloquium decided 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.840
 if together close to normal posture 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.840
 we ask for a machine 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.560
 the custome here 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:33.380
 I cut then I made the seam nÃ© 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.399
 otherwise I usually start 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.229
 to sew from inside out is that the seamstress 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.509
 right 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.310
 So you do this brazil seam of 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.970
 machine cuts here the short excess 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.819
 here o 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.420
 careful not to care not to sew 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:58.390
 cut straight stitching you did 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:01.759
 remember here to do French sewing 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.740
 cut the excess and there you now 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.929
 flip the fabric 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.640
 Can you come by here to get better? 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.080
 I 'm not going to pass because I'm there where 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.280
 now the iron but the tasse with the fingernail 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:19.280
 crease the fabric 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:21.500
 There you turn from the now yes inside out. 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:30.200
 It's better in the piece that you're going to do. 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:35.120
 get the hang of it so I liked it here 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.280
 so now I turn to step here so 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.370
 be very playful and pass the seam 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.040
 here this seam if you'll just leave 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.650
 so you can spend well here 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.870
 I do not know about half a centimeter 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.620
 less than half a centimeter this with 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.260
 stitching for a shirt you sew 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.900
 more than one centimeter 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.970
 first I'm going to sew like a 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.910
 a posture that I want to leave only this way 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.910
 always the shirt sew well together 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:36.120
 so here it was the other way around 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.270
 There's something I do not need here. 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.820
 overlock if I do this posture 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.970
 It looks like nothing reeling and 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:49.680
 normal right as the seam is straight to 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:52.650
 sale of the normal right as in sewing 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.930
 straight forward only the reverse was what 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.590
 It is said that French sewing is what I 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.550
 I did not iron for more 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.550
 cool, still 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.260
 is so and if you want to do for a 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.600
 shirt 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.330
 Are you doing the shirt you can? 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.810
 passing this seam and so close is 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.730
 a little bigger 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.609
 I'll make another one here like it's for 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.590
 shirts then here to do sewing 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.510
 Now I want to do French with the 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.950
 shirt liked 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.680
 I'm facing the same thing from inside out. 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.160
 Sewing sewing and even machine sewing 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.160
 normal 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.710
 I sewed it from the color machine on the 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:51.190
 line here equal to the previous one 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:53.569
 I'm referring here, take the access there now, seeing 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.449
 if I want it here like I said another 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:05:01.699
 time to get better 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:07.009
 turned from this side step here I came with the 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:10.340
 mother to the palace iron better and here instead 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:13.060
 I want to do this sewing I did here 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:17.419
 super fininha that will stay like this 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.190
 I want to taste a shirt so I do that. 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.349
 sewing in ten days 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.169
 I'm here half a centimeter ago as a 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:27.680
 most easy cm here I leave all 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:30.280
 a machine foot like that, and trade 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.280
 until recently 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.720
 bigger 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.950
 so here I did the sewing in 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.380
 I had this one because I'm going to have this 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.840
 I did it because I'm going to leave it like this. 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.760
 just so inside overclock so the 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.470
 culture and culture here too 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.160
 The more I want to make a 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.710
 shirt and then make the biggest line turn 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.470
 here it was the same as another 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.420
 on the right side that will stay clothes 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.890
 the sewn piece looked like it was a 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.470
 straight stitching 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.930
 on the other side the silver locke plus this 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.900
 Here I want to reinforce to be well. 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.180
 similar to a men's shirt seam or 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.790
 female, I come here and make a 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.740
 sewing thread passes first is iron 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.780
 better without me now I'll do it without going 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.360
 iron but you pass the iron piece 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.880
 even though I'm going to do it and pass the stance 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.160
 here reporting here then from the side of here 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.010
 The seamstress will remain like the seam 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.560
 double reinforced dinha looks more beautiful 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:40.280
 as the shirt bound it does not 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.280
 I know it well here 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.790
 the process 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:07.590
 and sewing here how beautiful it looks 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:12.180
 there is a clean seam on the inside and 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:16.260
 on the outside was on the right side 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:18.630
 so the seam is see if it does 

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:21.210
 here the fabric color any way you want 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:23.370
 if you want the same posture to come out 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.890
 You make a different color if you do not 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.110
 the color of the fabric and the inside 

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:30.420
 so that seam that tries shirt 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.880
 side of the shoulder shirt has this posture 

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.600
 if you realize 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:40.140
 so this is french sewing folks 

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:42.450
 you can leave it just as well defined 

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.550
 So to let loose and do more 

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.550
