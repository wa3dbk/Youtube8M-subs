another other way if you can't really

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.740 
another other way if you can't really
tell<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.670> side<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.090> can<00:01:36.240> flip<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.630> over

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
tell on this side you can flip it over

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.920 
tell on this side you can flip it over
and<00:01:37.140> um<00:01:37.740> it'll<00:01:38.490> tell<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.030> pretty<00:01:39.600> clearly

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
and um it'll tell you pretty clearly

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.300 
and um it'll tell you pretty clearly
you'll<00:01:40.259> be<00:01:40.409> able<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.650> see<00:01:40.799> where<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.009> fluid

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
you'll be able to see where the fluid

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.249 
you'll be able to see where the fluid
has<00:01:41.549> come<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> stop<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.420> then<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.170> just

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
has come to a stop and then you can just

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.710 
has come to a stop and then you can just
flip<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.560> over<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.340> don't<00:01:44.399> say<00:01:44.720> exactly

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
flip it over and I don't say exactly

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.630 
flip it over and I don't say exactly
where<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:45.960> at<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.380> side<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.189> um<00:01:47.399> I

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
where it's at on this side and um I

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.859 
where it's at on this side and um I
believe<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.000> little<00:01:48.180> space<00:01:48.479> here<00:01:48.750> is

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
believe this little space here is

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.260 
believe this little space here is
supposed<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.170> indicate<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:50.180> supposed<00:01:51.180> to

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
supposed to indicate a supposed to

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.090 
supposed to indicate a supposed to
indicate<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.659> quart<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.259> automatic

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
indicate a quart of automatic

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.330 
indicate a quart of automatic
transmission<00:01:53.579> fluid<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:55.259> make<00:01:55.409> sure<00:01:55.439> it

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
transmission fluid so just make sure it

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.950 
transmission fluid so just make sure it
comes<00:01:56.549> at<00:01:56.759> least<00:01:56.939> all<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.210> way<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.360> here<00:01:57.810> and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
comes at least all the way to here and

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.780 
comes at least all the way to here and
um<00:01:58.649> that's<00:01:59.040> pretty<00:01:59.189> much<00:01:59.340> all<00:01:59.490> there<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.700> to

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
um that's pretty much all there is to

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.160 
um that's pretty much all there is to
check<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.570> your<00:02:00.689> automatic<00:02:00.990> transmission

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
check in your automatic transmission

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.649 
check in your automatic transmission
