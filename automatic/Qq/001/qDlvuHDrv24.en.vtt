00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
feed them get them out so the scenario

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.980 
feed them get them out so the scenario
itself<00:04:32.020> didn't<00:04:32.560> quite<00:04:33.540> surprise<00:04:34.540> surprise

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
itself didn't quite surprise surprise

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.830 
itself didn't quite surprise surprise
live<00:04:35.440> up<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:36.310> maybe<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.730> expectation<00:04:37.570> of<00:04:37.660> it

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
live up to maybe the expectation of it

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.690 
live up to maybe the expectation of it
or<00:04:37.960> because<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:38.740> only<00:04:38.860> get<00:04:39.040> to<00:04:39.130> do<00:04:39.250> this<00:04:39.400> one

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
or because you only get to do this one

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.700 
or because you only get to do this one
so<00:04:40.030> it<00:04:40.120> could<00:04:40.300> have<00:04:40.390> been<00:04:40.510> quite<00:04:40.750> special<00:04:41.320> or

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
so it could have been quite special or

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.590 
so it could have been quite special or
if<00:04:42.370> they<00:04:42.520> wanted<00:04:43.000> to<00:04:43.060> they<00:04:43.210> could<00:04:43.510> have

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
if they wanted to they could have

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.570 
if they wanted to they could have
potentially<00:04:44.110> have<00:04:44.230> turned<00:04:44.560> this<00:04:44.800> into<00:04:45.010> a

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
potentially have turned this into a

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.690 
potentially have turned this into a
daily<00:04:46.180> where<00:04:46.930> if<00:04:47.440> you<00:04:47.740> complete<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.310> daily
