and look up the kind of for example the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.979 
and look up the kind of for example the
dynamic<00:00:40.590> range<00:00:40.800> or<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.399> color<00:00:41.640> tones<00:00:42.450> or<00:00:42.809> all

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
dynamic range or the color tones or all

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.090 
dynamic range or the color tones or all
that<00:00:43.110> kind<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.350> stuff<00:00:43.440> you'll<00:00:43.739> see<00:00:43.860> there's<00:00:44.040> a

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
that kind of stuff you'll see there's a

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.260 
that kind of stuff you'll see there's a
massive<00:00:44.340> difference<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:44.879> what<00:00:45.090> does<00:00:45.239> it

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
massive difference but what does it

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.260 
massive difference but what does it
actually<00:00:45.480> mean<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.170> real<00:00:46.680> life<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.550> here's

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
actually mean in real life so here's

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.779 
actually mean in real life so here's
here's<00:00:48.719> my<00:00:48.809> example<00:00:49.140> which<00:00:49.860> I've<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.489> been

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
here's my example which I've just been

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.069 
here's my example which I've just been
doing<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.059> myself<00:00:51.239> already<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.870> I'm<00:00:51.930> just

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
doing it myself already and I'm just

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.880 
doing it myself already and I'm just
like<00:00:52.199> blown<00:00:52.860> away<00:00:53.539> by<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.079> sensor<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.680> we

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
like blown away by the sensor that we

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.840 
like blown away by the sensor that we
get<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.489> even<00:00:57.020> cheap<00:00:58.020> full-frame<00:00:58.850> cameras

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
get in even cheap full-frame cameras

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.790 
get in even cheap full-frame cameras
nowadays<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.600> first<00:01:01.020> first<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.530> all<00:01:01.590> these<00:01:01.739> are

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
nowadays so first first of all these are

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.920 
nowadays so first first of all these are
the<00:01:01.949> two<00:01:02.100> images<00:01:02.190> there<00:01:03.180> are<00:01:03.210> obviously

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the two images there are obviously

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.429 
the two images there are obviously
different<00:01:04.320> sizes<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.309> I've<00:01:05.430> cropped<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
different sizes so I've cropped the the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.070 
different sizes so I've cropped the the
d600<00:01:07.890> frame<00:01:08.460> don't<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> same<00:01:09.780> size

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
d600 frame don't so it's the same size

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.330 
d600 frame don't so it's the same size
as<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.880> d2<00:01:11.880> X<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:13.320> image<00:01:13.619> here<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.130> from

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
as the d2 X so one image here is from

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.910 
as the d2 X so one image here is from
the<00:01:14.490> d600<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.780> another<00:01:16.200> image<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.619> from<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the d600 and another image is from the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.149 
the d600 and another image is from the
d2<00:01:17.369> X<00:01:17.640> which<00:01:17.850> was<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.290> 4,000<00:01:19.290> pound<00:01:19.320> camera<00:01:20.040> when

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
d2 X which was a 4,000 pound camera when

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.520 
d2 X which was a 4,000 pound camera when
it<00:01:20.189> came<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.020> straight<00:01:22.020> away<00:01:22.170> I'm

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
it came out and straight away I'm

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.749 
it came out and straight away I'm
shooting<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.070> ISO<00:01:24.110> 3200<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.740> focused<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.490> on

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
shooting at ISO 3200 and focused and on

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.550 
shooting at ISO 3200 and focused and on
the<00:01:27.030> door<00:01:27.330> handle<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> middle<00:01:28.200> here<00:01:28.380> and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
the door handle in the middle here and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.749 
the door handle in the middle here and
on<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.670> d2<00:01:30.000> x<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.420> was<00:01:30.600> already<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.470> its<00:01:31.759> h2

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
on the d2 x that was already in its h2

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.780 
on the d2 x that was already in its h2
mode<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.299> high<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.680> actual<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.189> saw<00:01:35.520> at

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
mode it's high to the actual I saw at

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.090 
mode it's high to the actual I saw at
the<00:01:36.420> native<00:01:36.810> high<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.049> ISO<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.890> camera

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
the native high of ISO of that camera

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.819 
the native high of ISO of that camera
will<00:01:38.250> have<00:01:38.369> up<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.750> 800<00:01:39.750> o<00:01:40.220> mean<00:01:41.220> well<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.939> d600

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
will have up to 800 o mean well the d600

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.760 
will have up to 800 o mean well the d600
sensor<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.130> up<00:01:44.970> at<00:01:45.119> 3200<00:01:46.079> that's<00:01:46.380> still<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
sensor is up at 3200 that's still a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.230 
sensor is up at 3200 that's still a
whole<00:01:47.100> stop<00:01:47.640> below<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.420> maximum<00:01:49.200> native<00:01:49.920> ISO

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
whole stop below is maximum native ISO

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.740 
whole stop below is maximum native ISO
so<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.479> native<00:01:51.780> ISO<00:01:51.899> cause<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.880> 6400<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.000> so

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
so is native ISO cause it's 6400 and so

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.910 
so is native ISO cause it's 6400 and so
you<00:01:54.840> think<00:01:54.990> about<00:01:55.049> okay<00:01:55.380> what's<00:01:55.619> what's

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
you think about okay what's what's

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.760 
you think about okay what's what's
really<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> difference<00:01:56.340> here<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.090> it's

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
really the difference here and it's

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.959 
really the difference here and it's
astonishing<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.189> straight<00:01:59.549> off<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.759> images

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
astonishing so straight off the images

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.580 
astonishing so straight off the images
milligan<00:02:00.390> go<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.540> can't<00:02:00.840> see<00:02:01.079> much<00:02:01.229> difference

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
milligan go I can't see much difference

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.160 
milligan go I can't see much difference
but<00:02:01.710> if<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.979> once<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.700> zoom<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.540> I'm<00:02:03.719> not

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
but if you once you zoom in and I'm not

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.520 
but if you once you zoom in and I'm not
meaning<00:02:04.350> zooming<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.040> much<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:05.640> just

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
meaning zooming in much it's just

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.419 
meaning zooming in much it's just
possibly<00:02:07.530> once<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.099> videos<00:02:08.399> been

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
possibly once this videos been

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.339 
possibly once this videos been
compressed<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.119> can't<00:02:09.360> see<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:09.660> well<00:02:10.140> on

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
compressed you can't see it so well on

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.990 
compressed you can't see it so well on
this<00:02:10.470> little<00:02:10.709> screen<00:02:10.860> however<00:02:11.069> let's<00:02:11.520> see<00:02:11.790> I

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
this little screen however let's see I

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.220 
this little screen however let's see I
just<00:02:12.660> zoom<00:02:12.870> in

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
just zoom in

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.149 
just zoom in
-<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:13.950> picture<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.550> me<00:02:15.120> over<00:02:15.659> here<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.230> on

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
- this picture of me over here so on

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.130 
- this picture of me over here so on
that<00:02:17.370> image<00:02:17.819> it's<00:02:18.060> looking<00:02:18.330> pretty<00:02:18.659> pretty

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
that image it's looking pretty pretty

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.440 
that image it's looking pretty pretty
greeny<00:02:19.500> on<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:20.190> next<00:02:20.519> image<00:02:20.670> you're<00:02:21.120> like<00:02:21.269> oh

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
greeny on the next image you're like oh

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.559 
greeny on the next image you're like oh
that's<00:02:22.260> really<00:02:22.739> clean<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.519> comparison<00:02:24.480> you're

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
that's really clean in comparison you're

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:25.759 
that's really clean in comparison you're
like<00:02:24.690> okay<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:24.959> I've<00:02:25.080> taken<00:02:25.260> all<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.530> noise

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
like okay so I've taken all the noise

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.559 
like okay so I've taken all the noise
reduction<00:02:26.129> in<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.459> color<00:02:26.670> reduction<00:02:26.879> off<00:02:27.299> and

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
reduction in the color reduction off and

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.500 
reduction in the color reduction off and
so<00:02:28.230> we're<00:02:28.560> not<00:02:28.769> playing<00:02:29.069> around<00:02:29.129> with<00:02:29.280> that

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
so we're not playing around with that

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.550 
so we're not playing around with that
and<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.690> just<00:02:30.870> thinking<00:02:31.019> that<00:02:31.110> okay<00:02:31.290> what's

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
and I just thinking that okay what's

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.930 
and I just thinking that okay what's
what's<00:02:31.950> really<00:02:32.400> isn't<00:02:32.519> much<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.910> difference

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
what's really isn't much of a difference

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.270 
what's really isn't much of a difference
there<00:02:33.330> okay<00:02:33.569> you've<00:02:33.720> seen<00:02:33.900> lots<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.319> air<00:02:34.650> color

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
there okay you've seen lots of air color

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.610 
there okay you've seen lots of air color
noise<00:02:35.549> in<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.090> image<00:02:36.239> however<00:02:36.720> it's<00:02:37.170> more

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
noise in the image however it's more

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.350 
noise in the image however it's more
when<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:37.950> try<00:02:38.129> to<00:02:38.190> push<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.670> image<00:02:38.760> or<00:02:38.970> edit

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
when you try to push the image or edit

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.390 
when you try to push the image or edit
the<00:02:39.480> image<00:02:39.780> here<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:39.989> if<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.230> bring<00:02:40.500> just<00:02:41.069> bring

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
the shadows up to 76 holy crap

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.740 
the shadows up to 76 holy crap
76<00:02:45.870> percent<00:02:46.040> find<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.280> with<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.549> Nikon<00:02:47.849> d600

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
76 percent find it with the Nikon d600

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.759 
76 percent find it with the Nikon d600
oh<00:02:50.120> it's<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.720> good<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.049> we're<00:02:52.410> not<00:02:52.500> talking

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
oh it's so good and we're not talking

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.180 
oh it's so good and we're not talking
about<00:02:52.829> oh<00:02:53.010> well<00:02:53.250> you've<00:02:53.459> got<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.989> bigger<00:02:55.190> more

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
about oh well you've got a bigger more

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.890 
about oh well you've got a bigger more
megapixels<00:02:56.819> to<00:02:57.180> deal<00:02:57.329> with<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.569> know<00:02:57.599> because

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
megapixels to deal with you know because

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.990 
megapixels to deal with you know because
I've<00:02:57.989> cropped<00:02:58.260> down<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.859> the<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.250> same<00:02:59.519> DX

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
I've cropped down to the the same DX

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.740 
I've cropped down to the the same DX
area<00:03:00.569> so<00:03:01.470> it's<00:03:01.879> roughly<00:03:02.879> there's<00:03:03.299> a<00:03:03.359> thing<00:03:03.660> as

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
area so it's roughly there's a thing as

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.860 
area so it's roughly there's a thing as
a<00:03:03.840> 10<00:03:04.109> compared<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.769> a<00:03:04.799> 12<00:03:05.370> megapixel<00:03:05.870> image

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
a 10 compared to a 12 megapixel image

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.420 
a 10 compared to a 12 megapixel image
but<00:03:07.079> if<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.230> look<00:03:07.470> at<00:03:07.739> Oh<00:03:08.750> shocker<00:03:09.750> that

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
but if you look at Oh shocker that

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.400 
but if you look at Oh shocker that
that's<00:03:11.430> that's<00:03:12.209> like<00:03:12.420> when<00:03:12.629> you<00:03:12.750> turn<00:03:12.989> your<00:03:13.170> TV

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.849 
that's that's like when you turn your TV
on<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:14.040> you've<00:03:14.160> just<00:03:14.190> got<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:14.730> static<00:03:15.599> noise

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
on and you've just got that static noise

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.050 
on and you've just got that static noise
that's<00:03:16.859> what<00:03:17.129> that<00:03:17.280> sitting<00:03:17.549> like<00:03:17.700> me<00:03:17.940> well

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.069 
it's such fine green the other thing
that's<00:03:26.639> going<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:26.910> say<00:03:27.000> is<00:03:27.150> if<00:03:27.299> we<00:03:27.510> look<00:03:27.810> at

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
that's going to say is if we look at

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.530 
that's going to say is if we look at
every<00:03:28.799> bring<00:03:29.040> shadows<00:03:29.700> back<00:03:29.849> down<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.209> normal

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
every bring shadows back down to normal

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.449 
every bring shadows back down to normal
but<00:03:31.470> if<00:03:31.680> we're<00:03:31.889> looking<00:03:31.980> at<00:03:32.250> for<00:03:32.430> example

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
but if we're looking at for example

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
how much detail can we get can we gain

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.490 
how much detail can we get can we gain
from<00:03:37.669> the<00:03:38.669> images<00:03:39.599> here<00:03:39.750> so<00:03:39.930> far<00:03:40.079> let's<00:03:40.349> say<00:03:40.470> I

from the images here so far let's say I
bring<00:03:40.680> exposure<00:03:41.040> down<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:42.739> minus<00:03:43.739> 1.2<00:03:44.250> and

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
bring exposure down to minus 1.2 and

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.500 
bring exposure down to minus 1.2 and
highlights<00:03:45.120> down<00:03:45.840> 100<00:03:46.819> okay<00:03:47.819> we're<00:03:48.090> getting

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
they are now completely orange if we go

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.730 
they are now completely orange if we go
with<00:04:41.000> the<00:04:41.090> Nick<00:04:41.240> on<00:04:41.390> its<00:04:41.960> also<00:04:42.170> there's<00:04:42.500> a<00:04:42.560> lot

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
with the Nick on its also there's a lot

with the Nick on its also there's a lot
of<00:04:42.920> completely<00:04:43.340> orange<00:04:43.670> there<00:04:43.910> as<00:04:44.000> well<00:04:44.150> but

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
of completely orange there as well but

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.310 
of completely orange there as well but
at<00:04:44.630> least<00:04:44.840> there<00:04:45.140> is<00:04:45.350> a<00:04:45.710> bit<00:04:46.280> of<00:04:46.490> green<00:04:47.320> so

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
at least there is a bit of green so

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.070 
at least there is a bit of green so
we've<00:04:48.530> got<00:04:48.740> something<00:04:49.340> back<00:04:49.940> but<00:04:50.540> I<00:04:50.600> just<00:04:50.780> find

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
we've got something back but I just find

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.930 
we've got something back but I just find
that<00:04:51.250> absolutely<00:04:53.470> astonishing<00:04:54.470> the<00:04:55.100> dynamic

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
that absolutely astonishing the dynamic

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.210 
that absolutely astonishing the dynamic
range<00:04:56.120> that<00:04:56.180> we're<00:04:56.390> getting<00:04:56.480> is<00:04:56.720> were<00:04:56.810> gaining

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
range that we're getting is were gaining

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.150 
range that we're getting is were gaining
at<00:04:58.220> this<00:04:58.610> super<00:04:59.270> high<00:04:59.450> ISO<00:05:00.200> that's<00:05:00.560> that's<00:05:00.920> the

at this super high ISO that's that's the

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.280 
at this super high ISO that's that's the
kind<00:05:01.310> of<00:05:01.370> main<00:05:01.610> thing<00:05:01.940> which<00:05:02.630> I'm<00:05:02.750> seeing<00:05:03.020> here

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
kind of main thing which I'm seeing here

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.980 
kind of main thing which I'm seeing here
at<00:05:03.380> the<00:05:03.580> going<00:05:04.580> up<00:05:04.700> to<00:05:04.900> 3200<00:05:05.900> the<00:05:06.350> d600<00:05:06.980> and<00:05:07.430> a

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
at the going up to 3200 the d600 and a

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.650 
at the going up to 3200 the d600 and a
d600<00:05:08.990> sensor<00:05:10.030> breezes<00:05:11.030> through<00:05:11.180> that<00:05:11.420> no

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
d600 sensor breezes through that no

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.360 
d600 sensor breezes through that no
problem<00:05:12.200> meanwhile<00:05:12.920> the<00:05:13.370> d2x<00:05:14.270> what<00:05:15.080> was<00:05:15.260> a

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
problem meanwhile the d2x what was a

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.900 
problem meanwhile the d2x what was a
4,000<00:05:16.370> pound<00:05:16.400> camera<00:05:17.500> struggles<00:05:18.500> like

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
4,000 pound camera struggles like

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.300 
4,000 pound camera struggles like
anything<00:05:19.910> and<00:05:20.090> yeah<00:05:20.420> and<00:05:20.770> and<00:05:21.770> that's<00:05:22.220> not

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
anything and yeah and and that's not

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.070 
anything and yeah and and that's not
even<00:05:22.520> if<00:05:22.730> we<00:05:22.820> bring<00:05:23.000> it<00:05:23.150> any<00:05:23.420> no<00:05:23.660> instruction

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
even if we bring it any no instruction

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.630 
even if we bring it any no instruction
so<00:05:24.260> for<00:05:24.680> example<00:05:24.950> let's<00:05:25.070> let's<00:05:25.310> a<00:05:25.370> little<00:05:25.430> bit

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
so for example let's let's a little bit

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.670 
so for example let's let's a little bit
if<00:05:26.270> we<00:05:26.360> go<00:05:26.480> back<00:05:26.660> to<00:05:26.780> that<00:05:26.870> picture<00:05:27.050> of<00:05:27.290> me<00:05:27.440> over

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
if we go back to that picture of me over

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.920 
if we go back to that picture of me over
here<00:05:27.920> so<00:05:28.520> here<00:05:28.760> what<00:05:29.000> I've<00:05:29.090> done<00:05:29.120> is<00:05:29.480> I've<00:05:29.780> got

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
here so here what I've done is I've got

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.950 
here so here what I've done is I've got
it<00:05:30.050> so<00:05:30.230> that<00:05:30.440> it's<00:05:30.650> that<00:05:30.890> the<00:05:31.040> shadows<00:05:31.460> are<00:05:31.750> +99

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
it so that it's that the shadows are +99

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.160 
it so that it's that the shadows are +99
on<00:05:33.170> the<00:05:33.580> Nikon<00:05:34.580> d600<00:05:35.540> and<00:05:35.750> you're<00:05:36.020> kind<00:05:36.140> of

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
on the Nikon d600 and you're kind of

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.080 
on the Nikon d600 and you're kind of
going<00:05:36.230> okay<00:05:36.560> can<00:05:36.740> still<00:05:37.070> kind<00:05:37.790> of<00:05:37.850> roughly

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
going okay can still kind of roughly

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.490 
going okay can still kind of roughly
make<00:05:38.300> out<00:05:38.420> there's<00:05:38.570> me<00:05:38.720> my<00:05:38.900> kill<00:05:39.110> there's<00:05:39.380> my

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
make out there's me my kill there's my

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.370 
make out there's me my kill there's my
wife<00:05:39.650> there<00:05:39.920> it's<00:05:40.580> not<00:05:40.730> like<00:05:40.790> yeah<00:05:41.630> it's<00:05:41.990> mush

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
wife there it's not like yeah it's mush

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.790 
wife there it's not like yeah it's mush
it's<00:05:42.650> much<00:05:42.830> or<00:05:43.040> and<00:05:43.220> also<00:05:43.340> the<00:05:43.580> the<00:05:44.800> sharpening

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
it's much or and also the the sharpening

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.880 
it's much or and also the the sharpening
at<00:05:46.070> the<00:05:46.310> noise<00:05:46.610> reduction<00:05:46.820> color<00:05:47.270> is<00:05:47.510> up<00:05:48.140> to<00:05:48.290> 40

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
at the noise reduction color is up to 40

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.280 
at the noise reduction color is up to 40
and<00:05:49.190> the<00:05:49.310> luminance<00:05:49.640> up<00:05:49.790> to<00:05:49.880> 41<00:05:50.270> so<00:05:50.630> just<00:05:51.020> read

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
and the luminance up to 41 so just read

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.690 
and the luminance up to 41 so just read
about<00:05:51.440> there<00:05:51.590> I<00:05:51.620> think<00:05:51.830> that's<00:05:51.980> far<00:05:52.250> enough

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
about there I think that's far enough

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.170 
about there I think that's far enough
it's<00:05:52.850> a<00:05:53.030> smooth<00:05:53.420> image<00:05:53.810> there<00:05:54.050> go<00:05:54.620> to<00:05:54.680> the<00:05:55.040> D<00:05:55.730> 2x

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
it's a smooth image there go to the D 2x

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.920 
it's a smooth image there go to the D 2x
ah<00:05:58.360> Wow

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
ah Wow

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.730 
ah Wow
