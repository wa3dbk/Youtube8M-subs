we'll head to the kitchen soon and

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.740 
we'll head to the kitchen soon and
prepare<00:02:44.290> them<00:02:44.640> I'm<00:02:45.640> not<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:45.910> good<00:02:46.090> chef<00:02:46.360> so<00:02:46.600> if<00:02:46.660> I

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
prepare them I'm not a good chef so if I

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.110 
prepare them I'm not a good chef so if I
can<00:02:46.989> do<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.140> you<00:02:47.560> can<00:02:47.590> do<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:47.920> as<00:02:48.100> well<00:02:48.130> the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
can do it you can do it as well the

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.729 
can do it you can do it as well the
reason<00:02:49.420> why<00:02:49.600> there's<00:02:49.930> so<00:02:50.080> much<00:02:50.200> better<00:02:50.500> than

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
reason why there's so much better than

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.150 
reason why there's so much better than
things<00:02:51.040> like<00:02:51.370> flower<00:02:51.820> of<00:02:52.150> cereals<00:02:52.570> is<00:02:52.720> because

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
things like flower of cereals is because

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.710 
things like flower of cereals is because
breads<00:02:54.160> for<00:02:54.489> example<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.030> most<00:02:55.180> common<00:02:55.570> type

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
breads for example the most common type

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.470 
breads for example the most common type
of<00:02:55.750> carbs<00:02:56.489> uses<00:02:57.489> flour<00:02:57.730> which<00:02:58.030> turns<00:02:58.269> quickly

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
of carbs uses flour which turns quickly

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.660 
of carbs uses flour which turns quickly
to<00:02:58.750> sugar<00:02:59.019> which<00:02:59.380> turns<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.920> fat<00:03:00.070> and<00:03:00.310> also<00:03:00.519> can

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
to sugar which turns to fat and also can

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.070 
to sugar which turns to fat and also can
cause<00:03:00.730> problems<00:03:01.150> with<00:03:01.480> your<00:03:01.600> blood<00:03:01.840> sugar

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
cause problems with your blood sugar

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.259 
cause problems with your blood sugar
control<00:03:02.290> whereas<00:03:03.250> whole<00:03:03.430> grains<00:03:03.700> release<00:03:04.060> it

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
control whereas whole grains release it

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.970 
control whereas whole grains release it
nice<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.720> slowly<00:03:04.959> which<00:03:05.260> is<00:03:05.440> what<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.739> want

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
nice and slowly which is what you want

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.759 
nice and slowly which is what you want
so<00:03:06.850> let's<00:03:07.000> head<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.299> kitchen<00:03:07.480> and<00:03:07.840> try<00:03:08.709> to

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
so let's head to the kitchen and try to

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.630 
so let's head to the kitchen and try to
prepare<00:03:09.010> some<00:03:09.370> of<00:03:09.459> these<00:03:09.610> grains<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:12.340> here<00:03:12.519> we

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
prepare some of these grains so here we

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.220 
prepare some of these grains so here we
are<00:03:12.730> in<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.970> kitchen<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.630> we<00:03:13.780> have<00:03:13.959> some

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
are in the kitchen and we have some

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.550 
are in the kitchen and we have some
quinoa<00:03:14.560> simmering<00:03:15.840> basically<00:03:16.840> we<00:03:17.049> put<00:03:17.320> one

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
quinoa simmering basically we put one

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.920 
quinoa simmering basically we put one
and<00:03:17.680> a<00:03:17.709> half<00:03:17.739> cups<00:03:17.890> of<00:03:18.370> water<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.880> one<00:03:19.600> cup<00:03:19.630> of

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
and a half cups of water to one cup of

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.170 
and a half cups of water to one cup of
quinoa<00:03:20.140> make<00:03:20.590> sure<00:03:20.829> to<00:03:21.100> rinse<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.549> carefully

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
quinoa make sure to rinse it carefully

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.970 
quinoa make sure to rinse it carefully
just<00:03:22.720> naturally<00:03:23.230> occurring<00:03:23.500> compounds

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
just naturally occurring compounds

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.319 
just naturally occurring compounds
called<00:03:24.130> saponins<00:03:24.549> which<00:03:24.850> can<00:03:25.030> give<00:03:25.150> it<00:03:25.239> a

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
called saponins which can give it a

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.390 
called saponins which can give it a
bitter<00:03:25.510> flavor

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
bitter flavor

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.729 
bitter flavor
and<00:03:27.519> so<00:03:28.480> we<00:03:28.569> had<00:03:28.720> it<00:03:28.840> at<00:03:28.959> boiling<00:03:29.409> as<00:03:29.530> soon<00:03:29.680> as

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
and so we had it at boiling as soon as

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.080 
and so we had it at boiling as soon as
it<00:03:29.799> started<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.069> boil<00:03:30.250> turned<00:03:30.549> it<00:03:30.700> down<00:03:30.849> so

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
it started to boil turned it down so

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.319 
it started to boil turned it down so
it's<00:03:31.209> just<00:03:31.299> at<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.510> nice<00:03:31.689> simmer<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:33.120> once<00:03:34.120> it

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
it's just at a nice simmer and once it

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.449 
it's just at a nice simmer and once it
starts<00:03:34.659> simmering<00:03:34.890> set<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.010> timer<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:38.459> 15

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
starts simmering set the timer to 15

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.940 
starts simmering set the timer to 15
minutes<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.060> 15<00:03:40.569> minutes<00:03:40.810> we'll<00:03:41.530> have<00:03:41.709> quinoa

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
minutes and 15 minutes we'll have quinoa

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.119 
minutes and 15 minutes we'll have quinoa
no<00:03:42.459> need<00:03:42.640> to<00:03:42.790> stir<00:03:43.030> with<00:03:43.239> quinoa<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:44.799> bubbles

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
no need to stir with quinoa the bubbles

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.339 
no need to stir with quinoa the bubbles
from<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.400> steam<00:03:45.760> will<00:03:46.209> move<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.140> quinoa

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
from the steam will move the quinoa

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.140 
from the steam will move the quinoa
around<00:03:47.859> so<00:03:48.280> there's<00:03:48.459> no<00:03:48.579> need<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:48.790> stir<00:03:49.090> it

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
around so there's no need to stir it

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.660 
around so there's no need to stir it
