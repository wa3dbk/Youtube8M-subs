00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.980
 the traveling show fair 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.949
 she again defended that they intend to wine wine in the workshops she 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.319
 high demand 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:24.779
 in your body 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.970
 what are our principles 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.240
 - what is the objective that you expect for this purpose 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.069
 even so he has to bring 

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:37.649
 I'm here again uberlÃ¢ndia I already feel the city I'm a citizen of 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.710
 landes 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.100
 so I am very happy to be here again by invitation 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.620
 every condemnation of the show 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.010
 and the other author her body shows that this mission a certain time I 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.450
 research the body part of the actor's physicality and within that 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.920
 physicality search 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.050
 intentions through physical issues 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.650
 and these issues goes through a whole set of exercises is a set 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.490
 of situations actors are building the truth 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.030
 the coolest is to resume the current as builder of the saw 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.810
 but live a moment so is that director hector builds director keith 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.790
 ends up being great is actually creator the act but lost in that context and this 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.210
 the subjective presents what causes whiteness to construct own senac if in the 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.550
 collective partner in the creation of the director and that goal of the soul also 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.060
 policy he has to have a motivation for it and so he continues 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.050
 motivation part of this context of 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.270
 he has to create his own scene within the context of the scene and this 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.270
 The creation of the actor is fundamental for him to be an artist 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.960
 which is important also includes it linked to prevention inpe 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.290
 and then the sides 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.500
 the slightest drop 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.150
 in the show scenes to be true
