perspective view if you are sitting in
the<00:00:17.760> perspective<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:18.630> whenever<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.590> draw

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
the perspective you so whenever we draw

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.340 
the perspective you so whenever we draw

the line it is directly going to be

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.849 
the line it is directly going to be
drawn<00:00:22.619> on<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.130> grid<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.330> if<00:00:24.900> we<00:00:25.170> are<00:00:25.199> sitting

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
drawn on the grid and if we are sitting

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.070 
drawn on the grid and if we are sitting
in<00:00:26.039> an<00:00:26.220> other<00:00:26.519> clock<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.090> orthographic<00:00:27.420> view

in an other clock to orthographic view

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.620 
in an other clock to orthographic view
and<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:28.980> maximize<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.820> graphical

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
and we can maximize a graphical

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.389 
and we can maximize a graphical
orthographic<00:00:31.199> view<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.679> directly<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.369> can

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
orthographic view and directly we can

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.510 
orthographic view and directly we can
draw<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.969> line<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.989> r2<00:00:34.230> graphic<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.190> we<00:00:35.340> can

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
draw a line in this r2 graphic so we can

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.340 
draw a line in this r2 graphic so we can
see<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.880> line<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.329> long<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.719> perspective<00:00:37.260> is

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
see this line is long and perspective is

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.810 
see this line is long and perspective is
standing<00:00:38.420> it<00:00:39.590> is<00:00:40.590> not<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.309> grid<00:00:41.610> it

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
standing it is not like on the grid it

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.459 
standing it is not like on the grid it
is<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> standing<00:00:43.320> position

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
is just just like a standing position

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.100 
is just just like a standing position
because<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.760> drawn<00:00:45.030> on<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.450> grid<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:45.899> in

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
because we have drawn on the grid but in

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.600 
because we have drawn on the grid but in
the<00:00:46.230> Arctic<00:00:46.559> direct<00:00:46.829> graphic<00:00:47.219> view<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the Arctic direct graphic view of the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.729 
the Arctic direct graphic view of the
front<00:00:47.850> if<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.570> draw<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.899> Arthur<00:00:49.320> graphic<00:00:49.680> view

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
front if we draw the Arthur graphic view

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.040 
front if we draw the Arthur graphic view
of<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> side<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.879> see<00:00:51.059> again<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.690> line<00:00:51.870> is

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
of the side so we see again the line is

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.470 
of the side so we see again the line is
standing<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.500> perspective<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.270> way

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
standing in perspective you in this way

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.510 
standing in perspective you in this way
we<00:00:54.719> know<00:00:56.570> so<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.960> are<00:00:58.140> looking<00:00:58.680> our<00:00:58.859> lines<00:00:59.219> are

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
we know so we are looking our lines are

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.279 
we know so we are looking our lines are
standing<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> perspective<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.930> because

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
standing in the perspective of because

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.930 
standing in the perspective of because
we<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.710> drawn<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.100> line<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.640> front

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
we have drawn this line in the front

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.240 
we have drawn this line in the front
orthographic<00:01:03.210> view<00:01:03.840> inside<00:01:04.409> our<00:01:04.650> graphic<00:01:05.129> we

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
orthographic view inside our graphic we

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.670 
orthographic view inside our graphic we
are<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> front<00:01:06.000> orthographic<00:01:06.270> view<00:01:07.140> so

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
are in the front orthographic view so

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.800 
are in the front orthographic view so
this<00:01:07.860> grid<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.369> just<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> top<00:01:09.090> view<00:01:09.330> when

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
this grid is just like the top view when

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.440 
this grid is just like the top view when
we<00:01:10.110> draw<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.710> line<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.250> grid<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:12.270> like

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
we draw a line in the grid just like

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.740 
we draw a line in the grid just like
this<00:01:12.680> so<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.860> line<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:14.880> said<00:01:15.299> when

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
this so this line is just like said when

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.100 
this so this line is just like said when
we<00:01:15.780> are<00:01:16.080> drawing<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.470> line<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.280> top<00:01:17.759> view<00:01:21.110> so

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
we are drawing the line in top view so

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.820 
we are drawing the line in top view so
you<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.250> see<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.580> lines<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.570> same<00:01:24.830> line

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
you can see the lines the same line

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.950 
you can see the lines the same line
which<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.490> drawn<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.060> top<00:01:27.270> view<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.600> I

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
which I have drawn in the top view and I

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.450 
which I have drawn in the top view and I
have<00:01:28.170> drawn<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.740> perspective<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.340> are

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
have drawn in the perspective you are

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.120 
have drawn in the perspective you are
laying<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.939> directly<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> grid<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.770> our

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
laying on directly on the grid so our

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.100 
laying on directly on the grid so our
three<00:01:32.490> are<00:01:32.670> terrific<00:01:33.000> views<00:01:33.450> are<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.780> like

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
three are terrific views are just like

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.039 
three are terrific views are just like
the<00:01:35.040> art<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> graphic<00:01:35.729> grits<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.570> first<00:01:36.840> is

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
the art the graphic grits so first is

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.539 
the art the graphic grits so first is
the<00:01:37.170> side<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.619> front<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.250> top<00:01:38.520> is

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the side in the front and the top is

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.890 
the side in the front and the top is
just<00:01:38.909> like<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.210> grid<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.659> perspective

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
just like the grid of the perspective

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.980 
just like the grid of the perspective
view<00:01:40.290> directly<00:01:40.740> when<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.250> draw<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.909> line<00:01:42.210> with

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
view directly when we draw in line with

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.530 
view directly when we draw in line with
the<00:01:43.110> CV<00:01:43.409> curve<00:01:43.439> tool<00:01:43.829> what<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.970> silica<00:01:45.390> to

it is just like in line this is just

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.449 
it is just like in line this is just
