00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.949 
woods with iron but let me just test it
one<00:02:29.740> more<00:02:29.860> time<00:02:30.040> one<00:02:30.310> two<00:02:30.940> three<00:02:31.510> yeah<00:02:31.810> only

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
one more time one two three yeah only

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.210 
one more time one two three yeah only
three<00:02:32.200> hits<00:02:32.320> alright<00:02:32.980> just<00:02:33.130> being<00:02:33.340> sure<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:35.500> it

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
three hits alright just being sure so it

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.210 
three hits alright just being sure so it
goes<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:37.480> uh<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:38.200> course<00:02:38.560> diamond<00:02:39.070> is<00:02:39.190> the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
goes so uh of course diamond is the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.070 
goes so uh of course diamond is the
strongest<00:02:39.790> next<00:02:40.660> up<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:41.020> seems<00:02:41.350> to<00:02:41.680> be<00:02:42.040> iron

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
strongest next up it seems to be iron

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.460 
strongest next up it seems to be iron
then<00:02:44.080> it<00:02:45.040> seemed<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.459> be<00:02:45.580> stone<00:02:45.940> then<00:02:46.870> wood<00:02:47.200> and

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
then it seemed to be stone then wood and

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.540 
then it seemed to be stone then wood and
then<00:02:47.890> gold<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:50.350> that's<00:02:50.680> with<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.070> swords

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
then gold so that's with the swords

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.949 
then gold so that's with the swords
everybody<00:02:52.090> if<00:02:52.360> you<00:02:52.630> enjoyed<00:02:53.170> go<00:02:53.890> ahead<00:02:54.190> and

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
everybody if you enjoyed go ahead and

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.090 
everybody if you enjoyed go ahead and
give<00:02:55.959> this<00:02:56.050> video<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.380> thumbs<00:02:56.620> up<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:56.920> also

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
give this video a thumbs up and also

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.509 
give this video a thumbs up and also
this<00:02:57.459> seed<00:02:58.269> that<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:59.260> I've<00:02:59.709> randomly<00:03:00.100> generated

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
this seed that I I've randomly generated

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.830 
this seed that I I've randomly generated
this<00:03:00.610> world<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.090> look<00:03:01.239> look<00:03:01.450> at<00:03:01.570> this<00:03:01.690> it

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
this world and look look at this it

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.160 
this world and look look at this it
already<00:03:02.019> has<00:03:02.290> iron<00:03:03.250> just<00:03:03.820> showing<00:03:04.180> like<00:03:04.360> right

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
already has iron just showing like right

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.830 
already has iron just showing like right
right<00:03:05.500> above<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.519> and<00:03:06.790> this<00:03:07.269> is<00:03:07.450> just<00:03:07.480> pretty

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
right above it and this is just pretty

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.040 
right above it and this is just pretty
cool<00:03:08.110> like<00:03:08.440> has<00:03:08.769> this<00:03:09.269> weird<00:03:10.269> looking<00:03:10.810> thing

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
cool like has this weird looking thing

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.340 
cool like has this weird looking thing
with<00:03:11.560> this<00:03:11.680> random<00:03:12.040> lilly<00:03:12.430> pad<00:03:12.700> here<00:03:13.260> so<00:03:14.260> if

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
with this random lilly pad here so if

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.840 
with this random lilly pad here so if
you<00:03:14.470> want<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.739> coordinates<00:03:15.190> I'll<00:03:15.489> put<00:03:15.760> them

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
you want the coordinates I'll put them

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.720 
you want the coordinates I'll put them
up<00:03:15.970> right<00:03:16.239> now<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:17.040> I'll<00:03:18.040> read<00:03:18.400> them<00:03:18.579> off<00:03:18.700> to

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
up right now and I'll read them off to

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.050 
up right now and I'll read them off to
you<00:03:18.970> just<00:03:19.269> in<00:03:19.450> case<00:03:19.660> so<00:03:20.079> X<00:03:20.320> is<00:03:20.820> 216

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
you just in case so X is 216

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.020 
you just in case so X is 216
y<00:03:22.390> is<00:03:22.450> 63<00:03:23.410> which<00:03:23.590> doesn't<00:03:23.890> matter<00:03:24.010> so<00:03:24.220> X<00:03:24.459> 2<00:03:24.700> 16

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
y is 63 which doesn't matter so X 2 16

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.490 
y is 63 which doesn't matter so X 2 16
and<00:03:25.420> Z<00:03:25.690> 310<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:27.390> where<00:03:28.390> you<00:03:28.600> spawn<00:03:29.049> is

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
and Z 310 and where you spawn is

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.860 
and Z 310 and where you spawn is
actually<00:03:30.100> over<00:03:30.480> somewhere<00:03:31.480> on<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.750> other

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
actually over somewhere on the other

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.990 
actually over somewhere on the other
side<00:03:31.989> of<00:03:32.290> this<00:03:32.410> hill<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:32.799> over<00:03:33.700> there<00:03:33.850> I<00:03:33.880> just

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
side of this hill and over there I just

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.390 
side of this hill and over there I just
flew<00:03:34.420> up<00:03:34.450> looked<00:03:35.019> for<00:03:35.320> a<00:03:35.350> flatter<00:03:35.739> area<00:03:36.220> and

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
flew up looked for a flatter area and

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.729 
flew up looked for a flatter area and
this<00:03:36.489> is<00:03:36.670> where<00:03:36.820> I<00:03:36.850> found<00:03:37.060> first<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:38.320> if<00:03:38.620> you

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
this is where I found first so if you

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.170 
this is where I found first so if you
want<00:03:38.950> to<00:03:39.040> have<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.549> coordinates<00:03:39.940> I'll<00:03:40.030> just

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
want to have the coordinates I'll just

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.150 
want to have the coordinates I'll just
keep<00:03:40.390> them<00:03:40.510> up<00:03:40.570> for<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:40.930> little<00:03:41.260> bit<00:03:41.410> longer<00:03:41.709> and

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
keep them up for a little bit longer and

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.220 
keep them up for a little bit longer and
oh<00:03:43.090> yes<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:43.540> seed<00:03:43.780> slash<00:03:44.579> shade<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.810> seed<00:03:47.049> is

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
oh yes the seed slash shade the seed is

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.920 
oh yes the seed slash shade the seed is
