snap-on<00:01:58.120> back<00:01:58.360> covers<00:01:58.720> but<00:01:58.930> I<00:01:59.230> don't<00:01:59.740> like

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
snap-on back covers but I don't like

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.590 
snap-on back covers but I don't like
when<00:02:00.190> they<00:02:00.280> expose<00:02:00.820> that<00:02:00.850> piece<00:02:01.330> right<00:02:01.480> there

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
when they expose that piece right there

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.360 
when they expose that piece right there

absolutely perfectly and then here's my

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.559 
absolutely perfectly and then here's my
one<00:02:14.500> complaint<00:02:14.800> I<00:02:15.250> guess<00:02:15.459> it's<00:02:15.670> minor<00:02:16.000> they

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
one complaint I guess it's minor they

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.449 
one complaint I guess it's minor they
have<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.959> logo<00:02:17.200> right<00:02:17.650> here<00:02:17.680> but<00:02:18.129> it's<00:02:18.250> kind

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
have the logo right here but it's kind

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.880 
have the logo right here but it's kind
of<00:02:18.519> cut<00:02:18.849> out<00:02:19.030> it's<00:02:19.360> almost<00:02:19.660> see-through<00:02:20.050> so

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
of cut out it's almost see-through so

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.470 
of cut out it's almost see-through so
the<00:02:21.219> white<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.670> you're<00:02:21.790> seeing<00:02:22.030> back<00:02:22.269> there

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
the white that you're seeing back there

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.300 
the white that you're seeing back there
is<00:02:22.599> actually<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.049> white<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.290> my<00:02:23.560> iphone<00:02:24.040> I

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
is actually the white of my iphone I

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.070 
is actually the white of my iphone I
just<00:02:24.879> think<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:25.269> know<00:02:25.359> they've<00:02:25.510> got<00:02:25.659> the<00:02:25.810> load

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
just think you know they've got the load

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.510 
just think you know they've got the load
on<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.320> inside<00:02:26.440> I'm<00:02:26.920> not<00:02:27.040> sure<00:02:27.190> why<00:02:27.310> they<00:02:27.400> had

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
on the inside I'm not sure why they had

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.250 
on the inside I'm not sure why they had
to<00:02:27.610> add<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:28.060> in<00:02:28.210> there<00:02:28.240> don't<00:02:28.930> know<00:02:29.080> how<00:02:29.200> we

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
to add that in there don't know how we

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.960 
to add that in there don't know how we
would<00:02:29.410> look<00:02:29.590> on<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.770> black<00:02:30.040> phone<00:02:30.340> maybe<00:02:30.760> would

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
would look on a black phone maybe would

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.910 
would look on a black phone maybe would
blend<00:02:31.240> in<00:02:31.420> more<00:02:31.450> with<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.020> black<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.650> case

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
blend in more with the black of the case

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.550 
blend in more with the black of the case
itself<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.640> be<00:02:33.760> even<00:02:34.420> less<00:02:34.600> noticeable<00:02:35.140> you

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
itself and be even less noticeable you

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.530 
itself and be even less noticeable you
have<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.920> white<00:02:36.100> kind<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:37.030> lines<00:02:37.270> of<00:02:37.480> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
have the white kind of the lines of the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.480 
have the white kind of the lines of the
logo<00:02:37.930> but<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.650> know<00:02:38.740> again<00:02:38.860> I<00:02:39.160> think<00:02:39.220> this

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
logo but you know again I think this

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.220 
logo but you know again I think this
case<00:02:39.730> goes<00:02:39.760> well<00:02:40.270> with<00:02:40.420> either<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.840> black<00:02:40.960> or

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
case goes well with either the black or

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.450 
case goes well with either the black or
the<00:02:41.290> weight<00:02:41.530> just<00:02:41.680> because<00:02:41.890> it's<00:02:42.010> got<00:02:42.070> both<00:02:42.430> of

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
the weight just because it's got both of

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.360 
the weight just because it's got both of
those<00:02:42.610> colors<00:02:43.090> incorporated<00:02:43.930> in<00:02:44.110> it<00:02:44.260> so<00:02:45.010> I'm

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
those colors incorporated in it so I'm

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.210 
those colors incorporated in it so I'm
able<00:02:45.670> to<00:02:45.760> dock<00:02:46.000> this<00:02:46.240> case<00:02:47.020> no<00:02:47.410> problem<00:02:47.860> in<00:02:48.010> all

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220
