hard<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.040> get<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.400> then<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.420> can't<00:01:12.600> exactly

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
hard to get to then you can't exactly

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.149 
hard to get to then you can't exactly
reach<00:01:13.080> out<00:01:13.229> touch<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.710> spin<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.979> fan

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
blades while you're painting it so and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.870 
blades while you're painting it so and
also<00:01:16.680> it's<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.130> narrow<00:01:17.280> gap<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.640> don't<00:01:17.759> want

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
also it's a narrow gap you don't want

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.160 
also it's a narrow gap you don't want
the<00:01:17.939> painting<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.360> bridging<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.750> gap<00:01:18.930> by

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the painting on bridging the gap by

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.690 
the painting on bridging the gap by
accent<00:01:19.560> or<00:01:19.619> something<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.920> feel<00:01:20.070> heavy<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.580> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
accent or something to feel heavy in a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.969 
accent or something to feel heavy in a
spot<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.930> take<00:01:22.110> these<00:01:22.229> fans<00:01:22.500> apart

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
in behind them these particular fans

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.250 
in behind them these particular fans
have<00:04:55.130> a<00:04:55.190> small<00:04:55.430> hole<00:04:55.670> ring<00:04:55.910> down<00:04:56.450> inside<00:04:57.110> the

have a small hole ring down inside the

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.860 
have a small hole ring down inside the
fan<00:04:57.440> body<00:04:57.650> on<00:04:57.890> the<00:04:58.010> shaft<00:04:58.280> um<00:04:59.240> it's<00:04:59.660> a<00:04:59.750> good

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
fan body on the shaft um it's a good

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.020 
fan body on the shaft um it's a good
idea<00:05:00.110> to<00:05:00.230> take<00:05:00.380> your<00:05:00.550> probably<00:05:01.550> a<00:05:01.640> flathead

two<00:06:40.400> small<00:06:40.850> flathead<00:06:41.120> screwdrivers<00:06:41.840> and

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
two small flathead screwdrivers and

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.930 
two small flathead screwdrivers and
repop<00:06:42.290> those<00:06:42.470> back<00:06:42.680> on<00:06:42.860> push<00:06:43.370> one<00:06:43.520> side<00:06:43.730> down

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
repop those back on push one side down

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.730 
repop those back on push one side down
get<00:06:44.180> it<00:06:44.270> started<00:06:44.600> and<00:06:44.750> then<00:06:44.990> stretch<00:06:45.620> the

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
get it started and then stretch the

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.580 
get it started and then stretch the
other<00:06:45.800> side<00:06:46.070> around<00:06:46.330> just<00:06:47.330> let<00:06:47.510> you<00:06:47.600> know<00:06:47.660> but

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
other side around just let you know but

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.440 
other side around just let you know but
uh<00:06:48.620> yeah<00:06:49.370> that's<00:06:49.640> pretty<00:06:49.850> much<00:06:49.970> it<00:06:50.090> this<00:06:50.300> is<00:06:50.420> a

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:50.450 
uh yeah that's pretty much it this is a

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.690 
uh yeah that's pretty much it this is a
great<00:06:50.690> time<00:06:50.840> to<00:06:50.990> clean<00:06:51.110> these<00:06:51.380> things<00:06:51.650> and<00:06:51.920> you
