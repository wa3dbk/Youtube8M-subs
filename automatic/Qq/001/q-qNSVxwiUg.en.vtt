00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
right there should have been so much

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.200 
right there should have been so much
more<00:00:52.410> dramatic<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.550> like<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> way<00:00:54.030> that

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210
