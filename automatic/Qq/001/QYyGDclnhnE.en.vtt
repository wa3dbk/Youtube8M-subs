arc 170 the arc 170 from 2009
yeah<00:00:35.670> those<00:00:36.570> engine<00:00:36.989> pieces<00:00:37.290> are<00:00:37.380> used<00:00:37.530> to

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
yeah those engine pieces are used to

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.510 
yeah those engine pieces are used to
create<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.219> accordion-like<00:00:38.850> thing<00:00:39.450> that

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
create the accordion-like thing that

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.200 
create the accordion-like thing that
compresses<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> air<00:00:41.640> obviously<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:43.050> can't

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
compresses the air obviously it can't

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.279 
compresses the air obviously it can't
bend<00:00:45.210> or<00:00:45.360> stretch<00:00:45.390> or<00:00:45.690> anything<00:00:45.840> because<00:00:46.050> it's

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
bend or stretch or anything because it's

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.069 
bend or stretch or anything because it's
hard<00:00:46.680> plastic<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.250> moving<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.180> we<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
hard plastic but moving on we have the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.389 
hard plastic but moving on we have the
nozzle<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.610> used<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.719> blow<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.890> air<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
nozzle that is used to blow the air and

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.979 
nozzle that is used to blow the air and
then<00:00:53.670> knock<00:00:53.969> away<00:00:54.149> all<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.539> balloons<00:00:54.809> and

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
then knock away all the balloons and

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.950 
then knock away all the balloons and
stuff<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.559> that's<00:00:56.719> it's<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.780> pretty

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
stuff so that's it's a pretty

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.380 
stuff so that's it's a pretty
interesting<00:00:58.170> idea<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.800> defense<00:00:59.390> supercell

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
interesting idea the defense supercell

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.119 
interesting idea the defense supercell

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
mockolate ever made on this channel that

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.320 
mockolate ever made on this channel that
one<00:01:16.290> did<00:01:16.920> not<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> very<00:01:17.640> good<00:01:17.880> barrel

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
one did not have a very good barrel

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.630 
one did not have a very good barrel
didn't<00:01:18.840> look<00:01:18.900> very<00:01:19.049> realistic<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:19.950> now<00:01:20.369> that

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
didn't look very realistic but now that

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.969 
didn't look very realistic but now that
I<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:21.000> done<00:01:21.210> some<00:01:22.170> more<00:01:22.380> building<00:01:22.830> I

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
I have done some more building I

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.370 
I have done some more building I
realized<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.150> figured<00:01:24.570> out<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:25.110> way<00:01:25.170> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
realized I have figured out a way to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.800 
realized I have figured out a way to
make<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> look<00:01:25.920> more<00:01:26.369> realistic<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.330> here

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
make a look more realistic one so here

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.899 
make a look more realistic one so here
is<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.229> can't<00:01:28.530> here<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.220> second

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
is that can't here is that second

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.240 
is that can't here is that second
version<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.329> cannon<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.780> my<00:01:31.380> opinion<00:01:31.829> it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
version of the cannon and my opinion it

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.100 
version of the cannon and my opinion it
kicks<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.640> lot<00:01:32.820> more<00:01:33.030> goblin<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:33.689> then<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
kicks a lot more goblin but then the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.440 
kicks a lot more goblin but then the
first<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.590> made<00:01:34.799> moving<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.090> archer

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
first one I made moving on to the archer

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.969 
first one I made moving on to the archer
let's<00:01:36.630> go<00:01:36.720> take<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.930> look<00:01:37.079> at<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.740> here's
