00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
hair growth so you can improve the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.000 
hair growth so you can improve the
penetration<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.710> such<00:00:58.949> medicines<00:00:59.399> and<00:01:01.010> it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
penetration of such medicines and it

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.000 
penetration of such medicines and it
says<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.850> activates<00:01:03.480> PRP<00:01:04.290> treatment<00:01:05.040> and

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
says it activates PRP treatment and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.140 
says it activates PRP treatment and
keeps<00:01:08.010> donors<00:01:08.460> gas<00:01:10.340> encourages<00:01:11.340> Cal<00:01:11.700> prepare

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
keeps donors gas encourages Cal prepare

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.780 
keeps donors gas encourages Cal prepare
and<00:01:13.880> hair<00:01:14.880> growth<00:01:15.750> mechanisms<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.580> that's

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
and hair growth mechanisms so that's

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.200 
and hair growth mechanisms so that's
what<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.750> calculator<00:01:19.380> benefits<00:01:20.210> so

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
what this calculator benefits so

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.600 
what this calculator benefits so
basically<00:01:21.659> god<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:23.070> improve<00:01:23.869> my<00:01:25.610> better

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
basically god is to improve my better

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.850 
basically god is to improve my better
circulation<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.180> hair<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.590> will<00:01:28.770> be

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
circulation to the hair and I will be

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.880 
circulation to the hair and I will be
applying<00:01:29.189> min<00:01:30.150> top<00:01:30.360> or<00:01:30.570> minoxidil<00:01:30.869> offer<00:01:31.470> this

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
applying min top or minoxidil offer this

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.910 
applying min top or minoxidil offer this
so<00:01:32.360> that<00:01:33.360> would<00:01:33.479> improve<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.259> minoxidil

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
so that would improve the minoxidil

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.929 
so that would improve the minoxidil
observe<00:01:35.340> absorption<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.390> thus<00:01:37.290> my<00:01:37.939> hair

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
observe absorption and thus my hair

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.469 
observe absorption and thus my hair
growth<00:01:39.240> would<00:01:39.420> be<00:01:39.540> faster<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:44.329> have<00:01:45.329> this

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
growth would be faster I have this

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.870 
growth would be faster I have this
opened<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.930> back

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
opened the back

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.950 
opened the back
so<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.540> would<00:01:48.689> look<00:01:48.840> inside

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.130 

so<00:01:53.530> it's<00:01:53.830> exciting<00:01:54.130> it's<00:01:54.400> a<00:01:54.460> roller<00:01:55.000> I<00:01:55.140> ordered

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
so it's exciting it's a roller I ordered

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.830 
so it's exciting it's a roller I ordered
actually<00:01:56.560> 0.5<00:01:57.250> mm<00:01:57.580> roller<00:01:59.250> the<00:02:00.250> roller<00:02:00.430> is

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
actually 0.5 mm roller the roller is

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.510 
actually 0.5 mm roller the roller is
back<00:02:01.840> safe<00:02:02.200> inside<00:02:02.920> a<00:02:03.720> plastic<00:02:04.720> container<00:02:05.520> so

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
back safe inside a plastic container so

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.760 
back safe inside a plastic container so
that<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.729> needles<00:02:06.850> don't<00:02:07.300> get<00:02:07.720> damaged<00:02:08.229> so<00:02:08.500> if

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
that the needles don't get damaged so if

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.080 
that the needles don't get damaged so if
you<00:02:08.890> place<00:02:09.100> it<00:02:09.130> properly<00:02:09.429> inside<00:02:09.940> this

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
you place it properly inside this

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.990 
you place it properly inside this
container<00:02:10.450> after<00:02:11.350> use<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:12.670> needle<00:02:12.970> should

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
container after use the needle should

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.510 
container after use the needle should
not<00:02:13.270> get<00:02:13.510> hot<00:02:14.380> on<00:02:14.709> which<00:02:14.860> they<00:02:15.100> should<00:02:15.250> not<00:02:15.340> get

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
not get hot on which they should not get

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.820 
not get hot on which they should not get
damaged<00:02:16.620> I'll<00:02:17.620> just<00:02:17.830> open<00:02:18.010> this<00:02:18.250> in<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.430> moment

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
damaged I'll just open this in a moment

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.100 
damaged I'll just open this in a moment
here<00:02:20.830> we<00:02:20.950> go<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:22.709> we<00:02:23.709> have<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.690> plastic

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
here we go so we have the plastic

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.840 
here we go so we have the plastic
container<00:02:26.470> in<00:02:26.560> which<00:02:27.510> we<00:02:28.510> have<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:30.580> scalp

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
container in which we have the the scalp

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.610 
container in which we have the the scalp
roller<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.840> we<00:02:34.959> chose<00:02:35.080> waste<00:02:35.290> too<00:02:35.440> much<00:02:35.470> time

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
roller so we chose waste too much time

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.610 
roller so we chose waste too much time
I'll<00:02:35.920> just<00:02:36.040> open<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.459> up<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.900> be<00:02:38.140> careful<00:02:38.500> while

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
I'll just open it up so be careful while

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
I'll just open it up so be careful while
we're<00:02:38.830> opening<00:02:39.310> this<00:02:41.280> battery<00:02:42.280> container

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
we're opening this battery container

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.850 
we're opening this battery container
because<00:02:43.060> sometimes<00:02:44.050> when<00:02:44.350> you<00:02:44.380> opening<00:02:44.770> it

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
because sometimes when you opening it

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.720 
because sometimes when you opening it
too<00:02:45.340> fast<00:02:46.020> you<00:02:47.020> may<00:02:47.200> tend<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.100> touch<00:02:48.520> the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
too fast you may tend to touch the

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.320 
too fast you may tend to touch the
needles<00:02:49.090> with<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.920> doctor<00:02:51.910> leaves<00:02:52.060> so

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
needles with this the doctor leaves so

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.199 
needles with this the doctor leaves so
the<00:02:52.989> needles<00:02:53.290> may<00:02:53.440> get<00:02:53.560> damaged<00:02:53.920> so<00:02:54.250> so<00:02:55.120> I'm

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
the needles may get damaged so so I'm

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.600 
the needles may get damaged so so I'm
just<00:02:55.390> opening<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:55.840> very<00:02:56.050> slowly<00:02:56.459> making<00:02:57.459> sure

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
just opening it very slowly making sure

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.449 
just opening it very slowly making sure
that<00:02:57.760> I'm<00:02:57.880> pushing<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.450> towards<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.560> M<00:02:59.769> so

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
that I'm pushing it towards the M so
