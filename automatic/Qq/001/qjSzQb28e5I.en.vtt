two<00:02:12.780> other<00:02:12.960> things<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.320> it<00:02:13.530> comes<00:02:13.710> with<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:15.480> a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
two other things that it comes with is a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.180 
two other things that it comes with is a
long<00:02:16.350> pole<00:02:16.760> such<00:02:17.760> as<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.740> little<00:02:19.980> short

pole
now<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.420> reason<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.810> they<00:02:21.990> do<00:02:22.170> this<00:02:22.200> is

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
now the reason that they do this is

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.790 
now the reason that they do this is
because<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:24.120> drop<00:02:24.330> pod<00:02:24.510> has<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> little

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
because this the drop pod has a little

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.400 
because this the drop pod has a little
hole<00:02:26.310> right<00:02:26.430> here<00:02:26.550> now<00:02:27.330> when<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.020> put<00:02:28.200> one<00:02:28.320> of

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
hole right here now when you put one of

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.340 
hole right here now when you put one of
these<00:02:28.500> into<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.340> hole<00:02:30.050> such<00:02:31.050> as<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.790> okay

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
these into that hole such as so okay

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.710 
these into that hole such as so okay
this<00:02:34.350> goes<00:02:34.590> on<00:02:34.770> it<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.310> then<00:02:36.180> once<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.450> goes<00:02:36.570> on

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
this goes on it and then once it goes on

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.870 
this goes on it and then once it goes on
it<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.990> can<00:02:37.140> either<00:02:37.260> depending<00:02:38.220> on<00:02:38.430> how<00:02:38.700> long

of my viewers okay so I have a blue one
right<00:04:34.620> here<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.340> then<00:04:35.550> I<00:04:35.580> can<00:04:35.760> I<00:04:35.820> do<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.030> cut<00:04:36.270> so

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
right here and then I can I do a cut so

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.980 
right here and then I can I do a cut so
comparison<00:04:37.350> for<00:04:38.220> also<00:04:38.700> time<00:04:38.910> they're<00:04:39.780> about

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
comparison for also time they're about

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.710 
comparison for also time they're about
the<00:04:40.200> same<00:04:40.380> size<00:04:40.440> as<00:04:41.010> you<00:04:41.130> can<00:04:41.280> try<00:04:41.400> to<00:04:41.460> see<00:04:41.720> they

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
the same size as you can try to see they

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.800 
the same size as you can try to see they
look<00:04:42.930> very<00:04:42.960> alike<00:04:43.380> I<00:04:44.070> mean<00:04:44.790> the<00:04:45.090> colors<00:04:45.660> are

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
look very alike I mean the colors are

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.750 
look very alike I mean the colors are
different<00:04:45.840> but<00:04:46.740> they<00:04:46.890> are<00:04:46.920> very<00:04:47.190> like<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:47.730> I

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
different but they are very like and I

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.910 
different but they are very like and I
like<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.120> because<00:04:48.330> you<00:04:48.570> know<00:04:48.690> they're<00:04:49.560> not

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
like that because you know they're not

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.140 
like that because you know they're not
I<00:04:49.950> like<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.280> factor<00:04:50.520> that<00:04:50.670> they're<00:04:50.820> using<00:04:50.970> the

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
I like the factor that they're using the

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.940 
I like the factor that they're using the
same<00:04:51.390> type<00:04:51.690> but<00:04:51.990> they're<00:04:52.710> giving<00:04:52.860> them

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
same type but they're giving them

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.620 
same type but they're giving them
different<00:04:53.040> colors<00:04:53.340> because<00:04:54.270> it<00:04:54.480> gives

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
different colors because it gives

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.590 
different colors because it gives
uniqueness<00:04:55.260> I<00:04:55.500> guess<00:04:56.070> to<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.150> figure<00:04:57.420> itself

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
uniqueness I guess to the figure itself

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.360 
uniqueness I guess to the figure itself
and<00:04:58.350> it<00:04:58.560> gives<00:04:58.680> you<00:04:58.770> an<00:04:58.860> ich<00:04:58.950> miss<00:04:59.130> to

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
and it gives you an ich miss to

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.700 
and it gives you an ich miss to
everything<00:04:59.760> else<00:04:59.910> now<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:01.110> weapons<00:05:01.410> it<00:05:01.500> comes

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
everything else now the weapons it comes

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.500 
everything else now the weapons it comes
with<00:05:01.920> our<00:05:02.700> um<00:05:03.590> dual<00:05:05.000> pistols<00:05:06.000> like<00:05:06.120> I<00:05:06.210> had<00:05:06.330> said

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
with our um dual pistols like I had said

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.440 
with our um dual pistols like I had said
earlier<00:05:07.100> which<00:05:08.100> are<00:05:08.280> I<00:05:08.460> believe<00:05:08.910> the<00:05:09.120> only<00:05:09.300> way

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
earlier which are I believe the only way

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.020 
earlier which are I believe the only way
to<00:05:09.630> get<00:05:10.050> them<00:05:10.290> at<00:05:10.740> this<00:05:11.160> moment<00:05:11.370> I<00:05:11.640> believe<00:05:11.910> you

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
to get them at this moment I believe you

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.780 
to get them at this moment I believe you
can<00:05:12.180> get<00:05:12.270> them<00:05:12.480> also<00:05:13.110> with<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:13.830> winter<00:05:14.160> rocket

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
can get them also with the winter rocket

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.090 
can get them also with the winter rocket
hog<00:05:15.080> but<00:05:16.080> I<00:05:16.260> believe<00:05:16.590> that's<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:16.800> only<00:05:16.980> way<00:05:17.070> to

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
hog but I believe that's the only way to

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.430 
hog but I believe that's the only way to
get<00:05:17.310> done<00:05:17.490> right<00:05:17.520> now<00:05:17.970> they<00:05:18.630> varnish<00:05:19.050> detail

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
get done right now they varnish detail

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.070 
stupid and he looks like this no that's
why<00:06:13.770> I<00:06:13.800> see<00:06:14.160> they<00:06:14.310> kinda<00:06:14.730> gave<00:06:14.940> you<00:06:15.150> the<00:06:15.870> dual

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
why I see they kinda gave you the dual

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.160 
why I see they kinda gave you the dual
magnums<00:06:17.070> because<00:06:17.940> even<00:06:18.330> Kelly<00:06:18.510> is<00:06:18.720> somewhat

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170
