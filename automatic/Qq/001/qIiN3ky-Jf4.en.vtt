00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.550
 hey you think I'm just as girl 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.650
 as I just can not get enough 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.150
 You can make up your needs 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.890
 probably like me too 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.810
 nail polish colors you need so much 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.760
 eyeshadow as it is only 1000 brushes 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.800
 and lipgloss and did not you see 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.750
 yes so at home looks like this 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.369
 that my drawers I burst 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.750
 the things you will like to have years 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.370
 somehow later find such a jar 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.989
 and think online why do i have that 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.000
 I do not use that yet 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.040
 and that's why we need girls 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.040
 today a make-up magnet board 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.469
 So if you just like me 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.760
 order in your room wanted to bring 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.469
 just have a clue again 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.750
 want what you have on make-up and 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.100
 just want to arrange the beautiful then 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.579
 you need magnet for our make-up 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.760
 board following things a magnet bar four 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.089
 wooden slats a scissors paper and pen 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.210
 and a ruler color a plastic cup 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.659
 and brush spray glue foil and 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:15.440
 plastic gloves a few magnets 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:16.880
 wood nails four angle nail polish one 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.740
 eyeshadow and whatever else you can 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.610
 still have to make-up and 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.470
 Wrapping paper 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.240
 So if you're so far off, let's go 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.659
 with step number one for that need 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.490
 we put our wooden slats around a frame 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.709
 After all, it is clearly two years to build 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.970
 Two short pieces and we do 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:33.500
 Now first and I have now 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.170
 times acrylic paint I brought've been using 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.850
 brought money and a lot I know 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.649
 I'm going to get a little bit of the money now 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.659
 take guarantee of the white because I like that 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.520
 have a very light pastel do 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.479
 I want to have that and I will 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.479
 the room for now 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.780
 I now have my wooden slats each 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.220
 You can do that twice 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.170
 As you like, I just wanted to 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.400
 a slightly more intense colors of course 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.180
 Once it's enough for you 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.890
 like better 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.540
 I'll let it dry for now 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.940
 and in the meantime, I'll take care of it 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.050
 around our magnetic board resp 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.880
 it is actually a simple one 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.460
 metal plate that will be ours later 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.160
 back wall for our picture frame with it 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.930
 nail polish brush powder puff what too 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.880
 always be good at it 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.530
 and yes she looks a bit like that 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.870
 Ugly that's why I'm going to do it 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.660
 Now measure that down and write me 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.070
 I have so gift wrap with so 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.870
 colorful hearts on it you can 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.370
 Of course, take what you liked 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.070
 it always sweet, a bit simple 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.450
 but a little color anyway 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.470
 then I would get the metal plate afterwards 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.470
 with the hearty 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.410
 So I have now cut out 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.150
 namely after spray glue does that 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.230
 just on my a metal plate 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.160
 on it and then hold the paper 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.160
 hopefully really good 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.990
 next, I'll take care of it now 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.170
 my make up so I 'm so 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:21.250
 couple of nail polishes so a brother bit 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.530
 brush and i have here quite sweet and 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.570
 Eyeshadow cans as a metal 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.970
 a bit of that already stops almost 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.260
 alone on my on my board but 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.540
 since this is very difficult I will 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.709
 nevertheless again attach magnets and 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.230
 you can see it is so from 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.760
 chocolate companies or chewing gum gives 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.860
 sometimes it's so special 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.020
 sweet little jar and how can you 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.000
 actually really cool collect magnets 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.930
 attach and as a storage box 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.360
 easy to use 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.610
 So now it is called magnets in the 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.680
 Hand take a second adhesive on top 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.330
 and then stick to the nail polish 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.959
 and third press press until 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.959
 is dry 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.420
 I now have all the magnets on mine 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.469
 make up stuff that is called me 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.900
 can take me to the next step 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:12.299
 take care and that would be my frame for 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.430
 my make-up board and then I take the 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.650
 both long and the two short sides 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.299
 and what is now a game are the 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.639
 angle that I showed you earlier 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.770
 also and the upholstery nails with it 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.660
 Of course, these accomplish much together 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.440
 We need the angle and the hold 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.039
 upholstery nails 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.039
 let's go 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:42.169
 there - now it's called frame and 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.030
 Match metal plate and one 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.710
 The two never merge again 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.479
 disconnect and you never get along 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.460
 second adhesive and with otherwise 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.050
 nothing else than with mounting glue 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.600
 that will be the best easy 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.500
 I'll show you the plate 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.240
 put it on the frame and put it on 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.190
 I draw some not so 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.479
 So much glue does not have that 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.360
 she goes and suddenly the whole 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.860
 frame with mounting glue power also 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.810
 the fact that we do not and then 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.030
 a bit stupid otherwise the whole thing sticks 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.280
 frame suddenly on the wall so one so 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.630
 sign mounting glue on it 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.070
 Press and wait that can dry it 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.820
 and then you can already make a make-up 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.820
 apply 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:33.669
 humming we watch this 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.819
 final result and that's it 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:39.319
 make-up magni board yes you have to 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:41.239
 prove patience in any case because of the 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:43.249
 montage climate whether really many hours 

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:44.749
 until he is completely dry there too 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:46.669
 the patience because then you have it once 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:49.789
 right and your frame holds forever 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.019
 I now have the whole in landscape format 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:53.809
 Of course you can also do it in the 

00:05:51.019 --> 00:05:55.339
 However, I could do big format 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:57.649
 thanks to my pattern because of the 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:06:00.409
 heart yes arranged so naturally 

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:01.369
 so do not pay attention to your patterns and 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.679
 everything that is missing now 

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:06.349
 of course, all the things that I do now 

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:12.409
 here can attach by magnet magnetically 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:15.889
 Brush Powder cans nail polish and mine 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:17.179
 eyeshadow box and finished 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.069
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:21.169
 imitate and just use yours 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:23.439
 favorite colors and hang your make 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.439
 up more beautiful
