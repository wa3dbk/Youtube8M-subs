dust i knows

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.190 
dust i knows
is<00:03:22.670> quite<00:03:22.850> a<00:03:22.910> bit<00:03:23.120> like<00:03:23.330> my<00:03:23.480> elemental<00:03:23.990> spells

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
is quite a bit like my elemental spells

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.040 
is quite a bit like my elemental spells
concept<00:03:24.860> and<00:03:25.040> in<00:03:25.880> a<00:03:25.970> way<00:03:26.120> it's<00:03:26.300> almost<00:03:26.570> exactly

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
concept and in a way it's almost exactly

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.890 
concept and in a way it's almost exactly
the<00:03:27.170> same<00:03:27.970> but<00:03:28.970> this<00:03:29.240> is<00:03:29.360> just<00:03:29.390> a<00:03:29.660> way<00:03:29.870> of

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
the same but this is just a way of

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.400 
the same but this is just a way of
allowing<00:03:30.770> you<00:03:30.830> guys<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.250> use<00:03:31.790> this<00:03:32.030> concept

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
allowing you guys to use this concept

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.260 
allowing you guys to use this concept
without<00:03:33.410> having<00:03:33.860> to<00:03:33.980> use<00:03:34.190> only<00:03:34.460> one<00:03:34.730> world<00:03:35.030> and

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
without having to use only one world and

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.240 
without having to use only one world and
you<00:03:35.690> can<00:03:35.840> use<00:03:35.990> this<00:03:36.170> in<00:03:36.380> any<00:03:36.560> world<00:03:36.860> you<00:03:37.070> so

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
bit of command blocks to put together if

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.790 
bit of command blocks to put together if
you<00:03:44.330> want<00:03:44.420> me<00:03:44.570> to<00:03:44.630> go<00:03:44.720> over<00:03:44.750> all<00:03:45.200> these<00:03:45.380> let<00:03:45.710> me
