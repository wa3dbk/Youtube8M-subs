00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.390
 everyone 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.870
 ｰｰｰthat I received such a thing 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.200
 It arrived because it is a character 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.610
 Those who bought 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.360
 I bought Koa 2 for a while now 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:25.590
 It is called Nagase 200 of t 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.590
 I would like to open softly It is a cpu for Pabunoto 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.590
 Packing has been packed like this 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.880
 Things are like this 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.250
 It is raw 1100 of t 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.450
 2 ghz cache is 4 mega fasb is 667 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:13.530
 A little notebook computer you're using a little now say that even 54 round celeron 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:18.299
 Because I use the late Qi pu notes 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.130
 I don't know if I can use this cpu or not 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.329
 But use 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.329
 I want to go home 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.060
 By the way 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.060
 Laptop is like this 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:48.450
 By the way 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.960
 This x persimmon this x perry 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.560
 Ensue Index 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.270
 Processor is 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.540
 4.1 and 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.920
 A little 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:04.439
 How much does it change because the numbers are low ? 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.439
 I would like to take one more time from a little changing the cp 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:13.580
 Yes the foundation has gone 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.580
 I will omit some work on the way, so it was a little bothersome to take 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.790
 What is a big giant? The contents are quite compact base 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.860
 The back is like this 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.900
 I would like to remove cp for a moment 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.450
 Hmm 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.610
 This has become a place of heat sink 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.010
 cpu is now 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.010
 I 'm on the packet 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.540
 It is called 478 of pet past pga 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.379
 I would like to remove a little 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.160
 I will come off if I turn this part 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.189
 Putsu 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.189
 This is also cpu 6 in public opinion 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.920
 54 rounds of public opinion 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.530
 1.86 gear 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.530
 It seems that the cache is running with one person processing 33 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.910
 This is the person who is going to attach this time 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.890
 The size is the same 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.800
 The size of the core is slightly larger 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.100
 Then I would like to add this 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.280
 I decided to try 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.240
 The position of the lock on the hook is slightly different and different 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.790
 Oh it was useless 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.790
 We will loose not this way pin from entering 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:26.960
 I was a little bit sour this time 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.960
 This cpu is likely to be a collection
