00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.330
 blackberry messenger application

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.610

 coffee is aboca and also on the google 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.760
 play specifically on the Google Play has 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.290
 come out of beta form and officially 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.000
 is to say that everyone could 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.409
 download this beta that was the one 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.109
 originated that the blackberry servers 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.280
 will be saturated because he received more than one 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.080
 million download 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.610
 in the first hours this originated that 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.979
 the servers will collapse and 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.110
 blackberry was forced to withdraw 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.729
 of all the store so much of the google 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.799
 play as from the app store the app 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.330
 blackberry messenger blackberry 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.070
 messenger let's say it arrives in a 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.990
 delicate moment to talk see and all 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.820
 we know that blackberry goes through a bad 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.300
 At the moment I think it has been sold to a 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.009
 entrepreneur group then precisely 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.290
 does not go through the best time and has 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.149
 decided to delay the release many 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.060
 surely you want to install this 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.039
 service and now I tell you one thing I 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.590
 I'm from whatsapp and it's hard for me to use line 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.880
 times what interest do people have in 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.020
 install this blackberry service 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.789
 messenger I hallucinate I do not know the meaning 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.289
 that you can see him using a service that 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.300
 you are going to use four days and you will get tired 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.590
 see if the TV has even come out on TV 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.899
 leo messi the player of barcelona 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.520
 announcing the widget application and not 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.530
 has had a success, look, they have spent 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.780
 money in advertising campaign and 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.660
 end people use a whatsapp and if 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.459
 perhaps line whatsapp line whatsapp line 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.620
 whatsapp line is that that is a 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.750
 hegemony then I think it arrives 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.780
 late is late finally I have been put 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.850
 what 's 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.459
 is voting right in front of the 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.069
 screen takes already come good the case is 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.770
 that I directly to see I advise you 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.270
 that you do not play the install this 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.890
 blackberry messenger application 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.209
 true until it officially comes out 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.760
 then when it officially comes out 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.980
 try it you will see that it is not going to 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.569
 like or even if you like it you will see that very 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.190
 few people will install it and will 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.780
 really use many of your 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.459
 contacts because this is the problem of 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.440
 the messaging applications that 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.239
 when it does not depend on your use of you without the 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.100
 penis that your contacts have this 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.780
 application also then practically 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.670
 they end up being applications 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.410
 sporadic that you use four or five days 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.560
 put him one or two weeks and finally you leave 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.810
 to use I'm wrong so I hope 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.220
 that this video has become clear to you 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.690

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.910
