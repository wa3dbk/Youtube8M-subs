just make the ender chest and the way
you<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.790> by<00:00:39.030> placing<00:00:39.390> eighth<00:00:39.860> obsidian

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.920 
you do it is by placing eighth obsidian
and<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.610> eye<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:42.030> ender<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> middle<00:00:42.780> and
