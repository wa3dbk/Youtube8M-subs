00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.270
 Lanzinger 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:30.600
 the amount of work behind it version 8 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.770
 At the beginning you have somehow more 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.870
 or less fuzzy on the mouth 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.910
 talked or long mails wrote something 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.620
 the dok filmer whether now is 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.540
 many of these agents were also in this 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.000
 Visitors must therefore directly what that is 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.680
 could imagine and know too 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.360
 what that means as double from that 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.360
 That has definitely become easier 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.280
 apple is unique in the concept 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.250
 Germany would say yes 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.320
 especially with the implementation of art 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.750
 partly even more so here a whole 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.360
 playground from a variety of 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.780
 I would save money 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.880
 definitely say huge capacity 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.830
 we can fight right here though 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.090
 So we are in the middle of the city 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.120
 I would already be unique 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.120
 designated 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.320
 Jesus already has a bit of everything 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.420
 so the stages were really made nicer 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.710
 partly nicely designed and what 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.910
 anyway a small beer garden where you 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.110
 It can always be something new 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.020
 that can come on others 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.310
 for example, festivals do not find that way 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.110
 I have to be nice if you if you 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.510
 here by gestures by the small ones 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.119
 grow again six very sweet ones 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.229
 Misty little niches somewhere 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.850
 in the trees lots of people art 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.140
 attached and so much on like durchs 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.860
 terrain and we look at all the things 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.610
 You come here and there again and again 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.610
 on what else 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.910
 not just a music festival would 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.670
 but quite clearly this art claim 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.720
 and I think that's special about the art 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.400
 if it's just the open air so art 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.830
 outside on a terrain on the then 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:32.920
 So 25,000 people will be celebrating too 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:38.050
 an art, a space for art really 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:41.920
 which is then playable where 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.680
 people can just have fun on 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.420
 one side is the main point and 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.580
 at the same time the whole terrain too 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.270
 just change both together 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.270
 Act 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.970
 culture that is realistically here 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.590
 from the festival area also stages one 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.720
 a little bit culture looks too 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.550
 was in front of her 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.250
 I did not expect it yet 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.020
 neither a teacher as we now beckons in 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.880
 At the Russian level, my started 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.010
 At that time, hair was ready on the flanks 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.690
 to withdraw how close pole and victory 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.920
 is people in the class was theirs 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.260
 name all letters of the alphabet 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.670
 sent and that my feet of scarce 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.210
 under my basin to the ground 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.920
 suffice 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.020
 I learned English like the others 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.580
 say I became as German as everyone there 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:39.540
 other a normal German 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:44.070
 called pacifiers or something I want now 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:46.290
 not generally say that because of the art 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.250
 and you realize that is very clear 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.250
 but also completely alright 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.430
 I really like the music here now 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.770
 specially seen at this festival 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.270
 unlike other festivals that 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.130
 indie electro max is cool 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.130
 I like that 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.240
 the first double was with 5000 visitors 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.770
 relatively small 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.949
 of course for the first time then already 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.949
 quite big realize our audience 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:47.779
 very young are very mixed 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.069
 audience what area in the first year 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:51.219
 not quite the case 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:54.080
 but we are very aware of music 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:57.520
 audience and I would say that show 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.520
 I double that also always had 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.280
 why do not you access the offer 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.139
 back what is offered here so a 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.580
 that's far too far away from the tent 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.509
 you have to go five minutes around first 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.409
 to get coffee 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:19.990
 he is all too expensive about that 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.169
 and that you are here simply to 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.930
 with a bit of water what more could you want 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.979
 that would be bigger it is becoming more popular 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.560
 and that's what it's actually about 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:32.470
 actually broken rather small and fine 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.430
 as a big and commerce, I believe that 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:38.310
 it just gets bigger everything will be like 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.620
 other festivals also meanwhile 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.800
 It used to be somehow she knows 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.659
 not as much as I like 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.340
 say, we always change some every year 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:50.199
 things so we are never satisfied 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.819
 We still want to do it better 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.379
 absolutely want to be on this 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:54.969
 surface remain so we have one 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:57.039
 political problems in the basics 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:59.020
 because that's your harbor extension area 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:01.030
 is and that he is actually industrial 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.139
 should be used and therefore it could 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.009
 be that us the campsites 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.780
 be omitted 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:05.949
 We do not want that because if the 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.759
 We simply can not go away 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.699
 keep going 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:11.380
 say we want to change it 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:13.150
 the quality we want the line up 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.710
 someone from very high start confessed 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.520
 We also want to continue art 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.650
 Remove 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.319
 We absolutely want the breath of the four 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.319
 weeks ahead even stronger 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:26.159
 frequent and therefore we give 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:26.159
 just always our best
