really weird I have a matchmaking works

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.170 
really weird I have a matchmaking works
and<00:04:17.979> it's<00:04:18.100> kind<00:04:18.370> of<00:04:18.459> like<00:04:18.609> you're<00:04:18.760> exploiting

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
and it's kind of like you're exploiting

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.670 
and it's kind of like you're exploiting
it<00:04:19.479> by<00:04:19.570> just<00:04:19.720> reading<00:04:19.840> all<00:04:20.049> these<00:04:20.139> lower<00:04:20.380> town

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
it by just reading all these lower town

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.460 
it by just reading all these lower town
halls<00:04:20.950> but<00:04:21.729> it's<00:04:22.150> not<00:04:22.479> exploiting<00:04:23.110> because

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
halls but it's not exploiting because

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.650 
halls but it's not exploiting because
supercell<00:04:24.220> made<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.820> game<00:04:25.030> like<00:04:25.240> this

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
supercell made the game like this

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.090 
supercell made the game like this
and<00:04:25.750> if<00:04:25.870> you<00:04:25.990> can<00:04:26.170> get<00:04:26.320> champions<00:04:26.770> like<00:04:26.890> glute

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
and if you can get champions like glute

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.310 
and if you can get champions like glute
bonus<00:04:27.430> for<00:04:27.580> rating<00:04:27.910> lower<00:04:28.090> townhall's<00:04:28.660> it's

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
bonus for rating lower townhall's it's

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.650 
bonus for rating lower townhall's it's
very<00:04:29.560> easy<00:04:29.800> because<00:04:30.040> it<00:04:30.580> I<00:04:30.850> don't<00:04:31.360> know<00:04:31.480> it's

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
very easy because it I don't know it's

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.780 
very easy because it I don't know it's
hard<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:31.990> explain<00:04:32.260> it's<00:04:33.160> actually<00:04:33.460> easy<00:04:33.640> to

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
hard to explain it's actually easy to

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.930 
hard to explain it's actually easy to
explain<00:04:34.240> I'm<00:04:34.420> just<00:04:34.570> bad<00:04:34.810> at<00:04:34.840> explaining<00:04:35.410> and

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
Snipes but a lot of bases do up Snipes

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.170 
Snipes but a lot of bases do up Snipes
and<00:04:40.660> I<00:04:41.260> had<00:04:41.740> like<00:04:41.920> 1<00:04:42.250> million<00:04:42.550> golden<00:04:43.030> I

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
have seven million add the same amount

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.600 
have seven million add the same amount
of<00:04:46.240> elixir<00:04:46.720> so<00:04:46.900> this<00:04:47.170> is<00:04:47.320> very<00:04:47.680> very<00:04:48.220> good<00:04:48.370> now

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
it's back to my main base this is a base

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.470 
it's back to my main base this is a base
that<00:04:50.650> I<00:04:50.680> use<00:04:50.830> for<00:04:50.980> defense<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:51.580> I'm<00:04:52.210> going<00:04:52.450> to

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
that I use for defense and I'm going to

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.960

actually<00:05:02.470> going<00:05:02.770> to<00:05:02.830> do<00:05:03.070> that<00:05:03.280> now<00:05:03.430> because

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
actually going to do that now because

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.850 
actually going to do that now because
you<00:05:04.150> can<00:05:04.300> upgrade<00:05:04.450> them<00:05:04.750> in<00:05:04.900> walls<00:05:05.290> and<00:05:05.680> that's

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
you can upgrade them in walls and that's

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.590 
you can upgrade them in walls and that's
going<00:05:06.040> to<00:05:06.130> be<00:05:06.190> super<00:05:06.400> cool<00:05:06.760> so<00:05:06.970> wait<00:05:07.270> we<00:05:07.390> watch

townhall 9 but like town I'll tend to
dead<00:05:52.030> base<00:05:52.300> and<00:05:52.600> I<00:05:53.140> kind<00:05:53.380> of<00:05:53.440> just<00:05:53.590> went<00:05:53.710> around

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
dead base and I kind of just went around

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.250 
dead base and I kind of just went around
to<00:05:54.070> my<00:05:54.160> troops<00:05:54.490> and<00:05:54.760> very<00:05:55.330> easy<00:05:55.630> picking<00:05:56.110> off

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
to my troops and very easy picking off

the<00:05:56.440> loot<00:05:56.620> and<00:05:56.770> then<00:05:57.190> this<00:05:57.310> town<00:05:57.550> was<00:05:57.790> pretty

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
the loot and then this town was pretty

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.250 
the loot and then this town was pretty
much<00:05:58.150> outside<00:05:58.540> so<00:05:58.720> I<00:05:58.750> didn't<00:05:58.930> have<00:05:59.050> to<00:05:59.110> worry

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
much outside so I didn't have to worry

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.750 
much outside so I didn't have to worry
about<00:05:59.350> getting<00:05:59.530> 50<00:05:59.919> percents<00:06:00.250> if<00:06:00.340> I<00:06:00.430> was<00:06:00.520> also

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760
