00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.349
 I want to carry out a technical and dry pastel investigation 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.210
 Canson paper an indigo blue I chose 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.579
 the blue info to strive precisely to be able to rework 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.739
 but a lot of light 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.310
 so the drawing 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.649
 I make them before using a pastel pencil 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.040
 then I have 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.590
 what I do 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.269
 with the optional adhesive tape to hake then 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:44.769
 gm he argued 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.520
 from the tiny single 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.879
 this is not obvious 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.040
 I will take 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.690
 an off white naples player agent and way of working 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.290
 portrait 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.130
 by the body 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.170
 so the 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.900
 I will be able to start positioning 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.370
 light games 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.940
 by 13 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.120
 right away men like I have a fund that is relatively trial 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.240
 it's out 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.080
 very very good 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.970
 but as and when 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.590
 trains will have a tendency to disappear 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.270
 as soon as I'm going to hand over others other colors even pass even 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.440
 time away 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.290
 this crazy project 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.100
 m 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.970
 he announced the direct color their main 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.970
 las vegas first on the blue what that gives 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.200
 so they melt 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.299
 with the blog almost because complementary can I 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:48.970
 so I left him there 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.300
 to see how it works 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.730
 how they mix 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.690
 but if I want them to make fire 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.939
 so thankfully 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.980
 hosting disaster victims 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.920
 the foal I do not immediately 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.340
 I am just a few colors 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.430
 to be able to work serenely the mare otherwise if I mix the two I 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.320
 will have a merger of two dead at least we will finally find me 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.569
 so here now I'm going 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.649
 I ask him how we take a red 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:20.929
 which is in place so I advocate Morocco here 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.889
 and I repositioned 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.509
 but no 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:29.270
 we even benefit from drawing some features 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.270
 but for all 6 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.739
 the young foal a little quiet for the moment 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:47.169
 the first reactor 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:50.510
 a set up with the three basic percent colors 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:55.039
 now play pro in the office to give a little more 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.459
 of heat because I had the day to mark really very hard 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.769
 I'm going strong with another so there I am all at once in the light 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:05.419
 the front of tablets 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:09.419
 vork overlap 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.159
 that's the case to say 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.559
 phthalates 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:16.299
 so there now 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.459
 I will give a little more fishing will ensure that it's going 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.209
 give 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.279
 so I'm going back 

00:03:23.279 --> 00:03:26.429
 with black 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:30.339
 so here I started with a place more during the show at all this is the 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:31.419
 tail 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.419
 she immediately has her sisters 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.959
 but I'm careful if you do not fall into the trap 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.799
 from all fronts 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.799
 I let the blue of the paper come 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:46.279
 monclar 

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:48.069
 but I will resume 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.939
 my first basic color 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:51.519
 with the newspaper 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.199
 I want to be very little 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.199
 he's mostly used the arm after over 

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:59.339
 so the joc 

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:02.769
 I'm going to look for a few more good still through a milking system 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.499
 I am a little detail 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:07.789
 muscles 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.659
 now I'm going to pick up all the colors I had at the beginning of 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:11.569
 millennium 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:12.420
 and I will 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.849
 practically finish 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.849
 the mare behind by this affair 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.959
 so now% and better vision 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.709
 as I'm still tall enough 

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:26.520
 finish 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.780
 the horse the gold mare putting me up so there now I really have the 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.999
 basic technique that has been demonstrated 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:36.349
 what everyone is treated the same way 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.159
 now that I can give a little more dynamism and a little 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:41.650
 modernity is still long 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.099
 with rates when we do not see 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.889
 what about words blues 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.199
 so that gives me a little bit more volume decline 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.259
 we feel a little bit of the art of the reality of things 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.349
 the mother what I want to do is show how we can give a little 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.379
 very light decoration compared to the composition of hens knees 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.430
 so the season the composition 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.430
 you are now the stations is over 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.680
 of course with always a little back you can come back with one eye 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.970
 again a few days after for general always ends up small 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:27.430
 lights what are we talking about 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.050
 affi n'guessan france 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.220
 to the mound when you could see him like that he said 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.150
 begins to be always important 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.780
 instead of looking each time this puzzle 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.860
 when I finished my studies here 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.479
 Nicolas Sarkozy 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.519
 you will find united remains only six months
