pretty ridiculous you know fours
timeframe<00:02:42.330> but<00:02:42.510> hey<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.840> was<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.110> early<00:02:43.350> 2000s

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
timeframe but hey it was the early 2000s

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.979 
timeframe but hey it was the early 2000s
when<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.459> animate<00:02:44.940> boom<00:02:45.239> was<00:02:45.540> pretty<00:02:45.810> much

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989
