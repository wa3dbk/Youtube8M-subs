00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.450
 Please, tell me my name and mine and before 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.219
 To start this video, I wanted to thank 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.570
 all of you for the more than 15 thousand 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.539
 views we had on our 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:23.960
 first video and now you're in the 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:26.840
 more reviews and today we will talk about 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.500
 keyboard with a thirst for marriage 60 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.180
 the ca 60 is perfect for fps games 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.129
 it is a keyboard for people who do not 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.870
 want to spend a lot but want a good 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.789
 keyboard and believe it will 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.859
 surprise the quality of construction 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:42.319
 of the series' keyboards sells itself 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:43.760
 remains very solid and in the case of this 60 

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:46.129
 is no different 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.039
 the structure of the ca 60 is made of aluminum 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.229
 which brings a very beautiful design it 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.850
 it is also very compact which is very 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:53.600
 good for those who do not have much space in 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.239
 your table 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.239
 the mechanics used on the shift keys 60 is 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.639
 the mrl or red chery Apartments 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.559
 beer that has a specific design 

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:05.119
 to be used in games and is not so 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.400
 suitable for typing 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.380
 the keys are also not so noisy 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.540
 as on most mechanical keyboards 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.340
 are completely linear and require 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.700
 very little pressure to register the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.500
 perfect fps gaming controls where 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.720
 keys are often used to 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.340
 the exchange of arms and all kinds of 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.610
 character movements 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.860
 the keys wa sd the doctors from one to six 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.410
 and the space bar has a surface 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.380
 possible to slide your finger in the case of 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.540
 wsd and numeric keys have curves 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.670
 to prevent slipping and makes it easier to 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.740
 unification of the keys the keyboard also 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.750
 has multimedia volume control keys 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.010
 which is how I exclude what most 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.930
 people will like 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.640
 and also has the windows locke key that 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.890
 lock the windows key to avoid 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.320
 during the game he has a 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.600
 wrist rest that serves as rest 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.730
 the hand and also as a deposit of the 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.250
 keys with different textures and colors 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.650
 inside it contains a part to remove 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.450
 the keyboard can be 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.820
 four tripods but this can lead to 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.190
 keyboard to slide a little, which can 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.840
 be uncomfortable i recommend using it 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.280
 only build back peace dare without 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.569
 no kind is what will leave more 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.640
 steady on the table 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.920
 the keyboard cable is covered with on the li 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.200
 which helps to maintain the good condition of it 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.140
 is powered by two usb what is 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.060
 compensated with the usb ramp behind 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:28.420
 the keyboard which will compensate the use 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:30.910
 Of these two guys, I think it's 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.740
 the K60 keyboard will tighten 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.130
 their price range with these technologies 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.980
 of old where you can squeeze more 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.990
 the belt is is up to 20 keys at a time without 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.030
 any problem of the keyboard to 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.160
 or your people is a program or 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.630
 game is not to know the commands that he 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.330
 you can invent 20 keys 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.489
 northeast and they will be known even 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.840
 Telling time is very cool and 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.209
 I also really liked these techniques 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.800
 used it for you to play what 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.580
 It helped a lot of this game and liked to 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.140
 damn it 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.390
 today it is enough also in the multimedia keys 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.920
 of them are very compact never wanted to be 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.489
 Father will not also work on your 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.440
 game is this land pilot in douz you 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.390
 tired of these two of them here on windows 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.580
 so much that for having an accident in the 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.620
 game and eventually minimized the standard game 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.140
 is shooting someone in the game of course 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.630
 and I think this keyboard only 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.090
 should have an illumination that she 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.120
 would be much more to this keyboard and the 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.799
 who would leave it but is introduced to 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.380
 public the general picture of the 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.920
 market today has compact design is 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:36.610
 with baby and metal the case at least as 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.670
 It's very beautiful, and so is yours. 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.070
 ruby door here sbt also played 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.450
 very cool, I already have to make up 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.320
 the two acb it consumes from 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.820
 computer 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.680

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.630
