00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:11.049
 lipsky 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.249
 the two cities 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.249
 ohl has closed the efe lorica project 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.460
 your friends is human being wrong 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.559
 but that phrase is meaningless when you miss the chance to make yourself 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.740
 rich or to become richer than she in this 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.820
 At destination you can move the worst mistakes in history 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.030
 the internet we are talking 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.420
 generally they are a company that is something that they have not bought at the time 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.340
 little things that looked like ingushes and ended up billing millions 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.870
 For example, you are not 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.060
 it's going to cost you 2 190 million 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.980
 and dialogue with the representatives I do not buy it 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.470
 and now that social network generates at least 10 billion dollars 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.500
 although they say that the worst mistake of all has been when so voracious merged with 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.550
 geo the bread as well as the 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.690
 everything so that fear will stop receiving 140 billion because of evil 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.000
 US service but the thing does not end there 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.480
 they say that 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.930
 the most serious leg measure of all has been 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.860
 It has been a day of the year 2001 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.920
 when he already played he was about to buy last he did 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.369
 and now the opposite of 100 billion dollars at least 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.120
 and come in rest 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.120
 there were llamas for sale 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.680
 I'm not going to say typical that a powerful radio signal amazed the 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.760
 astronomers of the bÃ¡rcena austral radio telescope 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.000
 It turns out that this signal was treated about six years ago 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.180
 but nobody pay attention because they thought it was of terrestrial origin 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.550
 something coming from very far could not be so powerful 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.500
 however the binner student that vick 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.590
 reviewing the files found that it actually came from space 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.760
 outside thousands or millions of light years away 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.400
 and that would have the equivalent power to the shock of two neutron stars 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.739
 before a galactic explosion 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:14.809
 However 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.929
 without the signal like this will result over there 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:21.729
 come from an extraterrestrial civilization in danger and requesting 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:23.759
 helps for something that happens they do 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:25.939
 a lot of time in a distant galaxy 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.009
 very far 

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.009
 but friends that in those people has arrived very late 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:39.759
 October sdc is planning to fly a fighter designed by Andy Warhol himself and his 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:43.589
 equipment which uses solid fuel is six meters long 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:44.519
 little more 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.519
 and also has good crawfish lobsters 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:49.889
 common the switch 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.089
 that we have seen in my moments worried 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:55.099
 because just state of legal chess jb 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:58.539
 and there comes his name 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:59.769
 World's number one 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.519
 at the Battle of Miami the wounded four of Star Wars 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:06.889
 honestly they make it awesome 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.889
 the launch of the plane does not guarantee what to do 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:15.209
 and that was also the room will be deployed by remote control efe 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:19.089
 Be sure 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:24.949
 some psoe deputies 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:28.249
 according to the fantasy of any fanatical year 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.249
 and if you market these insurance and happy 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.449
 later 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:38.269
 I'm not going to quote a nipple, you can not do anything else from people back 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.129
 he did lucky in the handling of 10 20 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.089
 one 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:49.259
 The Beijing Olympics 2008 represents a challenge for many athletes 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.340
 as for example the French representative in the decathlon competition 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.169
 what 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.169
 yes that is prepared thoroughly 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.270
 if you got to his 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.360
 of london 2012 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.360
 I suspect the scree 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.550
 p 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:57.999
 axis
