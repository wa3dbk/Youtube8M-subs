dropping<00:01:57.480> the<00:01:57.660> bottom<00:01:57.990> one<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:59.060> replacing<00:02:00.060> it

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
dropping the bottom one and replacing it

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.730 
dropping the bottom one and replacing it
with<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.450> fresh<00:02:00.780> piece<00:02:01.050> of<00:02:01.110> hair<00:02:01.440> from<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
with a fresh piece of hair from the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.670 
with a fresh piece of hair from the
bottom<00:02:02.570> so<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.750> creates<00:02:04.050> this<00:02:04.170> really<00:02:04.260> nice

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
bottom so this creates this really nice

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.950 
bottom so this creates this really nice
waterfall<00:02:05.310> effect<00:02:05.670> because<00:02:06.360> you've<00:02:06.510> got<00:02:06.720> your

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
waterfall effect because you've got your

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.100 
waterfall effect because you've got your
dropping<00:02:07.290> bond<00:02:07.650> each<00:02:07.830> time<00:02:08.100> and<00:02:09.020> getting<00:02:10.020> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
dropping bond each time and getting the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.530 
dropping bond each time and getting the
concept<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.680> this<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.220> quite<00:02:12.030> tricky<00:02:12.300> at<00:02:12.510> first

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
concept to this is quite tricky at first

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.270 
concept to this is quite tricky at first
and<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.140> had<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.440> do<00:02:13.560> quite<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.890> bit<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.100> practice

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
and I had to do quite a bit of practice

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.370 
and I had to do quite a bit of practice
to<00:02:14.730> get<00:02:14.850> this<00:02:15.000> right<00:02:15.270> but<00:02:15.870> once<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.110> get<00:02:16.290> it

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
to get this right but once you get it

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.380 
to get this right but once you get it
right<00:02:16.530> it's<00:02:16.590> really<00:02:17.280> really<00:02:17.490> easy<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.970> it's

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
right it's really really easy and it's

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:28.700 
right it's really really easy and it's
so<00:02:18.930> much<00:02:19.110> fun<00:02:19.320> to<00:02:19.380> do<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.780> as<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.050> can<00:02:28.170> see<00:02:28.440> i'm

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
so much fun to do so as you can see i'm

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.340 
so much fun to do so as you can see i'm
dropping<00:02:29.250> one<00:02:29.690> adding<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.870> fresh<00:02:31.110> piece<00:02:31.290> of

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
dropping one adding a fresh piece of

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.020 
dropping one adding a fresh piece of
hair<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:33.980> then<00:02:34.980> taking<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.460> section<00:02:35.670> from<00:02:35.940> the

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
hair and then taking a section from the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.850 
hair and then taking a section from the
back<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.710> incorporating<00:02:37.710> that<00:02:37.740> and<00:02:39.860> then

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
back and incorporating that and then

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.250 
back and incorporating that and then
dropping<00:02:41.100> one<00:02:41.370> again<00:02:41.840> just<00:02:42.840> keep<00:02:43.020> continuing

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
dropping one again just keep continuing

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.220 
dropping one again just keep continuing
this<00:02:43.890> process<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:45.330> here's<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.630> close-up<00:02:45.870> for

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
this process so here's a close-up for

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.680 
this process so here's a close-up for
you<00:02:46.410> i'm<00:02:46.590> taking<00:02:47.520> a<00:02:47.730> fresh<00:02:48.120> piece<00:02:48.330> of<00:02:48.390> hair

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
you i'm taking a fresh piece of hair

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.320 
you i'm taking a fresh piece of hair
from<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.930> bottom<00:02:49.880> putting<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:50.910> into<00:02:51.150> the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
from the bottom putting that into the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.930 
from the bottom putting that into the
braid<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.890> taking<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:52.920> section<00:02:53.340> from<00:02:53.850> the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
braid and taking a section from the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.140 
braid and taking a section from the
passing<00:02:54.450> area<00:02:56.870> I'm<00:02:58.460> incorporating<00:02:59.460> that<00:02:59.850> into

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
passing area I'm incorporating that into

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.900 
passing area I'm incorporating that into
the<00:03:00.300> braid<00:03:00.800> then<00:03:01.800> drop<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.190> bottom<00:03:02.489> one<00:03:02.670> and

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
the braid then drop the bottom one and

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.150 
the braid then drop the bottom one and
add<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:03.900> fresh<00:03:04.140> piece<00:03:04.290> of<00:03:04.440> hair

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.460 

so<00:03:09.160> once<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.519> get<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.879> end<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.379> to<00:03:11.379> the

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
so once you get to the end and to the

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.410 
so once you get to the end and to the
back<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.800> head<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.340> can<00:03:12.550> finish<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.330> off

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
back of the head you can finish it off

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.100 
back of the head you can finish it off
by<00:03:13.450> patting<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:15.690> adding<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.720> thief<00:03:16.959> or

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
by patting it and adding a thief or

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.900 
by patting it and adding a thief or
elastic<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:20.040> we'll<00:03:21.040> just<00:03:21.160> leave<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.459> until

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
elastic and we'll just leave that until

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.430 
elastic and we'll just leave that until
later<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:23.680> then<00:03:23.739> we'll<00:03:24.010> tie<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.250> in<00:03:24.580> to<00:03:25.440> finish

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
later and then we'll tie it in to finish

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.089 
later and then we'll tie it in to finish
off<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.709> hairstyle<00:03:27.220> oh<00:03:28.739> so<00:03:29.739> that's<00:03:29.860> what<00:03:30.069> it

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
off the hairstyle oh so that's what it

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.199 
off the hairstyle oh so that's what it
should<00:03:30.190> look<00:03:30.340> like<00:03:31.560> once<00:03:32.560> you've<00:03:32.830> finished<00:03:33.209> so

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
should look like once you've finished so

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.900 
should look like once you've finished so
all<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.569> drop<00:03:34.780> one's<00:03:35.019> hang<00:03:35.319> down<00:03:35.819> and<00:03:36.819> then

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
all the drop one's hang down and then

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:44.220 
all the drop one's hang down and then
we'll<00:03:37.000> do<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.209> other<00:03:37.239> side<00:03:42.420> so<00:03:43.420> take<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.049> same

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
we'll do the other side so take the same

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.850 
we'll do the other side so take the same
section<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.769> hair

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.960 

same<00:03:49.860> class<00:03:50.069> section<00:03:50.459> as<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:50.670> did<00:03:50.790> on<00:03:50.879> the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
same class section as you did on the

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.080 
same class section as you did on the
other<00:03:51.060> side<00:03:51.390> and<00:03:52.280> then<00:03:53.280> divide<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:53.670> into

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
other side and then divide that into

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.000 
other side and then divide that into
three<00:03:54.540> again<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:58.110> you're<00:03:58.349> doing<00:03:58.439> exactly<00:03:58.620> the

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
three again and you're doing exactly the

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.559 
three again and you're doing exactly the
same<00:03:59.040> thing<00:03:59.430> but<00:03:59.790> just<00:04:00.000> on<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.180> other<00:04:00.299> side<00:04:00.390> of

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
same thing but just on the other side of

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.300 
same thing but just on the other side of
your<00:04:00.780> head<00:04:00.930> so<00:04:01.319> once<00:04:01.500> you've<00:04:01.680> finished<00:04:01.860> the

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
your head so once you've finished the

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.890 
your head so once you've finished the
braid<00:04:02.640> on<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.879> other<00:04:03.000> side<00:04:03.209> of<00:04:03.239> your<00:04:03.480> head<00:04:03.629> and

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
braid on the other side of your head and

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.649 
braid on the other side of your head and
plat<00:04:04.890> it<00:04:05.040> down<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.250> little<00:04:05.459> bit<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:05.879> tie<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.480> off

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
plat it down a little bit and tie it off

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.050 
plat it down a little bit and tie it off
with<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:06.959> c4<00:04:07.440> elastic<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.280> then<00:04:08.489> from<00:04:08.940> the

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
with a c4 elastic and then from the

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.250 
with a c4 elastic and then from the
front<00:04:09.299> you<00:04:09.480> should<00:04:09.659> have<00:04:09.810> something<00:04:10.079> that

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
front you should have something that

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.119 
front you should have something that
looks<00:04:10.379> like<00:04:10.620> this<00:04:10.739> oh<00:04:12.650> you've<00:04:13.650> got<00:04:13.769> these<00:04:13.920> two

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
looks like this oh you've got these two

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.819 
looks like this oh you've got these two
sections<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:15.139> but<00:04:16.139> we<00:04:16.260> want<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:16.590> basically

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
sections and but we want to basically

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.029 
sections and but we want to basically
just<00:04:17.570> reincorporate<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:19.440> bit<00:04:19.650> of<00:04:19.769> hair

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
just reincorporate this bit of hair

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:28.040 
just reincorporate this bit of hair
that's<00:04:20.310> left<00:04:21.260> into<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.830> braid<00:04:25.190> so<00:04:26.720> I'm<00:04:27.720> do

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
that's left into the braid so I'm do
