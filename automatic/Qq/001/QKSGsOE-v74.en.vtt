00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
to propel them to go forward and I find

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.979 
to propel them to go forward and I find
that<00:00:37.290> really<00:00:38.160> absolutely<00:00:38.700> one<00:00:39.149> I've<00:00:39.809> met

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
that really absolutely one I've met

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.970 
that really absolutely one I've met
students<00:00:40.350> from<00:00:40.500> Japan<00:00:40.710> from<00:00:41.309> Mexico<00:00:41.940> from

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
students from Japan from Mexico from

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.340 
students from Japan from Mexico from
India<00:00:43.980> from<00:00:44.370> all<00:00:44.610> sorts<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.149> places<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.840> I

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
India from all sorts of places and I

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.500 
India from all sorts of places and I
think<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.010> becomes<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.789> its<00:00:47.940> own<00:00:48.239> way

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
think that that becomes in its own way

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.660 
think that that becomes in its own way
across<00:00:48.930> because<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.950> students<00:00:50.399> cross

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
across because the students cross

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.209 
across because the students cross
pollinate<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:52.170> they<00:00:52.320> cross<00:00:52.620> pollinate

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
pollinate and as they cross pollinate

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.680 
pollinate and as they cross pollinate
they<00:00:53.399> begin<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.760> talk<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.180> each<00:00:54.329> other<00:00:54.510> they

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
they begin to talk to each other they

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.450 
they begin to talk to each other they
begin<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.050> see<00:00:55.260> things<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.250> world

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
begin to see things and the world

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.889 
begin to see things and the world
becomes<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.850> better<00:00:56.969> place<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:57.780> all<00:00:57.840> of

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
I think one of the things that is

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.009 
I think one of the things that is
absolutely<00:02:41.879> extraordinary<00:02:42.090> about<00:02:42.780> Brooks

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019
