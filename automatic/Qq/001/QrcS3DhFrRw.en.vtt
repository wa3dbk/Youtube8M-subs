reasons our body needs salt

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.940 
reasons our body needs salt
so<00:02:14.159> let's<00:02:14.340> talk<00:02:14.519> about<00:02:14.579> salt<00:02:15.239> storage<00:02:15.950> how

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
so let's talk about salt storage how

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.740 
so let's talk about salt storage how
much<00:02:17.159> should<00:02:17.370> we<00:02:17.519> store<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.090> what<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.599> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
much should we store and what is the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.970 
much should we store and what is the
best<00:02:18.900> way<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.170> store<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:21.420> amount<00:02:21.980> figure

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:34.510 
storage I can easily take out a packet
okay<00:04:25.820> so<00:04:27.220> see<00:04:28.220> if<00:04:28.340> I<00:04:28.460> kept<00:04:28.820> this<00:04:33.040> ended<00:04:34.040> up<00:04:34.190> with

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
okay so see if I kept this ended up with

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.740 
okay so see if I kept this ended up with
seven<00:04:34.880> four<00:04:35.420> pound<00:04:35.720> packages<00:04:36.410> in<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.620> six

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
seven four pound packages in the six

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.140 
seven four pound packages in the six
pound<00:04:38.750> bucket<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.380> so<00:04:39.770> if<00:04:40.010> we<00:04:40.130> have<00:04:40.250> 28<00:04:40.610> pounds

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
pound bucket and so if we have 28 pounds

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.050 
pound bucket and so if we have 28 pounds
of<00:04:41.270> salt<00:04:42.160> so<00:04:43.160> that's<00:04:43.370> enough<00:04:43.640> for<00:04:43.850> one<00:04:44.030> person

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
of salt so that's enough for one person

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.230 
of salt so that's enough for one person
for<00:04:44.690> over<00:04:44.900> five<00:04:45.170> years<00:04:45.760> now<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:46.820> other<00:04:47.000> thing

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
for over five years now the other thing

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.680 
for over five years now the other thing
I<00:04:47.390> do<00:04:47.450> is<00:04:47.900> add<00:04:48.410> some<00:04:48.860> rice<00:04:49.760> just<00:04:50.090> in<00:04:50.270> case<00:04:50.480> it

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
I do is add some rice just in case it

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.480 
I do is add some rice just in case it
gets<00:04:50.780> moisture<00:04:51.320> in<00:04:51.410> this<00:04:51.530> will<00:04:51.710> absorb<00:04:52.100> it<00:04:52.340> and

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
gets moisture in this will absorb it and

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.090 
gets moisture in this will absorb it and
I<00:04:52.910> take<00:04:53.150> a<00:04:53.180> package<00:04:53.660> of<00:04:53.810> rice<00:04:53.990> and<00:04:54.230> I<00:04:54.800> poke

holes<00:04:55.490> in<00:04:55.790> it<00:04:55.940> and<00:04:56.750> that<00:04:57.680> way<00:04:57.830> most<00:04:58.010> of<00:04:58.130> the

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
holes in it and that way most of the

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.710 
holes in it and that way most of the
rice<00:04:58.370> stays<00:04:58.640> in<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:58.910> package<00:04:59.360> but<00:04:59.600> would

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
rice stays in the package but would

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.810 
rice stays in the package but would
still<00:04:59.840> absorb<00:05:00.380> any<00:05:00.590> moisture<00:05:00.800> and<00:05:01.280> when<00:05:01.790> I

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
still absorb any moisture and when I

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.420 
still absorb any moisture and when I
want<00:05:02.150> to<00:05:02.270> take<00:05:02.450> out<00:05:02.690> a<00:05:02.960> package<00:05:03.620> of<00:05:03.770> salt<00:05:04.010> I<00:05:04.190> can
