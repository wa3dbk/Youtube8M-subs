this<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.500> USB<00:00:43.860> hope<00:00:44.539> that<00:00:45.539> was<00:00:45.690> used<00:00:46.309> that

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
this is the USB hope that was used that

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.990 
this is the USB hope that was used that
formalised<00:00:48.180> blade<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:50.239> fibers<00:00:52.610> as<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.789> see
