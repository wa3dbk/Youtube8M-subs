00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:19.320
 how and what varnish to cover the pictures well 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:22.210
 firstly if the picture is not fresh and already 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.540
 few years or passed at this time you 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:30.970
 it just needs to be protected by external 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:35.129
 Impacts need to spend the world of course 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:38.289
 layer on the first processing i.e. 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.980
 have to primer first he fortify 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.839
 this picture 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:49.089
 secondly it will serve to communicate 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:52.149
 a layer of varnish with a colorful layer here is the second 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:56.249
 important moment to be 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:01:00.670
 consider and then on what basis 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:04.630
 those paints that we made pictures 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:08.500
 if water based paints and i 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.830
 would recommend taking this phthalic blessings 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.830
 or 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.000
 some other with us that is if 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.820
 paint 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.780
 paints pentaphthalic oil take fret 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.810
 water based 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:35.510
 if water based paints take good 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:39.500
 on it any of 0 it is necessary in order 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:42.200
 so that the varnish does not raise it 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.380
 and was not one with 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.040
 colorful layer because with time 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.310
 multiple foot and harden and 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.760
 peel off 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.310
 and if it will be 1 slade base on with 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.960
 paint can match what 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:05.170
 along with the paint peel off in order 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.170
 to make a lacquer film firmly 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.960
 the most durable I would advise 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:18.230
 the carrier is not a few layers and 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.950
 each new layer I spent was different 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.910
 a dream, that is, here we are 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.220
 surface let's say oil paint we 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.220
 put on her 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.220
 maces 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:41.380
 on this phthal base then after 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:46.420
 drying we apply varnish on acrylic 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:50.490
 basis we as a control word can 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:54.220
 one more make your drinks whether you 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:57.160
 it turns out a kind of triplex such 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.810
 Triplex is very durable it stands 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.610
 ultraviolet light, it can withstand any 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:09.780
 precipitation and is able to protect 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.780
 the picture is powerful enough 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.700
 physical effects the only thing 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:23.470
 need to remember with this application 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:28.180
 three layers of varnish that its thickness does not 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:34.480
 should be thick enough 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:37.560
 that a thick layer of varnish will eventually 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.020
 tend to Scacchi I breed varnish 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.560
 thinner is strong enough as 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:48.700
 at least one to one is often the case even 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:53.160
 slurry then makes each layer enough 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:57.840
 thin stage varnish layer is not so 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.820
 thick to bounce over time and 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.130
 peels off 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.830
 importantly the same value have 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:09.040
 glossy or matte varnish for coating 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.620
 paintings and matte varnish are more pleasant 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.420
 for the audience but because it feels 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:20.290
 brik and surface looks flat 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:24.240
 matte and velvety 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:28.630
 but at the same time matt varnish and made colors 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:33.790
 as if a little pale brings together 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:36.030
 shades and does not contribute to the brightness of color 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:41.020
 if you want to keep the brightness 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.960
 Of course you need to use glossy for 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.169
 blossomed 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.449
 but at the same time I would not use 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.880
 look your way on the surface which 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:53.330
 has irregularities 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.340
 because the bumps will 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:03.160
 promote glare 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:06.410
 to obstruct perception 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:11.800
 just take a picture of the mistake and the picture 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.800
 it will be very difficult to publish flare
