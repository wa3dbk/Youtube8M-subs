but by the gremlin mine although I

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.560 
but by the gremlin mine although I

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.690 

kind<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.350> know<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.710> kind<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:36.440> as<00:00:37.440> dumb<00:00:38.430> as<00:00:38.460> this

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
kind of know I kind of as dumb as this

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.979 
kind of know I kind of as dumb as this
sounds<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.120> don't<00:00:39.270> like<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.600> don't<00:00:39.840> know<00:00:39.899> which

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
sounds I don't like I don't know which

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.970 
sounds I don't like I don't know which
one<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.170> these<00:00:40.260> I'd<00:00:40.379> rather<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:43.770> two

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
one of these I'd rather have the two

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.600 
one of these I'd rather have the two
drop<00:00:44.190> or<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> six<00:00:44.760> trap<00:00:45.920> is<00:00:46.920> one<00:00:47.219> whichever

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
drop or the six trap is one whichever

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:57.020 
drop or the six trap is one whichever
one<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.879> put<00:00:48.090> out<00:00:48.210> first<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.780> die

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.729 

or<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.300> guess<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.989> could<00:00:58.110> just<00:00:58.230> new<00:00:58.379> get<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.649> then

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
or I guess I could just new get and then

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:14.990 
or I guess I could just new get and then
run<00:00:58.949> them<00:00:59.789> both<00:01:00.059> out<00:01:01.219> even<00:01:02.219> better

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.920 

um

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.020 

I<00:01:19.020> could<00:01:19.590> play<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> wall<00:01:20.160> and<00:01:20.460> then<00:01:20.550> do<00:01:20.700> both

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
I could play the wall and then do both

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.990 
I could play the wall and then do both
things<00:01:21.060> next<00:01:21.690> turn<00:01:21.840> presuming<00:01:22.230> i<00:01:22.320> draw<00:01:22.500> land

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
things next turn presuming i draw land

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.460 
things next turn presuming i draw land
but<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.150> don't<00:01:24.210> draw<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.660> land<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.200> definitely

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
but if I don't draw a land I definitely

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.230 
but if I don't draw a land I definitely
want<00:01:25.800> to<00:01:25.830> get<00:01:25.980> this<00:01:26.100> other<00:01:26.370> creature<00:01:29.240> I'm

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
want to get this other creature I'm

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.760 
want to get this other creature I'm
going<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.480> play<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.660> safe<00:01:30.870> and<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.410> play<00:01:31.650> out

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
going to play it safe and just play out

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.219 
going to play it safe and just play out
the<00:01:31.979> wall<00:01:32.280> oh<00:01:32.610> no<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.240> wall<00:01:33.479> dies<00:01:33.960> in

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the wall oh no because the wall dies in

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.040 
the wall oh no because the wall dies in
conjunction<00:01:34.620> with<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> gremlin<00:01:35.130> mind<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:39.050> if

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
conjunction with the gremlin mind so if

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.200 
conjunction with the gremlin mind so if
I<00:01:40.140> let<00:01:40.290> him<00:01:40.350> on<00:01:40.470> tap<00:01:40.710> he<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.220> save<00:01:41.729> himself<00:01:41.910> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
I let him on tap he can save himself the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.920 
I let him on tap he can save himself the
one<00:01:42.360> life<00:01:44.600> probably<00:01:45.600> does<00:01:45.690> make<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.869> huge

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
one life probably does make a huge

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.100 
one life probably does make a huge
difference<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:47.570> there<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:48.630> go<00:01:48.750> there's<00:01:48.990> one

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
difference but there we go there's one

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:59.520 
difference but there we go there's one
life

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.230 

now<00:02:00.130> he<00:02:00.190> punches<00:02:00.610> me<00:02:00.670> with<00:02:01.180> a<00:02:02.729> crazy<00:02:03.729> artifact

tez roads gambits what it would be I'd
rather<00:03:52.800> have<00:03:52.980> this<00:03:53.069> guy<00:03:53.220> I<00:03:53.250> think<00:03:53.520> although<00:03:54.120> if

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
rather have this guy I think although if

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.100 
rather have this guy I think although if
I<00:03:55.310> get<00:03:56.310> hit<00:03:56.370> with<00:03:56.520> sin<00:03:56.640> removal<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.180> mean<00:03:58.020> either

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
I get hit with sin removal I mean either

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.300 
I get hit with sin removal I mean either
way<00:03:58.260> he's<00:03:58.590> hitting<00:03:58.830> artifact<00:03:59.160> removal<00:04:01.280> be<00:04:02.280> a

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
way he's hitting artifact removal be a

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:25.140 
way he's hitting artifact removal be a
lot<00:04:02.520> worse<00:04:02.640> for<00:04:02.819> me<00:04:02.910> that<00:04:03.060> way

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.510 

alright<00:04:25.780> so<00:04:25.960> he'll<00:04:26.110> die<00:04:26.259> next<00:04:26.530> turn

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
alright so he'll die next turn

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.890 
alright so he'll die next turn
which<00:04:29.090> means<00:04:29.300> he<00:04:29.449> isn't<00:04:29.539> going<00:04:29.720> to<00:04:29.780> bother

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
which means he isn't going to bother

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.790 
which means he isn't going to bother
double<00:04:30.319> blocking<00:04:30.650> this<00:04:30.770> turn<00:04:32.470> so<00:04:33.470> I<00:04:33.500> might<00:04:33.740> as

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
double blocking this turn so I might as

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:44.780 
double blocking this turn so I might as
well<00:04:34.009> tag<00:04:34.220> with<00:04:34.400> him

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.800 

so<00:04:45.330> we<00:04:45.420> get<00:04:45.540> a<00:04:45.570> chump

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
so we get a chump

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.990 
so we get a chump
he<00:04:48.380> takes<00:04:48.620> for<00:04:48.919> I'll<00:04:49.370> play<00:04:50.060> wall<00:04:50.360> I<00:04:52.000> probably

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
he takes for I'll play wall I probably

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.580 
he takes for I'll play wall I probably
should<00:04:53.150> test<00:04:53.419> Mets<00:04:53.570> game<00:04:53.720> at<00:04:53.840> first<00:04:54.110> in<00:04:54.320> case<00:04:54.440> I

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
should test Mets game at first in case I

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:11.940 
should test Mets game at first in case I
draw<00:04:54.740> something<00:04:54.980> better<00:04:55.160> and<00:04:59.830> it<00:05:00.830> seems<00:05:01.040> fine

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:18.320 

so<00:05:12.520> I<00:05:12.580> do<00:05:12.640> lose<00:05:12.910> my<00:05:13.120> deuter<00:05:13.380> and<00:05:15.450> blister<00:05:16.450> Grove

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
so I do lose my deuter and blister Grove

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.700 
so I do lose my deuter and blister Grove
who's<00:05:19.330> aggro<00:05:19.720> now

what did he feel or i can go tangle

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.420 
what did he feel or i can go tangle
english<00:05:26.870> this<00:05:27.080> better<00:05:27.320> or<00:05:27.560> i<00:05:27.950> can<00:05:28.070> play<00:05:28.340> the

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.800 
english this better or i can play the
mere<00:05:28.580> sai<00:05:28.790> are<00:05:28.850> hoping<00:05:29.120> to<00:05:29.270> get<00:05:29.360> metal<00:05:29.600> craft

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
mere sai are hoping to get metal craft

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.860 
mere sai are hoping to get metal craft
and<00:05:30.050> the<00:05:30.950> tangle<00:05:31.250> angular<00:05:31.520> along<00:05:31.790> with<00:05:32.150> him<00:05:32.540> or

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
and the tangle angular along with him or

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.980 
and the tangle angular along with him or
the<00:05:33.230> spare<00:05:33.890> alone<00:05:34.100> with<00:05:34.280> them<00:05:34.370> I<00:05:35.270> think<00:05:35.900> I'd

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
the spare alone with them I think I'd

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:41.550 
the spare alone with them I think I'd
rather<00:05:36.110> start<00:05:36.890> learning<00:05:37.220> things<00:05:37.520> next<00:05:37.820> turn

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.230 

yep

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.779 

I<00:05:47.360> probably<00:05:47.930> should<00:05:48.139> have<00:05:48.169> attacked<00:05:48.380> first

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
I probably should have attacked first

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:55.980 
I probably should have attacked first
it's<00:05:49.789> just<00:05:49.910> going<00:05:50.030> to<00:05:50.060> be<00:05:50.150> the<00:05:50.330> keepers

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.140 

I<00:05:56.050> mean<00:05:56.620> you<00:05:56.710> can<00:05:56.830> double<00:05:57.100> block<00:05:57.280> replica<00:05:57.910> and

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
I mean you can double block replica and

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.650 
I mean you can double block replica and
Refugee<00:05:59.020> our<00:05:59.400> refugee<00:06:00.400> and<00:06:00.550> mir<00:06:00.880> or<00:06:01.060> he'll

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.590 
just jump and his last round our deck
actually<00:06:07.570> seemed<00:06:07.780> like<00:06:07.960> a<00:06:07.990> deck<00:06:09.240> full<00:06:10.240> charge

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.020 

all<00:07:02.410> right<00:07:02.560> so<00:07:02.740> I<00:07:03.070> guess<00:07:03.310> I<00:07:03.520> should<00:07:03.730> be<00:07:03.850> playing

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030 
all right so I guess I should be playing

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.910 
all right so I guess I should be playing
around<00:07:04.210> cerebral<00:07:04.660> eruption<00:07:07.830> suppose<00:07:08.830> I

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:08.920 
around cerebral eruption suppose I

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.140 
around cerebral eruption suppose I

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.150 
really should be playing around cerebral

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.980 
really should be playing around cerebral
eruption<00:07:11.790> I'll<00:07:12.790> where<00:07:12.970> he<00:07:13.060> can<00:07:13.210> just<00:07:13.420> scoop<00:07:13.600> ok

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
eruption I'll where he can just scoop ok
