right now we're just going to do the web

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.209 
right now we're just going to do the web
plug-in<00:00:37.380> because<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.680> don't<00:00:37.800> need<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.980> specify

plug-in because we don't need to specify

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.660 
plug-in because we don't need to specify
any<00:00:38.610> servers<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.930> we'll<00:00:40.230> download<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.890> from

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
any servers so we'll download it from

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.510 
file which is that disk image and so we
can't<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.750> eat<00:01:57.990> check<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.560> by<00:01:58.920> dragging<00:01:59.430> it

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
can't just eat check this by dragging it

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.899 
can't just eat check this by dragging it
down<00:01:59.549> to<00:02:00.000> eject<00:02:00.750> on<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.469> dock<00:02:01.680> or<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.729> can

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
down to eject on to the dock or we can

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.490 
down to eject on to the dock or we can
right-click<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:03.899> click<00:02:04.170> eject

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
right-click on it and just click eject

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.380 
right-click on it and just click eject
and<00:02:04.950> we're<00:02:05.909> done<00:02:06.000> with<00:02:06.060> that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
and we're done with that

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.240 
and we're done with that
so<00:02:06.719> Citrix<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.290> completely<00:02:07.680> installed<00:02:08.039> and

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
so Citrix is completely installed and

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.249 
so Citrix is completely installed and
the<00:02:09.119> only<00:02:09.300> other<00:02:09.420> step<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.690> we<00:02:09.929> need<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.110> do

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
the only other step that we need to do

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.380 
the only other step that we need to do
is<00:02:10.440> make<00:02:10.619> sure<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.280> CAG<00:02:11.670> settings<00:02:12.180> page

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
is make sure that the CAG settings page

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.830 
is make sure that the CAG settings page
is<00:02:12.569> directed<00:02:13.020> to

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
is directed to

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.960 
is directed to
look<00:02:14.380> for<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.770> local<00:02:15.100> client<00:02:15.490> instead<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.850> the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
look for the local client instead of the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.199 
look for the local client instead of the
Java<00:02:16.209> client<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:17.170> so<00:02:17.350> we'll<00:02:17.440> come<00:02:17.680> back<00:02:18.209> we'll

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
Java client and so we'll come back we'll

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.980 
Java client and so we'll come back we'll
go<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.510> CAG<00:02:19.720> page<00:02:20.790> login<00:02:24.300> navigate<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.540> the

go to the CAG page login navigate to the

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.420 
go to the CAG page login navigate to the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
and the client preferences link within

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.370 
and the client preferences link within
and<00:02:30.489> make<00:02:30.819> sure<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.330> we<00:02:31.450> are<00:02:31.600> on<00:02:31.630> local

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
and make sure that we are on local

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.120 
and make sure that we are on local
clients<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:33.550> that<00:02:33.580> we<00:02:33.970> will<00:02:34.150> use<00:02:34.300> Citrix<00:02:34.750> and

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
clients so that we will use Citrix and

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.240 
clients so that we will use Citrix and
this<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.280> what<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.520> will<00:02:36.610> look<00:02:36.670> like<00:02:38.250> when
