and i'm going to show you how to make a

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.600 
and i'm going to show you how to make a
different<00:00:07.849> kind<00:00:07.880> of<00:00:08.059> a<00:00:08.180> bow<00:00:08.330> for<00:00:08.660> you<00:00:08.750> package

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
different kind of a bow for you package

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.770 
different kind of a bow for you package
here<00:00:10.610> we<00:00:10.700> have<00:00:10.850> the<00:00:10.940> same<00:00:11.120> box<00:00:11.360> we<00:00:11.600> just

here we have the same box we just

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.560 
here we have the same box we just
wrapped<00:00:11.990> but<00:00:12.860> I<00:00:12.890> have<00:00:13.130> some<00:00:13.400> thick<00:00:14.180> ribbon

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
wrapped but I have some thick ribbon

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.550 
wrapped but I have some thick ribbon
that's<00:00:15.530> very<00:00:15.980> flat<00:00:16.960> so<00:00:17.960> I'm<00:00:18.080> going<00:00:18.289> to<00:00:18.320> do<00:00:18.439> the

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
that's very flat so I'm going to do the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.640 
that's very flat so I'm going to do the
same<00:00:18.830> kind<00:00:18.860> of<00:00:19.690> wrapping<00:00:20.690> around<00:00:20.810> the<00:00:21.170> box<00:00:21.410> as

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
same kind of wrapping around the box as

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.109 
same kind of wrapping around the box as
I<00:00:21.770> did<00:00:21.949> with<00:00:22.130> the<00:00:22.160> other<00:00:22.460> thin<00:00:23.330> ribbon<00:00:25.000> lay<00:00:26.000> it

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
I did with the other thin ribbon lay it

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.400 
I did with the other thin ribbon lay it
down<00:00:26.440> on<00:00:27.440> the<00:00:27.529> top<00:00:27.740> of<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:27.949> middle<00:00:29.199> flip<00:00:30.199> over

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
down on the top of the middle flip over

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.500 
down on the top of the middle flip over
the<00:00:30.500> box<00:00:33.340> twist<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:34.489> ribbon<00:00:34.640> in<00:00:34.879> the<00:00:34.909> back<00:00:34.999> so

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
the box twist the ribbon in the back so

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.479 
the box twist the ribbon in the back so
it<00:00:35.600> crosses<00:00:36.050> each<00:00:36.199> other<00:00:37.300> pull<00:00:38.300> it<00:00:38.420> tight

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.660 

pull<00:00:56.030> it<00:00:56.150> tight<00:00:56.950> and<00:00:57.950> this<00:00:58.130> is<00:00:58.250> just<00:00:58.430> a<00:00:58.520> regular

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
pull it tight and this is just a regular

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:06.280 
pull it tight and this is just a regular
knot<00:01:04.360> now<00:01:05.360> I'm<00:01:05.420> gonna<00:01:05.540> leave<00:01:05.690> that<00:01:05.720> aside<00:01:05.930> for

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
knot now I'm gonna leave that aside for

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:14.950 
knot now I'm gonna leave that aside for
a<00:01:06.380> minute<00:01:06.590> while<00:01:06.650> I<00:01:06.710> make<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.010> bow<00:01:13.690> okay<00:01:14.690> pull

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
a minute while I make the bow okay pull

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.320 
a minute while I make the bow okay pull
off<00:01:15.140> quite<00:01:15.470> a<00:01:15.500> length<00:01:15.980> of<00:01:16.130> ribbon<00:01:16.340> maybe<00:01:16.730> three

or four feet start with the end in your

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.940 
or four feet start with the end in your
fingers<00:01:20.780> like<00:01:20.990> this<00:01:22.450> pull<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.570> out<00:01:23.920> make<00:01:24.920> a

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
fingers like this pull it out make a

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.840 
fingers like this pull it out make a
loop<00:01:26.170> put<00:01:27.170> put<00:01:27.410> it<00:01:27.500> under<00:01:27.740> your<00:01:27.860> thumb<00:01:28.130> twist

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
loop put put it under your thumb twist

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.300 
loop put put it under your thumb twist
it<00:01:29.060> pull<00:01:29.330> it<00:01:30.260> out<00:01:30.410> and<00:01:30.680> make<00:01:30.740> a<00:01:30.860> loop<00:01:31.070> on<00:01:31.250> the

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
it pull it out and make a loop on the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.560 
it pull it out and make a loop on the
other<00:01:31.400> side<00:01:32.830> twist<00:01:33.830> it<00:01:34.060> and<00:01:35.060> you<00:01:35.119> can<00:01:35.450> make

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
other side twist it and you can make

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.910 
other side twist it and you can make
this<00:01:35.690> as<00:01:35.869> full<00:01:36.200> as<00:01:36.440> you<00:01:36.590> want

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920

this as full as you want
I<00:01:37.010> put<00:01:37.280> usually<00:01:37.640> about<00:01:38.110> five<00:01:39.110> or<00:01:39.260> six<00:01:39.410> loops<00:01:39.710> on

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
I put usually about five or six loops on

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.390 
I put usually about five or six loops on
each<00:01:40.100> side<00:01:40.900> and<00:01:41.900> you<00:01:42.110> can<00:01:42.260> make<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:42.619> loops<00:01:42.950> as

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
each side and you can make the loops as

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.990 
each side and you can make the loops as
big<00:01:44.000> or<00:01:44.270> as<00:01:44.420> small<00:01:44.720> as<00:01:45.200> you<00:01:45.320> want<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:46.000> each

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
big or as small as you want to each

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.359 
big or as small as you want to each
one's<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.450> same<00:01:47.660> now<00:01:47.900> pull<00:01:48.560> it<00:01:48.650> out<00:01:48.830> make<00:01:49.340> a

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
one's the same now pull it out make a

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.850 
one's the same now pull it out make a
loop<00:01:49.750> put<00:01:50.750> it<00:01:50.840> under<00:01:51.080> your<00:01:51.110> thumb<00:01:51.440> and<00:01:51.590> twist

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
loop put it under your thumb and twist

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.740 
loop put it under your thumb and twist
it<00:01:52.040> so<00:01:52.250> you're<00:01:52.400> holding<00:01:52.880> between<00:01:53.300> your<00:01:53.479> thumb

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
it so you're holding between your thumb

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.870 
it so you're holding between your thumb
and<00:01:53.780> your<00:01:54.050> finger<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:55.250> middle<00:01:55.460> of<00:01:55.729> every<00:01:56.000> loop

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
and your finger the middle of every loop

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:08.199 
and your finger the middle of every loop
this<00:01:58.880> takes<00:01:59.150> a<00:01:59.270> little<00:01:59.420> bit<00:01:59.570> of<00:01:59.630> practice

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.000 

now<00:02:09.209> I'm<00:02:09.360> going<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.509> cut<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.869> off<00:02:12.769> and<00:02:13.769> I'm

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
now I'm going to cut this off and I'm

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.089 
now I'm going to cut this off and I'm
going<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.190> take<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.370> smaller<00:02:14.760> piece<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.180> ribbon

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
going to take a smaller piece of ribbon

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.160 
going to take a smaller piece of ribbon
and<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.580> tie<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.910> center<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.750> all<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
and this is to tie the center of all the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:31.000 
and this is to tie the center of all the
loops<00:02:19.769> together

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.140 

and<00:02:31.970> pull<00:02:32.209> that<00:02:32.360> really<00:02:32.720> tight<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:34.700> I'm<00:02:34.909> going

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
and pull that really tight and I'm going

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.759 
and pull that really tight and I'm going
to<00:02:35.180> make<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.390> double<00:02:35.569> nut

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.820 

now<00:02:39.769> just<00:02:40.040> play<00:02:40.250> with<00:02:40.370> it<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.549> little<00:02:40.700> bit<00:02:40.940> until

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
now just play with it a little bit until

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.509 
now just play with it a little bit until
all<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.010> loops<00:02:43.280> are<00:02:44.000> pretty<00:02:45.159> and<00:02:46.159> you<00:02:46.340> have<00:02:46.489> a

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
all the loops are pretty and you have a

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.720 
all the loops are pretty and you have a
ribbon<00:02:46.940> at<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.239> top<00:02:47.330> of<00:02:47.599> your<00:02:47.660> box<00:02:48.549> now<00:02:49.549> I'm

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
ribbon at the top of your box now I'm

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.140 
ribbon at the top of your box now I'm
just<00:02:49.879> going<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.090> tie<00:02:50.299> that<00:02:50.330> on<00:02:51.640> or<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:52.940> can

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
just going to tie that on or you can

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.890 
just going to tie that on or you can
just<00:02:53.360> use<00:02:53.599> a<00:02:53.930> piece<00:02:54.170> of<00:02:54.230> tape<00:02:55.569> fold<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.720> tape
