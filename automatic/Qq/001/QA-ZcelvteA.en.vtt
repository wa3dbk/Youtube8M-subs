and<00:04:18.769> getting<00:04:19.769> down<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.340> hill<00:04:20.489> hmm<00:04:22.100> so<00:04:23.100> check

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
and getting down the hill hmm so check

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:33.800 
and getting down the hill hmm so check
that<00:04:23.310> out<00:04:23.460> that's<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:23.970> price

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.430 

so<00:04:34.380> just<00:04:34.560> keep<00:04:34.710> slowly

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.530 

take<00:04:38.440> any<00:04:38.650> time<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:39.669> radar<00:04:39.970> result<00:04:40.240> if<00:04:40.480> the

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
take any time the radar result if the

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.520 
take any time the radar result if the
radar<00:04:41.320> was<00:04:41.470> kind<00:04:41.650> of<00:04:41.680> weird<00:04:41.919> on<00:04:42.040> this<00:04:42.160> one<00:04:42.370> it

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
radar was kind of weird on this one it

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.800 
radar was kind of weird on this one it
it<00:04:44.530> seems<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:44.830> be<00:04:44.919> much<00:04:45.100> more<00:04:45.160> zoom<00:04:45.729> out<00:04:45.940> than

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
it seems to be much more zoom out than

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.500 
it seems to be much more zoom out than
it<00:04:46.930> normally<00:04:47.020> is<00:04:47.460> like<00:04:48.460> on<00:04:48.610> multiplayer<00:04:49.419> or

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
it normally is like on multiplayer or

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.810 
it normally is like on multiplayer or
anything<00:04:50.380> like<00:04:50.560> you<00:04:51.160> know<00:04:51.250> that<00:04:51.460> red<00:04:51.639> dot

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
anything like you know that red dot

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.420 
anything like you know that red dot
looks<00:04:52.210> very<00:04:52.600> close<00:04:52.960> he's<00:04:53.650> actually<00:04:53.860> not<00:04:54.190> too

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
looks very close he's actually not too

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.800 
looks very close he's actually not too
close<00:04:54.699> and<00:04:55.630> it<00:04:56.260> just<00:04:56.290> felt<00:04:56.590> a<00:04:56.650> little<00:04:56.680> bit

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
close and it just felt a little bit

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.320 
close and it just felt a little bit
harder<00:04:58.860> different<00:04:59.860> to<00:05:00.040> joke<00:05:00.340> where<00:05:00.850> where<00:05:01.300> is

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
harder different to joke where where is

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.210 
harder different to joke where where is
ya<00:05:01.840> like<00:05:02.139> you<00:05:02.320> think<00:05:02.620> that<00:05:02.800> that<00:05:02.979> red

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
ya like you think that that red

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.800 
ya like you think that that red
knowledge<00:05:03.580> is<00:05:03.699> pinpointing<00:05:04.449> on<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:04.630> map

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
knowledge is pinpointing on the map

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.510 
knowledge is pinpointing on the map
considering<00:05:05.410> how<00:05:05.470> close<00:05:05.650> in<00:05:05.919> one<00:05:06.070> spot<00:05:06.310> it's

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
considering how close in one spot it's

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.129 
considering how close in one spot it's
just<00:05:06.669> it's<00:05:07.180> harder<00:05:07.449> to<00:05:07.479> judge<00:05:07.630> on<00:05:07.990> this

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
just it's harder to judge on this

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:15.980 
just it's harder to judge on this
mattress<00:05:08.350> or<00:05:08.650> even

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.600 

every<00:05:16.650> fucker<00:05:17.180> goes<00:05:18.180> to<00:05:18.680> so<00:05:19.680> one<00:05:19.710> good<00:05:20.400> shot

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
every fucker goes to so one good shot

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.320 
every fucker goes to so one good shot
one<00:05:20.820> kill<00:05:21.260> what<00:05:22.260> about<00:05:22.350> face<00:05:22.680> shot

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
one kill what about face shot

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.790 
one kill what about face shot
what<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:26.310> helmets<00:05:26.610> advice<00:05:26.939> was<00:05:27.240> to<00:05:27.419> all<00:05:27.569> I<00:05:27.870> am

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
what the helmets advice was to all I am

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.129 
what the helmets advice was to all I am
gotten<00:05:29.189> close<00:05:29.400> enough<00:05:29.430> to<00:05:29.819> its<00:05:29.939> minute

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:45.850 

stink

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.690 

so<00:05:46.460> we're<00:05:46.550> getting<00:05:46.759> real<00:05:46.909> close<00:05:46.939> to<00:05:47.360> the<00:05:47.449> Intel

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
so we're getting real close to the Intel

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.270 
so we're getting real close to the Intel
don't<00:05:49.390> pick<00:05:49.870> up<00:05:49.990> the<00:05:50.050> intelligence<00:05:50.770> get<00:05:51.040> to<00:05:51.160> it

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
don't pick up the intelligence get to it

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.820 
don't pick up the intelligence get to it
this<00:05:51.430> usually<00:05:51.880> four<00:05:52.750> or<00:05:52.870> five<00:05:53.050> guys<00:05:53.290> kind<00:05:53.740> of

optimism<00:06:06.630> no<00:06:07.890> no<00:06:09.420> that's<00:06:10.420> just<00:06:10.600> what<00:06:10.780> it's

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
optimism no no that's just what it's

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:20.420 
called
not<00:06:12.890> achieve<00:06:13.430> anything<00:06:13.910> breaking<00:06:14.450> up

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.890 

so<00:06:21.430> this<00:06:21.879> is<00:06:21.909> like<00:06:22.180> the<00:06:22.330> easiest<00:06:22.449> way<00:06:22.719> to<00:06:22.780> get

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
so this is like the easiest way to get

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.450 
so this is like the easiest way to get
to<00:06:22.960> the<00:06:23.229> info<00:06:23.530> but<00:06:23.800> on<00:06:23.949> the<00:06:24.039> other<00:06:24.129> side<00:06:24.430> of
