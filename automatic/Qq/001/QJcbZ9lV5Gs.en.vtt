well<00:01:49.369> these<00:01:49.520> concrete<00:01:49.880> ships<00:01:50.440> they're

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
well these concrete ships they're

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.430 
well these concrete ships they're
temporary<00:01:52.039> emergency<00:01:52.759> built<00:01:53.509> world<00:01:53.899> war<00:01:54.170> ii

temporary emergency built world war ii

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.270 
temporary emergency built world war ii
ships<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:56.229> they<00:01:57.229> weren't<00:01:57.500> expected<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.069> last

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
ships and they weren't expected to last

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.249 
ships and they weren't expected to last
this<00:01:58.550> long<00:01:58.789> and<00:01:59.060> they're<00:01:59.240> incredibly<00:01:59.899> durable

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
this long and they're incredibly durable

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.440 
this long and they're incredibly durable
yeah<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:01.220> they<00:02:01.369> made<00:02:01.580> them<00:02:01.819> more<00:02:02.119> or<00:02:02.300> less

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
yeah so they made them more or less

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.780 
yeah so they made them more or less
because<00:02:02.720> they<00:02:02.840> did<00:02:02.990> not<00:02:03.020> steal

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
because they did not steal

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.150 
because they did not steal
well<00:02:04.360> steel<00:02:04.780> is<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:04.990> valuable<00:02:05.440> work<00:02:05.620> commodity

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
well steel is a valuable work commodity

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.770 
well steel is a valuable work commodity
and<00:02:06.250> they<00:02:06.340> could<00:02:06.520> build<00:02:06.670> they<00:02:07.060> built<00:02:07.330> concrete

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
and they could build they built concrete

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.660

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
ships in World War one they built him

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.300
