00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
to use for your chain it just depends on

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.080 
to use for your chain it just depends on
how<00:00:57.350> wide<00:00:57.590> you<00:00:57.860> would<00:00:57.980> like<00:00:58.190> your<00:00:58.400> belt<00:00:58.640> to<00:00:58.910> be

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.500 
now I'm going to give you a few options
of<00:02:29.600> how<00:02:30.050> you<00:02:30.110> can<00:02:30.440> have<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> closer<00:02:31.070> on<00:02:31.580> it<00:02:31.820> if

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
of how you can have a closer on it if

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.210 
of how you can have a closer on it if
you<00:02:32.720> have<00:02:32.900> an<00:02:33.020> old<00:02:33.170> belt<00:02:33.380> buckle<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.040> could

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
you have an old belt buckle you could

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.360 
you have an old belt buckle you could
just<00:02:34.430> use<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.670> I<00:02:35.300> always<00:02:36.140> have<00:02:36.440> belt<00:02:36.860> buckles

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
just use that I always have belt buckles

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.940 
just use that I always have belt buckles
because<00:02:37.820> I'm<00:02:38.000> always<00:02:38.600> cutting<00:02:39.080> up<00:02:39.290> Phelps<00:02:39.680> to

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
because I'm always cutting up Phelps to

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.240 
because I'm always cutting up Phelps to
use<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.459> letters<00:02:40.820> for<00:02:41.390> something<00:02:41.810> else<00:02:42.250> so

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
use the letters for something else so

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.640 
use the letters for something else so
I'm<00:02:43.430> just<00:02:43.640> going<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.820> remove<00:02:44.120> that<00:02:44.590> so<00:02:45.590> you

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
I'm just going to remove that so you

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.340 
I'm just going to remove that so you
would<00:02:45.920> just<00:02:45.950> slide<00:02:46.730> this<00:02:47.120> on<00:02:48.400> bring<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:51.019> prong

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
would just slide this on bring the prong

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.729 
would just slide this on bring the prong
through<00:02:51.830> like<00:02:52.580> that<00:02:53.049> then<00:02:54.049> you<00:02:54.200> could<00:02:54.320> use<00:02:54.530> the

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
through like that then you could use the

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.120 
through like that then you could use the
yarn<00:02:54.890> end<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.370> sew<00:02:55.549> this<00:02:55.760> on<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:57.049> then<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.860> put

yarn end to sew this on and then to put
the<00:02:58.160> belt<00:02:58.430> on<00:02:58.640> you<00:02:58.820> would<00:02:58.940> just<00:02:59.120> put<00:02:59.360> it

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.000 
would just put the belt on wind this
around<00:03:46.310> several<00:03:46.880> times<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.540> then<00:03:48.530> just<00:03:48.799> tuck

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.470 
it underneath
belt<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:50.970> wear<00:03:51.629> it<00:03:51.660> like<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:53.360> instead<00:03:54.360> of

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
belt and wear it like that instead of

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.960 
belt and wear it like that instead of
doing<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:54.989> wraparound<00:03:55.349> method<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.730> could

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
doing the wraparound method you could

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.780 
doing the wraparound method you could
just<00:03:57.330> do<00:03:58.110> a<00:03:58.140> chain<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.860> then<00:03:59.099> link<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.550> back

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
just do a chain and then link it back

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.880 
just do a chain and then link it back
into<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.269> belt<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.140> so<00:04:01.379> then<00:04:01.530> you'd<00:04:01.680> have<00:04:01.830> a

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
into the belt and so then you'd have a

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:12.270 
into the belt and so then you'd have a
buttonhole<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.819> a<00:04:02.849> button<00:04:03.090> belt

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.340
