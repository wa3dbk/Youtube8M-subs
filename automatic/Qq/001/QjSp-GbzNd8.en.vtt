00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.980 
and then you have on the el gato which
requires<00:04:57.340> an<00:04:57.490> HDMI<00:04:58.000> so<00:04:58.270> that's<00:04:58.480> pretty<00:04:58.840> much

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
requires an HDMI so that's pretty much

dual core i7 processor and this computer

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.270 
dual core i7 processor and this computer
is<00:05:40.030> a<00:05:40.210> monster<00:05:40.630> it<00:05:40.780> can<00:05:40.960> render<00:05:41.620> a<00:05:41.650> 10<00:05:42.010> minute

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
is a monster it can render a 10 minute

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.000 
is a monster it can render a 10 minute
video<00:05:42.430> in<00:05:42.670> about<00:05:42.850> five<00:05:43.150> minutes<00:05:43.390> and<00:05:44.010> that's

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
video in about five minutes and that's

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.680 
video in about five minutes and that's
really<00:05:45.610> really<00:05:45.790> good<00:05:45.850> for<00:05:46.150> a<00:05:46.180> computer<00:05:46.540> and

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
really really good for a computer and

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.540 
really really good for a computer and
the<00:05:46.780> reason<00:05:47.080> I<00:05:47.260> don't<00:05:47.920> actually<00:05:48.250> use<00:05:48.280> this

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
the reason I don't actually use this

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.700 
the reason I don't actually use this
computer<00:05:48.790> to<00:05:49.030> do<00:05:49.270> my<00:05:49.470> commentaries<00:05:50.470> and<00:05:50.500> all

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
computer to do my commentaries and all

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.820 
computer to do my commentaries and all
that<00:05:50.920> is<00:05:51.070> number<00:05:52.000> one<00:05:52.170> look<00:05:53.170> at<00:05:53.320> that<00:05:53.500> this

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
that is number one look at that this

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.220 
that is number one look at that this
computer<00:05:54.100> is<00:05:54.280> right<00:05:54.490> here<00:05:54.820> and<00:05:54.970> my<00:05:55.450> PVR<00:05:55.840> is<00:05:56.050> all

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
computer is right here and my PVR is all

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.780 
computer is right here and my PVR is all
the<00:05:56.380> way<00:05:56.440> over<00:05:56.470> there<00:05:56.650> that's<00:05:56.950> a<00:05:57.100> long<00:05:57.310> way<00:05:57.520> and

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
the way over there that's a long way and

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.610 
the way over there that's a long way and
the<00:05:58.360> cable<00:05:58.750> that<00:05:58.870> comes<00:05:59.020> with<00:05:59.230> the<00:05:59.320> PVR

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
the cable that comes with the PVR

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.950 
the cable that comes with the PVR
doesn't<00:06:00.010> actually<00:06:00.160> give<00:06:00.460> you<00:06:00.640> you<00:06:01.420> know<00:06:01.450> quite

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
doesn't actually give you you know quite

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.080 
doesn't actually give you you know quite
a<00:06:02.020> long<00:06:02.290> amount<00:06:02.680> like<00:06:02.890> a<00:06:03.070> cable<00:06:03.610> it<00:06:03.760> gives<00:06:03.970> you

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
a long amount like a cable it gives you

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.090 
a long amount like a cable it gives you
a<00:06:04.120> really<00:06:04.360> short<00:06:04.630> amount<00:06:04.780> and<00:06:05.200> that's<00:06:05.920> why<00:06:06.070> I

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
a really short amount and that's why I

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.100 
a really short amount and that's why I
don't<00:06:06.250> actually<00:06:06.550> do<00:06:07.150> commentaries<00:06:07.810> on<00:06:07.930> this

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
don't actually do commentaries on this

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.410 
don't actually do commentaries on this
computer<00:06:08.350> and<00:06:08.710> I<00:06:09.370> also<00:06:09.490> don't<00:06:09.790> have<00:06:09.910> a<00:06:10.000> mic<00:06:10.270> I

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 
computer and I also don't have a mic I

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.850 
computer and I also don't have a mic I
probably<00:06:10.660> would<00:06:10.870> end<00:06:11.080> up<00:06:11.290> having<00:06:11.590> to<00:06:11.710> buy<00:06:11.830> a

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
probably would end up having to buy a

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.800 
probably would end up having to buy a
blue<00:06:12.220> snowball<00:06:12.490> mic<00:06:12.910> for<00:06:13.090> like<00:06:13.180> fifty<00:06:13.480> dollars

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
blue snowball mic for like fifty dollars

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.600 
blue snowball mic for like fifty dollars
and<00:06:14.050> I<00:06:14.650> don't<00:06:14.830> want<00:06:14.950> to<00:06:15.010> waste<00:06:15.220> any<00:06:15.430> money

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
and I don't want to waste any money

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.470 
and I don't want to waste any money
right<00:06:15.850> like<00:06:16.210> right<00:06:16.540> now<00:06:16.570> but<00:06:18.120> this<00:06:19.120> is<00:06:19.300> the

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.480 
right like right now but this is the

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.690 
right like right now but this is the
computer<00:06:19.810> that<00:06:20.080> I<00:06:20.110> used<00:06:20.410> to<00:06:20.740> render<00:06:21.160> my<00:06:21.340> videos

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
computer that I used to render my videos

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.190 
computer that I used to render my videos
and<00:06:21.940> all<00:06:22.000> that<00:06:22.180> it's<00:06:22.330> a<00:06:23.250> 2011<00:06:24.300> mid-january<00:06:25.300> not
