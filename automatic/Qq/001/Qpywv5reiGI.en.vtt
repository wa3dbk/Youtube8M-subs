think<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.259> creates<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.619> really<00:01:49.860> nice<00:01:50.040> kind<00:01:50.280> of

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
think that creates a really nice kind of

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.580 
think that creates a really nice kind of
black<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.909> white<00:01:51.000> look<00:01:51.479> but<00:01:52.110> there<00:01:52.259> as<00:01:52.439> you

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
black and white look but there as you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.580 
black and white look but there as you
can<00:01:52.740> see<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.700> bumper<00:01:54.450> again<00:01:54.600> remains<00:01:55.020> super

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
can see the bumper again remains super

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.740 
can see the bumper again remains super
