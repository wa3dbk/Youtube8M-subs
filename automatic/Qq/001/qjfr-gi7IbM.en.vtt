and<00:00:00.120> you<00:00:00.630> feel<00:00:00.840> your<00:00:00.989> swimmers<00:00:01.350> are<00:00:01.530> ready<00:00:01.709> to

step<00:00:02.129> up<00:00:02.310> onto<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:02.790> block<00:00:03.030> I<00:00:03.389> think<00:00:04.049> it's<00:00:04.200> a

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
step up onto the block I think it's a

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.509 
step up onto the block I think it's a
smart<00:00:05.100> transition<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.690> go<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:07.170> frog<00:00:08.130> dive

working off of sometimes this if you

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.359 
working off of sometimes this if you
have<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> low<00:00:18.810> deck<00:00:19.109> stepping<00:00:20.100> up<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.340> the

have a low deck stepping up to the
blocks<00:00:20.730> is<00:00:20.910> pretty<00:00:21.180> intimidating<00:00:21.840> for

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
blocks is pretty intimidating for

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.480 
blocks is pretty intimidating for

swimmers that have not done it very

often<00:00:23.850> or<00:00:23.939> maybe<00:00:24.150> never<00:00:24.420> done<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.810> before<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.470> I

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
often or maybe never done it before so I

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.390 
often or maybe never done it before so I
like<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.519> have<00:00:27.000> our<00:00:27.029> swimmer<00:00:27.420> step<00:00:27.779> up<00:00:28.019> and

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
like to have our swimmer step up and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.560 
like to have our swimmer step up and
continue<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.429> drill<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.000> they<00:00:30.119> were<00:00:30.179> doing

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
continue a drill that they were doing

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.200 
continue a drill that they were doing
and<00:00:30.810> have<00:00:31.320> them<00:00:31.500> do<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> frog<00:00:32.279> die<00:00:32.520> from<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.969> stick

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
and have them do a frog die from a stick

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.780 
and have them do a frog die from a stick
of<00:00:33.360> up<00:00:33.510> position<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.680> about<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> seven<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
of up position to about a seven on the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.990 
of up position to about a seven on the
target<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.750> give<00:00:36.960> them<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.620> feeling<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.370> going

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
target to give them the feeling of going

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.240 
target to give them the feeling of going
through<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.510> air<00:00:39.690> setting<00:00:40.620> their<00:00:40.770> target

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
through the air setting their target

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.490 
through the air setting their target
dropping<00:00:42.149> their<00:00:42.300> head<00:00:42.480> down<00:00:42.719> into<00:00:42.960> their<00:00:43.170> arms

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
dropping their head down into their arms

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.549 
dropping their head down into their arms
looking<00:00:44.250> back<00:00:44.489> for<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> feet<00:00:45.090> hands<00:00:45.960> up<00:00:46.260> stick

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
looking back for the feet hands up stick

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.650 
looking back for the feet hands up stick
about<00:00:46.829> position<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.370> let's<00:00:48.210> shoot<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.629> a

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
about position and let's shoot to a

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.110 
about position and let's shoot to a
seven<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.350> glide<00:00:50.340> through<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.700> hole<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:51.090> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
seven and glide through the hole with a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.220 
seven and glide through the hole with a
strong<00:00:51.480> streamline<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.289> go<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:56.960> think<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.109> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
strong streamline and go I think on the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.200 
strong streamline and go I think on the
frog<00:00:58.500> dive<00:00:58.770> off<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.280> block<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.789> best<00:01:00.090> to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
frog dive off of the block it's best to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.209 
frog dive off of the block it's best to
start<00:01:00.600> them<00:01:00.719> right<00:01:00.989> out<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.949> track

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
start them right out in it in the track

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.619 
start them right out in it in the track
position<00:01:02.460> because<00:01:03.149> that's<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> position

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
position because that's the position

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.969 
position because that's the position
they're<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.199> want<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.470> use<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.830> their

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
they're going to want to use on their

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.330 
they're going to want to use on their
diet<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:06.080> again<00:01:07.080> we<00:01:07.320> assume<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.799> position

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
diet and again we assume the position

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.850 
diet and again we assume the position
getting<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.360> balance<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> block<00:01:10.320> versus

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
getting the balance on the block versus

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.340 
getting the balance on the block versus
on<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.040> deck<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.549> very<00:01:11.760> important<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.330> well

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
on the deck is very important as well

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.289 
on the deck is very important as well
Brian's<00:01:14.010> done<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> great<00:01:14.490> job<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.790> swimming

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
Brian's done a great job of swimming

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.570 
Brian's done a great job of swimming
that<00:01:15.450> position<00:01:15.990> getting<00:01:16.619> himself<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.340> good

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
that position getting himself in a good

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.240 
that position getting himself in a good
anchored<00:01:18.119> position<00:01:18.689> let's<00:01:19.320> pop<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.770> hands<00:01:20.100> up

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
anchored position let's pop the hands up

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.780 
anchored position let's pop the hands up
stick<00:01:20.790> them<00:01:20.939> up<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> seven<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.020> go<00:01:25.610> you<00:01:26.610> may

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
stick them up to a seven and go you may

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.640 
stick them up to a seven and go you may
have<00:01:26.939> noticed<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.509> dive<00:01:27.900> Brian<00:01:28.320> went<00:01:28.590> a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
have noticed on that dive Brian went a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.499 
have noticed on that dive Brian went a
little<00:01:28.770> bit<00:01:29.040> deep<00:01:29.280> I'm<00:01:29.909> going<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.150> ask<00:01:30.270> him<00:01:30.450> to

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
little bit deep I'm going to ask him to

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.109 
little bit deep I'm going to ask him to
try<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.020> again<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.650> move<00:01:32.369> his<00:01:32.549> hands<00:01:32.880> out<00:01:33.090> a

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
try that again and move his hands out a

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.870 
try that again and move his hands out a
little<00:01:33.360> bit<00:01:33.799> making<00:01:34.799> adjustments<00:01:35.700> for<00:01:35.820> your

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
little bit making adjustments for your

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.690 
little bit making adjustments for your
swimmers<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.659> critical<00:01:37.470> when<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.009> comes<00:01:38.369> to

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
swimmers is critical when it comes to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.510 
swimmers is critical when it comes to
drilling<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.659> dives<00:01:39.900> which<00:01:40.890> we've<00:01:41.130> always

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
drilling the dives which we've always

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.060 
drilling the dives which we've always
drilled<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> deep<00:01:42.210> end<00:01:42.740> before<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:43.860> get

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
drilled in the deep end before we get

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.460 
drilled in the deep end before we get
over<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.670> doing<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> dives<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.810> probably<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
over to doing the dives and probably a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.410 
over to doing the dives and probably a
more<00:01:46.710> shallow<00:01:47.070> starting<00:01:47.610> end<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.909> a
