 I had here the lamborghini to the 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.850
 redden 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.810
 the young surfers become the construction site 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.770

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.220

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:32.160
 Let's see how the nets can 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.160
 It is already getting quite excited 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.080
 prepared yes so we take over 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.960
 just half rehfeld so the whole 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.930
 area the look behind me here 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.030
 that will be all kia with parking and 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.960
 Buildings workshop in the middle of the 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.960
 free place so to speak 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.570
 sorry apology though 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:00.330
 Just say hello in the camera yes 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.030
 we are the krefelder street lines 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.280
 so cars must be safe 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.280
 Do you know what construction workers you believe 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.930
 already is evil exactly so exactly 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.820
 We are here with professionals in any case 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.960
 Now you are packing a few others 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:33.540
 have to move forward 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:34.070
 So I think mine saves everything 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.630
 right 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:40.380
 Now I can distribute my mortar 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:45.600

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:49.290

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.480
 So, what's in the milk ? 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.100
 fun holds range I wanted to first 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.720
 I take a break now 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.040
 So I 'm always hard now 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.320
 we made the especially the 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.240
 Laying the foundation a bit on the test 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.970
 the good thing is that we are today 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:06.750
 Also perfect for the construction site 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.910
 dressed are ok it is 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.440
 little 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:18.990
 now it will just go down 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:21.620
 not sure but a fisherman for dirk 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.620
 I would also have the makeshift or Mason 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.620
 or 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:39.339
 I have a small step for the 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:42.999
 but who explains a great for turk and 

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:45.129
 fischer what did we experience today? 

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:47.740
 we have the staff here in the vw 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:50.529
 We met at the 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.719
 Construction site laying the foundation stone before 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:54.939
 actual laying of the foundation stone 

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:57.219
 and the concern is fundamentally fischer 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:07:00.460
 I always stay mobile because of that 

00:06:57.219 --> 00:07:02.159
 now what is my job job 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.139
 it still in Munich 

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:06.340
 we still see a bit of the 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:09.850
 Aenne 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:13.320
 We also get really warm here 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.320
 get started online 

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:31.550
 8 a little movement is such a thing 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:36.199
 day as beautiful as today such a day 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.199
 that should never go away
