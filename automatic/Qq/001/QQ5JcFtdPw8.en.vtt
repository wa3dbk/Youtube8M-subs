definitely a freehand thing it's all

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.750 
definitely a freehand thing it's all
preference<00:03:38.299> you<00:03:38.750> could<00:03:38.870> have<00:03:39.019> it<00:03:39.200> centered

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
preference you could have it centered

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.569 
preference you could have it centered
you<00:03:40.760> could<00:03:41.680> have<00:03:42.680> it<00:03:42.769> off<00:03:42.859> to<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.069> side<00:03:43.280> like<00:03:43.310> I

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
you could have it off to the side like I

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.849 
you could have it off to the side like I
am<00:03:43.909> you<00:03:44.150> could<00:03:44.299> have<00:03:44.480> multiple<00:03:44.859> leaves

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
am you could have multiple leaves

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.759 
am you could have multiple leaves
totally<00:03:46.639> up<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:46.819> you<00:03:47.209> I<00:03:47.569> think<00:03:48.409> I'm<00:03:48.500> gonna<00:03:48.590> go

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
totally up to you I think I'm gonna go

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.030 
totally up to you I think I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:48.799> and<00:03:49.280> sew<00:03:49.549> this<00:03:49.760> middle<00:03:50.120> one<00:03:50.209> first<00:03:51.040> I'm

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
ahead and sew this middle one first I'm

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.339 
ahead and sew this middle one first I'm
also<00:03:52.189> gonna<00:03:52.430> do<00:03:52.730> a<00:03:53.060> zig-zag<00:03:53.389> stitch<00:03:53.569> for<00:03:54.230> this

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
also gonna do a zig-zag stitch for this

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.550 
also gonna do a zig-zag stitch for this
as<00:03:54.500> well<00:03:54.709> I<00:03:55.129> think<00:03:55.909> it<00:03:56.000> just<00:03:56.120> secures<00:03:56.599> it<00:03:56.840> the

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
as well I think it just secures it the

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.349 
as well I think it just secures it the
best<00:03:57.799> this<00:03:58.430> is<00:03:58.489> a<00:03:58.669> little<00:03:58.970> bit<00:03:59.090> thicker

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
best this is a little bit thicker

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:07.780 
best this is a little bit thicker
material<00:03:59.989> so

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.210 

and<00:04:08.930> because<00:04:09.930> it's<00:04:10.110> a<00:04:10.200> thicker<00:04:10.410> material<00:04:10.590> if

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
and because it's a thicker material if

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.870 
and because it's a thicker material if
you<00:04:11.430> have<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:12.590> heavy-duty<00:04:13.590> needle<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.760> could

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
you have a heavy-duty needle you could

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.130 
you have a heavy-duty needle you could
always<00:04:15.060> switch<00:04:15.330> that<00:04:15.570> out<00:04:15.630> in<00:04:15.870> your<00:04:15.960> machine

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
always switch that out in your machine

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.300 
always switch that out in your machine
so<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.680> way<00:04:16.770> you<00:04:16.830> don't<00:04:16.920> damage<00:04:17.130> your

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
so that way you don't damage your

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.270 
so that way you don't damage your
machine<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.840> can<00:04:19.020> ensure<00:04:19.380> that<00:04:19.410> the

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
machine and you can ensure that the

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.790 
machine and you can ensure that the
stitch<00:04:20.520> is<00:04:20.670> going<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:20.880> go<00:04:21.030> through<00:04:21.570> all<00:04:22.440> right

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
stitch is going to go through all right

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.000 
stitch is going to go through all right

as<00:04:38.910> best<00:04:39.120> as<00:04:39.270> possible<00:04:40.280> I<00:04:41.280> picked<00:04:41.730> two

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
as best as possible I picked two

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.060 
as best as possible I picked two
different<00:04:42.480> colors<00:04:42.780> an<00:04:42.960> orange<00:04:43.410> a<00:04:43.710> lighter<00:04:43.950> in

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
different colors an orange a lighter in

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:50.720 
different colors an orange a lighter in
a<00:04:44.490> darker<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:47.180> my<00:04:48.180> plan<00:04:48.510> is<00:04:49.260> to<00:04:49.710> go<00:04:50.130> light<00:04:50.460> to

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
a darker and my plan is to go light to

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.010 
a darker and my plan is to go light to
dark<00:04:51.000> so<00:04:51.240> kind<00:04:51.450> of<00:04:51.510> have<00:04:51.600> like<00:04:51.630> a<00:04:51.780> nice<00:04:51.990> little

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
dark so kind of have like a nice little

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.830 
dark so kind of have like a nice little
gradient<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:52.800> they'll<00:04:52.920> mix<00:04:53.160> in<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:54.660> two

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
gradient and they'll mix in the two

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.760 
gradient and they'll mix in the two
different<00:04:55.610> oranges<00:04:57.050> toward<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.230> middle<00:04:58.530> so

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
different oranges toward the middle so

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.970
