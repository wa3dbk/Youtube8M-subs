played<00:00:49.440> with<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.770> weapon<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.879> would

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
played with this weapon so I would

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.119

nothing<00:02:39.130> too<00:02:39.340> serious<00:02:39.849> I<00:02:40.180> mean<00:02:40.330> we<00:02:40.480> can<00:02:40.660> use

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
nothing too serious I mean we can use

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.900 
nothing too serious I mean we can use
tactics<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.680> whatnot<00:02:42.040> but<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.400> really<00:02:42.730> just

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
tactics and whatnot but I really just

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.059 
tactics and whatnot but I really just
want<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.150> have<00:02:43.980> some<00:02:44.980> fun<00:02:45.010> with<00:02:45.849> that<00:02:46.000> series

anyways today I kind of wanted to talk
about<00:02:52.299> the<00:02:52.840> next-gen<00:02:53.620> consoles<00:02:54.930> which<00:02:55.930> should

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
about the next-gen consoles which should

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.240 
about the next-gen consoles which should
be<00:02:56.440> releasing<00:02:57.130> later<00:02:57.430> on<00:02:57.670> this<00:02:57.880> year<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.739> also

kind of talk about that the next-gen

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.680 
kind of talk about that the next-gen
consoles<00:03:04.630> versus<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.859> pc<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:06.639> know<00:03:07.269> a<00:03:07.389> lot<00:03:07.630> of

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
consoles versus the pc I know a lot of

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.170 
consoles versus the pc I know a lot of
my<00:03:07.900> subscribers<00:03:08.170> are<00:03:08.920> currently<00:03:09.340> on<00:03:09.549> console

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
my subscribers are currently on console

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.819 
my subscribers are currently on console
so<00:03:10.510> this<00:03:11.040> video<00:03:12.040> will<00:03:12.959> more<00:03:13.959> or<00:03:14.079> less<00:03:14.290> be<00:03:14.560> for

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
so this video will more or less be for

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.460 
so this video will more or less be for
you<00:03:14.950> guys<00:03:15.389> I<00:03:16.389> don't<00:03:16.989> imagine<00:03:17.380> anybody<00:03:17.889> on<00:03:18.340> PC

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
you guys I don't imagine anybody on PC

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.949 
you guys I don't imagine anybody on PC
moving<00:03:20.489> over<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.819> next<00:03:21.970> gen<00:03:22.329> consoles

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
moving over to the next gen consoles

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.150 
moving over to the next gen consoles
just<00:03:23.350> because<00:03:24.690> if<00:03:25.690> you're<00:03:25.989> a<00:03:26.019> PC<00:03:26.560> gamer<00:03:26.829> you

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
just because if you're a PC gamer you

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.620 
just because if you're a PC gamer you
know<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.670> can<00:03:27.819> always<00:03:28.000> upgrade<00:03:28.420> your<00:03:28.870> pc<00:03:30.630> but

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
know you can always upgrade your pc but

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.920 
know you can always upgrade your pc but
i<00:03:31.900> imagine<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:33.160> next<00:03:33.850> gen<00:03:34.060> consoles<00:03:34.660> would

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
i imagine the next gen consoles would

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.290 
i imagine the next gen consoles would
kind<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.290> be<00:03:35.440> like<00:03:35.620> a

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
kind of be like a

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.460 
kind of be like a
low<00:03:37.960> to<00:03:38.100> mid-level<00:03:39.270> pc<00:03:40.270> as<00:03:40.600> far<00:03:40.990> as<00:03:41.200> its

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
low to mid-level pc as far as its

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.830 
low to mid-level pc as far as its
capabilities<00:03:42.310> that's<00:03:43.060> what<00:03:43.360> i<00:03:43.390> would<00:03:43.630> have<00:03:43.810> to

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
capabilities that's what i would have to

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.980 
capabilities that's what i would have to
probably<00:03:44.350> compare<00:03:45.070> compare<00:03:45.910> them<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.450> from

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
probably compare compare them to from

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.220 
probably compare compare them to from
what<00:03:47.140> i've<00:03:47.260> heard<00:03:48.900> apparently<00:03:49.900> they'll<00:03:50.110> be

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
what i've heard apparently they'll be

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.760 
what i've heard apparently they'll be
able<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.530> run<00:03:51.510> games<00:03:52.510> like<00:03:52.810> battlefield<00:03:53.410> 3

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
able to run games like battlefield 3

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.260 
able to run games like battlefield 3

they'll have about eight gigabytes of

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.170 
they'll have about eight gigabytes of
memory<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:05.710> I'm<00:04:05.980> not<00:04:06.190> really<00:04:06.400> sure<00:04:06.520> what<00:04:07.000> type

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
memory and I'm not really sure what type

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.520 
memory and I'm not really sure what type
of<00:04:07.710> graphics<00:04:08.710> unit<00:04:09.160> they<00:04:09.430> will<00:04:09.640> be<00:04:10.500> they<00:04:11.500> will

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
of graphics unit they will be they will

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.150 
of graphics unit they will be they will
have<00:04:13.530> but<00:04:14.640> from<00:04:15.640> what<00:04:15.820> it<00:04:15.970> sounds<00:04:16.239> like

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
have but from what it sounds like

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.710 
have but from what it sounds like
they're<00:04:18.160> going<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.370> cost<00:04:18.640> quite<00:04:19.390> a<00:04:19.450> bit<00:04:19.570> more

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
they're going to cost quite a bit more

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.500 
they're going to cost quite a bit more
than<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.980> current<00:04:21.250> generation<00:04:21.570> consoles<00:04:22.570> and

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
than the current generation consoles and

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.720 
than the current generation consoles and
and<00:04:25.510> I<00:04:26.020> don't<00:04:26.290> mean<00:04:26.440> like<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:27.340> current

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
and I don't mean like the current

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.850 
and I don't mean like the current
generation<00:04:28.170> consoles<00:04:29.170> what<00:04:29.470> their<00:04:29.620> prices

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
generation consoles what their prices

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.490 
generation consoles what their prices
now<00:04:30.430> I<00:04:30.460> mean<00:04:30.850> what<00:04:31.360> their<00:04:31.510> price<00:04:31.810> was<00:04:32.140> at

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
now I mean what their price was at

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.000 
now I mean what their price was at
release<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:34.290> mean<00:04:35.290> it<00:04:35.410> would<00:04:35.530> only<00:04:35.650> make<00:04:35.830> sense

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
release I mean it would only make sense

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.280 
release I mean it would only make sense
that<00:04:36.670> they<00:04:36.940> would<00:04:36.970> cost<00:04:37.300> more<00:04:37.690> seniors

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
that they would cost more seniors

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.960 
that they would cost more seniors
they're<00:04:38.440> going<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.620> have<00:04:38.800> much<00:04:39.580> better

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
they're going to have much better

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.300 
they're going to have much better
hardware<00:04:40.630> so<00:04:41.380> I'm<00:04:41.530> going<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.710> have<00:04:41.890> to<00:04:41.919> imagine

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
hardware so I'm going to have to imagine

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.880 
hardware so I'm going to have to imagine
these<00:04:42.700> things<00:04:43.450> are<00:04:43.690> probably<00:04:43.960> going<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:44.440> be<00:04:44.590> at

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
these things are probably going to be at

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.970 
these things are probably going to be at
least<00:04:44.950> six<00:04:45.730> to<00:04:46.120> you<00:04:47.080> know<00:04:47.200> seven<00:04:47.680> hundred

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
least six to you know seven hundred

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.610 
least six to you know seven hundred
dollars<00:04:48.010> when<00:04:48.820> they<00:04:48.970> first<00:04:49.840> release<00:04:50.290> to<00:04:50.590> the

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
dollars when they first release to the

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:57.330 
dollars when they first release to the
public<00:04:50.890> and<00:04:53.070> and<00:04:54.780> at<00:04:55.780> that<00:04:56.380> price<00:04:56.680> range<00:04:56.919> you

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
public and and at that price range you

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.120 
public and and at that price range you
know<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:57.550> could<00:04:57.850> go<00:04:58.360> ahead<00:04:58.600> and<00:04:58.720> buy<00:04:58.870> a<00:04:59.200> decent

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
know you could go ahead and buy a decent

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.520 
know you could go ahead and buy a decent
pc<00:05:01.260> that<00:05:02.260> would<00:05:02.410> probably<00:05:02.650> be<00:05:03.340> capable<00:05:04.090> of<00:05:04.530> the

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
pc that would probably be capable of the

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.230 
pc that would probably be capable of the
same<00:05:08.100> things<00:05:09.100> as<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:10.210> the<00:05:10.720> next<00:05:11.050> gen<00:05:11.260> consoles

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
same things as the the next gen consoles

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.970 
same things as the the next gen consoles
so<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:15.370> question<00:05:15.550> is<00:05:16.030> and<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:17.740> thing<00:05:17.950> that

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
so the question is and the thing that

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.580 
so the question is and the thing that
out<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:19.180> way<00:05:19.360> I<00:05:19.390> see<00:05:19.870> it<00:05:19.900> because<00:05:20.260> you<00:05:20.410> can

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
out the way I see it because you can

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.220 
out the way I see it because you can
always<00:05:20.800> upgrade<00:05:21.220> a<00:05:21.520> pc<00:05:22.090> and<00:05:22.360> I<00:05:22.510> don't<00:05:22.720> know<00:05:22.930> if

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
always upgrade a pc and I don't know if

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.420 
always upgrade a pc and I don't know if
they're<00:05:23.470> going<00:05:23.560> to<00:05:23.650> have<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:23.950> upgrade

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
they're going to have the upgrade

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.500 
they're going to have the upgrade
capability<00:05:25.300> for<00:05:25.600> the<00:05:25.720> next<00:05:26.020> gen<00:05:26.200> consoles

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
capability for the next gen consoles

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.390 
capability for the next gen consoles
because<00:05:28.510> some<00:05:29.169> games<00:05:29.440> you<00:05:29.770> know<00:05:29.890> games<00:05:30.160> are

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
because some games you know games are

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.670 
because some games you know games are
always<00:05:30.580> evolving<00:05:31.350> however<00:05:32.350> I've<00:05:32.590> never

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
always evolving however I've never

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.730 
always evolving however I've never
they<00:05:33.800> console<00:05:34.400> that<00:05:34.699> I<00:05:34.850> could<00:05:35.030> upgrade<00:05:35.740> the

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
they console that I could upgrade the

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.840 
they console that I could upgrade the
next-gen<00:05:37.370> consoles<00:05:37.910> may<00:05:38.240> be<00:05:38.380> capable<00:05:39.580> of<00:05:40.580> that

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
next-gen consoles may be capable of that

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.090 
next-gen consoles may be capable of that
that<00:05:43.850> can<00:05:44.090> kind<00:05:44.360> of<00:05:44.449> kind<00:05:45.110> of<00:05:45.289> evolve<00:05:45.680> with<00:05:46.070> the

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
that can kind of kind of evolve with the

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.360 
that can kind of kind of evolve with the
game<00:05:46.430> kind<00:05:47.060> of<00:05:47.180> upgrade<00:05:47.660> them<00:05:47.889> from<00:05:48.889> time<00:05:49.130> to

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
game kind of upgrade them from time to

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.180 
game kind of upgrade them from time to
time<00:05:49.400> to<00:05:49.910> keep<00:05:49.940> up<00:05:50.330> with<00:05:50.509> the<00:05:51.380> new<00:05:51.650> games<00:05:51.919> that

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
time to keep up with the new games that

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.420 
time to keep up with the new games that
are<00:05:52.280> coming<00:05:52.610> out<00:05:52.840> I<00:05:53.840> personally<00:05:54.800> never<00:05:55.039> owned

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
are coming out I personally never owned

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.640 
are coming out I personally never owned
the<00:05:55.699> console<00:05:56.210> that<00:05:56.389> was<00:05:56.539> capable<00:05:56.750> of<00:05:57.110> that<00:05:57.320> and

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
the console that was capable of that and

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.189 
the console that was capable of that and
never<00:05:57.770> really<00:05:58.130> looked<00:05:59.000> much<00:05:59.419> into<00:05:59.479> it<00:05:59.870> when<00:06:00.169> I

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
never really looked much into it when I

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.390 
never really looked much into it when I
was<00:06:00.820> strictly<00:06:01.820> playing<00:06:02.180> on<00:06:02.389> a<00:06:02.419> console<00:06:03.400> but

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
was strictly playing on a console but

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.400 
was strictly playing on a console but
the<00:06:04.520> thing<00:06:04.729> about<00:06:04.759> pcs<00:06:05.570> is<00:06:05.900> you<00:06:06.050> can<00:06:06.199> always

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
the thing about pcs is you can always

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.150 
the thing about pcs is you can always
upgrade<00:06:06.860> them<00:06:07.419> to<00:06:08.440> evolve<00:06:09.440> with<00:06:09.740> the<00:06:09.770> games

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
upgrade them to evolve with the games

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.980 
upgrade them to evolve with the games
that<00:06:10.400> are<00:06:10.759> being<00:06:11.180> produced<00:06:11.599> and<00:06:13.479> that's<00:06:14.479> you

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
that are being produced and that's you

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.279 
that are being produced and that's you
know<00:06:15.050> one<00:06:15.440> of<00:06:15.470> the<00:06:15.620> reasons<00:06:16.039> I<00:06:16.310> wanted<00:06:16.729> to<00:06:17.289> get

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
know one of the reasons I wanted to get

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:20.499 
know one of the reasons I wanted to get
into<00:06:18.470> pc<00:06:19.009> gaming<00:06:19.280> is<00:06:19.610> not<00:06:19.880> only<00:06:20.180> because

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:20.509 
into pc gaming is not only because

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.650 
into pc gaming is not only because
they're<00:06:20.690> capable<00:06:20.930> of<00:06:21.380> so<00:06:21.710> much<00:06:21.740> more<00:06:22.300> than<00:06:23.300> the

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
they're capable of so much more than the

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.170 
they're capable of so much more than the
current<00:06:23.930> generation<00:06:24.199> consoles<00:06:25.190> obviously

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
current generation consoles obviously

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.140 
current generation consoles obviously
but<00:06:26.810> they<00:06:26.990> will<00:06:27.139> still<00:06:27.349> be<00:06:27.729> capable<00:06:28.729> of<00:06:28.880> more

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
but they will still be capable of more

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.850 
but they will still be capable of more
than<00:06:29.479> the<00:06:30.139> next-gen<00:06:30.710> consoles<00:06:31.340> and<00:06:32.740> you<00:06:33.740> know

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
than the next-gen consoles and you know

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.279 
than the next-gen consoles and you know
because<00:06:34.280> their<00:06:34.550> technology<00:06:35.300> is<00:06:35.360> just<00:06:35.690> so<00:06:35.960> far

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
because their technology is just so far

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:40.589 
because their technology is just so far
ahead<00:06:36.410> of<00:06:36.590> that<00:06:37.659> why<00:06:38.659> I<00:06:38.690> don't<00:06:39.349> know<00:06:39.620> but

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:40.599 
ahead of that why I don't know but

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:46.570 
ahead of that why I don't know but
anyways<00:06:43.690> yeah<00:06:45.039> when<00:06:46.039> I<00:06:46.070> forgot<00:06:46.430> to<00:06:46.550> mention

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:46.580 
anyways yeah when I forgot to mention

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.839 
anyways yeah when I forgot to mention
the<00:06:47.030> steam<00:06:47.330> box<00:06:47.650> they're<00:06:48.650> also<00:06:49.039> there<00:06:49.699> will

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:49.849 
the steam box they're also there will

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:52.000 
the steam box they're also there will
also<00:06:50.000> be<00:06:50.210> a<00:06:50.360> steam<00:06:50.750> box<00:06:51.050> which<00:06:51.349> is<00:06:51.500> coming<00:06:51.740> out

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
also be a steam box which is coming out

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.399 
also be a steam box which is coming out
and<00:06:52.370> I'm<00:06:52.849> I'm<00:06:53.210> not<00:06:53.449> really<00:06:53.630> sure<00:06:53.780> if<00:06:54.050> it's

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:54.409 
and I'm I'm not really sure if it's

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:56.649 
and I'm I'm not really sure if it's
gonna<00:06:54.530> you<00:06:54.949> know<00:06:55.280> how<00:06:55.580> it<00:06:55.760> compares<00:06:56.180> to<00:06:56.479> the

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:56.659 
gonna you know how it compares to the

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:02.320 
gonna you know how it compares to the
next<00:06:57.409> gen<00:06:57.650> consoles<00:06:58.300> like<00:06:59.300> the<00:07:00.050> ps4<00:07:00.770> and<00:07:01.520> the

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330 
next gen consoles like the ps4 and the

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.760 
next gen consoles like the ps4 and the
xbox<00:07:02.930> 720<00:07:03.500> but<00:07:04.210> that<00:07:05.210> is<00:07:05.389> another<00:07:05.539> option<00:07:06.050> for

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:06.770 
xbox 720 but that is another option for

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.790 
xbox 720 but that is another option for
you<00:07:06.860> console<00:07:07.430> gamers<00:07:07.909> who<00:07:08.210> you<00:07:08.960> know<00:07:09.080> refuse

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 
you console gamers who you know refuse

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.120 
you console gamers who you know refuse
to<00:07:10.099> move<00:07:10.220> over<00:07:10.610> to<00:07:10.699> pc<00:07:11.120> gaming<00:07:11.919> which<00:07:12.919> I<00:07:13.070> know

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.130 
to move over to pc gaming which I know

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.240 
to move over to pc gaming which I know
there<00:07:13.550> are<00:07:13.580> probably<00:07:13.880> some<00:07:14.360> of<00:07:14.419> you<00:07:14.539> out<00:07:14.690> there

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.250 
there are probably some of you out there

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.339 
there are probably some of you out there
but<00:07:16.250> for<00:07:16.580> those<00:07:17.150> of<00:07:17.389> us<00:07:17.509> who<00:07:17.780> don't<00:07:17.810> really

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:18.349 
but for those of us who don't really

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:20.649 
but for those of us who don't really
care<00:07:18.590> what<00:07:18.620> we<00:07:18.919> want<00:07:19.159> what<00:07:19.759> we<00:07:19.789> play<00:07:20.210> on<00:07:20.419> as

care what we want what we play on as
long<00:07:20.900> as

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310 
long as

long as
it<00:07:21.420> runs<00:07:22.420> the<00:07:22.690> game<00:07:22.870> as<00:07:23.140> we<00:07:23.620> want<00:07:23.950> how<00:07:24.250> we<00:07:24.310> want

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:24.760
