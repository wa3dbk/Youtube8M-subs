about responsibility we have a

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.189 
about responsibility we have a

aspects<00:05:43.130> of<00:05:43.250> sustainability<00:05:43.850> are<00:05:44.240> so

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
aspects of sustainability are so

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.260 
aspects of sustainability are so
