00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello to all we go today 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.720
 to discover the directory 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.880
 reversed Senegalese and we're going 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.340
 the descriptive page of his 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.980
 directories pages on which we have 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.160
 could land thanks to the directory section 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.480
 inverted world through a few lines 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.670
 we will find some 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.900
 descriptions on the main directory 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.000
 Senegal with each on a descriptive 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.130
 I will start by describing you 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.619
 the yellow pages of senegal since 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.010
 it's the only reverse directory in the country 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.520
 so here is the website page 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.110
 Home 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.640
 so she's already in French what 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.649
 is relatively easy for the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.719
 navigation 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.030
 you can either search the number of 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.420
 phone from a professional by entering 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.950
 the name of the company where the activity 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.989
 as well as the city where you can 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.690
 also identified a number of 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.800
 phone 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.350
 so me that's what I'm going to do 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.640
 this is what interests us today 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.859
 knowing that in this field of research 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.090
 you can not enter the area code 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.189
 phone from senegal on 0 0 221 but 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.680
 directly the phone number so 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.400
 for example for me to do this 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.500
 demonstration 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.460
 I took the phone number of a 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.680
 restaurant in dakar so I'm going to dial 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.729
 33 8 169 69 69 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.729
 and I will click find 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.390
 so here we see that I got three 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.270
 results 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.110
 me is the restaurant that interests me 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.320
 so we have all the details related to this 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.689
 phone number to know here the name 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.240
 of the restaurant where the name of the company 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.450
 we have here the phone number 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.140
 that we sought to identify 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.210
 we also find an address 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.210
 mail as well as the website 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:05.470
 we have a fax number the sector 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.100
 the Company's activities and our 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.489
 right 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.330
 we can also note the products and 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.720
 services of this company 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.830
 so that's for 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.440
 this first inverted asnieres site that 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.800
 is relatively simple fast and who 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.610
 give good information 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.010
 so then we have reversed gaits 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.520
 does not exist on other sites 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.500
 on the other hand we can find a very good 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.810
 a very good platform that is the one 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.120
 orange which allows to search for 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.050
 phone numbers of individuals in 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.950
 entering their name their first name and city 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.170
 so now click on 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.140
 search we can get an address 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.340
 or a phone number 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.349
 so that's for 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.400
 for this page so we can also 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.989
 looked for the numbered end of a 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.050
 professional thanks to the yellow pages 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.000
 of orange is also having the 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.140
 indicative of all countries in the world 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.209
 clicking on this small section 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.720
 that's it for this orange website that 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:18.140
 is very well done very fast 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.720
 and finally we will move on this 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.810
 platform called address scene 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.140
 which is actually a website 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.250
 information on senegal so there we 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.530
 sees that she can find several 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.709
 headings and we also have a directory 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.010
 which lists the majority of 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.510
 professionals in senegal so there we do not 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.760
 can not do search via a 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.360
 search engine puts directly into 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.040
 selecting a category one 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.010
 business category or sector 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.459
 of activity so we're all going 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:56.660
 find all this here for this 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.810
 last yearbook so now he 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.389
 be aware that if you receive a 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:06.049
 phone number starting with 0 0 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:07.700
 221 it will necessarily be a number 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.910
 from Senegal since it's 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.730
 the country code for this country 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.170
 then if you are in France it's that 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.079
 you call them in senegal you 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.870
 dial 0 0 221 the area code 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.550
 country followed by phone number by 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.590
 against if you are in senegal and that 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.880
 you call it in France in this case 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.630
 you will dial the area code 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.030
 from france on 00 33 followed by the number of 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.240
 phone without putting the 0 from the beginning 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.430
 otherwise it will not work that's it for 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.580
 all these little information about 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.039
 the reverse directory of senegal and the 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.050
 research opportunities on others 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.669
 directories if you liked this content 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.400
