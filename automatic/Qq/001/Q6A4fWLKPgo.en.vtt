that we've used for our test-fit

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.750 
that we've used for our test-fit
actually<00:00:22.050> for<00:00:22.230> quite<00:00:22.320> some<00:00:22.590> time<00:00:22.619> very<00:00:23.369> unique

sort of innovation that goes on that
we've<00:00:28.080> always<00:00:28.230> been<00:00:28.380> very<00:00:28.560> impressed<00:00:28.890> with

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
we've always been very impressed with

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.189 
we've always been very impressed with
now<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.910> way<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.330> case<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.570> designed<00:00:31.050> is

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
now the way this case is designed is

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.389 
now the way this case is designed is
actually<00:00:31.500> out<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.710> single<00:00:32.040> piece<00:00:32.340> of

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
actually out of a single piece of

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.860 
actually out of a single piece of
aluminum<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.270> they<00:00:33.510> have<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.660> really<00:00:33.780> cool

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
aluminum and they have a really cool

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.780 
aluminum and they have a really cool
demonstration<00:00:34.620> right<00:00:35.219> over<00:00:35.399> here<00:00:35.550> am<00:00:35.640> i<00:00:35.760> right

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
demonstration right over here am i right

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.110 
demonstration right over here am i right
so<00:00:36.450> here's<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> 15<00:00:37.440> folds<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.820> go<00:00:38.969> into

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
so here's the 15 folds that go into

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.200 
so here's the 15 folds that go into
creating<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:41.100> s<00:00:41.250> frame<00:00:41.579> from<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.940> single

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
creating the the s frame from a single

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.520 
creating the the s frame from a single
piece<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.390> aluminum<00:00:42.600> starting<00:00:43.260> right<00:00:43.350> here

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
piece of aluminum starting right here

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.770 
piece of aluminum starting right here
that<00:00:43.680> they<00:00:43.770> cut<00:00:43.980> outs<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.600> what<00:00:45.600> I've<00:00:45.690> been

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
that they cut outs and what I've been

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.510 
that they cut outs and what I've been
told<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.260> there's<00:00:46.559> actually<00:00:47.129> not<00:00:47.309> an

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
told is that there's actually not an

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.580 
told is that there's actually not an
aluminum<00:00:48.300> folding<00:00:48.450> machine<00:00:48.960> large<00:00:49.230> enough<00:00:49.559> to

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
aluminum folding machine large enough to

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.319 
aluminum folding machine large enough to
create<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.160> thing<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.640> they<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.910> only<00:00:51.059> make

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
create this thing so they can only make

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.860 
create this thing so they can only make
about<00:00:51.480> 15<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.199> them<00:00:52.590> every<00:00:53.550> week<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.360> all<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
about 15 of them every week so all the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.420 
about 15 of them every week so all the
way<00:00:54.930> down<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.199> line<00:00:55.350> one<00:00:55.680> two<00:00:56.010> three<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.370> you

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
way down the line one two three and you

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.920 
way down the line one two three and you
can<00:00:56.610> see<00:00:56.760> each<00:00:56.879> time<00:00:56.910> they're<00:00:57.660> making

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
can see each time they're making

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.779 
can see each time they're making
different<00:00:58.199> folds<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.680> create<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.460> different

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
different folds to create the different

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.549 
different folds to create the different
elements<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.300> chassis<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:01.379> all<00:01:01.469> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
elements of the chassis going all the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.410 
elements of the chassis going all the
way<00:01:01.649> down<00:01:01.800> there<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.070> step<00:01:02.399> 10<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.000> finally

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
way down there to step 10 and finally

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.109 
way down there to step 10 and finally
over<00:01:03.660> here<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.960> step<00:01:04.170> 15<00:01:04.729> where<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:06.000> what

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
over here to step 15 where you have what

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.210 
over here to step 15 where you have what
is<00:01:06.240> essentially<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.750> finished<00:01:07.200> products<00:01:07.710> now

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
is essentially the finished products now

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.289 
is essentially the finished products now
I<00:01:08.250> think<00:01:08.369> they<00:01:08.640> should<00:01:08.790> make<00:01:08.820> little<00:01:09.210> tiny

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
I think they should make little tiny

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.609 
I think they should make little tiny
little<00:01:09.540> versions<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.049> these<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.470> can

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
little versions of these that you can

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.130 
little versions of these that you can
buy<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.520> set<00:01:11.760> up<00:01:11.850> your<00:01:11.880> own<00:01:12.000> title<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.990> would

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
buy and set up your own title this would

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.380 
buy and set up your own title this would
be<00:01:13.229> smaller<00:01:13.530> than<00:01:13.740> mini<00:01:13.920> ITX<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.610> think<00:01:14.850> but

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
be smaller than mini ITX I think but

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.200 
be smaller than mini ITX I think but
that<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.990> how<00:01:16.170> its<00:01:16.320> constructed<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.939> am

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that is how its constructed and I am

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.520 
that is how its constructed and I am
very<00:01:18.420> impressed<00:01:18.780> let's<00:01:18.990> go<00:01:19.110> back<00:01:19.259> over<00:01:19.500> here

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
very impressed let's go back over here

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.359 
very impressed let's go back over here
and<00:01:19.710> take<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.890> closer<00:01:20.100> look

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.890 

so<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.430> rattle<00:01:23.939> off<00:01:24.030> some<00:01:24.060> specs<00:01:24.509> for<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.750> guys

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
so to rattle off some specs for you guys

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.600 
so to rattle off some specs for you guys
I'm<00:01:25.110> going<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> read<00:01:25.500> out<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.400> made

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
I'm going to read out this so it's made

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.520 
I'm going to read out this so it's made
of<00:01:26.729> four<00:01:27.000> millimeter<00:01:27.780> aluminum<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.409> have<00:01:28.500> a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
of four millimeter aluminum we have a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.380 
of four millimeter aluminum we have a
tempered<00:01:28.979> glass<00:01:29.100> handle<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.180> very

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
tempered glass handle so it's very

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.670 
tempered glass handle so it's very
similar<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.869> what<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.110> might<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.290> seen<00:01:31.530> in

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
similar to what you might have seen in

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.950 
similar to what you might have seen in

is tucked in here in the back up to 220
millimeters<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.590> can<00:02:30.709> build<00:02:30.890> an<00:02:30.980> amazing

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
millimeters so you can build an amazing

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.470 
millimeters so you can build an amazing
system<00:02:31.670> out<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.820> this<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.150> definitely<00:02:32.240> a

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480

showpiece something you want to set up

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.830 
showpiece something you want to set up
somewhere<00:02:34.550> with<00:02:34.760> like<00:02:34.880> lights<00:02:35.120> underneath<00:02:35.510> so

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
somewhere with like lights underneath so

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.330 
somewhere with like lights underneath so
people<00:02:36.110> can<00:02:36.230> get<00:02:36.290> a<00:02:36.350> good<00:02:36.500> look<00:02:36.620> at<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:36.950> but

people can get a good look at it but

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.100 
people can get a good look at it but
that's<00:02:37.550> not<00:02:37.760> all<00:02:37.910> if<00:02:38.240> this<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.660> little<00:02:38.930> bit

in windy free mini so let's go take a
look<00:02:42.890> at<00:02:42.980> that<00:02:43.130> so<00:02:43.580> here<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.030> in<00:02:44.180> windy

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
look at that so here is the in windy

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.680 
look at that so here is the in windy
frame<00:02:45.350> mini<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.130> is<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.280> mini<00:02:46.550> ITX<00:02:46.790> chassis

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
frame mini this is a mini ITX chassis

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.380 
frame mini this is a mini ITX chassis
fully<00:02:48.020> open-air<00:02:48.680> design<00:02:49.070> as<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.370> can<00:02:49.640> see<00:02:49.880> it

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
fully open-air design as you can see it

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.120 
fully open-air design as you can see it
takes<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.690> lot<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:50.840> cues<00:02:51.110> from<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.410> original<00:02:51.890> in

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
takes a lot of cues from the original in

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.330 
takes a lot of cues from the original in
windy<00:02:52.760> frame<00:02:53.090> in<00:02:53.600> that<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.170> is<00:02:54.290> fully<00:02:54.650> aluminum

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
windy frame in that it is fully aluminum

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.880 
windy frame in that it is fully aluminum
this<00:02:55.790> one<00:02:56.000> is<00:02:56.209> actually<00:02:56.420> welded<00:02:57.050> entirely<00:02:57.470> so

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
this one is actually welded entirely so

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.470 
this one is actually welded entirely so
it<00:02:58.010> does<00:02:58.130> not<00:02:58.280> come<00:02:58.550> flat<00:02:58.760> packed<00:02:59.060> like<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.390> in

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
it does not come flat packed like the in

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.510 
it does not come flat packed like the in
windy<00:02:59.810> frame<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.350> no<00:03:00.560> assembly<00:03:00.830> required<00:03:00.980> but

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
windy frame so no assembly required but

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.520
