00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:09.630
 so to play an extract of spring 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.820
 of vivaldi 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.870
 we will first go on the greedy rope 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:21.030
 from there to impose a second must who 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:25.940
 will give a C sharp repeat this note 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:28.000
 three times first must still david 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.250
 half empty ropes 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.420
 again again david 2000 3rd 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:39.800
 finger on the agreement the second must 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:45.800
 play twice first must still 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:48.910
 david of the rope eager to play me at 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.910
 the normal speed that gives that 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.260
 so we go back on the agreement david half 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:10.520
 then 3rd on the rope of the second 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:15.340
 third camp david 2000 then 3rd 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:19.040
 finger on the rope the second must 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.460
 first must therefore adapt this wrong time 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.460
 it gives that 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.359
 we can also replace the david agreement 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:49.259
 by a fourth finger on the 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:49.259
 rope two there since these same notes 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:07.959
 and so that gives that so for this 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.069
 second part of the sequence we're going 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.920
 leave on the rope of the with a 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.780
 second must then david agreement 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:20.769
 half third finger on the rope of the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:24.480
 second third body david dominates 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:30.370
 first must still david 2000 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:32.700
 so that gives that we repeat it a 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.700
 again 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.540
 then simply on the rope of the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.530
 second must be promised on the agreement to 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:50.080
 my empty cords third finger on 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:53.770
 the agreement of the second first camp 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.080
 david of the first finger on the rope 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:00.430
 of the with a sort with the second must 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.950
 who does one of hearing so and strings to 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.100
 empty of the normal speed it gives 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.100
 it 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.600
 from the beginning 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.010
 m 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.820
 no
