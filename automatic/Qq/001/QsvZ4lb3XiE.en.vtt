00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.420 

okay<00:00:03.179> so<00:00:03.240> this<00:00:03.750> video<00:00:04.259> I'm<00:00:04.350> maybe<00:00:05.100> going<00:00:05.339> to

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
okay so this video I'm maybe going to

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.730 
okay so this video I'm maybe going to
slightly<00:00:05.580> contradict<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.960> couple<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.620> things

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
slightly contradict a couple of things

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.129 
slightly contradict a couple of things
I've<00:00:07.950> said<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.429> earlier<00:00:08.849> videos<00:00:09.179> about<00:00:09.389> space

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
I've said in earlier videos about space

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.810 
I've said in earlier videos about space
and<00:00:10.469> take<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.889> line<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.250> want<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.460> take<00:00:11.639> to

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
and take the line you want to take to

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.669 
and take the line you want to take to
the<00:00:11.910> ball<00:00:12.090> but<00:00:12.450> if<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:12.990> watch<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.230> lot<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.500> top

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
the ball but if you watch a lot of top

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.340 
the ball but if you watch a lot of top
players<00:00:13.860> someone<00:00:14.370> like<00:00:14.460> Gregg<00:00:14.700> Gaultier<00:00:15.350> or

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
players someone like Gregg Gaultier or

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.510 
players someone like Gregg Gaultier or
many<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.680> top<00:00:16.859> players<00:00:16.890> now<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.340> games

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
many of the top players now the games

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.620 
many of the top players now the games
are<00:00:17.640> becoming<00:00:17.699> so<00:00:18.000> much<00:00:18.090> faster<00:00:18.390> they're<00:00:18.510> not

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
are becoming so much faster they're not

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.570 
are becoming so much faster they're not
actually<00:00:18.960> letting<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.560> ball<00:00:19.710> game<00:00:19.890> get<00:00:20.400> into

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
actually letting the ball game get into

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.340 
actually letting the ball game get into
the<00:00:20.699> back<00:00:20.820> corner<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.720> particularly<00:00:22.050> what

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
the back corner so particularly what

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.950 
the back corner so particularly what
they're<00:00:22.500> doing<00:00:22.949> from<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> tee<00:00:24.090> it's<00:00:24.600> taking<00:00:24.900> a

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
they're doing from the tee it's taking a

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.259 
they're doing from the tee it's taking a
really<00:00:25.199> direct<00:00:25.410> line<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.310> ball<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:27.119> then

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
really direct line to the ball but then

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.759 
really direct line to the ball but then
relying<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.930> their<00:00:28.140> strength<00:00:28.529> their

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
relying on their strength their

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.310 
relying on their strength their
stability<00:00:29.039> all<00:00:29.910> their<00:00:30.090> training<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.960> get

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
stability all their training to get

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.720 
stability all their training to get
themselves<00:00:31.439> into<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.859> really<00:00:32.070> solid<00:00:32.309> strong

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
themselves into a really solid strong

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.090 
themselves into a really solid strong
position<00:00:33.180> which<00:00:33.989> allows<00:00:34.350> them<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.710> get<00:00:34.920> their

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
position which allows them to get their

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.940 
position which allows them to get their
wrists<00:00:35.430> behind<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.660> ball<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.170> they<00:00:37.260> often<00:00:37.620> end

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
wrists behind the ball so they often end

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.490 
wrists behind the ball so they often end
up<00:00:38.100> getting<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.670> position<00:00:39.149> here<00:00:39.450> using<00:00:40.440> a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
up getting in this position here using a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.020 
up getting in this position here using a
really<00:00:40.800> solid<00:00:41.010> strong<00:00:41.460> wrist<00:00:41.700> position

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
really solid strong wrist position

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.479 
really solid strong wrist position
you've<00:00:42.120> heard<00:00:42.300> me<00:00:42.450> talk<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.690> lot<00:00:42.960> about<00:00:43.489> and

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
you've heard me talk a lot about and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.250 
you've heard me talk a lot about and
having<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.940> semi<00:00:45.239> cocked<00:00:45.570> wrist<00:00:45.840> position

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
having the semi cocked wrist position

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.139 
having the semi cocked wrist position
this<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:47.010> think<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.370> where<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.610> really<00:00:47.850> comes

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
this I think is where it really comes

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.549 
this I think is where it really comes
into<00:00:48.390> its<00:00:48.480> own<00:00:48.719> where<00:00:49.110> you're<00:00:49.200> allowed<00:00:49.350> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
into its own where you're allowed a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.799 
into its own where you're allowed a
Beloit<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.610> ball<00:00:50.820> up<00:00:51.000> from<00:00:51.300> behind<00:00:51.449> you

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
Beloit in that ball up from behind you

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.110 
Beloit in that ball up from behind you
so<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.170> see<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:53.280> one<00:00:53.550> my<00:00:53.670> racket<00:00:54.030> is

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
so you can see this one my racket is

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.729 
so you can see this one my racket is
actually<00:00:54.390> perpendicular<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.320> side<00:00:55.530> wall

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
actually perpendicular to the side wall

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.590 
actually perpendicular to the side wall
which<00:00:56.520> means<00:00:56.550> if<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.030> hit<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> ball<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.480> that

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
which means if I hit the ball in that

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.150 
which means if I hit the ball in that
position<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.620> ball<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.070> go

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
position the ball is going to go

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.549 
position the ball is going to go
perfectly<00:00:59.699> straight<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.660> by<00:01:01.170> getting<00:01:01.230> that

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
perfectly straight so by getting that

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.500 
perfectly straight so by getting that
wrist<00:01:01.770> position<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.489> wrists<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.359> that

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
wrist position in wrists in that

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.299 
wrist position in wrists in that
position<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.500> actually<00:01:04.769> stay<00:01:04.979> really

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
position you can actually stay really

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.140 
position you can actually stay really
close<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> tee<00:01:06.119> do<00:01:06.810> less<00:01:07.049> work<00:01:07.640> but<00:01:08.640> allow

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
close to the tee do less work but allow

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.880 
close to the tee do less work but allow
myself<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.659> hit<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> ball<00:01:10.110> nice<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.590> straight

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
myself to hit the ball nice and straight

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.740 
myself to hit the ball nice and straight
so<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.100> see<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> lot<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.490> top<00:01:11.760> players<00:01:11.909> using

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
so you see a lot of top players using

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.240 
so you see a lot of top players using
this<00:01:12.869> tactic<00:01:13.260> someone<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:13.619> Greg<00:01:13.799> ulti<00:01:14.100> as<00:01:14.189> a

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
this tactic someone like Greg ulti as a

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.580 
this tactic someone like Greg ulti as a
classic<00:01:14.610> example<00:01:14.700> really<00:01:15.240> strong<00:01:15.479> great<00:01:16.409> risk

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
classic example really strong great risk

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.440 
classic example really strong great risk
position<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.340> know<00:01:17.430> he<00:01:17.549> starts<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.360> this

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
position you know he starts in this

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.929 
position you know he starts in this
position<00:01:18.960> anyway<00:01:19.439> but<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.520> movement

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
position anyway but this movement

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.460 
position anyway but this movement
pattern<00:01:21.240> allows<00:01:21.390> him<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.689> stay<00:01:21.930> closer<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
pattern allows him to stay closer to the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.770 
pattern allows him to stay closer to the
tee<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.920> then<00:01:23.430> straighten<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.000> ball<00:01:24.150> up<00:01:24.330> use

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
tee and then straighten the ball up use

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.320 
tee and then straighten the ball up use
quite<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> lot<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.290> whip<00:01:25.680> whip<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.490> rip<00:01:27.119> them

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
quite a lot of whip whip and rip them

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.300 
quite a lot of whip whip and rip them
you<00:01:27.750> know<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> strong<00:01:28.200> wrist<00:01:28.409> position<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
you know a strong wrist position to

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.859 
you know a strong wrist position to
follow-through<00:01:29.640> down<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.390> line<00:01:30.540> he<00:01:30.780> wants

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
follow-through down that line he wants

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.440 
follow-through down that line he wants
the<00:01:31.079> ball<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.259> go<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:32.430> then<00:01:32.579> he<00:01:32.850> will<00:01:33.000> send

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
the ball to go on but then he will send

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.149 
the ball to go on but then he will send
the<00:01:33.600> ball<00:01:33.750> back<00:01:34.229> into<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> back<00:01:34.680> corner<00:01:34.890> with

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the ball back into the back corner with

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.130 
the ball back into the back corner with
pace<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.240> his<00:01:36.329> opponent<00:01:36.479> may<00:01:36.810> have<00:01:36.930> thought

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
pace so his opponent may have thought

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.480 
pace so his opponent may have thought
they've<00:01:37.409> hit<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> decent<00:01:37.799> lens<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.400> he's

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
they've hit a decent lens but he's

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.190 
they've hit a decent lens but he's
actually<00:01:38.759> cut<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.090> off<00:01:39.210> taking<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.750> quick<00:01:39.960> and

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
actually cut it off taking it quick and

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.679 
actually cut it off taking it quick and
in<00:01:40.320> turn<00:01:40.560> has<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.040> put<00:01:41.280> more<00:01:42.119> pressure<00:01:42.360> on

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
in turn has just put more pressure on

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.389 
in turn has just put more pressure on
his<00:01:42.899> opponent<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.979> definitely<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.369> more

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
his opponent so it's definitely a more

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.700 
his opponent so it's definitely a more
advanced<00:01:45.030> way<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> get<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> ball<00:01:46.500> out<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
advanced way to get the ball out the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.249 
advanced way to get the ball out the
back<00:01:46.829> corner<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:48.180> or<00:01:48.450> even<00:01:48.479> prevent<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
back corner and be or even prevent the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.810 
back corner and be or even prevent the
ball<00:01:49.470> from<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.740> into<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.220> back<00:01:50.340> corner<00:01:50.520> but

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
ball from going into the back corner but

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.940 
ball from going into the back corner but
kind<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.540> taking<00:01:51.630> more<00:01:52.020> direct<00:01:52.380> line<00:01:52.500> doing<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
kind of taking more direct line doing a

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.770 
kind of taking more direct line doing a
little<00:01:53.130> bit<00:01:53.340> less<00:01:53.579> work<00:01:53.729> yourself<00:01:54.540> but

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
little bit less work yourself but

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.530 
little bit less work yourself but
relying<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.350> strong<00:01:55.680> technique<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.270> strong

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
relying on strong technique and a strong

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.959 
relying on strong technique and a strong
body<00:01:57.750> position<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.829> then<00:01:58.979> put<00:01:59.250> pressure<00:01:59.640> on

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
body position to then put pressure on

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.020 
body position to then put pressure on
your<00:02:00.180> opponent<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.930> attack<00:02:01.680> them<00:02:02.009> from<00:02:02.759> what

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
your opponent and attack them from what

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.520 
your opponent and attack them from what
they<00:02:03.299> may<00:02:03.509> have<00:02:03.540> thought<00:02:03.869> might<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.259> been<00:02:04.320> an

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
they may have thought might have been an

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.499 
they may have thought might have been an
attacking<00:02:04.860> position<00:02:05.100> themselves<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.060> I'm

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
attacking position themselves so I'm

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.700 
attacking position themselves so I'm
going<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:06.899> give<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.229> couple<00:02:07.469> of

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
going to just give you a couple of

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.270 
going to just give you a couple of
examples<00:02:08.250> here<00:02:08.539> try<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.660> demo<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.280> and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
examples here try and demo it and and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.410 
examples here try and demo it and and
see<00:02:11.550> what<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.730> looks<00:02:11.879> like

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.459 

so<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.510> can<00:02:16.599> see<00:02:16.719> I've<00:02:16.810> got<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.049> ball<00:02:17.230> really

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
so you can see I've got that ball really

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.640 
so you can see I've got that ball really
nice<00:02:17.739> and<00:02:17.980> straight<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:19.269> that<00:02:19.329> to<00:02:19.959> taking<00:02:20.560> that

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
nice and straight is that to taking that

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.830 
nice and straight is that to taking that
direct<00:02:21.069> line<00:02:21.219> to<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.430> back<00:02:21.609> corner<00:02:21.750> hit<00:02:22.750> the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
direct line to the back corner hit the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.809 
direct line to the back corner hit the
ball<00:02:22.989> from<00:02:23.140> there<00:02:23.439> but<00:02:23.769> then<00:02:23.920> in<00:02:24.069> one<00:02:24.280> step

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
ball from there but then in one step

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.729 
ball from there but then in one step
I'm<00:02:24.879> essentially<00:02:25.269> back<00:02:25.569> on<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.840> tee<00:02:26.049> and<00:02:26.260> then

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
I'm essentially back on the tee and then

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.140 
I'm essentially back on the tee and then
the<00:02:26.859> rally<00:02:27.040> looking<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.489> put<00:02:27.609> pressure<00:02:27.760> on<00:02:28.000> my

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
the rally looking to put pressure on my

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.540 
the rally looking to put pressure on my
opponent
