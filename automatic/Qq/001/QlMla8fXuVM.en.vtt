00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.370
 and the fire between the airport and Putilov 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.990
 bridge he advances infantry precisely 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.580
 battalion east now units 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.870
 Sparta will also come with him on 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.910
 reinforcements also in defense operations 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:19.439
 Donetsk airport and position in the rear 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.519
 Somali tanks help here. 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.109
 the task of the infantry here is to take positions with 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.060
 grenade launcher case if the enemy with 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.579
 Putilov bridge side will try 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.499
 break through to a new terminal 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.240
 just a few minutes before 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.710
 began another breakthrough Ukrainian 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.240
 army truth is no longer by 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.090
 the runway to the new 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.540
 terminal but from avdeevki through 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.090
 village Spartak Putilovskom near the bridge 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.050
 so trying to cut off 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.720
 Ukrainian military with infantry and but 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.400
 not specifically 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.030
 tanks in general airport defense 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.770
 take her motorola ring here literally 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.420
 speak for a few minutes repeat them 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.199
 gave us a big interview about 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.299
 how are things at the airport on that 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.119
 the situation was tense too 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.689
 but a little calmer than these 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.990
 minutes 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.950
 attack on Putilov bridge and took in 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.799
 including by 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.950
 artillery militia as far as we are 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.240
 known damy ukrainian orbit as well 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.240
 left possible and 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:48.150
 in the area but that's where we are now 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:50.220
 drive up we managed to get to 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.930
 advanced positions of the battalion Sparta 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.110
 new terminal directly on 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.120
 fourth floor here to us 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.450
 demonstrated trophy weapons 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.030
 found in piled weapons rooms 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.800
 who are now sorting out fixed 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.070
 the new terminal was equipped with firing 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.350
 points for a weird production we 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.990
 made a sweep all the room 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.160
 which left the whole debris deck 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.890
 early and a weapon was found which 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.400
 Ukrainian army regular troops she 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:28.170
 Well, it does not stand on arms as far as 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.980
 I deal with weapons and rock and charger 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.690
 amd found by patrons found 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.040
 what conclusion from this is possible well and so 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.950
 I think that not only fought here 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:45.330
 Ukrainian army which will kill 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.540
 us but also mercenaries from europe and countries 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.540
 NATO
