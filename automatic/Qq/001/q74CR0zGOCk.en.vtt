00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 just a step now is just a step and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.639
 dick climbed up so you got take 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.830
 lever and go back to the normal world so 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.300
 what his old man is great super 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.309
 all take away from here nafig 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.770
 so that you know yes and so on 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.430
 did that everyone knew that there was yes here 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.199
 so here's another such where 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.029
 lever make you get take 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.160
 chuck come back to my world so well here 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.960
 It seems to be necessary to accurately never well again 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.370
 normal world so normal try 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:39.840
 Now you can see where that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.780
 I missed the sign of the kite here 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.809
 seemingly where nothing is right yes 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:52.800
 in principle, it is also not visible on Che 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.899
 Nothing too well as it and not crowning 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.570
 such a suspicious we do not even see 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.950
 even about the plates nothing 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.760
 written it all read it too everything is clean 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.730
 and you can make out a redstone- type door with 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.530
 using the lever to open the seal from the diet 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.530
 here blind and whatâ€™s out of brine on men 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.620
 country from and in fact I just 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.950
 see nothing of these materials but it 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:27.770
 I read, too, my God, my God, I barely 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.630
 noticed this change right if you 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.260
 think up but you are at least not so complicated 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.190
 guys 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.460
 barely visible just barely visible so I 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.050
 I thought everything was flooding the card so what is there 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.490
 we have to teach the night this here this 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:47.860
 ok so although you get some sleep and Th 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:51.170
 now still i'm gonna die so your elevator is about 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.600
 super don't break it okay 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.930
 Now try to ride on his own 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.930
 an elevator 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.829
 oh fine very fast as usual prince 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.340
 so we fall 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:18.099
 Okay that's fine m mol 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:22.390
 danger pixel art cool rainbow 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:26.180
 so much all at once so okay 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.330
 carefully minefield and so on 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:34.400
 what to do it just run on the back and 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:37.160
 all but quietly ok put everything in the chest 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.590
 pressure plates know and that's it all 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.910
 I have the rest are not collected 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.530
 going though 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.049
 or does he mean all pripyat 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.510
 collect due in strongly tough to me 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.000
 it seems I can not oh well nafig now 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:55.069
 just die there is not yet the sword is all 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.599
 okay so put the complexity ok i 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.079
 already guess what month someone beat 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.819
 there will be normal so ok let's 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.600
 let's just put for reliability 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.959
 easy set it seems no accident in me 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.870
 weaver so actually I understand that 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.940
 that should be in these chests well 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.160
 start time in order to accurately and well, 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:21.640
 or randomly try so clearly understood 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:26.250
 broke everything 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.569
 so what we have here is what I can quickly 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.040
 like but it will be too easy ok 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:35.430
 we put all the same normal complexity 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:37.720
 as written so no zombies nafig you 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:46.390
 so okay, let's try immediately on 2 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:49.180
 open nothing like that no eq 2 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.800
 the archer this is kapets it already hurts it already 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:56.140
 hurt guys different from everyone killed so 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.480
 it will be necessary to capture this thing to us 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:03.180
 some kind of replenish 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.180
 so I did not watch it did not watch 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.800
 who I missed it before I'll take it away 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.400
 this person 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.520
 wonder what a petty dwarf god 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.480
 got scared 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:26.640
 so were the third like too 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:26.640
 nothing is perfect, and now this number has 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.620
 maybe there is something or I need 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.629
 desiccant they need to urge you 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.509
 to summon the wither it will be ass 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:42.740
 him that he will not kill I can not guard 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:42.740
 fight with a teacher in leather armor about 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.789
 the lever i saw there the lever was why are you 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.360
 he was not afraid that took months, 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.569
 greece or 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.149
 so great 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:56.610
 maybe there 's something else let's all at once 

00:04:54.149 --> 00:05:01.159
 check it seems to me but still needs to be 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:06.360
 at least something and don't hit me and come in 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:07.069
 begone die because God is now all 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.129
 quick 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:17.729
 let's live it 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:18.779
 here we have something written about pumpkin 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:23.899
 found a pumpkin 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:28.589
 cool so okay I think everything 

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:32.009
 it's time to site lever yes so and what is it here 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:33.869
 us, in principle, time is not difficult for us 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:38.899
 asked me not start need anything else 

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:42.899
 touch so there is nothing well ok 

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:46.740
