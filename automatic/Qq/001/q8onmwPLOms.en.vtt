00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.779
 Hey guys, how are you 

00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:03.120
 I hope it's ok 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.300
 I am you fuck 0 0 and this one I will dedicate it to one of the games that more 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.999
 I like the beach two 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:11.299
 spoke of Uzbek soil fumes 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.409
 Ok, let's begin 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:17.300
 development some the colossus was created by fumito ueda which also gave 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.519
 origin to ico another game that is for the same console 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.849
 in this game the aesthetics of ico is retaken but with a story that captivates 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.030
 From the beginning 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.730
 the protagonist who mysteriously do not know the name damn fumito him 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.220
 you would have put a proper name should go to a forbidden world away from everything 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.010
 to rescue a woman who has lost her soul 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.670
 a voice tells him that the only way to do it is to defeat the giants 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.110
 gigantic characters and ready 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.130
 easy to understand the no 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.260
 Now that you know the story I will explain a bit about the game 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.120
 at the beginning they show us a medium or long video that we can see 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.199
 the arrival of the prota 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.850
 mounted on his faithful horse and carrying a strange bundle to the forbidden people 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.090
 besides that in the same video we will discover the objective that the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.640
 Prota and the presentation of a mysterious voice proposing a treatment to the 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.360
 same 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.400
 then the voice tells us a kind of riddle to be able to find the first 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.530
 colossus and to start the play 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.570
 what I will say one thing if in the game not once to anyone do not worry 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.930
 since the main feature of this game is that 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.120
 yes yes there is no one 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.650
 It is the first game I see that there is no one else but the leader of his horse 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.560
 Hahaha 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.229
 following the theme through the lightsaber I say the special sword of the 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.289
 prota you have to go guiding you to be able to find the first colossus of a 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.869
 Long list of 16 shit are not many hehe 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.210
 as follows 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.670
 with a button the protal for his sword 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.310
 in that way the sword will throw a few lines of lights i silas to points towards 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.570
 the address where the colossus is 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.150
 the lines will come together and in that way you will find 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.350
 after having searched and found the first colossus, the next thing is to get on 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.800
 above the moustro 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.339
 pa throughout the game will be more difficult 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:12.059
 and stick the sword in a specific area that lights up with a 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:13.479
 kind of symbol 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:15.089
 what does clarify the arc 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:18.949
 throughout the game you will have to capture some orange fruits and 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:22.620
 a few white tail lizards since he has got these objects 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.829
 your life bar if you catch the fruits and you / of resistance 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.829
 if you catch the lizards they will increase 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.550
 then 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.130
 I will tell you the characters of sadous de colossus 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.959
 so they know who is who 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.579
 do not worry there are not many 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:39.980
 the nameless star 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.060
 It is our protagonist who risked everything with the aim of rescuing the soul 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.089
 of the woman 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:47.659
 we do not know why it will be for love 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.769
 what do i know 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.109
 his faithful horse 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.180
 thanks to him we can travel long distances in addition to helping us 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.129
 time to fight with the giants 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.950
 the sleeping girl that the prota brings her to this city to recover her 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.029
 soul 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:03.830
 durbin 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.810
 It is the mysterious voice, although it suggests in spreading the mission of ending the 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.740
 colossuses in order to awaken the monkey in addition to giving protocol approach 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.300
 children so you know where they are before going to face 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.939
 each one of them 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.900
 the funny thing about this character is his indecipherable language to which he speaks 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.329
 LOL 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.219
 I shit laughing listening to him ha ha 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:25.359
 the giants 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.649
 the colossi are the only enemies that we will find in this game 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:32.650
 They are in large areas at the time of battle 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.370
 but they are difficult i 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.459
 impossible to find them in the mat ita those who have the game 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.009
 they will understand hahahaha 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:43.319
 Some forms of colossi are easy to recognize 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.069
 like deer minotaur and so on 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.639
 but some do not have a characteristic shape although they are shocking 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.499
 since there are two-legged colossi that look really intimidating 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:58.689
 we already talked about the characters history and the game now I will talk about 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.959
 some points in favor and against 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.980
 a point in favor is the aesthetics of this game throughout this one 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.189
 we will see that the landscapes besides being well stylized 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.879
 They are changing around which direction the prota is heading on the map 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.139
 as areas of true forest until ruins of the old town 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.609
 really this game got all the juice that the beach and two can win 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.919
 not only the landscapes are well stylized 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.689
 The same colossi are also well designed, since we do not know exactly what 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:30.949
 are actually because in some areas of their bodies are komphela gy and others of 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:31.669
 stone 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.650
 another point in favor is besides the sound is your commands if you get used to 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.680
 them then that will be very easy 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.680
 but one of the points against is the supposed monotheist who has the 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.439
 game 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:45.090
 now I will explain 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.350
 in the game after killing the colossus the prota absorbs a black spirit and 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.509
 faint i 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.289
 when he wakes up he discovers that he is in the temple again to begin 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:55.780
 look for the next colossus 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.150
 I will give you my opinion 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.370
 yes it may be that for some the game gets a bit tired since you get the 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.220
 you spend 20 minutes or more looking for the colossus plus you have to do 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.330
 the same thing again and again 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.360
 In my case, the same thing did not happen to me, since it intrigued me to know 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.220
 which was the next colossus and I did not mind traveling almost the entire map 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.389
 hehe 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.550
 well to finish an opinion 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.730
 clarified not to reveal the ending because if you are not you would shit the game to those who 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.879
 they want to buy it xd 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:27.830
 this game is very good I recommend it p 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.090
 oo if you're one of those demanding guys with games, it's going to bore you a bit for 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.449
 the hairy hand 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.699
 if you are one of those people that you like to entertain yourself and ready 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:41.550
 this game will like you if you liked ico then you have to buy tea this 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.129
 game since you will find some answers to the questions that one day 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:47.249
 did you play aÃ­co 

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:48.759
 Nothing else to say 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:49.870
 I say goodbye
