other one of us climbed up the little

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.480 
other one of us climbed up the little
you<00:02:38.230> know<00:02:38.320> foot<00:02:38.530> holes<00:02:38.740> in<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.010> wall<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.220> we

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
you know foot holes in the wall that we

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.360 
you know foot holes in the wall that we
built<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:41.590> know<00:02:41.620> grabbed<00:02:41.950> onto<00:02:42.130> her<00:02:42.280> arm

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
and we pulled each other out I think I

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.380 
and we pulled each other out I think I
was<00:02:43.960> the<00:02:43.990> second<00:02:44.710> one<00:02:44.830> out<00:02:44.860> yeah<00:02:45.550> pretty<00:02:46.300> sure

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
was the second one out yeah pretty sure

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.300 
was the second one out yeah pretty sure
about<00:02:46.630> that<00:02:46.900> I<00:02:47.110> think<00:02:47.380> i<00:02:47.440> boosted<00:02:47.650> him

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
about that I think i boosted him

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.570 
about that I think i boosted him
so<00:02:49.910> yeah<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.870> was<00:02:51.050> it<00:02:51.770> was<00:02:51.950> definitely<00:02:52.310> a

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580

ground
other<00:03:19.880> people<00:03:20.210> don't<00:03:20.360> always<00:03:20.600> act<00:03:20.960> like<00:03:21.080> that

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
other people don't always act like that

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.140

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
worrying and that doesn't solve anything

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.990 
worrying and that doesn't solve anything
so<00:03:26.090> why<00:03:26.240> bother<00:03:26.420> being<00:03:26.660> worried<00:03:27.940> it's<00:03:28.940> not
