these it more
more<00:02:13.240> advanced<00:02:13.570> devices<00:02:13.960> that<00:02:14.260> we<00:02:14.410> have<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:15.010> I

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
more advanced devices that we have and I

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.980 
more advanced devices that we have and I
think<00:02:15.640> we're<00:02:15.820> probably<00:02:16.030> just<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.600> few<00:02:16.840> years

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
think we're probably just a few years

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.930 
think we're probably just a few years
away<00:02:17.200> from<00:02:17.350> significantly<00:02:18.280> longer<00:02:18.520> battery

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
away from significantly longer battery

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.140 
away from significantly longer battery
lives<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.540> lot<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.870> personal<00:02:20.290> products<00:02:20.890> yeah<00:02:21.880> we
