 I manifest that they are their paternal grandparents 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.030
 the mystery around arnold and the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.129
 full name became a gag 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.989
 in the program since several times in a 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.090

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.810
 you know what is level and it appears in the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.030
 chapter where a comet is going to pass 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.399
 in your city you see clearly when the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.850
 mailman delivers the telescope and in the 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.860
 label says arnold revealing number 14 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.869

 Friends is what's it and it's never 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.100
 mentioned as such but in many of 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.289
 his episodes the name of the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.569
 what's it and as well as in your shops 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.720
 commercial spaces and in the mailboxes of

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.679
 appears more times in the series is yahoo 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.020
 which is the same brand of sodas that 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.819
 appears in the cantankerous beavers it 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.220
 can notice clearly in the episode 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.270
 where stinky is a model of that brand 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.280
 of soft drinks 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.380
 apparently the unification of brands in 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.130
 soda was very common in nickelodeon in 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.079
 that time number 12 was thought to follow the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.239
 series with an arnold movie in san 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.579
 lorenzo where he goes in search of his 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.440
 parents having a plot very similar to 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.040
 the ones used by tom berries 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.840
 this 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.370
 it was the case by which nickelodeon 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.530
 will change spin and make the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.989
 creator will create the arnold movie that 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.239
 we all met despite this love 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.129
 movie did not have the required success but 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.469
 this has not been an impediment for 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.599
 arnold has not won an Oscar 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:33.720
 for the short film arnold escapes from the 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.819

 the slovak teacher of the fourth grade is 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.549
 one of the first characters 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.799
 homosexuals of the series of nick such 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.959
 It may not be so remarkable but how can we 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.629
 observe has a garden very much in the style 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.489
 Florist is passionate about the arts 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.680
 poems and even his teaching method 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.139
 It is based on respect for thoughts 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.150
 outsiders in the action chapter of 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:59.099
 thank you 'Mr. Simmons' mother does 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.109
 a comment to the one that says that the lord 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.480
 simmons and his friend like to go to 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.000
 ballet making reference that they had a 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.650
 secret love can be noticed in 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.109
 other episodes where he and the director 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.329
 from school they have a little friendship 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.519
 different as when they sing karaoke or 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.040
 when they come out in the video to show the 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.019
 teacher of the year number 10 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.150
 miriam pataky the mother of gel ga is 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.459
 alcoholic maybe it is not shown so 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.439
 explicitly but she has all the 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.049
 behaviors of an alcoholic like 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.390
 Nervousness awakening with migraines all 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.790
 the mornings and falling asleep while 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.920
 is eating with sleepy eyes it 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.230
 You can tell this is noticeable but 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.269
 a slightly subliminal way to the same 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.579
 time is observed that she is a mother 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.400
 absent and distracted because of its serious 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.650
 addiction to alcohol number 9 the lord

 smith guest of the house was never 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.760
 shown in the series and not only that 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.709
 we can see that only his 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.989
 presence in two episodes of the series 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.730
 we can also see that after the 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.530
 second season stop appearing 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.260

 number 8 returning to the tenants of 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.590

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.840
 last episode the newspaper that was the 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.410

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.610
 of harold and the veterans chapter 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.159

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:33.569
 have prejudices of any kind from 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:35.460
 incorporate an African-American character 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:37.620

 underground there are two curious situations 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:52.259
 the first is that at the beginning of the episode 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.270

 four first seasons of the series 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.080

 that formerly worked by throwing 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.680
 a few coins only for guests the thing 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.110
 is that in these washing machines they all say 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.640

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.470
 the character of Sponge Bob is based 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.480

 both characters are similar to 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.729
 exception that there are jeans always going

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.490
