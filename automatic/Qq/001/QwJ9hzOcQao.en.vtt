vaporeon so we're gonna have max special
tech<00:01:57.049> and<00:01:57.290> max<00:01:57.950> HP<00:01:58.250> now<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.030> reason<00:01:59.240> why<00:01:59.420> I

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
tech and max HP now the reason why I

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.280 
tech and max HP now the reason why I
have<00:01:59.630> max<00:01:59.900> HP<00:02:00.290> is<00:02:00.770> because<00:02:01.570> we<00:02:02.570> already<00:02:02.780> have

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
have max HP is because we already have

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.219 
have max HP is because we already have
the<00:02:03.619> assault<00:02:03.950> vest<00:02:04.189> on<00:02:04.340> vaporeon<00:02:05.210> and<00:02:05.420> we<00:02:06.110> do

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
the assault vest on vaporeon and we do

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.589 
the assault vest on vaporeon and we do
not<00:02:06.380> need<00:02:06.680> like<00:02:07.040> that<00:02:07.340> many<00:02:07.610> investments<00:02:08.479> into

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
not need like that many investments into

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.270 
not need like that many investments into
a<00:02:08.780> special<00:02:09.259> defense<00:02:09.560> which<00:02:09.799> I'm<00:02:09.979> going<00:02:10.099> to<00:02:10.159> be

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
a special defense which I'm going to be

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.729 
a special defense which I'm going to be
putting<00:02:10.519> for<00:02:10.879> which<00:02:11.209> is<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.450> last<00:02:11.689> bb's<00:02:12.620> we

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
putting for which is the last bb's we

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.410 
putting for which is the last bb's we
can<00:02:12.890> put<00:02:13.069> on<00:02:13.189> it<00:02:13.370> because<00:02:13.970> they<00:02:14.150> have<00:02:14.269> you<00:02:14.360> to

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
can put on it because they have you to

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.699 
can put on it because they have you to
solve<00:02:14.659> this<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:14.959> this<00:02:15.049> thing<00:02:15.260> can<00:02:15.409> eat<00:02:15.590> up

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
solve this and this thing can eat up

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.059 
solve this and this thing can eat up
special<00:02:16.310> hits<00:02:16.519> for<00:02:16.730> days<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.540> was<00:02:18.349> an<00:02:18.620> energy

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
special hits for days it was an energy

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.710 
special hits for days it was an energy
ball<00:02:19.220> will<00:02:19.489> only<00:02:19.640> do<00:02:19.849> like<00:02:19.970> twenty<00:02:20.330> percent<00:02:20.599> a

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
ball will only do like twenty percent a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.690 
ball will only do like twenty percent a
soybean<00:02:21.049> only

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
soybean only

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.850 
soybean only
then<00:02:21.879> you<00:02:21.940> like<00:02:22.090> 50<00:02:22.900> roughly<00:02:23.319> sixty<00:02:23.709> percent

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
then you like 50 roughly sixty percent

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.740 
then you like 50 roughly sixty percent
and<00:02:24.310> usually<00:02:24.910> we<00:02:25.000> don't<00:02:25.120> have<00:02:25.330> an<00:02:25.450> assault

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
and usually we don't have an assault

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.869 
and usually we don't have an assault
best<00:02:25.989> you<00:02:26.200> have<00:02:26.260> max<00:02:26.530> HP<00:02:26.800> max<00:02:27.250> special<00:02:27.610> defense

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
best you have max HP max special defense

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.100 
best you have max HP max special defense
you<00:02:28.629> will<00:02:28.750> probably<00:02:28.959> be<00:02:29.440> in<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.709> red<00:02:30.010> range<00:02:30.280> so

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
you will probably be in the red range so

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.660 
you will probably be in the red range so
appalling<00:02:32.110> assault<00:02:32.500> best<00:02:32.709> will<00:02:32.830> do<00:02:32.980> it's<00:02:33.280> some

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
appalling assault best will do it's some

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.979 
appalling assault best will do it's some
good<00:02:33.910> because<00:02:34.209> then<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.480> can<00:02:34.629> actually<00:02:34.900> learn

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
good because then you can actually learn

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.330 
good because then you can actually learn
more<00:02:35.200> special<00:02:35.650> attacking<00:02:36.040> hits<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:37.410> um<00:02:38.410> for

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
the max HP like i was saying its defense

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.180 
the max HP like i was saying its defense
is<00:02:43.090> crap<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.810> usually<00:02:44.019> people<00:02:44.260> run<00:02:44.560> bold<00:02:44.800> but

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
is crap and usually people run bold but

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.830 
is crap and usually people run bold but
i<00:02:45.370> want<00:02:45.910> a<00:02:46.000> special<00:02:46.360> attacking<00:02:46.950> vaporeon<00:02:47.950> and

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
hopefully that max HP you can live some

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.000 
hopefully that max HP you can live some
physical<00:02:52.750> hits<00:02:52.989> I'm<00:02:53.260> not<00:02:53.650> saying<00:02:53.890> it's

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
physical hits I'm not saying it's

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.030 
physical hits I'm not saying it's
possible<00:02:54.400> or<00:02:55.000> it's<00:02:55.510> impossible<00:02:56.230> but<00:02:56.769> it<00:02:56.890> is

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
possible or it's impossible but it is

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.940 
possible or it's impossible but it is
possible<00:02:57.730> if<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:58.150> makes<00:02:58.330> any<00:02:58.420> sense<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:59.650> for

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
possible if that makes any sense so for

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.470 
possible if that makes any sense so for
the<00:03:00.010> moves<00:03:00.220> obviously<00:03:00.819> we<00:03:00.970> can't<00:03:01.150> run<00:03:01.299> any

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
the moves obviously we can't run any

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.240 
the moves obviously we can't run any
sense<00:03:01.750> condition<00:03:02.290> moves<00:03:02.500> like<00:03:02.769> window<00:03:03.069> with

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
sense condition moves like window with

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.339 
sense condition moves like window with
or<00:03:03.459> toxic<00:03:03.940> because<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.780> have<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.019> assault

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
or toxic because you have the assault

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.759 
or toxic because you have the assault
vest<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.829> you<00:03:06.400> can't<00:03:06.640> run<00:03:06.819> any<00:03:07.030> moves<00:03:07.299> like

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
vest and you can't run any moves like

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.680 
vest and you can't run any moves like
rest<00:03:08.769> or<00:03:09.400> stores<00:03:09.819> dance<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.360> stuff<00:03:10.480> like<00:03:10.630> that

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
rest or stores dance and stuff like that

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.240 
rest or stores dance and stuff like that
so<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.230> only<00:03:11.380> moves<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:11.709> can<00:03:11.799> actually<00:03:11.950> have

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
so the only moves you can actually have

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.729 
so the only moves you can actually have
or<00:03:12.489> like<00:03:12.670> attacking<00:03:13.630> moves<00:03:13.959> like<00:03:14.380> special

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
or like attacking moves like special

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.370 
or like attacking moves like special

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
attacking a physical attacking soap for

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.289 
attacking a physical attacking soap for
the<00:03:17.470> move<00:03:17.739> where<00:03:18.400> I'm<00:03:18.519> going<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.730> be<00:03:18.849> running

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
the move where I'm going to be running

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.710 
the move where I'm going to be running
Shadow<00:03:19.780> Ball<00:03:20.019> now<00:03:20.650> what<00:03:21.459> I<00:03:21.489> Ron<00:03:21.910> is<00:03:22.090> signal

Shadow Ball now what I Ron is signal

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.479 
Shadow Ball now what I Ron is signal
beam<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.170> signal<00:03:23.500> beam<00:03:23.620> is<00:03:23.799> a<00:03:23.890> transfer<00:03:24.310> move

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
beam and signal beam is a transfer move

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.280 
beam and signal beam is a transfer move
so<00:03:24.760> if<00:03:24.940> you<00:03:25.030> guys<00:03:25.150> want<00:03:25.420> a<00:03:25.480> poking<00:03:25.810> are<00:03:25.989> they

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
pointing on with signal beam you're

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.170 
pointing on with signal beam you're
gonna<00:03:27.880> have<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.600> ask<00:03:29.560> someone<00:03:30.100> to<00:03:30.519> actually

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
gonna have to ask someone to actually

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.449 
gonna have to ask someone to actually
pokey<00:03:31.569> Jennifer<00:03:32.019> you<00:03:32.200> but<00:03:32.799> I<00:03:33.040> would<00:03:33.340> actually

pokey Jennifer you but I would actually

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.220 
pokey Jennifer you but I would actually
recommend<00:03:33.760> running<00:03:34.239> signaling<00:03:34.810> because<00:03:35.079> it

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
recommend running signaling because it

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.740 
recommend running signaling because it
actually<00:03:35.440> helps<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.250> lot<00:03:36.639> because<00:03:37.269> I've<00:03:37.540> seen<00:03:37.720> a

best move so the next move I'm going to

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.759 
best move so the next move I'm going to
put<00:04:12.489> on<00:04:12.639> is<00:04:12.880> ice<00:04:13.299> beam<00:04:13.569> for<00:04:13.750> coverage<00:04:14.200> because

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
put on is ice beam for coverage because

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:15.990 
put on is ice beam for coverage because
a<00:04:14.799> lot<00:04:15.220> of<00:04:15.250> charging<00:04:15.609> types<00:04:15.819> out<00:04:15.940> there

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
a lot of charging types out there

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.449 
a lot of charging types out there
obviously<00:04:16.560> because<00:04:17.560> dragons<00:04:17.799> is<00:04:18.130> like<00:04:18.280> the

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
obviously because dragons is like the

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.879 
obviously because dragons is like the
best<00:04:18.639> I<00:04:19.200> wouldn't<00:04:20.200> say<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.410> best<00:04:20.620> but<00:04:20.799> like

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
best I wouldn't say the best but like

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.129 
best I wouldn't say the best but like
one<00:04:21.400> of<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:21.789> best<00:04:22.030> typing<00:04:22.539> out<00:04:22.720> there<00:04:22.960> because

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
one of the best typing out there because

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.550 
one of the best typing out there because
they<00:04:23.380> can<00:04:23.530> learn<00:04:23.680> a<00:04:23.860> variety<00:04:24.820> of<00:04:25.180> moves<00:04:25.720> from

they're going to be snapped because they

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.580 
they're going to be snapped because they

move<00:04:40.039> to<00:04:40.310> actually<00:04:40.699> put<00:04:40.909> on<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.210> pony<00:04:41.479> art<00:04:41.659> is

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
move to actually put on the pony art is

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.589 
move to actually put on the pony art is
stalled<00:04:42.259> because<00:04:42.889> it<00:04:43.610> will<00:04:43.819> actually<00:04:43.970> flood

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
stalled because it will actually flood

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.279 
stalled because it will actually flood
burn<00:04:44.930> like<00:04:45.470> where<00:04:45.830> is<00:04:45.889> it<00:04:46.039> but<00:04:46.550> one<00:04:46.729> fourth<00:04:47.060> of

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
burn like where is it but one fourth of

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.320 
burn like where is it but one fourth of
this<00:04:48.289> thirty<00:04:48.560> percent<00:04:48.889> chance<00:04:49.190> so<00:04:49.580> I'm

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
this thirty percent chance so I'm

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.969 
this thirty percent chance so I'm
getting<00:04:50.690> a<00:04:50.750> thirty<00:04:50.930> percent<00:04:51.199> chance<00:04:51.409> on<00:04:51.650> burn

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
getting a thirty percent chance on burn

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.649 
getting a thirty percent chance on burn
is<00:04:52.220> actually<00:04:52.580> very<00:04:52.610> good<00:04:52.940> because<00:04:53.120> if<00:04:53.389> you<00:04:53.479> get

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:53.659 
is actually very good because if you get

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:56.260 
is actually very good because if you get
the<00:04:53.780> burn<00:04:53.990> you<00:04:54.500> have<00:04:54.680> more<00:04:55.069> likely<00:04:55.550> chance<00:04:55.909> to

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
the burn you have more likely chance to

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.050 
the burn you have more likely chance to
actually<00:04:56.419> make<00:04:56.990> a<00:04:57.020> live<00:04:57.590> a<00:04:57.620> physical<00:04:58.129> hit<00:04:58.340> from

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
actually make a live a physical hit from

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.360 
actually make a live a physical hit from
like<00:04:59.270> let's<00:04:59.539> say<00:04:59.659> a<00:05:00.020> weakness<00:05:00.470> policy<00:05:00.979> dragon

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
like let's say a weakness policy dragon

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.369 
like let's say a weakness policy dragon
dance<00:05:01.580> dragon<00:05:02.090> knight<00:05:02.240> you<00:05:02.780> won't<00:05:02.960> take<00:05:03.229> it

dance dragon knight you won't take it
very<00:05:03.500> well<00:05:03.710> but<00:05:03.979> you<00:05:04.129> will<00:05:04.250> surely<00:05:04.639> most

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
very well but you will surely most

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.570 
very well but you will surely most
likely<00:05:05.479> live<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.990> hit<00:05:06.349> I'm<00:05:07.190> not<00:05:07.400> a<00:05:07.460> hundred

likely live a hit I'm not a hundred
percent<00:05:07.759> sure<00:05:08.030> because<00:05:08.270> it<00:05:08.479> isn't<00:05:08.840> like<00:05:09.219> plus

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:42.249 
signal beam and Shadow Ball I would
recommend<00:05:40.909> getting<00:05:41.300> rid<00:05:41.569> of<00:05:41.599> hydro<00:05:42.050> pump

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:42.259 
recommend getting rid of hydro pump

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:43.899 
recommend getting rid of hydro pump
because<00:05:42.469> stalled<00:05:42.979> is<00:05:43.159> like<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.430> best<00:05:43.580> water

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
because stalled is like the best water

because stalled is like the best water
time<00:05:44.150> loop<00:05:44.330> for<00:05:44.930> vaporeon<00:05:45.529> because<00:05:45.800> you<00:05:45.889> get

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:46.069 
time loop for vaporeon because you get

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:48.399 
time loop for vaporeon because you get
the<00:05:46.190> thirty<00:05:46.370> percent<00:05:46.699> chance<00:05:47.029> burn<00:05:47.419> and<00:05:47.750> I

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:48.409 
the thirty percent chance burn and I

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:51.629 
the thirty percent chance burn and I
will<00:05:48.529> basically<00:05:48.919> make<00:05:49.069> Nick<00:05:49.430> Corey<00:05:49.729> on<00:05:49.940> and<00:05:50.270> um

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
will basically make Nick Corey on and um

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:54.999 
will basically make Nick Corey on and um
