00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
taller than the side wall so if you have

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.240 
taller than the side wall so if you have
a<00:02:23.670> large<00:02:23.970> piece<00:02:24.210> of<00:02:24.240> equipment<00:02:24.950> motorhome<00:02:25.950> or

it<00:02:28.410> needs<00:02:28.590> more<00:02:28.770> height<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.310> still<00:02:29.580> put

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
it needs more height you can still put

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.000 
it needs more height you can still put

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
works as you can see with this here you

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.930 
works as you can see with this here you
don't<00:02:40.680> need<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.950> truss<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.400> your<00:02:41.580> end<00:02:41.730> wall

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
don't need a truss on your end wall

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
don't need a truss on your end wall
because<00:02:42.300> you're<00:02:42.420> going<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.600> have<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.750> steel

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
because you're going to have a steel

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.250 
because you're going to have a steel
wall<00:02:43.230> here<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.680> have<00:02:43.800> posts<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:45.020> you<00:02:46.020> have<00:02:46.140> to

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
wall here you have posts and you have to

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.110 
wall here you have posts and you have to
put<00:02:46.410> wood<00:02:46.620> up<00:02:46.710> there<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.220> attach<00:02:47.550> your<00:02:47.790> metal

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
put wood up there to attach your metal

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.720 
put wood up there to attach your metal
anyway<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:49.590> we<00:02:49.890> just<00:02:50.040> make<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.400> girder<00:02:50.640> and

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
anyway so we just make it a girder and

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.300 
anyway so we just make it a girder and
you<00:02:51.000> don't<00:02:51.150> need<00:02:51.300> steel<00:02:51.570> on<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.900> end<00:02:52.110> as

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
you don't need steel on that end as

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.880 
you don't need steel on that end as
shown<00:02:53.310> here<00:02:53.640> we<00:02:54.450> also<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:54.990> demonstrates<00:02:55.800> the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
shown here we also this demonstrates the

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.170 
shown here we also this demonstrates the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
same thing you can put a door taller

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.660 
same thing you can put a door taller
than<00:02:57.390> your<00:02:57.480> side<00:02:57.690> wall<00:02:57.960> we<00:02:58.830> also<00:02:59.010> have<00:02:59.400> a

with<00:03:04.770> that<00:03:04.890> steel<00:03:05.160> lean-to<00:03:05.550> truss<00:03:07.400> this<00:03:08.400> shows

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
with that steel lean-to truss this shows

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
putting a steel wall up anyway that's

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:49.550 
putting a steel wall up anyway that's
all<00:04:48.539> the<00:04:48.630> strength<00:04:48.900> you<00:04:48.960> need<00:04:49.139> so<00:04:49.320> you<00:04:49.380> just

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
all the strength you need so you just

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.020 
all the strength you need so you just
make<00:04:49.710> it<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:49.889> girder<00:04:50.100> when<00:04:50.280> we<00:04:50.370> attach<00:04:50.639> clips

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
make it a girder when we attach clips

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.060 
make it a girder when we attach clips
and<00:04:51.300> run<00:04:52.259> our<00:04:52.380> purlins<00:04:52.740> in<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:52.949> clips<00:04:55.070> there's

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
and run our purlins in the clips there's

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.040 
and run our purlins in the clips there's
another<00:04:56.220> demonstration<00:04:56.910> there<00:04:57.120> they<00:04:57.870> just

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
another demonstration there they just

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.560 
another demonstration there they just
run<00:04:58.199> a<00:04:58.229> two<00:04:58.440> foot<00:04:58.620> on<00:04:58.740> center<00:04:58.979> and<00:05:01.550> basically

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
run a two foot on center and basically

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.879 
run a two foot on center and basically
you've<00:05:03.570> got<00:05:03.600> eight<00:05:04.020> holes<00:05:04.289> in<00:05:04.440> there<00:05:04.590> you<00:05:04.710> just

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
you've got eight holes in there you just

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.960 
you've got eight holes in there you just
run<00:05:05.190> your<00:05:05.220> purlins<00:05:06.120> in<00:05:06.270> there<00:05:07.400> it's<00:05:08.400> all<00:05:08.580> all

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
run your purlins in there it's all all

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.210 
run your purlins in there it's all all
the<00:05:09.120> trusses<00:05:09.360> have<00:05:09.660> to<00:05:09.870> have<00:05:10.229> these<00:05:10.410> same<00:05:10.889> clip

wood<00:06:10.650> purlins<00:06:11.010> and<00:06:11.190> we<00:06:12.090> don't<00:06:12.240> have<00:06:12.360> the<00:06:12.449> need

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
wood purlins and we don't have the need

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.480 
wood purlins and we don't have the need
for<00:06:12.630> temporary<00:06:12.900> bracing<00:06:13.740> later<00:06:14.099> you<00:06:14.310> just

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
for temporary bracing later you just

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.399 
for temporary bracing later you just
come<00:06:14.639> back<00:06:14.760> and<00:06:14.940> fill<00:06:15.180> all<00:06:15.210> those<00:06:15.510> in<00:06:15.690> but<00:06:16.320> you

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409 
come back and fill all those in but you

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:19.100 
come back and fill all those in but you
don't<00:06:16.530> have<00:06:16.680> to<00:06:16.830> pull<00:06:17.010> off<00:06:17.159> bracing<00:06:17.610> it's<00:06:18.110> it's

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
don't have to pull off bracing it's it's

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.500 
don't have to pull off bracing it's it's
permanent<00:06:19.560> bracing<00:06:19.830> that<00:06:19.949> is<00:06:20.070> installed<00:06:23.510> so

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
permanent bracing that is installed so

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.560 
permanent bracing that is installed so
you<00:06:24.570> maintain<00:06:25.169> your<00:06:25.500> measurements<00:06:26.010> just<00:06:26.570> this
