00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
are I think that one's wash dogs but

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.990 
are I think that one's wash dogs but
basically<00:02:01.100> just<00:02:01.310> tells<00:02:01.520> you<00:02:01.610> some<00:02:01.759> stuff

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
right here okay lay it down like this

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.630 
right here okay lay it down like this
here<00:02:13.459> we<00:02:13.670> have<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.180> console<00:02:14.900> itself<00:02:15.640> and

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
here we have the console itself and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.550 
here we have the console itself and
controller<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.510> looks<00:02:17.660> like<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:18.080> quick

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
controller and it looks like the quick

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.710 
controller and it looks like the quick
start<00:02:18.830> guide<00:02:19.100> right<00:02:19.310> here<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.820> don't<00:02:20.570> care

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.880 
start guide right here I don't care
about<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:22.209> controller<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:24.410> know<00:02:24.530> I'm<00:02:24.680> not<00:02:24.739> a

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
about that controller you know I'm not a

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
about that controller you know I'm not a
big<00:02:25.100> fan<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.580> controller<00:02:26.440> like

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
big fan of the controller like

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.430 
big fan of the controller like
personally<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:28.940> have<00:02:29.180> pretty<00:02:29.540> big<00:02:29.780> hands<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.470> I

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
controllers more but i'll probably get

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.320 
controllers more but i'll probably get
used<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.299> so<00:02:38.660> here's<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.500> controller

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
used to it so here's the controller

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.870 
used to it so here's the controller
looks<00:02:41.330> pretty<00:02:41.630> nice<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.170> uh<00:02:42.200> oh<00:02:42.739> it's<00:02:43.670> not<00:02:43.850> a

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
looks pretty nice and uh oh it's not a

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
guys can see this yeah I don't know this

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.840 
guys can see this yeah I don't know this
is<00:02:55.850> I<00:02:56.240> think<00:02:57.080> this<00:02:57.410> is<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.680> mic<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:58.220> watched<00:02:58.550> one

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
is I think this is the mic I watched one

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.470 
is I think this is the mic I watched one
unboxing<00:03:00.010> but<00:03:01.010> uh<00:03:01.040> this<00:03:01.370> is<00:03:01.580> a<00:03:01.610> complete<00:03:02.300> piece

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
unboxing but uh this is a complete piece

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.880 
unboxing but uh this is a complete piece
of<00:03:02.690> crap<00:03:02.990> if<00:03:03.890> this<00:03:04.100> is<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.310> mic<00:03:04.580> so<00:03:05.709> could<00:03:06.709> just

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
of crap if this is a mic so could just

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.280 
of crap if this is a mic so could just
be<00:03:07.010> an<00:03:07.130> earbud<00:03:07.630> for<00:03:08.630> whatever<00:03:08.870> reason<00:03:09.170> you

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
be an earbud for whatever reason you

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.580 
be an earbud for whatever reason you
need<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.560> use<00:03:09.680> one<00:03:09.920> earbud<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:10.880> uh<00:03:11.080> or<00:03:12.080> not<00:03:12.290> yeah

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
need to use one earbud so uh or not yeah

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.320 
need to use one earbud so uh or not yeah
that's<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.280> mic<00:03:13.459> I<00:03:13.730> guess<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:14.390> I<00:03:16.240> think<00:03:17.240> this

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
that's the mic I guess so I think this

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.110 
that's the mic I guess so I think this
is<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.540> charging<00:03:18.050> cable<00:03:18.200> for<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.560> controller

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
is the charging cable for the controller

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.640 
is the charging cable for the controller
and<00:03:20.830> I<00:03:22.959> think<00:03:23.959> this<00:03:24.050> is<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.290> power<00:03:24.530> connector

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
and I think this is the power connector

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.180 
and I think this is the power connector
and<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.709> hdmi<00:03:28.400> cable<00:03:29.320> now<00:03:30.320> let's<00:03:30.830> get<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:30.980> the

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
and the hdmi cable now let's get to the

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:38.350 
and the hdmi cable now let's get to the
console<00:03:31.780> so<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:36.459> guess<00:03:37.459> that<00:03:37.489> just<00:03:37.880> comes<00:03:38.180> out

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
console so I guess that just comes out

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.690 
console so I guess that just comes out
here's<00:03:39.020> the<00:03:39.170> game<00:03:40.090> right<00:03:41.090> here<00:03:42.100> so<00:03:43.100> that's

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
here's the game right here so that's

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.090 
here's the game right here so that's
cool<00:03:44.000> it's<00:03:44.330> not<00:03:44.540> actually<00:03:45.050> a<00:03:45.080> downloaded<00:03:46.070> copy

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
cool it's not actually a downloaded copy

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.699 
cool it's not actually a downloaded copy
I<00:03:46.459> didn't<00:03:46.730> want<00:03:46.940> it<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.060> be<00:03:47.330> so<00:03:48.290> that's<00:03:48.470> cool

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
I didn't want it to be so that's cool

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.910 
I didn't want it to be so that's cool
just<00:03:48.739> in<00:03:49.040> case<00:03:49.190> i<00:03:49.310> want<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:49.519> sell<00:03:49.700> it<00:03:49.730> later<00:03:50.030> on

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
just in case i want to sell it later on

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.479 
just in case i want to sell it later on
so<00:03:51.920> there's<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.250> game<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:53.950> here<00:03:54.950> is<00:03:55.220> the

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
so there's the game and here is the

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.850 
so there's the game and here is the
