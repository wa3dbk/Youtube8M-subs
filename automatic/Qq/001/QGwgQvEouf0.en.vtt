of<00:00:44.090> the<00:00:44.150> EPX<00:00:44.960> toggle<00:00:45.440> pretty<00:00:45.770> much<00:00:45.950> has<00:00:46.160> all

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
of the EPX toggle pretty much has all

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.360 
of the EPX toggle pretty much has all
the<00:00:46.550> same<00:00:46.760> features<00:00:46.790> as<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:47.480> EBX<00:00:48.220> except<00:00:49.220> it

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
the same features as the EBX except it

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.870 
the same features as the EBX except it
has<00:00:49.580> a<00:00:49.820> flat<00:00:50.829> cylindrical<00:00:51.829> lens<00:00:52.070> instead<00:00:52.640> of<00:00:52.760> a

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
has a flat cylindrical lens instead of a

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.050 
has a flat cylindrical lens instead of a
bubble<00:00:53.660> rounded<00:00:54.400> spherical<00:00:55.400> lens<00:00:55.610> that<00:00:55.820> I<00:00:55.880> get

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
bubble rounded spherical lens that I get

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.060 
bubble rounded spherical lens that I get
that<00:00:56.180> right<00:00:56.329> you<00:00:56.720> did<00:00:56.900> that<00:00:57.079> was<00:00:57.170> perfect<00:00:57.650> okay

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
that right you did that was perfect okay

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.720 
that right you did that was perfect okay
and<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:58.880> reason<00:00:59.210> for<00:00:59.239> that<00:00:59.480> is<00:01:00.140> it<00:01:01.130> looks<00:01:01.370> cool

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
and the reason for that is it looks cool

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.719 
and the reason for that is it looks cool
yeah<00:01:02.720> it's<00:01:03.079> a<00:01:03.170> it's<00:01:03.649> definitely<00:01:04.070> a<00:01:04.130> big<00:01:04.339> style

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
yeah it's a it's definitely a big style

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.120 
yeah it's a it's definitely a big style
point<00:01:05.420> plus<00:01:06.080> right<00:01:06.830> there

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
point plus right there

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.670 
point plus right there
but<00:01:08.000> these<00:01:08.149> days<00:01:08.420> back<00:01:09.020> when<00:01:09.170> cylindrical

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
but these days back when cylindrical

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.670 
but these days back when cylindrical
lenses<00:01:09.940> were<00:01:10.940> first<00:01:11.270> invented<00:01:11.680> the

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
lenses were first invented the

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.139 
lenses were first invented the
technology<00:01:12.979> wasn't<00:01:13.460> exactly<00:01:13.670> out<00:01:13.940> there<00:01:14.060> to

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
technology wasn't exactly out there to

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.180 
technology wasn't exactly out there to
make<00:01:14.270> their<00:01:14.509> optical<00:01:14.960> clarity<00:01:15.140> very<00:01:15.500> well<00:01:15.649> but

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
make their optical clarity very well but

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.680 
make their optical clarity very well but
thermal<00:01:16.580> moly<00:01:16.729> lenses<00:01:17.210> have<00:01:17.390> come<00:01:17.570> a<00:01:17.600> long

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
thermal moly lenses have come a long

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.690 
thermal moly lenses have come a long
ways<00:01:18.050> another<00:01:18.350> back<00:01:18.590> in<00:01:18.740> style<00:01:18.950> so<00:01:19.520> now<00:01:19.640> we

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
ways another back in style so now we

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.750 
ways another back in style so now we
have<00:01:19.940> an<00:01:20.060> option<00:01:20.390> for<00:01:20.920> cylindrical<00:01:21.920> lens<00:01:22.100> and

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
have an option for cylindrical lens and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.600 
have an option for cylindrical lens and
nfx<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:23.659> also<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:24.170> nfx<00:01:24.590> s<00:01:24.799> which<00:01:25.280> is<00:01:25.400> going<00:01:25.520> to

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
nfx and also the nfx s which is going to

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.880 
nfx and also the nfx s which is going to
be<00:01:25.790> the<00:01:26.090> smaller<00:01:26.420> version<00:01:26.870> of<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.140> FX<00:01:27.500> if<00:01:27.770> you

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
be the smaller version of the FX if you

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.120 
be the smaller version of the FX if you
have<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.130> face<00:01:28.430> that<00:01:28.729> doesn't<00:01:29.979> doesn't<00:01:30.979> agree

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
have a face that doesn't doesn't agree

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.490 
have a face that doesn't doesn't agree
with<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.340> large<00:01:31.580> large<00:01:32.150> bit<00:01:32.420> which<00:01:32.990> is<00:01:33.110> not<00:01:33.260> me<00:01:33.470> I

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
with a large large bit which is not me I

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.850 
with a large large bit which is not me I
need<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:33.920> large<00:01:34.130> fit<00:01:34.400> so<00:01:34.729> here<00:01:35.030> is<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.659> n<00:01:36.200> FX

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
need the large fit so here is the n FX

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.359 
need the large fit so here is the n FX
display<00:01:37.400> for<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:37.790> handsomely<00:01:38.270> on<00:01:38.630> me<00:01:38.990> and

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
display for you handsomely on me and

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.010 
display for you handsomely on me and
basically<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.580> idea<00:01:40.610> is<00:01:41.240> you're<00:01:41.450> getting

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
basically the idea is you're getting

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
on the bottom so instead of having a

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.890 
on the bottom so instead of having a
mesh<00:02:18.950> right<00:02:19.370> there<00:02:19.550> which<00:02:19.730> can<00:02:19.910> collect<00:02:20.210> water

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
mesh right there which can collect water

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.560 
mesh right there which can collect water
and<00:02:21.260> snow<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.800> then<00:02:21.950> freeze<00:02:22.220> it's<00:02:22.910> a<00:02:23.060> it's<00:02:23.480> a

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
and snow and then freeze it's a it's a

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.270 
and snow and then freeze it's a it's a
thermal<00:02:23.810> plastic<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.770> means<00:02:24.950> it's<00:02:25.190> not

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
thermal plastic so that means it's not

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.920 
thermal plastic so that means it's not
going<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.670> be<00:02:25.760> it's<00:02:26.390> not<00:02:26.480> gonna<00:02:26.600> be<00:02:26.720> catching

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
going to be it's not gonna be catching

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.540 
going to be it's not gonna be catching
as<00:02:27.140> much<00:02:27.320> you<00:02:27.440> can<00:02:27.590> wipe<00:02:27.740> it<00:02:27.890> off<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.010> lot<00:02:28.220> easier

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
as much you can wipe it off a lot easier

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.880 
as much you can wipe it off a lot easier
that<00:02:29.450> means<00:02:29.600> it's<00:02:29.780> not<00:02:29.870> gonna<00:02:30.020> get<00:02:30.290> water<00:02:30.620> in

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
that means it's not gonna get water in

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.540 
that means it's not gonna get water in
there<00:02:31.100> freezing<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.820> clogging<00:02:32.660> your<00:02:32.690> pores

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
there freezing and clogging your pores

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.790 
there freezing and clogging your pores
so<00:02:34.550> less<00:02:35.000> fogging<00:02:35.360> less<00:02:35.870> chance<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.320> foggy

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
so less fogging less chance of foggy

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.410 
so less fogging less chance of foggy
let's<00:02:36.980> chance<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.310> everything<00:02:37.880> we<00:02:37.970> can<00:02:38.120> do<00:02:38.270> to

let's chance it everything we can do to

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.030 
let's chance it everything we can do to
fight<00:02:38.630> fogging<00:02:38.959> you<00:02:39.230> will<00:02:39.410> do<00:02:39.560> with<00:02:39.920> the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
fight fogging you will do with the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.370 
fight fogging you will do with the
triple-threat<00:02:40.430> technology<00:02:41.170> it's<00:02:42.170> right

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
triple-threat technology it's right

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.580 
triple-threat technology it's right
armored<00:02:42.770> venting<00:02:43.130> we<00:02:43.670> also<00:02:43.820> have<00:02:44.150> dual<00:02:45.020> pane
