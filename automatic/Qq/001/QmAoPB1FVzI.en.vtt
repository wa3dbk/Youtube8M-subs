00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.020
 he is hello to all and butten he is 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.380
 today we find ourselves for the tutorial 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.580
 number 51 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.559
 so today we are going to make a door 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.780
 in a wall so a door twice 2 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.260
 so which is very fine since did a 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.670
 wide in fact so that's all the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.090
 systems they are below in fact one 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.189
 will see it right in the end good I'll you 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.429
 show the system that is up there 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.720
 here if we see there he is there you see 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.120
 I used it to make a 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.540
 fence to use it to do this 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.260
 we want here to portal and we pass 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.149
 like that here it is so it is very 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.010
 very simple very simple 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.899
 recognize the system anyway 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.949
 for that we will do it right away 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.379
 so let's go to the hop couffo 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.980
 it's gone so there you put two 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.949
 pistons like that you put four 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.500
 blocks above so that will be the blocks 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.930
 of the door actually these blocks here 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:08.180
 then you put two pistons to 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:13.590
 extremes like this here 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:20.430
 then you will put blocks 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:24.470
 like that and relayed with that with his 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:28.650
 pistons there like this thin 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.090
 here are the repeaters that are there 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.340
 you put them in the third step 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.010
 two middle ones leave you like 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.000
 that's what it will first of this 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.940
 middle and after that will be that then 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.690
 then then we'll do the 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.690
 system of 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.200
 fast optics in fact that's so you 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.800
 must know hop that's like these 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.100
 is here we will put the lever 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.240
 so that's normally when we do that 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.570
 so here are normally the four 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.740
 blocks is positioned like this and when 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.690
 we disable 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.200
 that's how it stays and these blocks 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.830
 art is here so to do so 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.780
 already behind we will have to relay the 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.840
 thing 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.910
 the forgiveness system so already you put 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.160
 repeaters to the second notch so 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:31.810
 behind you put you are going to put 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:35.290
 torches so here and here you go 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.940
 put blocks there and here it is so 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.920
 normally the aca sextant until 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.780
 until two blocks that are lost 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.250
 then you put a torch in 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.510
 below this one so next to the rpt 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.640
 and peter here is 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.910
 hop the pistons will retract here is 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:55.480
 and then to finish that and run up 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.600
 in flight and then no we have that left 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.800
 and so are basically this torch at the 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.810
 torch that's under it's going to feed 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.209
 this beam that will disable who will 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.390
 disable this torch the same for that 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.040
 So that's good then we're going 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.250
 so connect the two torches so you 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.850
 see if I remove her sextant and if I 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.180
 the hop remit that is retracting so here 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.780
 we will go relayed from below hop like 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.530
 this is tech 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.830
 so here is the are relayed then 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.780
 then we will do 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.970
 go put a torch here so we're going 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.020
 actually link this system there with the 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.910
 system below that's so love 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.650
 put that you put two powders 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.620
 then you put one will redo a 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.480
 another one-way tic trick at wholesale 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.950
 the saa push the piston and as soon as the 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.890
 bass system is an obstacle launched a 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.000
 little impulses in the system for 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.500
 you simply retract 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.180
 so here be careful if you put 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.340
 there the torch is no longer powered for 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.230
 make a small detour like these and 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.470
 there you take off the block I'm going to make 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.180
 the space to show you this is under 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.400
 pistons where were to have space in 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.780
 done if you put a block here it's going 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.870
 feed the piston after the stroke of 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.130
 kembo must not happen 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:17.200
 then here is where we are now 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.799
 wait, let's see where are we 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.690
 so here is the bring him to the he we 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.060
 still remains these two blocks there to do 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.160
 an impulse again so that they can 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.669
 they can return to their position 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.280
 initial 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:35.710
 here you put a powder repeater and 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.030
 then we will redo a trick ati 1 1 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.830
 piston I do not know what's called 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.530
 these forests look for the name because I 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.750
 have absolutely no idea there here you 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.750
 have m 3rd and there second so 4 3 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.530
 twice the average gold mnemonic or 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.810
 so hop 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.210
 Here you will do the same blow not 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.370
 does not do anything to me that says 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.160
 bullshit hop here is here you go 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.169
 put a piston is a powder so in 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.910
 done there is this repeater that feeds this 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.010
 piston and the one that will feed the 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.849
 block when the block will then wait 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.409
 that the block will be here that's it 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:12.099
 so that's going to launch a drive and 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:14.830
 it's good so that's their only active hop 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:17.979
 that but the blocks in assets or 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:22.619
 when very weird but I had to forget 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.619
 something yes here second notch 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:31.389
 wait one activates no deactivate one sees 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.149
 there nickel that one must put in 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.800
 second notch very important according to them 

00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:37.929
 in the fourth end and falls to the second 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.369
 I hope you are well 

00:05:37.929 --> 00:05:40.749
 have respected all the tics so there 

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:42.819
 the machine itself is 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:45.219
 completed only remains to make a 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:46.679
 system to be able to press a 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:49.300
 button simply makes it 

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:53.649
 so we'll do right now 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:56.589
 machine up so like this so that's 

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:58.509
 then a flop Technical expect from a 

00:05:56.589 --> 00:06:02.050
 super start bullshit months that's it 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.699
 so here you go m so before you 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.429
 put the torch and or border the bazaar 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:08.740
 hop you will put his then you 

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:11.529
 go put a torch here so that's okay 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:15.309
 block will be peter quite simply and 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:16.419
 then you put your torch is this 

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:18.610
 which is very important is that these 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.659
 two pistons that are across so that's it 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:24.969
 it must be in the third notch 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:28.259
 this is normally our system of 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:28.259
 buttons is over 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:34.639
 so just wait for a refresh of 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.330
 ama for the friendly so that's it 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:42.590
 retracted and aca sextant here 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:44.689
 retract so right now if you 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:49.370
 so want to see there your door still 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:52.249
 the ex stretched hop you can do so 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.389
 I had done so wait for that 

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:57.379
 it looks like what I did in 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:59.990
 water I had done that I had done 

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:01.099
 after that I put some leaves in 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.050
 on it okay you 're doing like 

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:05.060
 you want but basically there you have to 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.979
 just hidden with these two blocks the ace 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.810
 track have succeeded I wanted you can 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:09.800
 go down etc 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.089
 so that's very practical 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.909
 that in fact it takes no place at 

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:15.830
 outside level so above the ground 

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:16.969
 she just takes in the undergrounds that 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.969
 can be very handy if you do 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:21.319
 houses at stones or basics 

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:22.009
 on flights that's it can be very 

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:24.560
 very convenient 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:26.599
 because it's still quite compact 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.509
 well not too much but well it goes in 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:31.159
 underground it's compact and so that's it 

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:33.560
 good after this button has obviously you 

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:35.469
 relay it to what you want 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.610
 if you too want to put it there 

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:39.770
 so wait all of you do not know the 

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:43.550
 same height if you want to put it there 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:45.699
 hop you can above like that 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.699
 tech 

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.950
 here and there it retracts so after 

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.740
 here you can see the go 

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:54.330
 after it's very customizable 

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.470
 all reston systems are very 

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:59.820
 customizable me i just give you 

00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:01.500
 the base we will say here is so 

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:05.510
 I hope I leave that on the other hand 

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:07.440
 so I hope you enjoyed this tutorial 

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.940
 do not hesitate to leave a comment 

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.919
 if ever there is a problem and that's 

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:15.120
 so that others or myself can 

00:08:10.919 --> 00:08:17.730
 you answer that here so I tell you to 

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.330
 the next one for tutorial 52 or for 

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.380
 other videos 

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.380
 here are the roofs
