next<00:00:02.650> we<00:00:02.770> want<00:00:02.920> to<00:00:02.980> take<00:00:03.190> measurements<00:00:03.610> from

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:04.060 
next we want to take measurements from

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.210 
next we want to take measurements from
the<00:00:04.150> top<00:00:04.629> of<00:00:04.870> the<00:00:05.019> cutter<00:00:05.290> deck<00:00:05.560> to<00:00:05.830> the<00:00:05.859> top

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:06.220 
the top of the cutter deck to the top

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.660 
the top of the cutter deck to the top
edge<00:00:06.549> of<00:00:06.970> the<00:00:07.539> pulley<00:00:08.130> so<00:00:09.130> put<00:00:09.309> a<00:00:09.339> ruler<00:00:09.519> right

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
edge of the pulley so put a ruler right

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.560 
edge of the pulley so put a ruler right
down<00:00:10.379> this<00:00:11.379> one<00:00:12.599> is

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:29.580 

two<00:00:17.230> and<00:00:18.390> five-sixteenths<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.939> this<00:00:25.270> one

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.710 

-<00:00:30.220> and<00:00:32.940> 7/16<00:00:33.940> and<00:00:34.149> make<00:00:34.239> sure<00:00:34.329> you<00:00:34.420> write<00:00:34.570> those

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
- and 7/16 and make sure you write those

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:44.189 
- and 7/16 and make sure you write those
down<00:00:40.140> next<00:00:41.140> step<00:00:41.770> is<00:00:42.040> to<00:00:42.640> remove<00:00:43.059> the<00:00:43.840> bolts

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
down next step is to remove the bolts

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.960 
down next step is to remove the bolts
that<00:00:44.440> are<00:00:44.500> holding<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:45.129> taper<00:00:45.370> bushing<00:00:45.940> to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
that are holding the taper bushing to

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.470 
that are holding the taper bushing to
the<00:00:46.150> pulley<00:00:46.360> and<00:00:47.790> these<00:00:48.790> take<00:00:50.790> 7/16<00:00:51.790> sockets

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
the pulley and these take 7/16 sockets

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.530 
the pulley and these take 7/16 sockets
so<00:00:53.440> we'll<00:00:53.589> just<00:00:53.739> remove<00:00:53.980> them<00:00:54.220> and<00:00:54.460> next<00:00:55.360> step

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
so we'll just remove them and next step

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.670 
so we'll just remove them and next step
is<00:00:55.690> after<00:00:55.870> we<00:00:56.050> ruin<00:00:56.320> then<00:00:56.409> we're<00:00:56.500> going<00:00:56.650> to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
is after we ruin then we're going to

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.590 
is after we ruin then we're going to
install<00:00:57.159> them<00:00:57.370> into<00:00:57.610> threaded<00:00:58.089> holes<00:00:58.300> over

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
install them into threaded holes over

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:06.810 
install them into threaded holes over
here<00:00:59.790> to<00:01:00.790> remove<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.510> pulley<00:01:05.549> okay<00:01:06.549> I've<00:01:06.670> got

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
here to remove the pulley okay I've got

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.760 
here to remove the pulley okay I've got
them<00:01:07.030> out<00:01:07.210> now<00:01:07.689> I'm<00:01:07.869> going<00:01:08.170> to<00:01:08.290> put<00:01:08.500> each<00:01:08.710> one

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
them out now I'm going to put each one

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.560 
them out now I'm going to put each one
in<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.760> two<00:01:09.909> the<00:01:10.030> threaded<00:01:10.360> holes<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.570> we're

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
in the two the threaded holes and we're

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.750 
in the two the threaded holes and we're
gonna<00:01:13.659> turn<00:01:13.930> them<00:01:14.110> down

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.960 

until<00:01:18.760> they<00:01:19.299> make<00:01:19.330> contact<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.729> pulley

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
until they make contact with the pulley

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.630 
until they make contact with the pulley
and<00:01:22.540> this<00:01:23.500> is<00:01:23.619> going<00:01:23.920> we're<00:01:24.280> gonna<00:01:24.400> they're

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
and this is going we're gonna they're

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.120 
and this is going we're gonna they're
not<00:01:24.670> start<00:01:25.030> to<00:01:25.119> alternatively<00:01:25.659> turn<00:01:25.960> them<00:01:26.200> to

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
not start to alternatively turn them to

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.190 
not start to alternatively turn them to
push<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.490> pulley<00:01:27.700> off<00:01:27.970> that<00:01:28.930> was<00:01:29.049> made
