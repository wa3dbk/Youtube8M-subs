map it is but I think I would i play all
the<00:03:40.350> math<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.680> enjoyed<00:03:40.950> all<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.130> maps<00:03:41.400> but<00:03:41.820> I

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
the math so I enjoyed all the maps but I

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.820 
the math so I enjoyed all the maps but I
still<00:03:42.209> think<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.570> second<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.080> third<00:03:43.110> DLC<00:03:43.440> was

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.130 
still think the second the third DLC was
the<00:03:43.950> best<00:03:44.250> out<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.060> all<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.510> deal<00:03:45.690> sees<00:03:45.930> in

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
the best out of all the deal sees in
