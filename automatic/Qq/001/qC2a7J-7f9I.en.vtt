didn't<00:02:22.709> even<00:02:22.800> find<00:02:22.980> air<00:02:23.250> just<00:02:23.970> blood<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:25.310> I

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
didn't even find air just blood and I

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.510 
didn't even find air just blood and I
could<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.670> knew<00:02:27.000> be<00:02:27.360> having<00:02:27.720> usually<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.650> shot

this<00:02:29.790> high<00:02:30.030> would<00:02:30.840> require<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.940> blood<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.330> run

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
this high would require the blood to run

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.479 
this high would require the blood to run
down<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.140> side<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.590> deer<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.100> drip<00:02:35.340> on
