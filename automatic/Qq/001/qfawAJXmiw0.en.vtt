make tremendous gains from some simple
very<00:00:16.710> shallow<00:00:17.070> postures<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:17.970> then<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.150> can

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
very shallow postures and then you can

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.790 
very shallow postures and then you can
work<00:00:18.449> your<00:00:18.510> way<00:00:18.690> up<00:00:18.810> as<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.410> build<00:00:19.650> that

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
work your way up as you build that

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.970 
work your way up as you build that
foundation<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.580> strength<00:00:20.880> for<00:00:21.180> your<00:00:21.270> body<00:00:21.539> so

foundation of strength for your body so

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.009 
foundation of strength for your body so
the<00:00:22.980> basic<00:00:23.430> movements<00:00:23.970> for<00:00:24.150> this<00:00:24.300> are<00:00:24.840> we're

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
the basic movements for this are we're

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.109 
the basic movements for this are we're
going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.260> go<00:00:25.500> either<00:00:26.340> shoulder<00:00:26.699> width<00:00:26.970> apart

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
going to go either shoulder width apart

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.849 
going to go either shoulder width apart
or<00:00:27.539> some<00:00:27.779> people<00:00:27.930> like<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.320> go<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> little<00:00:28.619> bit

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
or some people like to go a little bit

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.380 
or some people like to go a little bit
further<00:00:29.130> than<00:00:29.220> shoulder<00:00:29.490> width<00:00:29.760> apart<00:00:29.789> and

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
further than shoulder width apart and

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.880 
further than shoulder width apart and
you'll<00:00:30.510> see<00:00:30.720> why<00:00:30.900> when<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.320> go<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> little<00:00:31.679> bit

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
you'll see why when we go a little bit

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.889 
you'll see why when we go a little bit
lower<00:00:32.099> with<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.610> your<00:00:33.239> feet<00:00:33.480> are<00:00:33.630> parallel

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
lower with this your feet are parallel

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.810 
lower with this your feet are parallel
so<00:00:34.380> your<00:00:34.739> feet<00:00:35.010> are<00:00:35.130> pointing<00:00:35.430> straight<00:00:35.460> ahead

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
so your feet are pointing straight ahead

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.750 
so your feet are pointing straight ahead
and<00:00:36.180> then<00:00:36.899> we're<00:00:37.079> just<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.620> make<00:00:38.579> like

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
and then we're just going to make like

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.459 
and then we're just going to make like
we're<00:00:38.940> sitting<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.420> bench<00:00:39.809> we're<00:00:40.230> just

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
we're sitting on a bench we're just

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.619 
we're sitting on a bench we're just
going<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.739> sit<00:00:41.190> straight<00:00:41.579> down<00:00:41.730> ever<00:00:42.390> so

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
going to sit straight down ever so

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.590 
going to sit straight down ever so
slightly<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.649> my<00:00:43.800> knees<00:00:43.860> are<00:00:44.219> bent<00:00:44.430> my<00:00:45.090> back<00:00:45.360> is

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
slightly so my knees are bent my back is

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.080 
slightly so my knees are bent my back is
straight<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.489> then<00:00:47.489> we're<00:00:47.640> going<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.820> put<00:00:48.000> our

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
straight and then we're going to put our

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.209 
straight and then we're going to put our
hands<00:00:48.600> again<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.500> elbows<00:00:49.890> are<00:00:49.920> slightly

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
hands again the elbows are slightly

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.369 
hands again the elbows are slightly
lower<00:00:50.670> than<00:00:50.820> our<00:00:51.030> palms<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.660> our<00:00:51.989> fingertips

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
lower than our palms and our fingertips

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.069 
lower than our palms and our fingertips
are<00:00:52.890> almost<00:00:53.820> touching<00:00:54.120> there's<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.780> little

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
are almost touching there's a little

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.689 
are almost touching there's a little
space<00:00:55.320> between<00:00:55.559> our<00:00:55.860> fingers<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.489> we're

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
space between our fingers and we're

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.990 
space between our fingers and we're
relaxed<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> great<00:00:58.680> posture<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.609> be<00:00:59.789> in

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
relaxed this is a great posture to be in

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.549 
relaxed this is a great posture to be in
while<00:01:00.390> you're<00:01:00.570> practicing<00:01:01.170> your<00:01:01.289> belly

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
while you're practicing your belly

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.100 
while you're practicing your belly
breathing<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:03.000> slowly<00:01:03.359> do<00:01:03.690> some<00:01:03.930> belly

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
breathing so we can slowly do some belly

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.630 
breathing so we can slowly do some belly
breathing<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.710> we<00:01:04.830> explained<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.369> another

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
breathing that we explained on another

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:14.750 
breathing that we explained on another
segment<00:01:12.500> or<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.890> take<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.430> some<00:01:14.610> more

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
segment or we can take this to some more

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.410 
segment or we can take this to some more
advanced<00:01:15.210> levels<00:01:15.630> where<00:01:16.700> we<00:01:17.700> start<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.180> sit

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
advanced levels where we start to sit

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.679 
advanced levels where we start to sit
lower<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:20.430> what's<00:01:20.640> important<00:01:21.150> as<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.450> sit

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
lower and so what's important as we sit

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.800 
lower and so what's important as we sit
lower<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.890> our<00:01:22.979> back<00:01:23.189> stays<00:01:23.520> straight

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
lower is that our back stays straight

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.940 
lower is that our back stays straight
still<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:24.990> we're<00:01:25.170> sitting<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> very<00:01:25.710> low

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
still like we're sitting on a very low

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.190 
still like we're sitting on a very low
stool<00:01:26.310> now<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.850> then<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.420> look<00:01:27.630> forward<00:01:28.049> I

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
stool now and then if I look forward I

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.929 
stool now and then if I look forward I
can<00:01:28.380> still<00:01:28.619> see<00:01:28.770> my<00:01:28.950> toes<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.579> my<00:01:29.700> knees

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
can still see my toes that my knees

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.990 
can still see my toes that my knees
don't<00:01:30.240> expand<00:01:30.689> out<00:01:30.900> past<00:01:31.259> my<00:01:31.500> toes<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:32.850> can

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
don't expand out past my toes so we can

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.810 
don't expand out past my toes so we can
take<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> larger<00:01:34.430> exercise<00:01:35.430> which<00:01:35.790> is

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
take that to a larger exercise which is

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.969 
take that to a larger exercise which is
similar<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> deep<00:01:36.780> knee<00:01:37.049> bend<00:01:37.320> what<00:01:37.680> we<00:01:37.799> call

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
similar to a deep knee bend what we call

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.080 
similar to a deep knee bend what we call
it<00:01:38.070> Don<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:39.140> where<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.290> crease<00:01:40.590> down<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.460> this

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
it Don you where we crease down and this

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.380 
it Don you where we crease down and this
helps<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> loosen<00:01:42.990> up<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.409> sacrum<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.390> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
helps to loosen up the sacrum and the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.020 
helps to loosen up the sacrum and the
spine<00:01:45.860> don't<00:01:46.860> try<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.880> any

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
spine don't try this if you have any

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.120 
spine don't try this if you have any
kind<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.479> knee<00:01:48.750> or<00:01:48.960> low<00:01:49.110> back<00:01:49.350> problems<00:01:49.890> unless

kind of knee or low back problems unless

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.830 
kind of knee or low back problems unless
you're<00:01:50.460> working<00:01:50.610> with<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.000> chi<00:01:51.659> gong

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
you're working with a chi gong
