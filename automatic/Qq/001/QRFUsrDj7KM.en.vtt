 properties inherent in many products 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.509

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.340
 many children are already overweight 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.870
 early age many children suffer 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.300

 Disease advocates 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.210
 consumers say that most 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.980
 responsible for this 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.900
 industry is not the right products 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.949
 who are also advertising typing in 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.840

 baby food entices 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.559
 raffle figurines or gifts which 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.000
 attracts young buyers 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.920
 but many of those products that 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.980
 advertise this way too 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.270
 sweet too salty and calories it 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.340
 becomes a big problem for 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.960
 parents during shopping sometimes i 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.969
 I catch myself thinking what exactly such 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.449
 products and buy especially if children 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.160
 with you in the store it looks all 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.230
 very useful and have toys or 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.030
 Any interesting figures and children 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.739
 refuse very problematic today by 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.369
 this has been given new 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.510

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.770
 of these, 252 products by standards

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.979
 percent and only 29 were 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.450
 classified as safe food 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.340
 the industry has very much 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.930
 economic interest is to 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.150
 a lot of very salty sweet and 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.130
 sell high-calorie foods because 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.670
 that the income from them is much greater than from 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.990
 healthy and balanced nutrition 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.119
 they require to be created 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.829
 legislative regulation which 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.450
 sale of products harmful to children 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.579
 supply will limit or completely 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.530
 ban as more children in

 Germany overweight or 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.649

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.720
 food industry sees no reason 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.430
 for any action and apparently this and 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.710
 will continue to be a matter of buyers 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.710
