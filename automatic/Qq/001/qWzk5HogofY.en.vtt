 meet here and then have a roof over their heads as one expects 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.040
 Meeting point where they can talk about where they spend their free time 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.820
 we can now spend that happy 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.190
 Part of their goal is 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.310

 Cut to the point of getting ready 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.190
 the silence view is the seas represent Bulgarian abbot percent the question came however 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.160
 the percent also criticizes her for giving the Hypo to Wagener 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.270
 The best way to get a trailer from this place is by getting them 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.310
 then the hammer is then percent enforce Congress and therefore stands 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.670
 he also satisfied CNY 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.930
 and then let's do more everything like that 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.170
 Well, you have to weigh your own weight and we have to ask the young bear club 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.590

 percentage tables you can say what you do 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.860
 18 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.860

 I wanted to have a look 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.850
 What did the young people do to them because the train in the last 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.760
 Weeks were with us in the town hall as bad weather 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.110
 9 and 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.960
 made their meetings there and then I heard that they were the trailer 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.970
 have gotten 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.010
 and he will be inaugurated today and let's have a look 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.110
 and do you know his already is you let it worry him 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.800
 yes, I've heard a bit so mainly meet 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.379
 here 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.029
 the percentages 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:15.129
 nice to hear me a bit music after a week I have homework 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.409
 I've heard 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.529
 because they just need to energize the kids where they are 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:21.319
 so be with each other 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.219
 then you met here today we met very young people already with him 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:26.249
 talked about it 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:30.060
 I did not speak with him for a long time next to Italy 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.880
 they've already counted us 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.979
 even with the little speech we do 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.749
 and what does it mean to pay off personally from the project? 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:39.109
 if I'm really great 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.109
 I just think it's a pity that there are people around 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.219
 to have broken her the other day to these this trailer already 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.719
 Maybe train have the right to have knocked over other youngsters 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.719
 were also jealous and whose son wanted to have trailer 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.249
 but otherwise I'm the thing really great. Stage means Euro never have it 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:57.289
 been able 

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:58.590
 and that loads 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.030
 in the process as press photographer of the Münsterland newspaper Kiel 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.220
 Do you think that was a good idea? 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.550
 the usual totally good gift of a long time never seen that done 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.629
 what could we do the first song 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.449
 in these 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:16.469
 originated in this area and then there is not yet i had due 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:19.249
 from not seen I come from the outside 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:22.850
 we see it differently and 18 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.189
 in the friend of him, so the paints m because here is my name 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.819
 all in common is on points 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.169
 Jasko agrees I have mental support for the Thin Valley 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.399
 support 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:36.829
 Kauder said he 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.919
 the painter Dale Fitz was the construction years 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.869
 and why does he do that 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:45.549
 Karl because he likes to paint and because he gets the cans paid so it did not matter 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:46.509
 is 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.389
 I am Max was approx 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:49.909
 and what are you doing here 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.130
 I find one 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.539
 Graffiti leads him off 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:55.369
 and that is St. George 

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:58.639
 Shorten the town wages Espersen 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.769
 I know that I always win 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.519
 of course we have 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.529
 "I'm not too close, but still able to cope with that 

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:06.779
 Of course 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:10.139
 I am the Simone Roth from the public order office of the city administration 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.770
 and then it was over 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.770
 and it continues here, too, the young people have invited us 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.099
 Amon at the opening to be there and look around the project 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.130
 whether you think that this is a good idea I think the idea is important 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.370
 so Breuer 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.500
 Nervous were the now Jena possibility if bad weather 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.759
 to withdraw and not to get wet 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.809
 and just have their own 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:37.979
 Cities where they can retreat and meet 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.830
 and do you know what you have always been around here so in the last few days years months ago 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:43.789
 organized 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:45.960
 no idea let us surprise 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.620
 I am from the kindergarten St 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.080
 and what does 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.789
 So what does the duo have El Hierro 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.659
 So I prepared the speech here and 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.819
 we can stop here today people are rubbing around 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:02.529
 projects have been presented here 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:04.160
 and GM 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.850
 I think it's fun to spend time with the other Sorrento guys 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.259
 definitely that way 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.490
 We are very pleased to hit Park 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.870
 doubly 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.830
 there are too few benches and Amberg from the youth work this Bormann 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.830
 Gift bags so much better than the park 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.860
 and for 1 2 it's been one and the idea around here too 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.380
 Maybe not so many or since Tuesday again 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.800
 we are about 15 people and it is not always there because of that 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.319
 the weather already suits him 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:35.979
 preceding 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:40.979
 So which Saab positions are so who has what they say 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:44.629
 so weakened right position soon, three people are selected the 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:46.960
 got the key and 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.199
 But with us all can become equal full of people or behind 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.479
 People like that 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.580
 if it is also good that now spray with Cafe di Gio 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.580
 yes then they will see what our logo is and 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.610
 Werner himself as well as paid for it 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.199
 Haller I've been the best Merckle screamer since the launch of the Lich 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.729
 everywhere as the 2 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.759
 I'm going to my clique 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:11.280
 and that's a good idea with the hammer 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.879
 yes, yes 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:15.879
 Olivers to after so many things 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.639
 a lot of IT is actually a lot of IT together 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:20.770
 should benefit
