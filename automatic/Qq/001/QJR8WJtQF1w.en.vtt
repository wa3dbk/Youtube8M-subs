00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.250 
over the years I have found that I like

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.829 
over the years I have found that I like
doing<00:00:06.910> cesareans<00:00:07.830> with<00:00:08.830> my<00:00:09.730> females<00:00:10.509> that<00:00:10.719> are

doing cesareans with my females that are

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.799 
doing cesareans with my females that are
going<00:00:11.200> to<00:00:11.320> be<00:00:11.469> giving<00:00:11.830> birth<00:00:12.099> for<00:00:12.429> a<00:00:13.150> number<00:00:13.780> of

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
going to be giving birth for a number of

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:21.720 
going to be giving birth for a number of
different<00:00:14.259> reasons<00:00:17.010> first<00:00:18.840> when<00:00:19.840> you<00:00:20.349> have<00:00:20.730> a

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
different reasons first when you have a

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.410 
different reasons first when you have a
female<00:00:22.300> that<00:00:22.750> is<00:00:22.900> going<00:00:23.109> to<00:00:23.199> be<00:00:23.320> giving<00:00:23.619> birth

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
female that is going to be giving birth

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.839 
female that is going to be giving birth
a<00:00:25.420> couple<00:00:26.230> of<00:00:26.380> days<00:00:26.560> before<00:00:26.800> you're<00:00:27.220> expecting

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
a couple of days before you're expecting

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.040 
a couple of days before you're expecting
it<00:00:28.000> you<00:00:28.269> start<00:00:28.869> montt<00:00:29.289> monitoring<00:00:30.189> the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
it you start montt monitoring the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.380 
it you start montt monitoring the
female's<00:00:32.050> body<00:00:32.560> temperature<00:00:33.390> normal

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
female's body temperature normal

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.510 
female's body temperature normal
temperature<00:00:35.140> is<00:00:35.350> a<00:00:35.410> hundred<00:00:35.829> and<00:00:36.010> one<00:00:36.219> point

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
temperature is a hundred and one point

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.910 
temperature is a hundred and one point
one<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.820> when<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.210> body<00:00:40.629> temperature<00:00:41.440> drops

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
one so when the body temperature drops

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.240 
one so when the body temperature drops
and<00:00:42.370> it<00:00:42.760> will<00:00:42.940> drop<00:00:43.300> below<00:00:44.070> ninety<00:00:45.070> eight

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
and it will drop below ninety eight

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.229 
and it will drop below ninety eight
point<00:00:45.579> five<00:00:45.910> I<00:00:46.829> have<00:00:47.829> found<00:00:48.100> that<00:00:48.399> my<00:00:48.609> dogs<00:00:48.910> go

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
point five I have found that my dogs go

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.110 
point five I have found that my dogs go
down<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.899> almost<00:00:50.829> like<00:00:51.039> ninety<00:00:51.430> seven<00:00:51.820> point

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
down to almost like ninety seven point

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.900 
down to almost like ninety seven point
five<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.440> their<00:00:53.649> body<00:00:53.859> temperature<00:00:54.460> will<00:00:54.640> drop

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
five so their body temperature will drop

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.180 
five so their body temperature will drop
and<00:00:56.129> then<00:00:57.129> their<00:00:57.609> bodies<00:00:57.640> will<00:00:58.329> warm<00:00:58.600> back<00:00:58.690> up

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
and then their bodies will warm back up

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.950 
and then their bodies will warm back up
when<00:01:00.190> their<00:01:00.370> body<00:01:00.579> temperatures<00:01:01.359> warm<00:01:01.899> back

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
when their body temperatures warm back

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.740 
when their body temperatures warm back
up<00:01:02.170> that<00:01:02.920> is<00:01:03.190> when<00:01:03.399> they'll<00:01:03.640> start<00:01:03.940> delivery

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.749 

in<00:01:08.009> order<00:01:09.009> to<00:01:09.390> catch<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.420> time<00:01:11.080> that<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.500> body

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
in order to catch the time that the body

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.649 
in order to catch the time that the body
temperature<00:01:12.759> drops<00:01:13.180> you've<00:01:14.140> got<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.950> be

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
temperature drops you've got to be

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.429 
temperature drops you've got to be
monitoring<00:01:16.659> your<00:01:17.140> dog's<00:01:17.500> temperature<00:01:19.439> about

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
monitoring your dog's temperature about

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.910 
monitoring your dog's temperature about
every<00:01:21.070> four<00:01:21.400> hours<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.350> this<00:01:23.770> is<00:01:24.159> the<00:01:24.430> start<00:01:24.820> of

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
every four hours so this is the start of

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.499 
every four hours so this is the start of
a<00:01:26.920> period<00:01:27.159> of<00:01:27.400> time<00:01:27.579> where<00:01:27.880> you're<00:01:28.060> going<00:01:28.329> to

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
a period of time where you're going to

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:35.010 
a period of time where you're going to
lose<00:01:28.750> a<00:01:29.049> lot<00:01:29.380> of<00:01:29.409> sleep<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:33.280> can<00:01:33.610> go<00:01:33.880> on<00:01:34.180> for<00:01:34.990> a

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
lose a lot of sleep this can go on for a

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.139 
lose a lot of sleep this can go on for a
couple<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.680> days<00:01:35.890> if<00:01:36.280> you<00:01:36.399> don't<00:01:36.610> know<00:01:36.909> when

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
every four hours you do the temperature

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.590 
every four hours you do the temperature
but<00:04:23.230> when<00:04:23.800> her<00:04:24.070> body<00:04:24.250> cools<00:04:24.729> off<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:25.210> starts

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:28.560 
warming back up you just go to the vet
and<00:04:28.150> how

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
and how

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.070 
and how

the cesarean death the cesarean will

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:39.030 
the cesarean death the cesarean will
take<00:04:32.610> about<00:04:33.610> an<00:04:34.450> hour<00:04:34.840> in<00:04:35.700> time<00:04:37.260> add<00:04:38.260> on<00:04:38.770> your

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
take about an hour in time add on your

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.300 
take about an hour in time add on your
transportation<00:04:39.970> time<00:04:40.210> and<00:04:40.510> you've<00:04:41.320> got<00:04:41.620> it

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
transportation time and you've got it

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.080 
transportation time and you've got it
the<00:04:43.180> cesarean<00:04:43.780> done<00:04:44.280> within<00:04:45.280> two<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:45.970> three

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
the cesarean done within two to three

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.530 
the cesarean done within two to three
hours<00:04:46.690> and<00:04:46.900> you're<00:04:47.560> home

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
hours and you're home

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.740 
hours and you're home
so<00:04:49.540> you've<00:04:49.750> eliminated<00:04:50.220> that<00:04:51.220> one<00:04:51.700> hour<00:04:51.970> per

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
so you've eliminated that one hour per

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.660 
so you've eliminated that one hour per
puppy

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.100 

another<00:04:57.670> reason<00:04:57.940> for<00:04:58.360> doing<00:04:58.480> a<00:04:58.810> cesarean
