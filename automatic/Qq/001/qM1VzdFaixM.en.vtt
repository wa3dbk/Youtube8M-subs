goldfish so the way to keep them alive

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.199 
goldfish so the way to keep them alive
is<00:03:46.319> basically<00:03:46.620> this<00:03:46.829> once<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.579> week<00:03:47.729> you<00:03:48.000> just

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
want to take about 1/5 of the water out

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.500 
want to take about 1/5 of the water out
maybe<00:03:50.430> dig<00:03:50.669> up<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.849> ground<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.269> little<00:03:51.359> bit

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
maybe dig up the ground a little bit

what<00:04:10.169> about<00:04:10.379> the<00:04:10.790> Seine<00:04:11.790> about<00:04:12.000> over<00:04:12.359> feeding

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
what about the Seine about over feeding

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.479 
what about the Seine about over feeding
can<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:13.079> overfeed<00:04:13.530> fish<00:04:13.769> you<00:04:14.099> can<00:04:14.190> definitely

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
can you overfeed fish you can definitely

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.920 
can you overfeed fish you can definitely
over<00:04:14.579> feed<00:04:14.790> fasciae<00:04:15.299> and<00:04:15.419> the<00:04:15.479> basic<00:04:15.750> rule<00:04:15.900> is

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
over feed fasciae and the basic rule is

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.710 
over feed fasciae and the basic rule is
to<00:04:16.280> feed<00:04:17.280> even<00:04:17.519> in<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.729> aquarium's<00:04:18.180> or<00:04:18.479> in<00:04:18.630> a

filled with fish can take in in about 2

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.790 
filled with fish can take in in about 2
or<00:04:21.299> 3<00:04:21.419> minutes<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:21.959> know<00:04:22.139> what<00:04:22.440> they<00:04:22.560> can<00:04:22.620> be

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.730 
these fish the goldfish in a baggie I
remember<00:04:30.840> as<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:30.930> kid<00:04:31.020> we<00:04:31.320> would<00:04:31.440> put<00:04:31.650> the

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
remember as a kid we would put the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.680 
remember as a kid we would put the
baggie<00:04:31.949> in<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.430> water<00:04:32.639> so<00:04:33.030> that<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.389> it<00:04:33.570> would

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
baggie in the water so that the it would

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.420 
baggie in the water so that the it would
adapt<00:04:33.990> to<00:04:34.259> that<00:04:34.409> temperature<00:04:34.919> is<00:04:35.039> that<00:04:35.159> true

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
adapt to that temperature is that true

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.310 
adapt to that temperature is that true
is<00:04:35.550> that<00:04:35.580> an<00:04:35.820> old<00:04:36.000> wives<00:04:36.419> tale<00:04:36.630> no<00:04:37.050> it's<00:04:37.259> true

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
is that an old wives tale no it's true

in fact we do that with aquariums as
well<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:39.990> want<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.440> temperature<00:04:40.770> in<00:04:41.009> the

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
well and you want the temperature in the

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.710 
well and you want the temperature in the
bag<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.580> acclimate<00:04:42.030> to<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.270> temperature<00:04:42.659> in

be in there and then add some water to
it<00:04:48.590> about<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:48.950> same<00:04:49.100> temperature<00:04:49.280> it's<00:04:49.669> fine

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
it about the same temperature it's fine

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.250 
it about the same temperature it's fine
you<00:04:50.090> don't<00:04:50.150> have<00:04:50.300> to<00:04:50.389> be<00:04:50.570> as<00:04:50.690> it's<00:04:51.020> not<00:04:51.139> as
