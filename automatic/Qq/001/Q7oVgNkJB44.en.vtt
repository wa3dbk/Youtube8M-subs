00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.700 

yeah<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:16.859> basically<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.510> trick<00:00:18.960> today

yeah so basically this is a trick today

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.210 
yeah so basically this is a trick today
which<00:00:19.980> I'm<00:00:20.130> gonna<00:00:20.250> do<00:00:20.520> which<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:23.210> the<00:00:24.210> drunk

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
which I'm gonna do which is on the drunk

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.390 
which I'm gonna do which is on the drunk
the<00:00:26.220> drunken<00:00:26.670> girl<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.300> think<00:00:27.869> it's<00:00:28.740> just<00:00:29.039> like

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
the drunken girl I think it's just like

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.420 
the drunken girl I think it's just like
should<00:00:30.060> be<00:00:30.240> there<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.920> link<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
should be there the link to the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.500 
should be there the link to the
performance<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.300> um<00:00:34.309> well<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.430> what<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.000> is

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
performance but um well it what it is is

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.330 
performance but um well it what it is is
I've<00:00:36.750> seen<00:00:36.960> one<00:00:37.230> tutorial<00:00:37.860> but<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.070> was<00:00:38.160> very

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
I've seen one tutorial but it was very

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.959 
I've seen one tutorial but it was very
clear<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.660> think<00:00:39.930> he<00:00:39.989> got<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.260> wrong<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:41.070> um

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
clear and I think he got it wrong so um

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.790 
clear and I think he got it wrong so um
this<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.420> one<00:00:42.719> way<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> do<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.649> don't

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
this is one way to do it but I don't

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.529 
this is one way to do it but I don't
think<00:00:44.160> he<00:00:44.370> does<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.180> could<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.480> it

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
think he does it but you could do it

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.729 
think he does it but you could do it
this<00:00:45.629> way<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.050> would<00:00:46.110> still<00:00:46.379> work

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
this way and it would still work

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.090 
this way and it would still work
so<00:00:47.340> basically<00:00:47.730> ask<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:49.620> said<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.950> say

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
so basically ask the you said to say

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.910 
so basically ask the you said to say
like<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.579> wasn't<00:00:51.420> people<00:00:52.110> ask<00:00:52.320> me<00:00:52.469> what<00:00:52.590> happens

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
like I wasn't people ask me what happens

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.610 
like I wasn't people ask me what happens
when<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.129> goes<00:00:53.219> wrong<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.760> those<00:00:54.719> I'm<00:00:55.140> once<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
when it goes wrong and those I'm once a

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.490 
when it goes wrong and those I'm once a
drunken<00:00:56.039> girl<00:00:56.250> picked<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.030> card<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.320> been

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
on top basically what these cut should

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.810 
on top basically what these cut should
look<00:03:11.110> like<00:03:11.140> is<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.930> only<00:03:14.670> put<00:03:15.670> these

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
look like is that you only put these

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.340 
look like is that you only put these
cards<00:03:16.240> on<00:03:16.390> top<00:03:18.270> and<00:03:19.270> now<00:03:19.510> what<00:03:19.750> you<00:03:19.870> do<00:03:20.020> is<00:03:20.050> you

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
cards on top and now what you do is you

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.970 
cards on top and now what you do is you
cut<00:03:20.710> until<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.460> see<00:03:21.730> two<00:03:22.120> faces<00:03:22.890> facing<00:03:23.890> each

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
cut until you see two faces facing each

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.120 
cut until you see two faces facing each
other<00:03:24.130> so<00:03:24.370> if<00:03:24.430> there's<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.700> face<00:03:24.970> down<00:03:25.210> there

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
other so if there's a face down there

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.820 
other so if there's a face down there
so<00:03:27.130> that's<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.640> face<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.150> you<00:03:28.270> want<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.830> these

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
so that's the face and you want to these

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.340 
so that's the face and you want to these
faces<00:03:30.460> facing<00:03:31.000> each<00:03:31.120> other<00:03:31.500> if<00:03:32.670> as<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:35.110> back

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
faces facing each other if as the back

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.500 
faces facing each other if as the back
there<00:03:35.860> you<00:03:36.250> cut<00:03:36.460> further<00:03:36.730> down<00:03:39.240> it's<00:03:40.240> okay<00:03:40.450> so

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
there you cut further down it's okay so

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.120 
there you cut further down it's okay so
we<00:03:40.750> keep<00:03:40.960> cutting<00:03:41.260> further<00:03:41.650> down

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
we keep cutting further down

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.130 
we keep cutting further down
now<00:03:42.580> that's<00:03:42.760> to<00:03:42.970> -<00:03:43.300> there's<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.480> back<00:03:43.660> here<00:03:43.960> and

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
now that's to - there's a back here and

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.220 
now that's to - there's a back here and
a<00:03:44.170> face<00:03:44.350> down<00:03:44.620> face<00:03:45.220> up<00:03:45.280> there<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:46.080> then<00:03:47.080> when

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
a face down face up there and then when

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.250 
a face down face up there and then when
you<00:03:47.320> find<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.970> just<00:03:49.210> turn<00:03:49.600> these<00:03:49.870> cards

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
you find that you just turn these cards

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.860 
you find that you just turn these cards
and<00:03:50.380> place<00:03:50.560> them<00:03:50.770> face<00:03:50.920> down<00:03:50.980> on<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.340> bottom

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
and place them face down on the bottom

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.260 
and place them face down on the bottom
and<00:03:52.870> that<00:03:53.320> makes<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:53.980> deck<00:03:54.220> all<00:03:54.550> face<00:03:54.970> down

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
and that makes the deck all face down

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.320 
and that makes the deck all face down
cut<00:03:55.900> from<00:03:56.020> the<00:03:56.200> top<00:03:56.410> four<00:03:56.680> cards<00:03:57.090> then<00:03:58.090> you<00:03:58.210> get

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
cut from the top four cards then you get

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.880 
cut from the top four cards then you get
a<00:03:58.360> break<00:03:58.600> under<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.080> top<00:03:59.290> four<00:03:59.470> cards<00:04:00.690> okay

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
a break under the top four cards okay

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.960 
a break under the top four cards okay
well<00:04:02.890> normally<00:04:03.190> should<00:04:03.370> be<00:04:03.490> easy<00:04:03.640> with<00:04:03.880> the

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
well normally should be easy with the

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.900 
well normally should be easy with the
bend<00:04:04.150> of<00:04:04.300> the<00:04:04.450> cards<00:04:04.810> and<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:06.160> say<00:04:06.370> well<00:04:06.700> ask
