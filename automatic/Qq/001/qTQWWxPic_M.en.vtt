00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.260
 well that's it everyone knows and 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.090
 zoom 35 and today we end up 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.640
 for the fourth episode of the road to 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.500
 glory daughter of mario balotelli have this 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.030
 we start this episode with the purchase 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.410
 of a card mcm rise and so here is 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.520
 for the meta a five he is still 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.080
 quite important in my team because 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.240
 that he makes the connection between the kind of bpl 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.619
 and the Scottish so then there I 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.400
 created a small team of rest in you 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.510
 go see 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.850
 as usual I do them however 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.589
 the practical tutorial and so I rested 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.510
 I rested my club I will win 5 0 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:37.780
 against new york red bulls in semi 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.059
 pro 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.530
 so here it was pretty easy but good 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.269
 that was not the point of looking 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.100
 the total domination that I them 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.710
 inflict then sprouted the small contract 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.949
 this is moffatt borini tedjar there is 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.899
 it's the small fail life and I start to 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.819
 have a good collective so 84 so there 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.710
 it's pretty fun and I decided to 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:57.819
 still mount this collective for for 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.289
 have more ease in matches 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:02.889
 I bought a 150 credit coach 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.600
 so this lute what has the Russian not 

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:07.180
 really link with the team apart from the 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.590
 composition so the 4 2 3 1 here you go 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.610
 then I 'm going to buy writer so 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.990
 here I took the cheapest possible 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.090
 a genius 400 credit in immediate purchase 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.710
 for a right defender of bpl and I 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.170
 came across this writer so of fulham 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.100
 or riser as you want and that's it 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.869
 so here we reach the centers 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.369
 collective 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.200
 I really wanted to play with my 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.920
 team with collective centers and that's 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.070
 what am I going to do against this 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.409
 adversary so a fairly poor team 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.350
 we see well adrian tossed with adrian 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.970
 parents and balotelli in the 20th minute goes 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.240
 make the powder speak and will open the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.060
 score 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.860
 so it was raining during this match I like 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.690
 not the densest of all I therefore 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.640
 time I try to try to take 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.770
 finally on my main account I have a 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.660
 stage where it's not raining here you go 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.860
 and so look at this little pass for 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.710
 mario balotelli but humble chile chi 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.790
 the ha infiltrates into the defense and 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.650
 luckily for him the guardian the ridge 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.050
 but unfortunately it comes back to five 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.930
 vicky flaw who scored his goal at the 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.100
 33rd minute so 2 to 0 on a magnificent 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.570
 collective action at the pass for 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.619
 balotelli was really amazing 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.720
 even if it's not him who 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.340
 conclusion it's his mate flaw life and 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.780
 watch this pass of rami garcia for 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.479
 chicharito and charlie the new recruit 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.340
 he passes the guard he finally pulls the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.900
 small center and on the rummy head 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.850
 Garcia Ravi Garcia who was originally 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.900
 and at the finish of the action we see the 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.080
 very well played from dream and 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.370
 garcia and you'll see that it's going 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.209
 to be my opponent enough that she had 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.450
 decided to buy back 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.890
 so here I am going to win the title and 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.720
 I will go up to division 4 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.340
 but the world pro image division 4 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.090
 it's against this opponent and that's fine 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.920
 to be a real test 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.480
 unfortunately here is watching what he 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.130
 wanted to do during the whole match the 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.830
 accelerations with martins or with 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.910
 doumbia yaya goes back and and he has 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.620
 do that during the whole game guys 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.940
 it was full full full i 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.739
 tried many times to come back to the score 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.120
 but now he had players 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.959
 too fast and I had no 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.760
 bad of bronze players 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.500
 look at this already mario head 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.120
 balotelli look at this rescue on the 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.660
 line from on the part of his 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.160
 player so 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.980
 that's how we lose at half time 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.209
 so he sent me a message 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.239
 even sent a message right after his 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.650
 goal by doing baraja so here I am them 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.670
 players like that good and I watched 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.709
 two where he came from so it's a 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.150
 American I decided not to answer and 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.129
 good then he will score a magnificent 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.569
 purpose to watch this doumbia pass for 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.549
 obafemi martins who will make a 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.819
 beautiful volley recovery so the 2 0 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.560
 for him and he's going he's gonna he'll score a 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.580
 third goal so I really did not get 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.410
 of luck in this match you will see 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.730
 in the end he wants to score a third 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.890
 douala goal watching it comes back on his 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.329
 player at redmond fabianski but that 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.549
 come back to his player and seydou doumbia 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.129
 will aggravate the score 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.870
 so 3 goals to 0 and so that's 3-0 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.739
 july then did not want to go on so I 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.450
 will send a message I will send 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.849
 commands from this here he had me a 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.640
 little edgy access to allah and so I him 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.780
 send go go go through the thing and you 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.370
 see that after watching this 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.680
 domination very this shot 10 squared but 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.049
 zero goal 8 makes nine shots staring 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.400
 and still sends me back 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.680
 and so I decided I was tired of 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.340
 game 7 wins 7 losses was 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.629
 revealing 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.069
 look at it just send me some 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.720
 messages the yuma of pitcher telling me where 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.079
 I do not answer because it interests me 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.489
 not and so 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.410
 so that's it so this match was the click 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.660
 and I decided to buy myself I decided 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.889
 to buy me I had 2900 credit 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.450
 I decided to complete my team 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.799
 to have that pretty pottas players 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.209
 so see her I buy el shaarawy 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.440
 so el shaarawy who will be in our 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.810
 final team I just need it 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.579
 pass in one word c I accept a defender 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.979
 left so sandton sandton who will 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.209
 also in our final team 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.099
 so there really was it really 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.389
 the match that already has me that irritated me and 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.800
 I really wanted to really 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.599
 want to have a good team of this 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.290
 stake next and inga so and inga 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:29.840
 defender of everton the 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.370
 the fags player netherlands and finally 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.290
 I buy I buy a last player not 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.040
 that I wanted to watch how much and there 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.660
 I was lucky I found a 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.430
 little luca sleiman who is also him and 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.310
 in other final guides I found at 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.510
 450 credit and we're going to chain so here we go 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.610
 look at the team and at centers 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.170
 collective 74 years old so note that's it 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.810
 rather pleasure and so we will go on 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.150
 against against this opponent so on the 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.370
 paper a priori ge a priori game winner 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.110
 on the game paper and you will see that 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.490
 that in the 10th minute I will open the 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.050
 score with mario balotelli on a 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.670
 beautiful shot that will not let 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.130
 no chance to the magnificent goalkeeper 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.840
 of mario balotelli 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.860
 here he has I know I do not know if me 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.420
 I did not count how many goals he has 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.160
 marked from the beginning but I think 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.900
 that he put a good package so that 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.180
 is rather fun but it will equalize 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.320
 at just before half time still no 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.700
 chance to watch fabien from who captures the 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.440
 balloon but that rebound rebounded and 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.670
 it goes into the goal so equalization 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.770
 from wright phillips so it's not shaun 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.540
 wright phillips of qpr is that of 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.980
 charlton i cross he plays charlton i 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.360
 am not sure passage you can 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.860
 notice that the der sar the jersey of the 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.870
 stage Rennes so it made me a little 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.090
 laugh at half time everywhere so you 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.350
 see that I dominate in May but that he 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.210
 makes two shots on both goals and 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.190
 watch balotelli in the 51st minute who 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.810
 will speed up on the side to pass the 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.140
 guardian the little one hits at ground level 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.490
 unstoppable 2 goals 1 for for my team 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.410
 so that's pretty fun 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.450
 division 4 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.770
 I even managed to score a third 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.900
 goal on this magnificent head of mario 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.130
 balotelli so another hand triplet 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.720
 lifted and it will end that does not stop 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.710
 to illustrate who does not stop 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.980
 stand out in this match and watch her 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.970
 and here he gets a penalty so I 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.100
 know it's luck that made me 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.480
 here he gets a penalty here I have 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.520
 put the passage in accelerated because he 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.290
 will transform it and on a referral of 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.540
 corner in the 92nd minute 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.710
 he will write the goal of the equalizer 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.000
 while he has not had a single 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.730
 action during the match except the peno 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.330
 and and that's so I do not have a second 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.490
