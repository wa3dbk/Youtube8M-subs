00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.460
 This time around 10 planets you are planning 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.460
 really does not want to visit 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.370
 the planet http 1 max was twice as 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.830
 great as jupiter yet has one 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.240
 ridiculous weight first 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.190
 just as hard as a little one 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.680
 basketball and has only a quarter of 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.080
 Dense water he bit the lake 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.859
 hcp 1 would be big enough on the 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.859
 drive water 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.010
 tres-2b is the darkest planet of the world 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.800
 the jupiter was discovered now 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.270
 great tour graduated march 99 of the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.610
 light that hits him 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.290
 this makes the shirts look like coal and 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.050
 is much darker is every object 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.300
 us astrologers are on the solar system 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.050
 but not sure why tres-2b like that 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.970
 is dark 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.530
 if I am in his atmosphere for 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.530
 not alone responsible 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.830
 who sp 12 b is the hottest so far 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.239
 found his exoplanets 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.220
 Surface temperature was reached in 2002 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.600
 100 degrees Celsius and first close 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.409
 his star as everyone else known 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.630
 planet 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.210
 he is so close to his star that 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.790
 this gradually on st every second 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.010
 we are called p12 b 6 billion tonnes 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.659
 sucked on water and he gets it 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.659
 drawn into an increasingly elongated reform 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.970
 corot exo 3b is the densest 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.010
 the most massive known exoplanets he too 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.700
 has the size of jupiter but 20 times so 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.350
 a lot of mass 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.590
 That makes him twice as dense as lead 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.090
 a human on corot exo 3b would be 50 times 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.220
 as much as on earth 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.190
 an 80 kilo man would be so 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.990
 over 4000 kilo because of this pressure would 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.730
 literally let him collapse 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.470
 there are about as would be as synonymous with 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.470
 elephant would sit on his post 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.490
 there are also in our solar system 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.910
 Planets from which you better stay away 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.680
 keeps 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.020
 whether the Neptune rule unbelievable 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.030
 strong jetstreams phones in gas clouds 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.370
 Press a hurricane of the size of 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.710
 our earth itself is there to reach 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.690
 the wind speeds of over 2400 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.880
 km h it is at a double 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.470
 sound speed wanted a human 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.540
 He is likely to enter the file 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.040
 of the enormous forces tore the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.170
 Choice distributed on the planet 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.850
 until today it is not clear where from 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.590
 Neptune's energy for the fastest 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.590
 Binding of our solar system comes from 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.210
 51 cars are 100 times closer to his 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.630
 star on the earth in comparison to 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.580
 Sun 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.010
 therefore there is a temperature of 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.440
 over 1300 degrees celsius and extremely 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.970
 fast binds and the big heat 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.750
 there's no on the planet though 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.400
 Steam 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.130
 but that does not mean that there is no 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.360
 Rain heat even brings up the iron 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.140
 the planets to evaporate and 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.090
 rising up 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.010
 In the atmosphere, iron is formed 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:58.010
 steam clouds and instead of water drops 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:59.660
 expects the molten iron on the 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.310
 jupiter giant storms reign 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.300
 Much bigger is our earth itself 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.400
 can be 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.990
 They produce incredible lightning 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.270
 several hundred times as bright as 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.980
 on earth in the atmosphere of the 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.959
 There are also clouds with jupiters 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.850
 high proportion of broken ammonia 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.300
 to put that lung and skin 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.310
 would 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.830
 under this hostile and 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.780
 dark atmosphere up to 40 kilometers 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.090
 deep ocean of liquid metallic 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.680
 Hydrogen These are by the big ones 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.020
 pressure arose on the jupiter and 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.640
 reflect the strong flashes by 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.940
 it is practically impossible not to 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.940
 dazzle 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.859
 the egssoft de 436 ps about the size of 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.109
 the earth and almost completely with ice 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.269
 covered but rather than being very cold 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.349
 this planet found one 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.599
 surface temperature of over 400 degrees 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.560
 celsius should be more than 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.760
 weird 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.250
 but the gravity here makes it 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.989
 possible it presses the water vapor 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.209
 a solid layer together and 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.849
 prevents them from rising like that 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.680
 class 6b retains a constant layer 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.400
 and is kind of a burning one 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.400
 Eiskugel 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.040
 The Venus is due to its size and 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.210
 mass often compared with the earth yet 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.670
 the two could be more different 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.080
 Planets you would not be on 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.490
 The Venus would be immediately 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.350
 burn and suffocate 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.360
 the surface temperature over 400 degrees 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.910
 Celsius is hot and the air is poisonous 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.100
 fabrics contains the atmosphere of 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.840
 venus is also 90 times bigger than the 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.050
 earth and there is a pressure of 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.100
 diving at 900 meters depth 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.930
 space probes landed on the Venus 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.400
 only a few could take pictures 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:41.110
 before being destroyed by the pressure 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:42.400
 Gliese 581 C is there astrologer 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.840
 one of the few planets in 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.560
 future be populated by people 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.290
 could 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.580
 nevertheless it is very dangerous here though 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.990
 there may be one for humans 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.160
 Rohrbacher zone 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.620
 But this is on a small strip 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.380
 in the middle of the planet limited and 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.170
 even here everything is done there crisis 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.910
 581 c 1 red dwarf and cheap 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.190
 sky blood red and the plants were 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.200
 appear black and leave us 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.080
 this zone would be deadly in any case 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.760
 the crisis 51 c so close to his star 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.710
 it is located in one 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.020
 so-called bound rotation and 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.370
 does not turn for its own axis for 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.650
 man therefore the habitable zone 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.630
 would leave on one half of the 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.220
 planets are cremated immediately and 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.220
 on the other kids tax return
