00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.139 

I<00:00:00.299> thought<00:00:00.810> of<00:00:00.989> that<00:00:01.140> this<00:00:01.650> 2001<00:00:02.639> model<00:00:03.000> only

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
I thought of that this 2001 model only

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.090 
I thought of that this 2001 model only
had<00:00:03.419> one<00:00:03.629> power<00:00:03.899> source<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.529> engines<00:00:04.890> and

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
had one power source the engines and

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:15.680 
had one power source the engines and
they're<00:00:05.490> not<00:00:05.670> functioning<00:00:14.450> take<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> look

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
they're not functioning take a look

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.800 
they're not functioning take a look
pictures<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.440> crew<00:00:16.730> that's<00:00:17.730> funny<00:00:18.090> if<00:00:18.330> it

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
pictures of the crew that's funny if it

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.769 
pictures of the crew that's funny if it
is<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.140> ship's<00:00:19.410> crew<00:00:19.939> why<00:00:20.939> it's<00:00:21.210> just<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.539> crew

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
is the ship's crew why it's just a crew

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.480 
is the ship's crew why it's just a crew
take<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.470> closer<00:00:22.710> look<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.250> you'll<00:00:23.400> see

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
take it closer look and you'll see

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.640 
take it closer look and you'll see

others and here's another thing look the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.240 
others and here's another thing look the
electrocardiogram<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.289> very<00:00:52.500> strange<00:00:52.860> if

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
electrocardiogram is very strange if

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.250 
electrocardiogram is very strange if
he's<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.730> suspended<00:00:54.270> animation<00:00:54.329> again<00:00:55.050> his

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
he's in suspended animation again his

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.990 
he's in suspended animation again his
heartbeat<00:00:55.649> should<00:00:55.829> slow<00:00:56.070> down<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.670> not

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
heartbeat should slow down and not

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.819 
heartbeat should slow down and not
maintain<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> same<00:00:57.780> rhythm<00:00:57.989> that's<00:00:58.379> true<00:00:58.649> I

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
maintain the same rhythm that's true I

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.229 
maintain the same rhythm that's true I
don't<00:00:59.070> even<00:00:59.160> want<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.550> guess<00:00:59.760> what<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.969> might

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
don't even want to guess what that might

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.209 
don't even want to guess what that might
mean<00:01:00.300> let<00:01:00.989> me<00:01:01.140> guess<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.710> means<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.190> I

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219

mean let me guess it means that I
thought<00:01:02.430> human<00:01:02.850> that's<00:01:03.030> what<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.390> means

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
thought human that's what it means

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.140 
thought human that's what it means
doesn't<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.080> yeah<00:01:04.769> do<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.430> with<00:01:05.729> any<00:01:05.880> prizes

right answer there's another thing I
don't<00:01:09.810> understand<00:01:10.500> where's<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> energy

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
don't understand where's the energy

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.710 
don't understand where's the energy
coming<00:01:12.000> from<00:01:13.700> I'll<00:01:14.700> check<00:01:15.090> out<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.390> engine

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
coming from I'll check out the engine

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.660 
coming from I'll check out the engine
