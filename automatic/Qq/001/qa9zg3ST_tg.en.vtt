00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:15.209
 the opponent of Bayern Munich in the second friendly match in the context of 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.380
 Winter preparation at the Saudi Arabian Club all neither out 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.429
 Neckar and we with many children have the opportunity to cheerfully rotate 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.300
 Bundle directs all players traveling to play 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.179
 Dolly Robinson Jetta also took over the initiative of Bayern Munich 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.179
 the first opportunity after three minutes spoils Lahm 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.760
 Lugar Toni 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.460
 he takes her the opportunity 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.420
 After some tough training sessions you could certainly from Munich 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.960
 do not expect fireworks 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.020
 Nevertheless 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.800
 clearly driven again and again 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.870
 by natural form 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.870
 Roberto then lies to Rabbit Altintop 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.670
 make beautiful 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.250
 However, Jürgen Klinsmann was satisfied with the opening phase 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.250
 Bayern Munich clearly the determining team 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.659
 Bayern Munich with Miro Klose on but also this time good games 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.070
 looking for Luca Toni 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.170
 close miss 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.290
 after ten minutes 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.090
 with Bayern Munich can clearly lead here 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.540
 everyone back under control and then with the first opportunity after 14 minutes 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.930
 long ball 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.140
 not quite harmless then but 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.460
 «The ball loss 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.250
 and suddenly 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.250
 Morad in front of the gate 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.390
 region 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.390
 Michelle ENSI 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.880
 Lucy Open wins the ball here 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.390
 and then get on with it 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.530
 from Esther all the media 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.870
 since Morath that's almost too pretty 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.160
 Farther 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.390
 SUT 0 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.159
 Probes later were again and again 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.539
 take care here 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:13.819
 the Frenchman 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.669
 with good early form 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:17.749
 and this scene 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:21.279
 only a few centimeters of Klose were missing with the preliminary work 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.639
 Webber is missed 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:27.119
 clearly 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:30.309
 after 28 minutes again neither neither 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.939
 and suddenly Mohammed Arbon appears 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.409
 like the one on 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.109
 Fürth with Yello Lensing 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.109
 already in the first test match a good idea 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.739
 Dr Bavarian number one and also here 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.739
 pretty much no problem on the ground 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.209
 three minutes later Hamit Altintop 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.019
 very active performances first half then it's sparks like Barry 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.749
 on Luca Toni 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.979
 in the Bund they see that 

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:05.969
 as reported 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.819
 great Gabbert statement also carries 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.819
 and gas 1 so wanted after 31 minutes 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.789
 Kapeller she is 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.059
 Vitali not very good 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.409
 but who wants to blame him? 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.089
 against the strong Frenchman 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:22.519
 were in graduation 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.549
 no chance for the keeper 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.979
 wonderful little technical achievement 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:28.599
 from Ribe 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.659
 when Bayern take the lead 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.429
 only four minutes later now the strongest wait of FCB Luca Toni 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:39.249
 Hamit Altintop 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.310
 below comes Massimo Oddo who is looking for Luca Toni again 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:45.669
 and bet Gottschalk goes out 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.659
 ice cold the midfielder 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.979
 from the Bundesliga goal 1/11 in the way 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:55.159
 also in the test matches, which we immediately there 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.159
 and again proves his Torgefahr 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.239
 the second 0 for Bayern Munich after 35 minutes 

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:09.179
 it was also the last dangerous scene of the first half 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:13.629
 Jürgen Klinsmann, he almost changed the entire team 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.779
 Highly deserved the 2 to 0 lead for Bayern 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.539
 after 45 minutes then the first scene 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.590
 the second half 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.759
 one of the rare attacks 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:27.710
 from Almeida r 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.979
 nicely done then suddenly stands 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.289
 master 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.289
 Thomas Kraft came in now 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.250
 second team of Bayern Munich absolutely powerless the GWS and 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.879
 Daniel wanted to go 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.050
 not energetic enough 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.980
 exploited ice cold and again in the next scene again all over 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:48.479
 With 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.620
 this a violence shot 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.330
 Thomas Kraft would not have had a chance 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.330
 as the slow motion proves 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.629
 in the aftermath, however, again stronger in Munich 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.860
 five minutes after the connecting hit runways in his so far 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.230
 most dangerous scene 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.319
 Header to the crossbar luck 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.389
 for the Saudi Arabian club 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.389
 then after 20 minutes a lot of idling Daniel 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.309
 the ninety Tel Minute 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:23.330
 the transmitter was one but weak as that rewarded by Sohnemann's army 

00:05:23.329 --> 00:05:24.819
 the dollar 11 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:26.009
 with his 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.960
 best scene for Bayern so far in the first example already two assists 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:33.190
 and now the American with his first goal 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.919
 nice individual achievement here 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.250
 precise shot the 3 to 1 for Bayern Munich of course the decision in 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:42.529
 this test game 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:45.529
 even if there was a second option the best 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.960
 In the 94 minute it looked like that and again, but there they learn the beautiful 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.110
 interaction 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.839
 both hardwood Bayern Munich the opponent 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:56.979
 finally Miro Klose shot blocked and Martina 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:59.839
 while she's enough 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:02.369
 but it remained the last scene in this game 

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:05.149
 Bayern Munich wins the second test match within three days 

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:09.609
 this time with 3 to 1 against the Saudi Arabian club al Ain leather and 

00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:12.939
 can therefore be satisfied with the first results of the year 2009 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:13.639
 look back
