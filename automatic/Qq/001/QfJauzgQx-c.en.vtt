00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.790
 in this video I will explain 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.280
 how to make a leather pompom for 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.219
 decorate the cover midnight i 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:19.210
 cut and a small leather paw of 5 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:22.210
 mm wide that will come inside 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.400
 good taste as well as a link that goes 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.600
 allow the task and easily to the 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.230
 zipper of the cover 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:33.219
 I cut a rectangle of leather so 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.489
 I will draw landmarks 3 cm from the edge 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:39.550
 greater every 5 mm for plots 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:43.420
 I use a silver pencil in fact that 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.239
 will be erasable once the fringes 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.120
 cut with cuts and frank 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.269
 of Pointon with a cutter and settle in 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.429
 metal it will have to be well positioned 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:58.030
 their eyes settle and press firmly 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:01.059
 on it and have a clean cut and 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.749
 frank from 3 cm from the edge 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.199
 superior 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:09.130
 once the fringes of amine cut 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:12.340
 I'm going to return the crusty sideboard 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.090
 and I will come and stick the little paw 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.840
 of leather on the inside edge of the bridge 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:24.579
 for that in fact I'm going to baste the 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:28.520
 inner edge of gaulle I fold the 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:32.210
 little leather paw in half and I want 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.890
 to put it on leaving 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.469
 about 1 cm you can use the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.119
 glue for cooking or for textiles me 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.429
 I have a preference for glue for 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.079
 textiles since it is a glue that has 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.110
 a much faster catch 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:51.319
 once the little paw posed I'll 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:55.009
 come back drop a small trickle of glue 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:58.209
 on the leather paw and then I'm going 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:04.569
 brush the entire part 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:08.149
 superior of qom then i'm going 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:12.140
 wrapped the piece of leather on itself 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.329
 in his ranks as much as we can 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.489
 let the glue dry a bit then he 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:19.120
 all you have to do is pass the little one 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.730
 leather tie in the little paw 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.489
 then tied your pompom to the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.870
 zipper of your pocket 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.530
 so that's what it gives 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.819
 once the bag is finished and decorated 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.720
 a small stamp 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.530
 we could also varied in 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:42.710
 my body is a side fabric costs from 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:47.140
 your leather and to give a side a 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.140
 little more fantasy at your worst
