00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 not many of these maternities who 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.299
 close everywhere in France going back 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.109
 terrible stories of women getting 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.990
 are found in situations 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.330
 emergency impossible is the 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.370
 solution would not these houses of 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.750
 birth why not actually he 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.699
 there is a bill currently that 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.800
 disputed in the Senate precisely for 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.689
 frame to regulate for for 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.699
 to make it exist like this 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.380
 exists in other countries including 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.150
 europe but also to united states then 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.560
 what is the principle of saying 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.390
 Today in France there to 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.619
 so-called birth structures it's up to 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.540
 to say that there is maternity 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.829
 there go women who give birth to 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.420
 home there is one more 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.129
 hundreds and then between the two there is to 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.989
 structures where there is no 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.910
 medicalization they are wise women 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.219
 who are helping mothers-to-be 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.570
 and so it's much more natural and 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.700
 that's what women are looking for and 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.230
 that's a little the principle the concept 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.449
 of birth houses and in case of 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.640
 problem sophie is well right next he 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.350
 there is a resuscitation service there is a 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.809
 maternity to report the slightest 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.410
 problem will have resisted that signa a 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.390
 hospital 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.500
 Here the idea is that what we 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.059
 exists today in France and 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.680
 very often inside the enclosure 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.409
 of the hospital as we will see in the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.540
 report to beauvais but tomorrow if the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.040
 law passes and if we settle we could 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.020
 to imagine that a house is a little 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.490
 outside the hospital and that if there is 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.130
 the slightest problem we can 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.869
 directly sent the child the mom 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.580
 in a structure net results by 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.009
 report to our European neighbors where that 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.439
 already exists and then that's the solution 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.420
 because it costs not less 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.890
 according to a rapporteur of the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.150
 law is double the ones 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.310
 birth houses or much less 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.750
 expensive than a structure because there is 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.740
 a lot more staff then what 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.450
 I propose you immediately it's from 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.100
 see how it works why the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.600
 women go to these structures of 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.640
 birth and well went to the hospital 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.710
 Beauvais where it has not been since 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.810
 of 3 years now a structure where he 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.310
 about thirty women a year who 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.450
 give birth in these structures of 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.990
 birth led by midwives 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.990
 watch 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.580
 Zelia 34 wins her third child 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.680
 but unlike his two 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.180
 previous pregnancies she chose 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.250
 to give birth in a structure of 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.110
 different births of maternity 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.690
 classic is led by 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.920
 Midwives 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.990
 so he was serving in a structure of 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.190
 birth that is arranged a little bit 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.300
 differently from a birth room 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.740
 classical 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.480
 women give birth to those 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.650
 living in the position of their choice 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.070
 they can mobilize as she does 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.780
 wish 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.100
 there we can help them support them 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.900
 so they'll get down to four 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.920
 legs on the side at 6 in the arms of 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.590
 their husbands and wives she should 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.850
 give birth in particular squatting 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.740
 so they have what it takes for them 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.020
 help the liana to support itself 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.270
 would hang stretch their backs and then by 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.810
 example the delivery stool for 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.680
 settle down really squatting 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.680
 so that's true 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.580
 I am followed throughout the 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.989
 pregnancy by the same wise woman 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.870
 it will be largely childbirth that 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.540
 I would call first contractions that 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.010
 I will find there in this room 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.870
 maybe I'll be brought lying there 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.269
 on this couch on all fours with the 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.560
 ball on the liana probably make a 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.340
 big part of the work in the memory 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:08.930
 who is behind everything and everything is open 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.750
 and everything is possible and watch how 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.390
 a follow-up consultation is held 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.750
 pregnancy in this structure a real 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.750
 complicity 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.030
 this morning emilia measures the size and 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.340
 records the heart rate of the fetus 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.049
 of eight months everything is fine 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.159
 our consultations in the structure 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.810
 it's consultations that last 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.730
 much longer than in maternity 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.810
 classic one can afford to 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.730
 take one hour an hour and a half 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.530
 two hours for moms and then 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.970
 we will talk about pregnancy a lot of 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.860
 baby a lot but we will also talk 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.480
 everything that goes around the elders the 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.580
 dads work when they work 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.140
 still in the city with end 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:50.390
 really all they have and 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.700
 given this relationship young people 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.940
 parents as elise and valere are 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.340
 happy to introduce their children as 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.640
 about thirty babies a year lÃ©andre 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.170
 was born here 11 months ago 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.540
 so tomorrow if you want a 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.660
 second child 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:12.110
 undoubtedly one starts even 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.489
 structure with pleasure that's obvious 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.810
 it even arises the question even arises 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.810
 not one can not imagine otherwise 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.560
 if things were very cute what 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.310
 which one would have to call sophie is that 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.020
 in these structures 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.490
 pregnancy of women giving birth 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.479
 it's not at risk pregnancies 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.340
 it's really pregnancies that 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.410
 are very very good advice this type of 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.210
 structure for risky pregnancies 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.560
 here is to be so national anyway 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.509
 when in quotation marks a casting 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.729
 effect we choose if it is a pregnancy 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.960
 at risk we do not propose this type of 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.150
 structure then I propose you to 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.070
 take on the phone Nathalie who we 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.710
 call of gisors in the eure you 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.169
 are there nathalie yes hello 28 years the 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.509
 thalie hello thank you for calling you 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.520
 to go to give birth on May 16 and 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.110
 you chose to give birth in a 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.110
 structure that is not a maternity 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.910
 classic precisely for such reason 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.650
 actually talking to women who 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.419
 had already had children I got 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.889
 realized that I had a lot of 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.780
 priori about childbirth 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.440
 I imagined inevitably to be installed on 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.690
 the back most probably those under 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.380
 epidural follow the instructions that we 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.590
 could give me 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.599
 and in fact I discovered that this is 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.970
 can have an active role in 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.349
 childbirth listening to choice 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.510
 the counterpart is really 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:26.000
 away from acts 1 exclusion including 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.130
 peace laughs but the principle is to 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.320
 to trust his body even though we 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.000
 we do not know how to make the body yours 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.729
 know the wise woman who will you 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.979
 help to sleep yes yes it is precisely 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.080
 the principle me elite exchange that took 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.270
 the relay as soon as the declaration of 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.250
 pregnancy in the third month and have 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.409
 benefited from a rifle with a 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.389
 comprehensive and individualized preparation 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:49.550
 it's a real relationship of trust and 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.009
 for us it is a wonderful support 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.440
 for the days of childbirth and seven 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:58.130
 birthing houses is not too much 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:01.070
 away from home at 45 minutes to little 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:04.940
 near cars so for a first vv 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.180
 we do not know what is a first 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.300
 baby 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.470
 did you also imagine to 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.110
 giving birth at home at a home 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.729
 moment yes yes we thought about it but it's 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.949
 true for a 1st bis a little tricky 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.870
 also and then the ideological post it's 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.050
 an ideal compromise because it responds to 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:23.590
 both to the security needs on 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.990
 we need as new parents if 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.180
 never a problem to have a transfer 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.530
 possible and very fast and at the same 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.530
 time it meets the need for freedom 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.430
 he clicks it they had it 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.900
 had both for the kids 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.699
 it's good because it's 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.949
 requires future parents to question themselves 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:40.509
 on childbirth on that moment on 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:42.430
 how do you want to sell it from the 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:44.139
 to live and to remember 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.370
 also it is that it is the wise women 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:47.110
 who will take the hand if I dare to say 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.849
 and that's important because 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.560
 places where there is no maternity 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:52.000
 it can be an alternative and that is 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.340
 important to call him back also reminded 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.169
 go there is forgotten Sunday around 6am 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.219
 this morning when time is it 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:06.159
 important question 

00:06:57.219 --> 00:07:06.849
 nathalie it does not snow do not laugh thank you 

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:08.830
 have a good day 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:10.449
 be happy with this baby this is a 

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.199
 boy a girl you know it yes finally 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:12.879
 hardly 5 

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:15.909
 good and well listen you will kiss him 

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:18.039
 to see us again and thank you for calling 

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:19.569
 so we are waiting for the law to recall that 

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:20.830
 these birth houses and that's 

00:07:19.569 --> 00:07:21.639
 single to double in terms of cost for 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.319
 the community 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:25.150
 So again it was the argument 

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:26.830
 important and then the experiences that 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.240
 exists in other countries show that 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.500
 it works and it can be a 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.389
 solution for the brakes that are 

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.250
 isolated or maternity wards where there is more 

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:35.500
 maternity just thanks to richard 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.270
 to be this way at the forefront of 

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:42.870
 information and solutions that 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.870
 can offer patients alexander
