well<00:00:00.500> I'm<00:00:01.500> so<00:00:01.740> excited<00:00:01.860> now<00:00:02.190> I<00:00:02.280> can't<00:00:02.610> even

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
well I'm so excited now I can't even

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.200 
well I'm so excited now I can't even
stand<00:00:02.939> myself<00:00:03.980> I<00:00:04.980> did<00:00:05.850> it

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
stand myself I did it

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.060 
stand myself I did it
I<00:00:06.980> built<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.970> Bedini<00:00:09.469> circuit<00:00:10.469> schoolgirl

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
I built the Bedini circuit schoolgirl

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.240 
I built the Bedini circuit schoolgirl
circuit<00:00:11.750> and<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:13.650> very<00:00:13.920> raw<00:00:15.890> how<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.949> wires

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
circuit and it's very raw how the wires

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.710

the battery is pulling about 12.5 1
volts<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:32.660> I'll<00:00:33.660> show<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.960> guys<00:00:34.079> later

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
volts and I'll show you guys later

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.490 
volts and I'll show you guys later
I<00:00:34.739> just<00:00:35.100> wanted<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.399> give<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.550> an<00:00:35.670> update<00:00:36.500> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
I just wanted to give you an update the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.100 
I just wanted to give you an update the
battery<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.160> charging<00:00:38.579> at<00:00:38.850> twelve<00:00:39.180> point<00:00:39.450> five

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
battery is charging at twelve point five

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.100 
battery is charging at twelve point five
eight<00:00:40.610> volts<00:00:42.440> if<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.710> hear<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.010> barely

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
eight volts if you can hear it barely

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.639 
eight volts if you can hear it barely
and<00:00:46.110> then<00:00:46.230> turn<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:47.180> potentiometer<00:00:48.649> so

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
and then turn up the potentiometer so

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.139 
and then turn up the potentiometer so
that<00:00:49.829> light<00:00:50.039> comes<00:00:50.309> on<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:50.969> kind

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
that light comes on you can see it kind

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.849 
that light comes on you can see it kind
of<00:00:51.210> flicker

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.880 

we<00:00:55.370> get<00:00:55.609> brighter

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
we get brighter

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.720 
we get brighter
and<00:00:58.460> this<00:00:58.610> thing<00:00:58.880> is<00:00:59.180> going<00:00:59.390> so<00:00:59.630> fast<00:01:00.340> that<00:01:01.340> my

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
and this thing is going so fast that my

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.450 
and this thing is going so fast that my
pairings<00:01:02.240> or<00:01:02.540> I<00:01:02.870> got<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:03.950> build<00:01:04.100> a<00:01:04.220> whole<00:01:04.430> new

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
pairings or I got to build a whole new

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:16.720 
pairings or I got to build a whole new
machine

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.880 

here<00:01:17.730> bearings<00:01:18.390> about<00:01:18.630> ready

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.890 

turn<00:01:22.130> it<00:01:22.280> down<00:01:22.310> again<00:01:22.729> to<00:01:23.300> get<00:01:23.450> to<00:01:23.979> smooth

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
turn it down again to get to smooth

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.930 
turn it down again to get to smooth
rotation<00:01:27.760> this<00:01:28.760> thing<00:01:29.030> will<00:01:29.240> run<00:01:29.420> forever<00:01:30.940> not

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
rotation this thing will run forever not

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.469 
rotation this thing will run forever not
pulling<00:01:32.330> it<00:01:32.390> probably<00:01:32.930> anything<00:01:34.330> that<00:01:35.330> I'll

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
pulling it probably anything that I'll

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.210 
pulling it probably anything that I'll
show<00:01:35.659> you<00:01:35.720> guys<00:01:35.840> that<00:01:36.050> later<00:01:38.740> I'll<00:01:39.740> fund<00:01:39.979> it<00:01:40.100> it

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
show you guys that later I'll fund it it

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.800 
show you guys that later I'll fund it it
I'll<00:01:40.670> go<00:01:40.820> through<00:01:41.000> all<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.240> circuitry<00:01:41.720> and

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
I'll go through all the circuitry and

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.560 
I'll go through all the circuitry and
all<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.259> stuff<00:01:42.440> I<00:01:42.560> bought<00:01:42.710> at<00:01:42.860> RadioShack

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
all the stuff I bought at RadioShack

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:51.450 
all the stuff I bought at RadioShack
you<00:01:44.570> can<00:01:44.720> see<00:01:44.840> I<00:01:44.869> used<00:01:45.470> this<00:01:45.790> schematic<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:49.690> I

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
you can see I used this schematic and I

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.930

used truth be known circuitry to kind of

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:12.010 
used truth be known circuitry to kind of

I<00:02:40.840> bought<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.620> 30<00:02:42.070> amp<00:02:42.370> or<00:02:42.880> milliamp<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:44.620> calls

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
I bought a 30 amp or milliamp it calls

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.340 
I bought a 30 amp or milliamp it calls
for<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.130> 25<00:02:45.640> but<00:02:46.060> I'm<00:02:46.720> pulling<00:02:46.990> a<00:02:47.020> little<00:02:47.260> too

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
for a 25 but I'm pulling a little too

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.810 
for a 25 but I'm pulling a little too
much<00:02:47.530> juice<00:02:47.940> for<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:48.970> 25<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:50.740> I<00:02:51.400> got<00:02:51.580> everything

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
much juice for a 25 and I got everything

00:02:51.820 --> 00:03:01.800 
much juice for a 25 and I got everything
at<00:02:52.690> RadioShack<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:58.330> see<00:02:58.480> all<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.720> stuff<00:03:00.810> lamp

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
at RadioShack you see all the stuff lamp

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.110 
at RadioShack you see all the stuff lamp
