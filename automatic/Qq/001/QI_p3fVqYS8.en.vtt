00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.460
 Choi Young

 amoto has a convenient function that shines on the couty, 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.519
 Sooner or later 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:12.739
 Like pajamas are also coated 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:17.240
 That's the kotiti sidewalk at the bottom with a different QWERTY keyboard 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.110
 Android phones are all ug 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.460
 Supports hotkey function. publication shortcuts 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.669
 I support it. 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.679
 - Enter shortcut key and execute 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.380
 There is such a way to be 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.300
 Then how to set it up 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.010
 I'll show you coolly. 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.710
 4 billion girl Kim Ye Jin button 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.310
 It is. 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.400
 Press the Menu button 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.800
 In the summer, setting comes out. 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.970
 Persuasion setting ' 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.310
 By setting 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.610
 I said it was a program. 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.960
 It's fast. Let's run it fast. 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.940
 The Internet browser is going to rain and it's time to give. 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.740
 That there will be 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.330
 The Internet browser is called a search button 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.360
 KOSPI 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.690
 Incoming search ends with + 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.280
 Multi-can be be 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.909
 She may range that way. The 620 says the program is the land. 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.909
 The show was assigned to a program. By July 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.980
 Do you know the touch 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.080
 application I can choose an application 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.930
 So I lift my head 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.240
 Well, just like a host of host countries, we 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.300
 There is something, so even the scholars 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.689
 It's a shortcut. 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.850
 I have not heard it from you. 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:38.800
 I'll do it. 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.940
 So here is a sample called +2 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.310
 I started this only for the host bar. 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.880
 Last year you did not choose. 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.310
 Ichiro 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.610
 It's only here. 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.610
 Then how do you actually use the release 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.000
 Let's take a look. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.040
 And citizens 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.430
 There's a search button at the bottom. I do not have a search button. 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.670
 There's depth. 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.240
 From Zach 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.040
 Search but 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.559
 The water remains 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:10.109
 Let's take a look at 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.109
 Then, 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.439
 It's 50 seconds and the image and the scene are gone. 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.870
 I can confirm that the management staff is running as a tournament host 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:24.169
 In the case of Kim Tae-hee, 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:26.510
 Search personal + 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.599
 I found a way to search 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.439
 I pressed the service while holding it down. 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.599
 So then on the Internet 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.569
 I can only do it. The address book is god. 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.369
 Conduct search tool 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:40.169
 felled 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.569
 Your address book quickly went to the address book first. 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.129
 Because there is nothing, it is different from the one that came out like this, and I eat again. 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:50.150
 The reason is 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.640
 As a politician, 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.269
 We should see it as a host with a dog address. 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.949
 Everything was gathered. 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.909
 Gwanghwamun 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.839
 As a company survives 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:08.189
 Let me ask you. 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.189
 Even if it went too fast, 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:12.150
 Shortcuts 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.150
 Application can be executed using 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.989
 I do not want to set up a dock cruiser. 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.939
 I could ask you to change 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.219
 Set up 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.289
 Application and Quick Run Here 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:30.679
 After a quick shot 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:34.709
 We can change what is specified in the win. 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.799
 When the quality goes up, I get this message again. 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:39.999
 For movie fans, 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:41.349
 like this 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.459
 I can not say that I did not know anything else. 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:48.999
 walking into 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:53.309
 We are better than the existing reset 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.699
 I can erase it. the front door 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.049
 Let's blow it 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.209
 You do this. 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.709
 Basically, 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.130
 Suppressed bundled browsers 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.389
 xcorp.com Ascension 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.159
 It was Skype. You can also set it up. 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.470
 Can we set it up after the war? 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.329
 dr. 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.629
 Let's set it up again. 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:21.629
 Because I do not have a lot of job reports 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:24.229
 Let's try youtube 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.389
 Hearing and so on 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.939
 I can confirm that the beginning was. 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:30.819
 Hotclick 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:33.199
 According to the search, 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.990
 It's a school. 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.439
 I want to go out with a hit song 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:40.639
 Fast freely 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.409
 How to set up shortcuts 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.240
 I said I did not run shortcuts to find shortcuts. 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:50.189
 I hope you will use it this way. 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:54.629
 How long has it been built up? 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:55.720
 kucc blogger single 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.009

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.339
 But if you communicate with but a thorough personally 

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:02.749
