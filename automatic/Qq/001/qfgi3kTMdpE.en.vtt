because some of the suds can linger in

crunchy it makes them really soft

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.980 
crunchy it makes them really soft
because<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.360> soap<00:02:07.290> contains<00:02:07.759> natural<00:02:08.759> oils

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
because the soap contains natural oils

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.500 
because the soap contains natural oils
and<00:02:10.080> no<00:02:10.590> harsh<00:02:11.100> chemicals<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.820> will<00:02:12.150> cause

your<00:02:12.720> brushes<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.320> damage<00:02:13.740> or<00:02:13.950> fall<00:02:14.490> apart<00:02:14.610> and

your brushes to damage or fall apart and

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.230 
your brushes to damage or fall apart and
unlike<00:02:15.990> some<00:02:16.260> brush<00:02:16.530> cleaners<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.550> soap<00:02:17.820> does

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
unlike some brush cleaners the soap does

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.980 
unlike some brush cleaners the soap does
not<00:02:18.540> make<00:02:18.990> your<00:02:19.140> brushes<00:02:19.620> have<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.220> film<00:02:20.850> or<00:02:21.390> a

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
then I just set that down to track now

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.140 
then I just set that down to track now

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
Parian spirit brush cleaner specifically

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.520 
Parian spirit brush cleaner specifically
for<00:03:36.210> our<00:03:36.270> Beauty<00:03:36.510> Blender<00:03:36.780> I<00:03:36.810> don't<00:03:37.170> use<00:03:37.350> this

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
for our Beauty Blender I don't use this

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.290 
for our Beauty Blender I don't use this
on<00:03:37.740> any<00:03:38.100> of<00:03:38.160> my<00:03:38.340> other<00:03:38.370> brushes<00:03:38.760> just<00:03:38.940> my

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
on any of my other brushes just my

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.120 
on any of my other brushes just my
Beauty<00:03:39.540> Blender<00:03:39.570> because<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.410> noticed<00:03:41.070> that

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
Beauty Blender because I noticed that

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.940 
Beauty Blender because I noticed that
this<00:03:41.460> allows<00:03:42.180> for<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.990> product<00:03:43.770> that's

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
this allows for the product that's

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.200 
this allows for the product that's
soaked<00:03:44.250> into<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.850> sponge<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:46.670> come<00:03:47.670> out<00:03:47.880> from

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
soaked into the sponge to come out from

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.920 
soaked into the sponge to come out from
the<00:03:48.300> inside<00:03:48.690> if<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.410> squeeze<00:03:49.710> it<00:03:49.890> into<00:03:50.100> the

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
the inside if I squeeze it into the

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.300 
the inside if I squeeze it into the
sponge<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.320> soap<00:03:52.530> doesn't<00:03:52.770> do<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.100> it

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
sponge and the soap doesn't do that it

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.640 
sponge and the soap doesn't do that it
doesn't<00:03:53.940> really<00:03:54.060> get<00:03:54.330> all<00:03:54.930> of<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.230> color<00:03:55.440> out

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
doesn't really get all of the color out

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.350 
doesn't really get all of the color out
of<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:55.950> sponge<00:03:56.250> like<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.700> tirion<00:03:57.030> spirit

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
of the sponge like the tirion spirit

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.970 
of the sponge like the tirion spirit
does<00:03:57.510> so<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:57.720> do<00:03:57.840> use<00:03:58.110> my<00:03:58.140> Parian<00:03:58.590> spirit

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
does so I do use my Parian spirit

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.369 
does so I do use my Parian spirit
specifically<00:03:59.880> for<00:04:00.000> my<00:04:00.090> Beauty<00:04:00.330> Blender

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
specifically for my Beauty Blender

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.770 
specifically for my Beauty Blender
because<00:04:02.040> I<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.790> soap<00:04:02.999> doesn't<00:04:03.420> work<00:04:03.510> as<00:04:03.749> well

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
because I the soap doesn't work as well

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.809 
because I the soap doesn't work as well
and<00:04:04.590> as<00:04:04.680> you<00:04:04.769> can<00:04:04.829> see<00:04:04.890> I'm<00:04:05.219> squeezing<00:04:05.609> it

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
and as you can see I'm squeezing it

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.429 
and as you can see I'm squeezing it
running<00:04:06.209> water<00:04:06.450> through<00:04:06.659> and<00:04:06.930> squeezing<00:04:07.379> it

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
running water through and squeezing it

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.899 
running water through and squeezing it
again<00:04:07.709> to<00:04:07.889> get<00:04:08.010> everything<00:04:08.400> out<00:04:08.760> because

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
again to get everything out because

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.910 
again to get everything out because
sometimes<00:04:09.209> your<00:04:09.900> foundation<00:04:10.319> gets<00:04:10.469> soaked<00:04:10.739> up

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
sometimes your foundation gets soaked up

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.349 
sometimes your foundation gets soaked up
in<00:04:11.040> there<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.549> you<00:04:11.730> really<00:04:11.969> really<00:04:12.090> have<00:04:12.329> to

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
in there and you really really have to

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.270 
in there and you really really have to
squeeze<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.930> out<00:04:13.049> of<00:04:13.139> there<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:13.530> make<00:04:14.159> sure

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
squeeze it out of there so make sure

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.610 
squeeze it out of there so make sure
that<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.930> squeeze<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.079> as<00:04:16.169> much<00:04:16.320> as<00:04:16.440> possible

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
that you squeeze it as much as possible

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.860 
that you squeeze it as much as possible
so<00:04:17.009> that<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.250> can<00:04:17.400> get<00:04:17.579> all<00:04:17.759> of<00:04:18.389> the<00:04:18.509> product

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
so that you can get all of the product

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.279 
so that you can get all of the product
out<00:04:19.049> of<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.410> lender<00:04:19.949> sponge<00:04:21.139> and<00:04:22.139> that's

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
out of the lender sponge and that's

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.810 
out of the lender sponge and that's
pretty<00:04:22.500> much<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:23.009> I<00:04:23.039> just<00:04:23.220> let<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:23.610> sit

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
pretty much it I just let it sit

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.100 
pretty much it I just let it sit
overnight<00:04:23.849> to<00:04:24.360> dry<00:04:24.479> with<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.810> rest<00:04:24.960> of<00:04:25.050> my

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
overnight to dry with the rest of my

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.170 
overnight to dry with the rest of my
brushes<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:25.949> I<00:04:26.130> do<00:04:26.190> this<00:04:26.430> process<00:04:26.669> at<00:04:27.120> least

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
brushes and I do this process at least

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.370 
brushes and I do this process at least
once<00:04:28.020> every<00:04:28.199> week<00:04:29.160> and<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.430> half<00:04:29.460> or<00:04:29.940> so<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:31.020> like

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
once every week and a half or so I like

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.469 
once every week and a half or so I like
to<00:04:31.500> clean<00:04:31.650> my<00:04:31.680> brushes<00:04:31.979> often<00:04:32.789> as<00:04:33.000> often<00:04:33.240> as<00:04:33.389> I

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
to clean my brushes often as often as I

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.810 
to clean my brushes often as often as I
use<00:04:33.690> them<00:04:33.900> because<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:35.370> don't<00:04:35.520> want<00:04:35.669> to<00:04:35.729> use

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
use them because you don't want to use

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.300 
use them because you don't want to use
brushes<00:04:36.000> that<00:04:36.300> are<00:04:36.509> always<00:04:37.199> dirty<00:04:37.710> cuz<00:04:38.130> they

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
brushes that are always dirty cuz they

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.670 
brushes that are always dirty cuz they
don't<00:04:38.580> allow<00:04:39.180> your<00:04:39.539> makeup<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.139> go<00:04:40.259> on<00:04:40.440> as
