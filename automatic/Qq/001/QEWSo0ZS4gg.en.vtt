00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:09.440
 with friends we are close to the event 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.490
 I'm going to make the chicken already 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.290
 a seasoning 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.420
 without anything 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.420
 so as well as how it came 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.230
 the cleanest possible no appliance 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.500
 happy 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.220
 I keep receiving these messages 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.220
 support 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.130
 to home 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.130
 ah 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.300
 or 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.560
 the discharge of water 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.540
 hate 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.409
 so so so 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.570
 one of the most controversial parts that 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.330
 they always ask part of the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.770
 implementation 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.440
 I'm going to share a bit of the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.360
 supplementation that I do these days 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.660
 normally every day is equal to 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.660
 drink 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.750
 five months 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.659
 to take five months in the morning and then 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.320
 in the afternoon and evening every eight hours 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.320
 it's a door 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.910
 the capsules of l carnitine with 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.910
 methionine 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.640
 same 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.640
 8 hours 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.620
 I do not care 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.190
 he also cries 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.270
 the liver has adequate way 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.980
 now I have 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.280
 glucosamine with chondroitin 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.920
 same every 8 hours 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.180
 for joints 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.180
 joints ligaments 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.360
 and then we have played in the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.360
 stage 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.430
 of cramps with this we avoid 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.430
 and finish 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.700
 complex b 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.700
 now 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.280
 important to maintain the processes 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.280
 metabolic 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.900
 I forgot the mine 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.950
 And social 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.310
 to give oxidation 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.500
 the body works properly 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.800
 hours 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.800
 now we are cooking to the 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.820
 old 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.820
 how's it going 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:43.090
 at the end of nothing 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.090
 as our god 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.340
 that is 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.180
 While 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.430
 total
