after<00:00:51.140> we<00:00:51.710> leave<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.070> village<00:00:53.890> so<00:00:54.890> I<00:00:55.370> was

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
after we leave the village so I was

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.460 
after we leave the village so I was
about<00:00:56.059> halfway<00:00:56.270> through<00:00:56.600> by<00:00:56.720> PhD<00:00:57.230> at<00:00:57.440> berkeley

when the earthquake occurred in gujarat

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.680 
when the earthquake occurred in gujarat
india<00:01:01.070> in<00:01:01.370> 2001<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.210> there<00:01:02.329> was<00:01:02.420> something

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
india in 2001 and there was something

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.960 
india in 2001 and there was something
like<00:01:02.720> 20,000<00:01:03.710> people<00:01:04.369> killed<00:01:04.729> by<00:01:04.940> that

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
like 20,000 people killed by that

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.810 
like 20,000 people killed by that
earthquake<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:05.750> mostly<00:01:06.050> from<00:01:06.820> collapsing

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
earthquake and mostly from collapsing

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.359 
earthquake and mostly from collapsing
unreinforced<00:01:08.600> masonry<00:01:09.410> buildings<00:01:09.440> and<00:01:10.220> here

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
unreinforced masonry buildings and here

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.130 
unreinforced masonry buildings and here
was<00:01:10.640> learning<00:01:11.090> about<00:01:11.149> earthquake<00:01:11.660> resistant

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
was learning about earthquake resistant

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.560 
was learning about earthquake resistant
design<00:01:12.410> and<00:01:12.740> I<00:01:13.100> had<00:01:13.340> this<00:01:13.700> experience<00:01:13.759> working

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
design and I had this experience working

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.900 
design and I had this experience working
for<00:01:14.869> my<00:01:14.990> father<00:01:15.020> as<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.619> brick<00:01:16.009> mason<00:01:16.369> so<00:01:16.580> I<00:01:16.610> knew

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
for my father as a brick mason so I knew

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.760 
for my father as a brick mason so I knew
about<00:01:17.090> how<00:01:17.390> to<00:01:17.450> build<00:01:17.810> these<00:01:17.960> types<00:01:18.259> of<00:01:18.380> houses

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
about how to build these types of houses

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.980 
about how to build these types of houses
and<00:01:19.009> I<00:01:19.550> thought<00:01:19.729> well<00:01:20.030> you<00:01:20.450> know<00:01:20.479> this<00:01:20.750> is<00:01:20.960> a

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
and I thought well you know this is a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.350 
and I thought well you know this is a
man-made<00:01:21.470> problem<00:01:22.250> it's<00:01:22.490> not<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:22.790> earthquake

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
man-made problem it's not the earthquake

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.820 
man-made problem it's not the earthquake
that<00:01:23.390> kills<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.869> people<00:01:24.050> it's<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:24.380> building

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
that kills the people it's the building

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.650 
that kills the people it's the building
collapsing<00:01:25.399> that<00:01:25.670> does<00:01:25.940> so<00:01:26.210> there<00:01:26.360> should<00:01:26.630> be

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
collapsing that does so there should be

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.080 
collapsing that does so there should be
some<00:01:27.080> solution<00:01:27.530> so<00:01:28.399> I<00:01:28.430> thought<00:01:28.640> if<00:01:28.759> I<00:01:28.880> put

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
some solution so I thought if I put

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.850 
some solution so I thought if I put
those<00:01:29.240> two<00:01:29.540> together<00:01:29.659> that<00:01:30.170> I<00:01:30.500> could<00:01:30.710> really

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
those two together that I could really

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.220 
those two together that I could really
make<00:01:31.070> a<00:01:31.130> difference<00:01:31.400> in<00:01:31.670> this<00:01:31.790> field

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.610 

so<00:01:36.190> our<00:01:36.700> first<00:01:37.060> project<00:01:37.300> is<00:01:37.660> working<00:01:38.350> in<00:01:38.590> the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
so our first project is working in the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.040 
so our first project is working in the
area<00:01:39.370> devastated<00:01:39.850> by<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.270> tsunami<00:01:40.510> in<00:01:40.900> Aceh

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
area devastated by the tsunami in Aceh

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.560 
area devastated by the tsunami in Aceh
in<00:01:41.230> Indonesia<00:01:41.470> and<00:01:42.160> when<00:01:43.090> we<00:01:43.240> build<00:01:43.450> the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
in Indonesia and when we build the

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.930 
in Indonesia and when we build the
houses<00:01:43.720> we<00:01:44.080> hire<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:44.920> train<00:01:44.980> local<00:01:45.640> builders

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
houses we hire and train local builders

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.870 
houses we hire and train local builders
to<00:01:46.120> build<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.720> houses<00:01:47.110> but<00:01:47.320> we<00:01:47.980> also<00:01:48.190> engage

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
to build the houses but we also engage

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.550 
to build the houses but we also engage
the<00:01:49.300> homeowner<00:01:49.690> and<00:01:49.720> involve<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.170> homeowner

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
through construction and one of the

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.680 
through construction and one of the
first<00:01:56.620> families<00:01:56.860> that<00:01:57.280> we<00:01:57.370> worked<00:01:57.580> with<00:01:57.820> wife

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
first families that we worked with wife

first families that we worked with wife
a<00:01:58.870> husband<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.380> three<00:01:59.590> kids<00:01:59.680> they<00:02:00.580> built<00:02:00.880> a

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
a husband and three kids they built a

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.020 
a husband and three kids they built a
small<00:02:01.300> timber<00:02:02.260> Shack<00:02:02.500> right<00:02:02.830> there<00:02:03.100> on<00:02:03.760> their

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
small timber Shack right there on their

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.640 
small timber Shack right there on their
plot<00:02:04.210> so<00:02:04.390> they<00:02:04.600> could<00:02:04.780> be<00:02:04.930> there<00:02:05.140> day<00:02:05.350> by<00:02:05.560> day

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.580 
plot so they could be there day by day
in<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:07.180> construction<00:02:07.660> process<00:02:07.780> overseeing

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
in the construction process overseeing

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.410 
in the construction process overseeing
it<00:02:08.770> because<00:02:09.010> we<00:02:09.190> really<00:02:09.610> want<00:02:09.640> them<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.000> buy

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
it because we really want them to buy

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.180 
it because we really want them to buy
into<00:02:10.450> what<00:02:11.020> makes<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.590> house<00:02:11.740> earthquake

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
into what makes the house earthquake

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.210 
into what makes the house earthquake
resistant<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:13.690> when<00:02:14.440> we<00:02:14.560> got<00:02:14.680> finished<00:02:15.070> with

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
resistant so when we got finished with

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.980 
resistant so when we got finished with
this<00:02:15.340> particular<00:02:16.000> house<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.510> family<00:02:16.840> moved

this particular house the family moved
in<00:02:17.230> we're<00:02:17.920> doing<00:02:18.190> our<00:02:18.310> exit<00:02:18.730> survey<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.210> we're

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
in we're doing our exit survey and we're

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.940 
in we're doing our exit survey and we're
asking<00:02:19.690> all<00:02:19.810> these<00:02:19.930> technical<00:02:20.380> questions

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
asking all these technical questions

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.030 
asking all these technical questions
about<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.820> house<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:23.290> mom<00:02:23.500> she<00:02:23.830> just

about the house and the the mom she just
cut<00:02:24.340> right<00:02:24.370> through<00:02:24.550> all<00:02:24.910> of<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.420> she

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
cut right through all of that and she

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.020 
cut right through all of that and she
said<00:02:25.840> this<00:02:26.410> house<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.800> like<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:26.980> dream<00:02:27.370> now<00:02:28.000> I

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
said this house is like a dream now I

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.270 
said this house is like a dream now I
can<00:02:28.300> sleep<00:02:28.450> at<00:02:28.720> night<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:31.060> just<00:02:31.570> really

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
can sleep at night and it just really

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.680 
can sleep at night and it just really
made<00:02:33.280> us<00:02:33.520> realize<00:02:34.000> how<00:02:34.240> important<00:02:34.600> the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
made us realize how important the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.480 
made us realize how important the
earthquake<00:02:34.990> resistance<00:02:35.440> was<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.130> her<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.370> how

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
earthquake resistance was to her and how

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.100 
earthquake resistance was to her and how
much<00:02:36.640> she<00:02:36.910> believed<00:02:37.300> that<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.750> house<00:02:37.930> would

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
much she believed that the house would

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:46.800 
much she believed that the house would
keep<00:02:38.290> her<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.590> her<00:02:38.650> family<00:02:38.800> safe

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.479 

well<00:02:47.810> when<00:02:48.109> when<00:02:48.530> earthquakes<00:02:48.739> happen<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.430> the

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
well when when earthquakes happen in the

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.339 
well when when earthquakes happen in the
US<00:02:49.760> or<00:02:49.909> Japan<00:02:49.969> very<00:02:50.540> few<00:02:50.719> people<00:02:50.989> are<00:02:51.049> killed

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
US or Japan very few people are killed

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.259 
US or Japan very few people are killed
it<00:02:51.560> costs<00:02:52.159> a<00:02:52.189> lot<00:02:52.310> of<00:02:52.459> money<00:02:52.670> but<00:02:52.849> they're<00:02:53.060> very

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
it costs a lot of money but they're very

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.940 
it costs a lot of money but they're very
few<00:02:53.480> deaths<00:02:53.750> in<00:02:54.049> earthquakes<00:02:54.560> but<00:02:54.799> in

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
few deaths in earthquakes but in

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.440 
few deaths in earthquakes but in
developing<00:02:55.370> countries<00:02:55.430> thousands<00:02:56.390> and

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
developing countries thousands and

thousands of people are still killed by

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.289 
thousands of people are still killed by
earthquakes<00:02:59.329> so<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.590> 10<00:03:01.010> years<00:03:01.310> I'd<00:03:01.700> like

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
earthquakes so in 10 years I'd like

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.699 
earthquakes so in 10 years I'd like
earthquake<00:03:02.780> resistant<00:03:03.319> housing

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
earthquake resistant housing

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.289 
earthquake resistant housing
construction<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.400> become<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.849> norm<00:03:05.090> in

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
construction to become the norm in

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.149 
construction to become the norm in
developing<00:03:05.750> countries<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.739> really<00:03:07.010> reduce
