 the exhibition the outdoor students the two largest mammals 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.949
 is exhibited this month in one of the most recognized shopping centers 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:22.839
 from the city 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.239
 where you can see eleven unique pieces of prehistoric animals 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.179
 two

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.820
 manager of the one of the commercial unicentro medellín we have eleven the 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.970
 exemplary is 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.070
 d of that time I know 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.740
 the copies have to the Czech Republic they left Hamburg 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.760
 By boat they arrived in Cartagena in Cartagena arrived in Medellin 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.399
 it's the first time this sample visits america 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:58.870
 It is important 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.590
 what the community knows 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.380
 what stopped 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.670
 powerful that the sample is going to stay very little time 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.000
 In colombia 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.380
 and whoever wants to see it 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.570
 after he's here he has to go to pay so he can watch her 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.430
 the sample really 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.880
 percent is a sample 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.580
 roving the magic of realism these prehistoric animals 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.079
 they were the inspiration of the Swedish scientists and other artists who took 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.679
 more than two years in its construction thus achieving the exact replica of 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.799
 some extinct animals more than ten thousand years ago at the end of the era 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.590
 glacial the giants of the ice age is an exhibition 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.850
 per cent manifested that of the Quaternary era 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.530
 it is an exhibition that comes directly 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.550
 of the Czech Republic 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.929
 per cent was developed by paleontologists 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.840
 attached to the pilsen museum 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.630
 in the city of prague 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.979
 They developed from the fossils that have been found in 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.600
 practically all parts of the world except the continent 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.450
 African 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.049
 they developed these models 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:13.739
 which are the shakhtar exact museographic reproductions of the sec of the 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.739
 mammals that lived in that era 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.789
 two 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.319
 two 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.369
 for me it is very satisfying that you want is 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:32.769
 as the cooperative university of colombia 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.059
 has linked with that because he believed from the beginning 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:38.500
 in this project 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.019
 It is important 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.679
 what g 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:43.639
 the scientific community 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.589
 Well this 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:48.889
 efe endorsing in a certain way then all this work 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:51.959
 that was made from 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.899
 of the fossils that is important 

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:56.160

 This copy is sponsored by the cooperative university 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:01.859
 from Colombia 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.439
 let us know in dakar the heroes so you will know how big was our 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:06.659
 history 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.599
 with mid 2008 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.599
 this was a bigger deer that can come into being 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:17.109
 from its curule if it reaches about two meters in height to its legs 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:22.009
 It is ditched cornet as we claimed this one reaches to measure about 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:26.759
 three and a half meters from end to end and can weigh up to 40 kilograms 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:31.799
 is very badly known because it was polygamists who are polygamists 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.069
 the animals that would like to go around hungry 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.919
 with these hikes the path is said to be 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.979
 three Colombians and one Venezuelan 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.319

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.229
 dr 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:58.259
 we have some guided tours that can be 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:59.370
 In two ways 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.569
 spontaneous that that is not the people meet here at this point where we are 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:08.919
 and there you have a more or less significant group of people 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.499
 begins to be the route 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:11.999
 with ways that were 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:17.570
 They were also able to read trained ccoo networks by museum staff 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:20.329
 University of Antioquia University 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.329
 reply 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:27.969

 my name is marcela lópez velázquez 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.849
 at this moment we are dictating a workshop in 67 percent 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:42.059
 travel will support your section of the era she is not exempt from alien tussam in 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:43.219
 clay 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:48.900
 the workshop is to make animals in plasticine is very simple 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.610
 we are simply 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.610
 we take a sample of the play dough and we make 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.189
 the animal tamed margin of the best of him 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:01.610
 it's very important because they can learn by playing them not necessarily 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.860
 they have to stop a wave and they do not leave the characteristic of the different 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.169
 animals so very rigid but they are the sea water my house learn and 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.190
 it takes a lot of knowledge we have some very nice anecdotes 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.309
 that is, we had a child of about three or four years 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:20.539
 that what I wanted to give him food 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.749
 Primal albos interest as the ancestor of the bull 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:28.120
 and what he wanted was to re food and entel was passing him 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.360
 the food obviously, the Valencian teaches the world 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.389
 he is not alive if manny is alive he is alive 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.409
 I already part bland the anne children 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.580
 they have been the protagonists of the impressive show 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.090
 and people who also have an interest 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.229
 let's say it's scientifically enjoyed greatly 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:54.969

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.930

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.169
 I answer 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.289
 two 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.309
 I found a good exhibition very good 

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:14.740
 in the porteña scene that teleamazonas 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.319
 children but the big person to know the animal is from the ice age 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.650
 i for them that they have moved psoe because it is a very nice profession 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:25.180
 so we invite everyone 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.240

 to come, I am absolutely sure that no one who comes unicentro in this 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.830
 epoch will come out disappointed 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.830
