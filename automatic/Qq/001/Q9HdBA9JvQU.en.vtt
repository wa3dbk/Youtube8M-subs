responded right away that's just when i
sat<00:01:28.170> down<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.710> we're<00:01:29.340> going<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.520> try<00:01:29.610> moving

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
sat down so we're going to try moving

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.390 
sat down so we're going to try moving
around<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.540> little<00:01:30.570> bit<00:01:33.229> it<00:01:34.229> seems<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.310> be

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
around just a little bit it seems to be

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.210 
around just a little bit it seems to be
following<00:01:35.579> me<00:01:36.079> I'll<00:01:37.079> be<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.740> jerky<00:01:38.100> way

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
following me I'll be it in a jerky way

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.590 
following me I'll be it in a jerky way
but<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.579> following<00:01:39.060> me<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.240> don't<00:01:39.420> have<00:01:39.450> to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
but it is following me I don't have to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.390 
but it is following me I don't have to
work<00:01:39.750> too<00:01:39.960> hard<00:01:39.990> what<00:01:40.590> happens<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.070> move<00:01:41.250> up

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
work too hard what happens if I move up

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.039 
work too hard what happens if I move up
and<00:01:42.200> it<00:01:43.200> still<00:01:43.380> follows<00:01:43.740> me<00:01:44.119> so<00:01:45.119> i<00:01:45.420> guess<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
and it still follows me so i guess the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.730 
and it still follows me so i guess the
camera<00:01:46.320> likes<00:01:46.500> me<00:01:46.759> that's<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.000> can

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.069 

so<00:01:51.670> one<00:01:51.820> of<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:52.030> things<00:01:52.090> we<00:01:52.420> discover<00:01:52.810> when<00:01:53.020> we

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
so one of the things we discover when we

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.600 
so one of the things we discover when we
first<00:01:53.320> started<00:01:53.680> this<00:01:53.770> experiment<00:01:54.189> is<00:01:54.549> that

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
first started this experiment is that

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.569 
first started this experiment is that
with<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.420> backlighting<00:01:55.990> correction<00:01:56.590> on<00:01:56.829> the

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
with the backlighting correction on the

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.260 
webcam recognized everyone recognized
data<00:01:59.649> recognize<00:02:00.159> Geoffrey<00:02:00.520> recognize<00:02:01.000> me

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
data recognize Geoffrey recognize me

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.240 
data recognize Geoffrey recognize me
when<00:02:01.720> we<00:02:01.869> turn<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.350> backlight<00:02:02.560> correction

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
when we turn the backlight correction

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.830 
when we turn the backlight correction
off<00:02:03.399> that's<00:02:04.000> where<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.299> ran<00:02:04.420> into<00:02:04.659> trouble

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
off that's where you ran into trouble

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.600 
off that's where you ran into trouble
that's<00:02:05.259> when<00:02:05.470> first<00:02:05.710> of<00:02:05.829> all<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.130> picture<00:02:06.430> got

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
that's when first of all the picture got

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.389 
that's when first of all the picture got
much<00:02:07.090> darker<00:02:07.600> as<00:02:07.780> you<00:02:08.380> can<00:02:08.500> see<00:02:08.679> right<00:02:08.709> now<00:02:08.920> and

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
much darker as you can see right now and
