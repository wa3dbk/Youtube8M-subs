00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.319
 the zander he is the noble fish of the fish 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.910
 our region's demand is huge 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.740
 The exploitation of the fisherman is always 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.190
 less and that drives the price in the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.320
 height 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.820
 to breed zander that was so far one 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.250
 very expensive and too 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.500
 risky undertaking three inventors 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.859
 have now figured out how to do that 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.859
 change 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.480
 every single zander from the basin 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.340
 enjoy the maximum attention of 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.770
 GÃ¼nter quote and his colleagues 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.690
 weekly they are weighed during 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.760
 your development from young to 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.860
 food fish half of the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.860
 growth phase rank 15 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.329
 So six months in total they need 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:05.339
 so about one and a half years so all around 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.339
 sure to reach this 1.5 kilo 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.009
 These are the first low energy zander 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.520
 so they are called they grow in 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.440
 this fish farm has about 2,000 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.810
 zander at once with all 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.119
 nourished at just 500 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.220
 watt energy consumption per hour 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.020
 as many as a computer only 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.440
 Once a day, the filter must be cleaned 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.850
 become 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.850
 more there is to do 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.750
 15 to 20 minutes you are done with it 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.730
 what works so easy today 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.100
 that took years of development 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.490
 most important the enrichment of the water 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.860
 with bacteria and that takes place in these 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.120
 instead of how it works 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.120
 stays secret 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.220
 they have managed a trick the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.900
 greedy predatory fish from a small to 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.790
 to bring fresh fish 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.190
 to eat dry pellets 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.270
 you have to respect a lot of them 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.250
 animal species and then works but has 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.480
 also took several years and so this 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.550
 to get experience 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.680
 and there will surely be more 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.690
 you have to keep working on it 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:28.090
 the thing in to make the civil 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.400
 dry food low energy zander 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.100
 rearing model is ready for 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.560
 Marketing with it should be food fish 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.780
 but also stock fish cost-effectively 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.300
 are bred then there is the zander 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.000
 maybe more often in the lake and 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.420
 may soon be cheaper on the 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.420
 Plate
