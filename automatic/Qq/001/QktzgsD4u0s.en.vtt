and this helps the rider concentrate on

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.530 
and this helps the rider concentrate on
where<00:01:46.049> they<00:01:46.380> are<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:46.820> which<00:01:47.820> will<00:01:48.150> be<00:01:48.330> very

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
where they are going which will be very

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.500 
where they are going which will be very
useful<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.200> normal<00:01:49.740> customers<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.610> not<00:01:51.180> just

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
useful to normal customers and not just

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.130 
useful to normal customers and not just
for<00:01:51.750> Jorge<00:01:52.170> Lorenzo<00:01:52.820> it<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.030> safer<00:01:54.540> but<00:01:54.960> will

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
for Jorge Lorenzo it is safer but will

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.609 
for Jorge Lorenzo it is safer but will
also<00:01:55.530> make<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.890> bike<00:01:56.100> very<00:01:56.460> exciting<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.240> ride

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
also make the bike very exciting to ride

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.929 
also make the bike very exciting to ride
this<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.680> important<00:01:59.520> the<00:02:00.240> bike<00:02:00.479> must<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:01.290> fun

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
this is important the bike must be fun

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.750 
this is important the bike must be fun

four<00:02:27.620> years<00:02:27.890> ago<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:29.060> crossplane<00:02:29.570> concept

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
four years ago the crossplane concept

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.860 
four years ago the crossplane concept
