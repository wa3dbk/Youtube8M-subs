00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.730
 this is a high ranking game 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.810
 I was in a position to challenge the first ones 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.609
 four of the ranking 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.680
 at the same time the challenge that will go of 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.629
 scene in a few moments for example there is 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.709
 a very interesting mogliano calvisano 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:17.300
 which obviously sees the latter in front 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.189
 and the first in the standings 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.009
 let's see who will have the necessary oxygen 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.900
 now to start at high altitude 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.509
 the important challenges we are at the end of 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.099
 first round and slowly you do 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.109
 of the areas which are the teams 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.909
 more optically a smell of play off 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.670
 and every challenge is obviously important 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:36.620
 especially if it's a direct challenge 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.420
 reached the gold flames but with one 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.500
 game obviously more than we see 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.579
 already a signatory that if in possession 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.500
 of the oval with the pressure below is 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.660
 a good drive will look good 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.149
 drive we advance very well rovigo force 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.390
 we are giving ourselves calmly we are cold and 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.679
 the amortization we have not been able to 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.199
 bring it for once but we are there 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.590
 a meter away and let's get organized now with 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.839
 calm 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.579
 let's see if we bring any of them back 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.870
 Because our forward you test 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.420
 we try it, we definitely try 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.390
 from goal and the referee is goal from goal 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.120
 bertelli was our right 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.470
 we left again 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.720
 add two more points and what 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.290
 the scorigino scor e part stefano seems 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.870
 good looks good girls get up 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.150
 and all this gives reason to what 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.640
 until now I live it tried to do 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.840
 then play score still locked 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.820
 on 7 to 0 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.610
 ceccato and very good and excellent brivio 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.020
 of the femi cz rugby rome is not settled 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.630
 in the hands of the players shopping 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.360
 let's go there we were half way right 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.920
 Rovigo was right that his own 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.530
 transformation that could lead 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.200
 rovigo a piÃ¹ 14 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.440
 it seems to me that part stefano at the foot 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.160
 is a quail says yes so 14 to 0 2 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.500
 rovigo destinations obviously seen that then the 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.330
 previous situation with a scrum 5 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.350
 did not bear fruit bearing fruit 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.350
 instead this free kick 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.950
 I would opt to try to start over at 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.550
 do what he did 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.260
 at the beginning of the first half 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.730
 benetti's soccer is short 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.630
 direction was optimal but you think that 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.310
 be more andrea de brands very human 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.020
 we managed to hold that then 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.820
 moment we might in the game document 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.410
 because the time has already come a lot 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.820
 good for luciano di gaza widen 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.830
 to the inclusion of stefan basson a 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.940
 stefan foods for given farolini 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.620
 stopped very well he had not held up well 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.600
 the line of what was low in the sense 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.550
 It had not gone well established perfect 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:47.450
 but we have very few big holes 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.670
 meters from the crimson goal we play 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.070
 this applies to offshore for andrea de 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.100
 marks that challenge assumed succeeds 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.620
 stay in the field and cut away 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.190
 the other internet do it with the cyber he 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.780
 vian in the first half always give in 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.090
 time of flight of the ball from a forever 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.860
 time the defense of being able to put ourselves 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.930
 a piece 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.060
 let's play the stefan pass 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.890
 still off we go let's go with the die 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.430
 feeds for lupone 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.950
 here it is the train of our new 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.860
 zealand and directly from the holidays 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.680
 Christmas 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.140
 the goal that wakes me up I am 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.320
 we have twenty minutes and we have the 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.870
 need to run there at this point 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.580
 an advantage in favor of the flames e 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.790
 a numerical superiority outside that 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.860
 I think it was bane bane ben 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.100
 exploited by Captain Masaro surely 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:47.450
 will whistle after the transformation of 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:50.390
 South African who hits the goalposts so 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.640
 ends the match with the result of 19 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.800
 10 for the femi cz rugby rovigo delta 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.400
 against the gold flames sports group 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.400
 rugby
