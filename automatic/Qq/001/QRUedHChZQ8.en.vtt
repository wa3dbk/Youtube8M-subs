basically<00:00:05.670> this<00:00:06.089> aqua<00:00:06.629> clear<00:00:06.750> 70<00:00:07.470> on<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.099> home

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
basically this aqua clear 70 on a home

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.669 
basically this aqua clear 70 on a home
20<00:00:08.820> gallon<00:00:09.179> tank<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.950> put<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.080> aqua<00:00:13.080> clear<00:00:13.230> 30

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
20 gallon tank and I put a aqua clear 30

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.250 
20 gallon tank and I put a aqua clear 30
propeller<00:00:14.219> in<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.480> don't<00:00:15.630> move<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:16.080> lot

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
propeller in it so it don't move a lot

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.620 
propeller in it so it don't move a lot
of<00:00:16.410> water<00:00:16.619> like<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> 70<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.760> it's<00:00:18.210> not<00:00:18.390> too

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
of water like a 70 and it's not too

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.359 
of water like a 70 and it's not too
powerful<00:00:19.230> for<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.500> tank<00:00:19.770> also<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.760> can<00:00:20.970> see

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
powerful for the tank also you can see

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.310 
powerful for the tank also you can see
gives<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.550> lot<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.789> room<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.449> got<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.140> back

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
gives you a lot of room I got the back

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.349 
gives you a lot of room I got the back
of<00:00:25.470> purging<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.039> there<00:00:26.220> guy<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.730> there's<00:00:27.269> a

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
of purging in there guy that there's a

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.910 
of purging in there guy that there's a
wall<00:00:27.599> where<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.019> water<00:00:28.260> has<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.560> come<00:00:28.890> through

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
wall where the water has to come through

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.359 
wall where the water has to come through
it's<00:00:29.519> got<00:00:29.670> an<00:00:29.789> in-tank<00:00:30.269> media<00:00:30.960> basket<00:00:31.560> I'm

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
it's got an in-tank media basket I'm

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.130 
it's got an in-tank media basket I'm
sure<00:00:32.790> some<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.149> y'all<00:00:33.360> know<00:00:33.540> about<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.960> but

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
sure some of y'all know about it but

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.959 
sure some of y'all know about it but
anyways<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.770> water<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.700> going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.910> come

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
anyways the water is going to come

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.299 
anyways the water is going to come
through<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.510> filter<00:00:36.870> floss<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:38.040> wall

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
through the filter floss and this wall

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.360 
through the filter floss and this wall
solid<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.570> got<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.780> go<00:00:39.899> down<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.739> then<00:00:41.219> it

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
solid so it's got to go down and then it

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.490 
solid so it's got to go down and then it
goes<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> chamber<00:00:42.660> at<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.840> bottom<00:00:43.320> down

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
goes to a chamber at the bottom down

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.250 
goes to a chamber at the bottom down
here<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.730> very<00:00:45.000> bottom<00:00:45.450> which<00:00:45.539> has<00:00:45.719> got<00:00:45.930> some

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
here the very bottom which has got some

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.549 
here the very bottom which has got some
false<00:00:46.860> guard<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.579> down<00:00:47.850> there<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.660> then<00:00:49.140> it

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
false guard in it down there and then it

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.189 
false guard in it down there and then it
ends<00:00:49.890> up<00:00:50.100> coming<00:00:50.640> up<00:00:50.850> through<00:00:51.180> here<00:00:51.600> through

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
ends up coming up through here through

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.319 
ends up coming up through here through
the<00:00:52.350> filter<00:00:52.739> floss<00:00:52.920> through<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.210> then

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the filter floss through that and then

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.080 
the filter floss through that and then
out<00:00:54.890> so<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.219> said<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.730> aqua<00:00:57.030> clear

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
out so like I said this is a aqua clear

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.799 
out so like I said this is a aqua clear
70<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.559> all<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> size<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> 70<00:01:00.210> but

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
70 so you get all the size of the 70 but

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.110 
70 so you get all the size of the 70 but
you<00:01:01.199> get<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> movement<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:02.160> like<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> aqua

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
you get the movement of like a aqua

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.109 
you get the movement of like a aqua
clear<00:01:03.239> 30<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.559> tank<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.979> not<00:01:05.220> being<00:01:05.430> you

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
clear 30 so the tank is not being you

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.240 
clear 30 so the tank is not being you
know<00:01:06.270> water<00:01:06.990> blowing<00:01:07.470> everywhere<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
know water blowing everywhere and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.550 
know water blowing everywhere and
messing<00:01:09.240> up<00:01:09.360> your<00:01:09.510> corals<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.080> everything

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
messing up your corals and everything

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.060 
messing up your corals and everything
now<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.250> next<00:01:11.700> one<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.000> did<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.619> another<00:01:13.619> aqua

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
now the next one I did is another aqua

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.289 
now the next one I did is another aqua
clear<00:01:14.220> 70<00:01:14.670> with<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:16.250> aqua<00:01:17.250> clear<00:01:17.400> 30<00:01:17.790> propeller

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
clear 70 with a aqua clear 30 propeller

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.960 
clear 70 with a aqua clear 30 propeller
and<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:18.960> same<00:01:19.290> thing<00:01:19.340> not<00:01:20.340> moving<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.820> lot

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
and it's so same thing not moving a lot

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.749 
and it's so same thing not moving a lot
of<00:01:21.119> water<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.720> then<00:01:22.380> about<00:01:22.920> an<00:01:23.040> aquatic<00:01:23.400> life

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
of water and then about an aquatic life

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.840 
of water and then about an aquatic life
protein<00:01:24.540> skimmer<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.799> has<00:01:26.040> its<00:01:26.280> own<00:01:26.460> pump

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
protein skimmer that has its own pump

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.210 
protein skimmer that has its own pump
and<00:01:27.060> everything<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.689> no<00:01:27.930> air<00:01:28.229> lines<00:01:28.560> no<00:01:28.950> bio

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and everything so no air lines no bio

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.289 
and everything so no air lines no bio
cube<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.450> know<00:01:31.369> little<00:01:32.369> protein<00:01:32.939> skimmer

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
cube you know little protein skimmer

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.780 
cube you know little protein skimmer
with<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> wood<00:01:33.840> stones<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.560> stuff<00:01:34.829> anyway<00:01:35.759> so

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
with the wood stones and stuff anyway so

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.109 
with the wood stones and stuff anyway so
I<00:01:36.119> bought<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:37.220> protein<00:01:38.220> skimmer<00:01:38.400> aquatic

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
I bought this a protein skimmer aquatic

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.990 
I bought this a protein skimmer aquatic
life<00:01:39.299> many<00:01:39.750> internal<00:01:40.500> protein<00:01:41.100> skimmer<00:01:41.430> it's

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
life many internal protein skimmer it's

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.770 
life many internal protein skimmer it's
made<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.960> know<00:01:43.079> internal<00:01:43.890> inside<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.549> a
