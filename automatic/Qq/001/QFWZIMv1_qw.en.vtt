00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
was a bit of a letdown since there was

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.300 
was a bit of a letdown since there was
no<00:02:46.780> challenge<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.770> it<00:02:47.890> just<00:02:47.920> makes<00:02:48.220> it

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
no challenge to it and it just makes it

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.860 
no challenge to it and it just makes it

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
annoying when you have to do it over and

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.540 
annoying when you have to do it over and
over<00:02:50.170> again<00:02:50.260> since<00:02:50.590> there's<00:02:50.770> nothing<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.310> it

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
over again since there's nothing to it

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.430
