made up of like diamonds and stars in a
grid<00:01:02.489> pattern<00:01:02.520> all<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:02.969> way<00:01:03.059> through<00:01:03.300> casino

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
grid pattern all the way through casino

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.570 
grid pattern all the way through casino
Backman's<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.799> pattern<00:01:05.070> goes<00:01:05.280> all<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.519> way

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
Backman's the pattern goes all the way

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.179 
Backman's the pattern goes all the way
to<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.820> edges<00:01:06.110> it<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.409> one-way<00:01:07.770> back<00:01:08.010> design

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
to the edges it is a one-way back design

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.789 
to the edges it is a one-way back design
it<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.850> different<00:01:09.630> when<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.170> reversed

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
it is different when it's reversed

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.250 
it is different when it's reversed
so<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.630> riffle<00:01:12.630> shuffle<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.020> cards

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
so if you riffle shuffle the cards

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.410 
so if you riffle shuffle the cards
together<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:14.310> will<00:01:14.520> notice<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
together you will notice that the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.230 
together you will notice that the
pattern<00:01:16.130> changes<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> side<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.850> your<00:01:17.939> deck

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
design I guess from the Sultan deck if

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.530 
design I guess from the Sultan deck if
you<00:01:40.770> remember<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> back<00:01:41.340> design<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
Sultan deck that's the same symbol

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.410 
Sultan deck that's the same symbol
they're<00:01:44.509> one<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.540> these<00:01:45.810> jokers<00:01:46.729> has<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.759> card

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
they're one of these jokers has a card

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.230 
they're one of these jokers has a card
