as you guys see it looks beautiful like

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.780 
as you guys see it looks beautiful like
the<00:02:32.870> tamaak<00:02:33.200> look<00:02:34.190> see<00:02:34.310> there's<00:02:34.460> a<00:02:34.490> hitmarker

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
the tamaak look see there's a hitmarker

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.090 
the tamaak look see there's a hitmarker
around<00:02:35.240> it<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:35.690> that's<00:02:36.170> how<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.350> can<00:02:36.590> tell

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
around it so that's how you can tell

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.100 
around it so that's how you can tell
most<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.459> time<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:38.540> was<00:02:38.630> silent<00:02:38.840> right

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
again as long as you get one hit so

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.970 
again as long as you get one hit so
probably<00:03:08.810> not<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.050> SVU<00:03:09.320> and<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:09.739> you<00:03:09.800> can<00:03:09.890> get

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
probably not the SVU and so you can get

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.240 
probably not the SVU and so you can get
them<00:03:10.100> in<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.250> head<00:03:11.320> so<00:03:12.320> you<00:03:12.739> know<00:03:12.830> normally
