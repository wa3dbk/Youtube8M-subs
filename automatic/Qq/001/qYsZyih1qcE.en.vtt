the other penguins but there are what we

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.160 
the other penguins but there are what we
call<00:00:35.370> sub-antarctic<00:00:36.030> penguins<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.020> they're

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
call sub-antarctic penguins so they're

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.979 
call sub-antarctic penguins so they're

when he's full-grown this hatching is

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.939 
when he's full-grown this hatching is
very<00:00:54.449> important<00:00:55.110> for<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> Cincinnati<00:00:55.860> Zoo

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
very important for the Cincinnati Zoo

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.700 
very important for the Cincinnati Zoo
and<00:00:56.340> for<00:00:56.579> Larry<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.090> bebe<00:00:57.320> this<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.530> their

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
and for Larry and bebe this is their

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.229 
and for Larry and bebe this is their
second<00:00:59.129> hatching<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.640> it's<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.850> second

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
second hatching and it's a second

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.000 
second hatching and it's a second
hatching<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.750> we've<00:01:00.930> had<00:01:01.140> here<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
hatching that we've had here in the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.250 
hatching that we've had here in the
history<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> zoo<00:01:02.820> basically<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:04.019> need<00:01:04.229> to

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
history of the zoo basically we need to

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.170 
history of the zoo basically we need to
hatch<00:01:04.559> these<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> self-sustaining

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
hatch these and have a self-sustaining

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.870 
hatch these and have a self-sustaining
population<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.140> captivity<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:08.280> everyone<00:01:08.760> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
population in captivity for everyone to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.460 
population in captivity for everyone to
see<00:01:09.090> these<00:01:09.270> birds<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.049> them<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> be

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
see these birds and for them to be

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.070 
see these birds and for them to be
ambassadors<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.159> an<00:01:11.640> article<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.689> we'll<00:01:12.930> have

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
ambassadors for an article so we'll have

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.350 
ambassadors for an article so we'll have
these<00:01:13.350> birds<00:01:13.860> around<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> long<00:01:14.790> time<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
these birds around for a long time and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.210 
these birds around for a long time and
hopefully<00:01:15.509> Beebe<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.020> Larry<00:01:16.290> will<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.619> more

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
hopefully Beebe and Larry will have more

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.030 
hopefully Beebe and Larry will have more
chicks<00:01:17.490> as<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:18.150> go<00:01:18.299> now<00:01:18.900> penguins<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> wild

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
chicks as we go now penguins in the wild

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.100 
chicks as we go now penguins in the wild
are<00:01:20.159> having<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.610> hard<00:01:20.820> time<00:01:20.880> king<00:01:21.479> penguins<00:01:21.960> are

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
are having a hard time king penguins are

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.200 
are having a hard time king penguins are
doing<00:01:22.350> fairly<00:01:22.619> well<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.549> there<00:01:23.759> are<00:01:23.880> four

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
doing fairly well but there are four

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.840 
doing fairly well but there are four
species<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:25.080> are<00:01:25.259> highly<00:01:25.710> endangered<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.490> a

getting warmer we see oil spills we see

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.219 
getting warmer we see oil spills we see
pollution<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:41.670> see<00:01:41.850> overfishing<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.750> all

pollution and we see overfishing and all

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.899 
pollution and we see overfishing and all
of<00:01:43.409> those<00:01:43.560> factors<00:01:43.860> are<00:01:44.130> taking<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.670> toll<00:01:44.880> on

of those factors are taking a toll on

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.149 
of those factors are taking a toll on

there's<00:01:47.430> going<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.670> be<00:01:47.729> even<00:01:48.060> more

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
there's going to be even more

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.660 
there's going to be even more
populations<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.470> will<00:01:49.680> either<00:01:49.920> disappear

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
populations that will either disappear

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.480 
populations that will either disappear
or<00:01:50.700> decline<00:01:51.659> substantially<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.829> what<00:01:53.310> can

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
or decline substantially and what can

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.929 
or decline substantially and what can
you<00:01:53.520> do<00:01:53.939> well<00:01:54.570> basically<00:01:55.530> save<00:01:55.799> energy<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
you do well basically save energy the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.690 
you do well basically save energy the
carbon<00:01:57.450> footprint<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.500> has<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> lot

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
carbon footprint that you have has a lot

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.420 
carbon footprint that you have has a lot
to<00:01:59.729> do<00:02:00.060> with<00:02:00.210> how<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.689> global<00:02:01.680> warming<00:02:02.130> takes

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
to do with how this global warming takes

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.789 
to do with how this global warming takes
place<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:03.090> these<00:02:03.210> areas<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:03.899> drive<00:02:04.439> less

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
place in these areas so drive less

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.679 
place in these areas so drive less
change<00:02:05.490> your<00:02:05.729> lightbulbs<00:02:05.969> out<00:02:06.509> so

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
change your lightbulbs out so

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.220 
change your lightbulbs out so
