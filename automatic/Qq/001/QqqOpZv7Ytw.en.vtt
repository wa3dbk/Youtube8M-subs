00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
there as you can see which L should

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.290 
there as you can see which L should
actually<00:04:21.420> attach<00:04:22.580> okay<00:04:23.580> so<00:04:24.420> this<00:04:24.990> street<00:04:25.230> here

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
actually attach okay so this street here

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.010 
actually attach okay so this street here
it<00:04:27.300> pushes<00:04:27.780> down<00:04:27.810> a<00:04:27.990> thing<00:04:28.350> in<00:04:28.770> there<00:04:29.870> it<00:04:30.870> has

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020

it pushes down a thing in there it has
to<00:04:31.050> be<00:04:31.290> level<00:04:31.650> of<00:04:31.800> ice<00:04:32.010> it<00:04:32.190> doesn't<00:04:32.370> shoot<00:04:32.850> it

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
to be level of ice it doesn't shoot it

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:41.750 
to be level of ice it doesn't shoot it
properly<00:04:36.920> which<00:04:37.920> on<00:04:38.160> shoots<00:04:38.820> this<00:04:40.520> you<00:04:41.520> attach

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760

the system right a tactical rail sort of

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.730 
the system right a tactical rail sort of
clip<00:05:13.280> so<00:05:14.280> you<00:05:14.610> slide<00:05:15.000> it<00:05:15.180> on<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.450> then<00:05:16.080> you<00:05:16.320> can

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
clip so you slide it on and then you can

that<00:05:49.630> some<00:05:49.870> subset<00:05:50.320> I<00:05:53.729> say<00:05:54.729> it's<00:05:54.910> a<00:05:54.940> pretty

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
that some subset I say it's a pretty

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.969 
that some subset I say it's a pretty
pretty<00:05:55.479> accurate<00:05:55.960> sight<00:05:56.110> for<00:05:56.350> close<00:05:56.500> range

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
pretty accurate sight for close range

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:01.230 
pretty accurate sight for close range
um<00:05:57.990> it's<00:05:58.990> kind<00:05:59.560> of<00:05:59.590> corny<00:05:59.830> gonna<00:06:00.280> be<00:06:00.490> like<00:06:00.729> so

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
um it's kind of corny gonna be like so

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:07.850 
um it's kind of corny gonna be like so
