 the first one in gel then my 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.479
 oily skin prone to acne tends to 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.650

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.990

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.280
 very good indeed in shelton absorption 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.270
 extremely fast law 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:42.570
 he is not even here in the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.860
 Here to aces eggs and uses makeup does 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.729
 everything and does not do the cleaning of shape 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.200
 proper 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.369
 it's probably going to be some do not know 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.079
 then when you start packing 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.619
 something I know probably 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.390
 because I do not know if they correct is 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.790
 that should be done daily this 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.100
 project because he is always with me or 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.469
 one part of the morning and one part of the night 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.630
 today I'm very correct in the morning in 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:10.080
 same part of the night I'm going to put him 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:12.810
 always in my grandmother 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.610
 in a little push then gets a 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.320
 very small amount of skin 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:22.020
 Can you see something put here? 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.890
 he leaves you well and you pass in O 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.010
 skin 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.520
 it absorbs extremely 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.340
 fast is not furious and look that the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.120
 skin is such a great texture 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.900
 very good you thus make him smell 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.850
 weighs me a lot and does not fill up very soft 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.310
 almost imperceptible 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.070
 so to be an example you pass on 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.020
 face is very close to the nose and is 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.540
 for those who have these products with 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.850
 So I have a limit so it looks like you 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.750
 You can travel, you have nothing else. 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.130
 in the skin 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:02.220
 JosÃƒ Â© loved product and the truth is this 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.660
 here is part of a treatment of cnic 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.520
 in these six steps 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.100
 I do not do the three steps - the 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.660
 interesting here and so the whole thing 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.120
 time you hear a whole line of 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.160
 treatment may be very 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.440
 better but I have some produtinhos 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.180
 neither that the use I already have that I that 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:24.360
 I am and are faithful to the moment then people 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.459
 in this product 60 the game walks that 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.440
 Do you have any problem, because a lot of times 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.260
 you have acne prone skin 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.330
 walnuts you pass she unfortunately ends 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.250
 getting worse then it's always good to 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.019
 times we are today if there was someone who 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.660
 really understand I'd like to help 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.640
 our skin that every skin fla waits for 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.010
 with victory for each one has a granddaughter in 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.900
 one kind of skin you have another then 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.400
 always good for us to know that our 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.930
 skin to know the type of skin that 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.730
 people could be of the products that people 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.340
 can use what we can really 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.410
 increase sales is not mass in a 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.780
 elementary logic to buy articles is 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.550
 that it was there you just osas 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.160
 buying an old product dry it 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.769
 can end up getting worse in the opposite effect 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.650
 on your skin then always or consult 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.420
 someone who really understands and then people 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.269
 You know that we have this video in quality 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.220

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.880
 now knows which games is much more seen 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.880
