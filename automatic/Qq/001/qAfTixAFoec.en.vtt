rather<00:01:12.310> than<00:01:12.610> oatmeal<00:01:13.060> because<00:01:13.510> oatmeal<00:01:14.020> is

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
rather than oatmeal because oatmeal is

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.180

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
fiber one nothing like that

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.590 
fiber one nothing like that
any<00:01:23.380> protein<00:01:23.920> food<00:01:24.340> is<00:01:24.520> is<00:01:24.730> okay<00:01:25.210> because

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
any protein food is is okay because

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.050 
any protein food is is okay because
proteins<00:01:25.990> don't<00:01:26.350> have<00:01:26.530> fiber<00:01:27.070> and<00:01:27.400> them<00:01:27.550> so<00:01:27.850> a

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
proteins don't have fiber and them so a

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.970 
proteins don't have fiber and them so a
lot<00:01:28.600> of<00:01:28.630> times<00:01:28.930> after<00:01:29.110> surgery<00:01:29.650> will<00:01:29.800> say

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
lot of times after surgery will say

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.680 
lot of times after surgery will say
stick<00:01:30.220> to<00:01:30.250> things<00:01:30.460> that<00:01:30.640> are<00:01:30.820> tender<00:01:31.300> soft

stick to things that are tender soft

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.530 
stick to things that are tender soft
easier<00:01:32.410> to<00:01:32.560> digest<00:01:32.790> chew<00:01:33.790> everything<00:01:34.120> really

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
easier to digest chew everything really

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.240 
easier to digest chew everything really
well<00:01:34.720> but<00:01:34.930> there<00:01:35.080> is<00:01:35.170> no<00:01:35.320> particular<00:01:35.560> protein

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
well but there is no particular protein

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.390 
well but there is no particular protein
that's<00:01:36.570> definitively<00:01:37.570> restricted<00:01:38.400> and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
that's definitively restricted and

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.180 
that's definitively restricted and

of inflammation protein is really

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.660 
of inflammation protein is really
important<00:01:44.290> to<00:01:44.410> promote<00:01:44.590> that<00:01:44.860> healing<00:01:45.310> the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
issue that a lot of people have is how

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.970 
issue that a lot of people have is how
do<00:01:49.030> I<00:01:49.180> prevent<00:01:49.570> weight<00:01:50.080> gain<00:01:50.110> while<00:01:50.860> I'm

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
filing a low fiber diet because people

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.750 
filing a low fiber diet because people
think<00:01:52.780> this<00:01:53.230> is<00:01:53.440> completely<00:01:54.010> contradictory

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
think this is completely contradictory
