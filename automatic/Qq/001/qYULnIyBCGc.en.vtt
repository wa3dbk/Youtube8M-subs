00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.870
 this time we are going to prepare a plan 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.700
 of strawberries for this we will occupy 1 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.950
 strawberry cup we will occupy 6 eggs 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.349
 three quarters of a cup of sugar a milk 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.060
 evaporated and condensed milk 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.020
 as a first step we are going to preheat 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.020
 our oven 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.930
 at 350 degrees or 175 degrees if that 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.420
 you have the other stove time as 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.079
 next step we will place a pot 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.079
 simmer 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.059
 and we are going to take our sugar 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.760
 we will leave it there until it starts 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.810
 caramelize you have to be moving 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.600
 constantly 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.210
 well as you'll see it starts caramelize there 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.950
 to keep moving constantly to 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.990
 that the sugar is not going to burn anymore 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.730
 almost sugar is going to have a 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.260
 bitter taste must be moving 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.260
 constantly only 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.850
 and as you can see, caramel made it time to 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.100
 put out the fire once we have 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.360
 liquid well the candy what we're going to 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.820
 do is take it to the mold in which 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.960
 we are going to prepare our plan we are going to 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.420
 do very carefully because the 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.680
 horrible burning candy so you have to 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.330
 do it very carefully and in a 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.770
 fast way because it also cools very 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.719
 Quick 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.000
 since we have it in the mold we are going to 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.729
 try to incorporate for everything what is 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.230
 the bottom part until we have left 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.060
 this way 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.320
 and since we have it this way what 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.470
 let's let it rest for a moment 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.040
 we are going to place the strawberries in the 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.040
 blender 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.630
 we are going to place the eggs that I already know by 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.430
 what is already removed from the shells as you see 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.940
 a 6 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.940
 ah 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.790
 let's bring the evaporated milk 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.900
 and condensed milk 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.430
 and we will leave it 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.780
 since we're not going to come back from this 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.400
 way and what we're going to do is take 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.780
 our mix directly to the mold 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.780
 where we had placed the candy 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.740
 since we pour the mixture what we're going to 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.740
 do is place some aluminum and 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.890
 Cover all our mold perfectly 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.510
 in which we have the mixture 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.530
 later we are going to place water in 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.170
 another container 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.440
 to place it in a bain marie flan 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.230
 inside the oven by placing it in this 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.300
 way in this part we have the mold 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.040
 with the flan with the mixture for the flan and 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.520
 in this part we have the mold with water 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.670
 the water reaches this part of here and 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.910
 Now if we're going to bring it all together to 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.090
 bain- marie oven for about one 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.920
 hour or one hour with 40 minutes 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.110
 once we unmold we are left with 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.959
 this way and I only added 3 strawberries 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.430
 to decorate because it's very sweet so 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.590
