00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.020 

okay<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:01.979> idea<00:00:02.100> behind<00:00:02.399> this<00:00:02.580> build<00:00:02.820> is<00:00:02.939> to

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
okay the idea behind this build is to

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.769 
okay the idea behind this build is to
make<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.179> stronger<00:00:03.510> board<00:00:04.220> so<00:00:05.270> the<00:00:06.270> shell<00:00:06.569> of

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
make a stronger board so the shell of

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.669 
make a stronger board so the shell of
the<00:00:07.370> blank<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:09.019> to--we<00:00:10.019> foam<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.559> that's

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
the blank is to--we foam and that's

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.799 
the blank is to--we foam and that's
really<00:00:10.889> heavy<00:00:11.219> really<00:00:11.730> strong<00:00:12.980> so<00:00:13.980> I'm

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
really heavy really strong so I'm

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.010 
really heavy really strong so I'm
cutting<00:00:15.809> out<00:00:15.929> these<00:00:16.400> blocks<00:00:17.750> made<00:00:18.750> from

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
cutting out these blocks made from

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.120 
cutting out these blocks made from
lighter<00:00:19.230> foam<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.980> insert<00:00:20.369> into<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:22.189> 96

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
lighter foam to insert into the 96

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.710 
lighter foam to insert into the 96
chambers<00:00:26.130> or<00:00:26.340> cells<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.449> cut<00:00:28.050> with<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> router<00:00:28.699> so

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
chambers or cells I cut with a router so

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.620 
chambers or cells I cut with a router so
after<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.750> finish<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:31.349> I'm<00:00:31.920> going<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.340> be

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
after I finish this I'm going to be

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.549 
after I finish this I'm going to be
gluing<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.809> whole<00:00:33.960> thing<00:00:34.110> together

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
gluing the whole thing together

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.069 
gluing the whole thing together
and<00:00:34.710> there's<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.460> lot<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.670> pieces<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.570> glue<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
and there's a lot of pieces to glue and

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.260 
and there's a lot of pieces to glue and
so<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.230> get<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.559> into<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.760> glue<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.090> three

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
so I get it into in the glue in three

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.270 
so I get it into in the glue in three
phases<00:00:39.540> here<00:00:40.290> I'm<00:00:40.410> cutting<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.739> strong<00:00:41.040> back

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
phases here I'm cutting a strong back

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.220 
phases here I'm cutting a strong back
for<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.059> first<00:00:42.210> phase<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.960> see<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.200> there

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
for the first phase and you see it there

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.490 
for the first phase and you see it there
on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.469> right<00:00:44.930> one<00:00:45.930> thing<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.410> was

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
on the right one thing that was

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.380 
on the right one thing that was
important<00:00:46.980> was<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.430> be<00:00:47.700> sure<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.000> uh<00:00:48.059> whenever

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
important was to be sure to uh whenever

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.670 
important was to be sure to uh whenever
I've<00:00:48.629> inserted<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.829> foam<00:00:50.570> blocks<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:52.379> clamp

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
I've inserted the foam blocks to clamp

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.139 
I've inserted the foam blocks to clamp
it<00:00:52.770> from<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> side<00:00:53.219> because<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.879> Gorilla

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
it from the side because the Gorilla

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.299 
it from the side because the Gorilla
Glue<00:00:54.420> would<00:00:54.629> have<00:00:54.750> pushed<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.230> block<00:00:55.710> out<00:00:55.980> and

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
Glue would have pushed the block out and

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.830 
Glue would have pushed the block out and
I<00:00:56.370> would<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.579> had<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.730> deal<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
I would have had to deal with that so I

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.209 
I would have had to deal with that so I
had<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.079> put<00:00:58.199> some<00:00:58.320> thought<00:00:58.530> into<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:59.010> whole

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
had to put some thought into the whole

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.560 
had to put some thought into the whole
gluing<00:00:59.699> process<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:01.500> also<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.760> wanted<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
gluing process and also I wanted the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.039 
gluing process and also I wanted the
glue<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:05.659> touch<00:01:06.659> every<00:01:07.020> point<00:01:07.640> because<00:01:08.640> I

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
glue to touch every point because I

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.600 
glue to touch every point because I
wanted<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.110> find<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.409> final<00:01:10.860> blank<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.400> one

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
wanted to find a final blank to be one

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.929 
wanted to find a final blank to be one
unit<00:01:12.090> if<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.659> had<00:01:12.960> gaps<00:01:13.260> or<00:01:13.590> spaces<00:01:13.850> then<00:01:14.850> I'm

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
unit if it had gaps or spaces then I'm

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.520 
unit if it had gaps or spaces then I'm
going<00:01:15.150> backwards<00:01:15.390> from<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.840> original<00:01:16.200> intent

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
going backwards from the original intent

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.999 
going backwards from the original intent
of<00:01:16.680> making<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.159> stronger<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.750> took<00:01:19.740> some

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
of making it stronger so I took some

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.030 
of making it stronger so I took some
time<00:01:20.040> gluing<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.110> doing<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.290> glue<00:01:22.830> up<00:01:22.920> in

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
time gluing it and doing the glue up in

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:33.359 
time gluing it and doing the glue up in
the<00:01:23.130> three<00:01:23.280> phases<00:01:23.930> helped<00:01:24.930> with<00:01:25.080> that

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.440 

it<00:01:34.369> was<00:01:34.490> pretty<00:01:34.670> fun<00:01:34.880> putting<00:01:35.119> this<00:01:35.210> puzzle

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
it was pretty fun putting this puzzle

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.130 
it was pretty fun putting this puzzle
together<00:01:35.799> making<00:01:36.799> boards<00:01:37.310> is<00:01:37.610> a<00:01:38.060> fun<00:01:38.869> process

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
together making boards is a fun process

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.609 
together making boards is a fun process
and<00:01:40.240> this<00:01:41.240> board<00:01:41.450> was<00:01:41.630> really<00:01:41.869> challenging<00:01:42.409> so

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
and this board was really challenging so

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.499 
and this board was really challenging so
it<00:01:42.680> was<00:01:42.799> even<00:01:43.009> more<00:01:43.039> fun<00:01:43.220> I<00:01:43.460> mean<00:01:43.759> I<00:01:44.000> mean

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
it was even more fun I mean I mean

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.149 
it was even more fun I mean I mean
surfing<00:01:44.869> is<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.170> little<00:01:45.470> bit<00:01:45.649> better<00:01:45.799> than<00:01:46.039> this

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
surfing is a little bit better than this

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.279 
surfing is a little bit better than this
but<00:01:46.490> but<00:01:47.030> as<00:01:47.210> far<00:01:47.390> as<00:01:47.420> building<00:01:47.840> boards<00:01:47.990> this

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
but but as far as building boards this

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.359 
but but as far as building boards this
is<00:01:48.350> this<00:01:48.950> is<00:01:49.159> a<00:01:49.189> this<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.240> peak<00:01:50.420> for<00:01:50.659> me<00:01:51.369> anyway

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
is this is a this the peak for me anyway

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.039 
is this is a this the peak for me anyway
I<00:01:53.470> I'm<00:01:54.470> next<00:01:55.130> I'm<00:01:55.310> going<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.549> glue<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.840> side

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
I I'm next I'm going to glue the side

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.950 
I I'm next I'm going to glue the side
pieces<00:01:57.350> onto<00:01:57.679> this<00:01:57.979> now<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:58.700> glue<00:01:59.119> that<00:01:59.509> I

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
pieces onto this now the glue that I

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.639 
pieces onto this now the glue that I
applied<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.700> next<00:02:01.970> piece<00:02:02.649> you

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
applied to the to the next piece you

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:04.749 
applied to the to the next piece you
know<00:02:03.740> going<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:03.920> clap<00:02:04.130> them<00:02:04.250> together<00:02:04.369> tightly

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
know going to clap them together tightly

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.490 
know going to clap them together tightly
here<00:02:05.090> we<00:02:05.450> go<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:06.770> it's<00:02:07.369> going<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:08.500> expand

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
here we go and and it's going to expand

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.150 
here we go and and it's going to expand
uh<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.959> any<00:02:11.959> seams<00:02:12.350> that<00:02:12.530> are<00:02:12.650> showing<00:02:13.010> right

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
uh and any seams that are showing right

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.789 
uh and any seams that are showing right
here<00:02:13.220> in<00:02:13.580> this<00:02:13.730> one<00:02:13.940> from<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.690> side<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.769> know

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
here in this one from the side you know

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.380 
here in this one from the side you know
it'll<00:02:16.100> spit<00:02:16.310> expand<00:02:16.730> slightly<00:02:16.940> into<00:02:17.269> those

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
it'll spit expand slightly into those

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.610 
it'll spit expand slightly into those
seams<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:17.930> make<00:02:18.560> for<00:02:18.769> a<00:02:18.799> good<00:02:18.950> bond<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:20.620> here

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
seams and make for a good bond so here

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.590 
seams and make for a good bond so here
it<00:02:21.709> is<00:02:21.799> all<00:02:21.920> strapped<00:02:22.220> together<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:23.450> got

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
it is all strapped together and I got

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.140 
it is all strapped together and I got
the<00:02:23.750> weight<00:02:23.959> down<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.980> 26<00:02:25.519> pounds<00:02:25.730> on<00:02:26.060> the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
the weight down to 26 pounds on the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.680 
the weight down to 26 pounds on the
blank<00:02:26.420> from<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.870> original<00:02:27.200> 40<00:02:27.530> pounds<00:02:27.860> so<00:02:28.690> the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
blank from the original 40 pounds so the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.310 
blank from the original 40 pounds so the
idea<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:31.220> keep<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:31.940> just<00:02:32.239> under<00:02:32.660> the

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
idea is to keep it just under the

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.140 
idea is to keep it just under the
original<00:02:33.829> weight<00:02:34.160> of<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.400> old<00:02:34.549> elephant<00:02:34.970> guns

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
original weight of the old elephant guns

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.300 
original weight of the old elephant guns
because<00:02:35.359> I<00:02:35.420> did<00:02:35.720> update<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.350> shape<00:02:37.100> a<00:02:37.220> little

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
because I did update the shape a little

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.630 
because I did update the shape a little
bit<00:02:37.549> and<00:02:37.850> I<00:02:38.920> guys<00:02:39.920> were<00:02:40.100> really<00:02:40.370> used<00:02:40.549> to

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
bit and I guys were really used to

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.729 
bit and I guys were really used to
writing<00:02:40.910> really<00:02:41.720> heavy<00:02:42.019> boards<00:02:42.350> back<00:02:42.530> then

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
writing really heavy boards back then

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.220 
writing really heavy boards back then
it's<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.280> different<00:02:43.549> world<00:02:43.700> now<00:02:43.870> but<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:44.930> still

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
it's a different world now but I still

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.110 
it's a different world now but I still
want<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.440> make<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.590> traditional<00:02:47.260> board<00:02:49.120> and

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
want to make a traditional board and

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.110 
want to make a traditional board and
I've<00:02:50.269> really<00:02:50.510> never<00:02:50.630> had<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:50.900> desire<00:02:51.560> to

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
I've really never had a desire to

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.020 
I've really never had a desire to
duplicate<00:02:53.120> an<00:02:53.930> old<00:02:54.200> board<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:55.790> little
