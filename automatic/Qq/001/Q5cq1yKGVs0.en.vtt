00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
courses these are similar to some of the

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.720 
courses these are similar to some of the
spring<00:00:50.820> classic<00:00:51.360> races<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:52.019> Europe<00:00:52.469> yes<00:00:53.160> you

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
spring classic races in Europe yes you

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.369 
spring classic races in Europe yes you
have<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.089> the<00:00:54.269> physical<00:00:54.809> ability<00:00:55.199> but

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
have to have the physical ability but

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.290 
have to have the physical ability but
there's<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.739> task<00:00:55.949> tactical<00:00:56.579> aspect<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.210> as

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
there's a task tactical aspect of it as

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.240 
there's a task tactical aspect of it as
well<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.320> get<00:00:58.530> really<00:00:58.649> excited<00:00:58.769> about<00:00:59.100> these

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
well so I get really excited about these

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.979 
well so I get really excited about these
races<00:00:59.640> because<00:00:59.760> i<00:00:59.909> like<00:01:00.089> these<00:01:00.239> punchy<00:01:00.659> climbs

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
races because i like these punchy climbs

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.899 
races because i like these punchy climbs
but<00:01:01.620> there's<00:01:01.799> a<00:01:01.860> bit<00:01:02.129> more<00:01:02.159> to<00:01:02.519> it<00:01:02.549> than<00:01:02.850> just

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
but there's a bit more to it than just

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.389 
but there's a bit more to it than just
you<00:01:03.629> know<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:03.989> climb<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:05.009> know<00:01:05.129> i<00:01:05.369> think

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
you know can you climb you know i think

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.550 
you know can you climb you know i think
that<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.119> course<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.509> ridden<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.200> bit<00:01:07.380> more

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
that the course is ridden a bit more

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.180 
that the course is ridden a bit more
aggressively<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.790> circuit<00:01:09.210> race<00:01:09.360> because

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
aggressively in a circuit race because

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.620 
aggressively in a circuit race because
you<00:01:11.190> know<00:01:11.310> five<00:01:11.610> laps<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.149> you've<00:01:12.299> gotten<00:01:12.570> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
you know five laps in you've gotten to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.940 
you know five laps in you've gotten to
know<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> course<00:01:13.110> pretty<00:01:13.350> well<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.710> people

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
know the course pretty well and people

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.310 
know the course pretty well and people
know<00:01:14.250> where<00:01:14.729> they<00:01:14.940> can<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.420> out<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.170> wind

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
know where they can be out of the wind

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.020 
know where they can be out of the wind
where<00:01:16.680> they<00:01:16.799> can<00:01:16.979> save<00:01:17.220> energy<00:01:17.399> where<00:01:17.850> they

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
where they can save energy where they

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.810 
where they can save energy where they
can<00:01:18.210> move<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:18.600> easily<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.530> think<00:01:20.039> it's<00:01:20.190> a<00:01:20.310> good

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
can move up easily I think it's a good

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.270 
can move up easily I think it's a good
mix<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.330> bit<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.570> everything<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.710> both
