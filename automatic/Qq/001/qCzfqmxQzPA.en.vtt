just doing a little bit more with these
cube<00:00:13.279> speakers<00:00:13.929> this<00:00:14.929> one<00:00:15.170> here<00:00:15.410> of<00:00:15.529> my<00:00:15.709> little

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
cube speakers this one here of my little

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.019 
cube speakers this one here of my little
enclosure<00:00:16.369> for<00:00:16.759> it

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
enclosure for it

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.819 
enclosure for it
answer<00:00:17.810> got<00:00:17.990> the<00:00:18.079> back<00:00:18.289> of<00:00:18.410> it<00:00:18.529> in<00:00:18.619> there<00:00:18.800> that

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:18.829 
answer got the back of it in there that

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:22.210 
answer got the back of it in there that
I've<00:00:19.099> soldered<00:00:19.369> wires<00:00:19.789> onto<00:00:20.150> it<00:00:20.360> and<00:00:21.220> I've

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
I've soldered wires onto it and I've

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.920 
I've soldered wires onto it and I've
made<00:00:22.430> the<00:00:22.579> Box<00:00:22.759> a<00:00:22.880> little<00:00:23.090> bit<00:00:23.210> bigger<00:00:23.419> so<00:00:23.660> this

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
made the Box a little bit bigger so this

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.440 
made the Box a little bit bigger so this
is<00:00:24.079> the<00:00:24.140> smallest<00:00:24.439> one<00:00:24.650> and<00:00:25.059> it's<00:00:26.059> on<00:00:26.210> at<00:00:26.329> the

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
is the smallest one and it's on at the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:37.540 
is the smallest one and it's on at the
moment<00:00:34.030> holding<00:00:35.030> it<00:00:35.210> down<00:00:36.129> right<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:37.250> back<00:00:37.430> of

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
moment holding it down right the back of

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:48.130 
moment holding it down right the back of
the<00:00:37.640> enclosure<00:00:44.980> no<00:00:45.980> enclosure<00:00:46.930> not<00:00:47.930> going<00:00:48.079> to

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
the enclosure no enclosure not going to

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.040 
the enclosure no enclosure not going to
be<00:00:48.230> very<00:00:48.380> much<00:00:48.590> at<00:00:48.739> all<00:00:49.450> what<00:00:50.450> a<00:00:50.480> work<00:00:50.750> that<00:00:50.989> is

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
be very much at all what a work that is

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.280 
be very much at all what a work that is
that<00:00:51.590> white<00:00:52.130> kind<00:00:52.550> needs<00:00:53.480> to<00:00:53.630> be<00:00:53.720> facing<00:00:53.989> out

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
that white kind needs to be facing out

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.500 
that white kind needs to be facing out
so<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:55.430> other<00:00:55.460> ones<00:00:55.790> I've<00:00:56.000> done<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.300> same

facing outwards the plate facing out and

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.250 
facing outwards the plate facing out and
make<00:02:39.480> sure<00:02:39.660> it's<00:02:39.810> not<00:02:39.870> going<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.109> touch

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
make sure it's not going to touch

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.360 
make sure it's not going to touch
anything<00:02:40.560> when<00:02:40.739> you're<00:02:40.859> mounting<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.220> neck

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370

replies<00:03:01.980> through<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:03.360> high<00:03:03.540> bases<00:03:04.910> from<00:03:05.910> the

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
replies through the high bases from the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.870 
replies through the high bases from the
27<00:03:06.750> in<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.930> larger<00:03:07.260> box<00:03:10.520> so<00:03:11.520> that's<00:03:11.640> quite

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
27 in the larger box so that's quite

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.740 
27 in the larger box so that's quite
good<00:03:11.940> in<00:03:12.270> that<00:03:12.360> box

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
good in that box

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.220 
good in that box
that<00:03:13.020> small<00:03:13.290> box<00:03:13.470> there<00:03:13.770> and<00:03:14.520> I'll<00:03:14.610> put<00:03:14.850> this

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
that small box there and I'll put this

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.770 
that small box there and I'll put this
longer<00:03:16.230> box<00:03:16.560> on<00:03:17.150> because<00:03:18.150> I<00:03:18.180> like<00:03:18.480> this

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
longer box on because I like this

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.930 
longer box on because I like this
because<00:03:19.170> it's<00:03:19.350> all<00:03:20.280> little<00:03:20.580> things<00:03:20.760> not

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
because it's all little things not

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.120 
because it's all little things not
pushing<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:21.510> much<00:03:21.720> air<00:03:21.959> into<00:03:22.140> a<00:03:22.260> smaller<00:03:22.680> spice

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
pushing so much air into a smaller spice

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.699 
pushing so much air into a smaller spice
on<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.290> down<00:03:25.290> strike<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:25.950> other<00:03:26.910> kind<00:03:27.709> and

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
on the down strike of the other kind and

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.340 
on the down strike of the other kind and
I<00:03:28.830> think<00:03:29.100> that<00:03:29.280> this<00:03:29.430> is<00:03:29.550> gonna<00:03:29.780> hide<00:03:30.780> in

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
I think that this is gonna hide in

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.290 
I think that this is gonna hide in
getting<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.310> little<00:03:32.459> bit<00:03:32.640> better<00:03:32.760> standing

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
getting a little bit better standing

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:43.100 
getting a little bit better standing
there<00:03:33.420> like<00:03:33.600> OHS<00:03:40.790> yes<00:03:41.790> I<00:03:41.970> just<00:03:42.000> pushed<00:03:42.900> onto

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
there like OHS yes I just pushed onto

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:54.930 
there like OHS yes I just pushed onto
the<00:03:43.290> edge<00:03:43.350> once<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.680> got<00:03:43.800> this<00:03:43.890> back<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.250> see

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.460 

now<00:03:55.940> if<00:03:56.000> you<00:03:56.120> can<00:03:56.270> make<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:56.480> rule<00:03:56.780> dis<00:03:56.990> nigga<00:03:57.140> box

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
now if you can make a rule dis nigga box

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.920 
now if you can make a rule dis nigga box
for<00:03:57.710> it<00:03:57.830> I<00:03:57.950> reckon<00:03:58.220> that'd<00:03:58.340> be<00:03:58.459> better<00:03:58.930> instead

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
for it I reckon that'd be better instead

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.990 
for it I reckon that'd be better instead
just<00:04:00.260> I<00:04:00.440> get<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.650> white<00:04:00.830> and<00:04:01.190> stop<00:04:01.580> that<00:04:01.730> feel
