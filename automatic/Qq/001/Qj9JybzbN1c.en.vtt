00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.820
 We are with Pablo LavallÃ©n the technician of 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.320
 the 7th bicampeona good pablos 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.000
 congratulations the truth that puts us 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.740
 very happy to talk again another year 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.780
 with you and with a new title on top 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.720
 how are you doing very well thank you very much 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.640
 happy and good made repeat a 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.790
 little last year's speech I think 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.640
 that these guys have made a great 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.189
 season not only this year but from the 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.860
 previous the continuity of the work we 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.509
 has personally favored me 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.989
 it has also favored me a lot 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:37.269
 They knew what I wanted from each one and 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.309
 of the team and they certainly did a great 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.960
 tournament is important for a coach 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.870
 just what was mentioned just the 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.609
 fact of knowing and that they already have 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.960
 know on your game day if 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:52.359
 Logically you earn a lot of time if you 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.329
 I had already had a pre-ninth and 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.609
 the year that they direct it eighth also me 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.879
 logically saving one year to the 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:03.640
 another to follow with the same philosophy the 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.010
 same ways this is very helpful and 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.829
 one only starts me to adjust 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.350
 small details to improve what's done 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:14.680
 It is not easy, what is not easy is that 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.619
 the boys can get over the 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.810
 fact that relaxation does not one when 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.810
 Come out champion or when you reach a goal 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.820
 it's very complicated to be able to repeat and good 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.040
 the boys wanted more and that's why 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.420
 they reached the goal but if 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.159
 we were talking to them and we 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.200
 they said they already know you a lot that 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.820
 is that he knows us a lot and that 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.000
 that's how a good father is like there's 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.530
 as a group of more than 20 children I know the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.130
 true that yes the truth that is a group 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.039
 very lovable 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.170
 and this is my fourth year at the club 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.450
 the four years three years I had them to 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.210
 they and sincerely one is fond 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.470
 much with everyone with those who play with 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.840
 those who play with us who are left 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.190
 outside and the truth that if I feel 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.290
 in a way a soccer father 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.740
 and what fills me the most is the fact that 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.300
 they are good 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.090
 [Music] 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.369
 seized the concepts that I intend 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.220
 of football and they are convinced that 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.470
 good that it was the way or the 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.980
 better this the best provision for 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.320
 to be able to improve and to achieve this the 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.030
 championship and that's what more what 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.000
 more I have as a coach not that 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.190
 they have been convinced of what 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.050
 that I wanted to convey him speaking 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.760
 said is your son was also crowned this 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.100
 year so it was for the extraction by 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.080
 double check if it was the truth a 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.630
 Barbara's joy they deserved it too 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.310
 they did a great job with with juanjo 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.080
 or reilly with alexander montenegro that 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.240
 He also had a large part of the year with 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.850
 them and good is a great category 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.160
 as well 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.570
 and honestly in the way that was given to me 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.090
 gave thus depending on another result 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.000
 that put a little bit of emotion but 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.730
 the truth was a year the redondito the 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.500
 last year it was my turn this year our 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.660
 town so well we want to say by 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.970
 better is finally consulted by the 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.250
 game in this category hopefully that already 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.720
 they knew your idea what was the identity 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.460
 that they maintained throughout this year and 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.020
 also last year that allowed them 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.860
 re-consecrate with the shirt of 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.720
 river with the is the idea is the 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.700
 traditional and the typical river is the 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.270
 that today we see in the first division that 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.250
 I think that also helped us a lot already 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.560
 they were very good at realizing 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.060
 how good that today the first one 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.370
 played similar to what the 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.820
 category and good that that makes the 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.170
 guys dig deeper into the tension 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.030
 knowing that every concept that is 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.960
 pull here in training and the day 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.880
 of matches 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.170
 and then to get closer to being in a first 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.660
 division because the first move of the 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.850
 same way so good is the I think 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.160
 which is the idea the philosophy that has 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.100
 printed marcelo gallardo to the team 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.650
 is the one that I also share and 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.520
 well the guys realized that it is 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.840
 similar and that's why I got more ball 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.550
 Pablo thank you very much we left 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.260
 help with training and good 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.090
 congratulations for this barbarous closure 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.420
 of the year and hopefully for a long time 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.420
 more thanks
