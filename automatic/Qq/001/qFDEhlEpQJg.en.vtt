who's feeling very comfortable as well
so<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.960> quality<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.439> tennis<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.799> think<00:01:11.040> gets

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
so the quality of tennis I think gets

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.289 
so the quality of tennis I think gets
better<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.900> term<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.020> amazing<00:01:13.350> for

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
better and this term it's amazing for

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.120 
better and this term it's amazing for
the<00:01:15.299> first<00:01:15.570> time<00:01:15.720> ever<00:01:16.130> three-dimensional

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
the first time ever three-dimensional

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.530 
the first time ever three-dimensional
technologies<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:18.060> brought<00:01:18.299> their

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
technologies have brought their

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.140 
technologies have brought their
expertise<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.470> tennis<00:01:19.770> court<00:01:20.060> creating<00:01:21.060> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
expertise to the tennis court creating a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.300 
expertise to the tennis court creating a
revolutionary<00:01:21.990> new<00:01:22.140> view<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.189> action

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
revolutionary new view of the action

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.300 
revolutionary new view of the action
what<00:01:24.270> we<00:01:24.479> do<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:24.869> use<00:01:25.080> multiple<00:01:25.650> cameras<00:01:26.070> and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
what we do we use multiple cameras and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.460 
what we do we use multiple cameras and
instead<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.630> teaching<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> images

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
instead of just teaching the images

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.080 
instead of just teaching the images
together<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:29.610> combine<00:01:29.850> all<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.110> descendants

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
together we combine all the descendants

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.749 
together we combine all the descendants
in<00:01:32.420> one<00:01:32.689> three-dimensional<00:01:33.380> space<00:01:33.759> so

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
in one three-dimensional space so

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.270 
in one three-dimensional space so
basically<00:01:35.450> it's<00:01:35.780> like<00:01:35.960> having<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.799> different

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
basically it's like having the different

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.599 
basically it's like having the different
pixels<00:01:37.729> positions<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:38.539> you<00:01:39.530> get<00:01:39.799> a<00:01:40.039> 3d

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:40.609 
pixels positions and you get a 3d

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:43.179 
pixels positions and you get a 3d
scanning<00:01:40.969> of<00:01:41.240> all<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.750> arena<00:01:41.990> now<00:01:42.799> having

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
scanning of all the arena now having

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.399 
scanning of all the arena now having
that<00:01:43.340> 3d<00:01:43.579> scanning<00:01:43.969> you<00:01:44.750> can<00:01:44.929> really<00:01:45.140> move

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
that 3d scanning you can really move

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.319 
that 3d scanning you can really move
around<00:01:45.770> a<00:01:46.100> virtual<00:01:46.579> camera<00:01:46.909> and<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:47.090> have<00:01:47.210> the

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
around a virtual camera and you have the

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.779 
around a virtual camera and you have the
freedom<00:01:47.569> to<00:01:48.079> reshoot<00:01:48.979> from<00:01:49.399> where<00:01:49.579> we<00:01:49.670> run

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
freedom to reshoot from where we run

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:57.410 
freedom to reshoot from where we run
good<00:01:49.969> one

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.120 

it<00:01:58.420> was<00:01:58.689> time<00:01:58.929> to<00:01:58.960> do<00:01:59.200> battle<00:01:59.409> for<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.920> first

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
it was time to do battle for the first
