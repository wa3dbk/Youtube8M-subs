tool my Harbor Freight I found out that
it's<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.029> carbon<00:00:21.689> brushes<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:22.980> had<00:00:23.189> to

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
it's the carbon brushes so I had to

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.540 
it's the carbon brushes so I had to
order<00:00:24.869> some<00:00:25.019> directly<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:26.039> have<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.189> call<00:00:26.400> on

four of them one last you probably a
couple<00:00:39.750> years<00:00:39.899> if<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.610> motor<00:00:41.940> doesn't

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
couple years if this the motor doesn't

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.500 
couple years if this the motor doesn't
die<00:00:42.390> no<00:00:43.340> but<00:00:44.340> anyway<00:00:44.719> so<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> side<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
where the carbon brushes are housed so

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.959 
where the carbon brushes are housed so
get<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> screwdriver<00:00:57.329> flat<00:00:58.850> unscrew<00:00:59.850> these

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.640 

fill<00:01:07.729> out<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:08.000> old<00:01:09.310> carbon<00:01:10.310> brush<00:01:11.530> put<00:01:12.530> in

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
fill out the old carbon brush put in

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.200 
fill out the old carbon brush put in
another<00:01:12.890> one<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.330> got<00:01:14.540> to<00:01:14.630> do

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.560 

sometimes<00:01:20.020> you<00:01:20.170> have<00:01:20.910> certain<00:01:21.910> way<00:01:22.060> that<00:01:22.090> put

sometimes you have certain way that put

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:32.270 
sometimes you have certain way that put
these<00:01:22.720> in<00:01:27.090> there<00:01:28.090> we<00:01:28.210> go<00:01:28.330> put<00:01:28.990> that<00:01:29.020> in<00:01:30.480> get<00:01:31.480> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
these in there we go put that in get the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.830 
these in there we go put that in get the
cap<00:01:33.280> brush<00:01:34.210> cap<00:01:35.370> push<00:01:36.370> it<00:01:36.520> down<00:01:39.660> screw<00:01:40.660> it<00:01:40.720> down

now<00:01:41.650> let<00:01:41.770> me<00:01:41.860> show<00:01:42.010> you<00:01:42.040> what<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.280> did<00:01:42.400> to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
now let me show you what I did to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.940 
now let me show you what I did to
improvise<00:01:44.950> until<00:01:45.400> I<00:01:45.430> got<00:01:45.670> these<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.530> on<00:01:47.770> this

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
improvise until I got these so on this

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.780 
improvise until I got these so on this
one<00:01:48.220> this<00:01:48.460> one's<00:01:48.670> really<00:01:49.000> messed<00:01:49.210> up<00:01:50.640> take<00:01:51.640> all

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
one this one's really messed up take all

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:59.210 
one this one's really messed up take all
this<00:01:51.850> brush<00:01:52.060> cap<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:55.750> gone<00:01:57.240> got<00:01:58.240> some

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
this brush cap so that's gone got some

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.370 
this brush cap so that's gone got some
aluminum<00:02:00.220> stuck<00:02:00.880> in<00:02:01.060> here<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:05.080> carbon

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
aluminum stuck in here and the carbon

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.280 
aluminum stuck in here and the carbon
brush<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.450> this<00:02:07.540> is<00:02:07.630> what<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.869> carbon<00:02:08.140> brush

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
brush so this is what the carbon brush

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:15.570 
brush so this is what the carbon brush
looks<00:02:08.560> after<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:10.980> couple<00:02:11.980> months<00:02:12.850> of<00:02:13.120> use<00:02:14.580> as

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
looks after a couple months of use as

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.890 
looks after a couple months of use as
you<00:02:16.510> can<00:02:16.630> compare<00:02:16.990> it<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.820> new<00:02:18.820> one<00:02:21.480> it's<00:02:22.480> a

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
you can compare it to the new one it's a

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.900 
you can compare it to the new one it's a
lot<00:02:23.110> shorter<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.709> so<00:02:24.250> when<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.550> gets<00:02:24.640> shorter

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
lot shorter and so when it gets shorter

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.840 
lot shorter and so when it gets shorter
it<00:02:25.209> loses<00:02:25.810> connectivity<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.459> doesn't

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
it loses connectivity and it doesn't

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.090 
it loses connectivity and it doesn't
pass<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.390> electrical<00:02:29.320> current<00:02:29.590> as<00:02:29.920> well

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
pass that electrical current as well

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.270 
pass that electrical current as well
plus<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.330> corrosion<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.050> stuff<00:02:32.350> but<00:02:33.070> most

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
plus the corrosion and stuff but most

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.380 
plus the corrosion and stuff but most
mostly<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:35.230> not<00:02:35.500> touching<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.390> motor

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
mostly the the it not touching the motor

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.120 
mostly the the it not touching the motor
so<00:02:38.230> what<00:02:38.380> I<00:02:38.410> did<00:02:38.500> was<00:02:38.769> just<00:02:39.060> cut<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.680> it

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
so what I did was just cut it so it

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.830 
so what I did was just cut it so it
wouldn't<00:02:42.370> be<00:02:42.430> pulled<00:02:42.760> by<00:02:42.940> this<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.420> not<00:02:43.630> touch

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
wouldn't be pulled by this and not touch

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.110 
wouldn't be pulled by this and not touch
it<00:02:44.019> so<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.590> pushed<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.100> in<00:02:45.340> stuck<00:02:45.970> some

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
it so I pushed this in stuck some

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.100 
it so I pushed this in stuck some
aluminum<00:02:46.600> in<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:46.959> then<00:02:47.769> put<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.430> cap<00:02:48.640> back<00:02:48.670> on

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
aluminum in and then put the cap back on

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.110 
aluminum in and then put the cap back on
I<00:02:50.110> don't<00:02:50.530> really<00:02:50.830> recommend<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.700> because<00:02:51.970> it

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
I don't really recommend it because it

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.590 
I don't really recommend it because it
probably<00:02:52.420> voids<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.840> warranty<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.440> now<00:02:53.709> but

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
probably voids the warranty so now but

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.920 
probably voids the warranty so now but
