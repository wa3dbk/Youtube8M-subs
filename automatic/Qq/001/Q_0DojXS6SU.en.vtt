00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello and welcome to a new floor of 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.050
 playing with Kate and today we will learn to 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.510
 play timeline 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.769
 this episode has been sponsored by sky 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.629
 chip distributors 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.699
 the preparation of this game consists of what 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.650
 next first what we will do 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.869
 will shuffle all the cards of the game 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.910
 Each one has two sides 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.400
 obviously on the one hand the 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.400
 image and the event in question and by 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.919
 another side we have the image element and 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.260
 one year the year notice that is highlighted 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.920
 in this case in light blue this for 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.690
 that belongs to the box of inventions but 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.520
 they can also be combined with others 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.030
 games of tables that will have others 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.440
 colors then we lower the deck of 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.510
 letters with care that the years 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.880
 always be down and we deliver 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.100
 four cards to each player that must 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.290
 place in front of them so that the 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.480
 year not to see the players in 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.610
 No time can they make the year 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.410
 that there are behind these letters when 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.270
 players are more experts if they wish 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.059
 You can say play with more than four 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.310
 letters each one then once done 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.450
 that what we will do is reveal the 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.189
 first year of the deck of cards and once 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.480
 done that we will be ready to start 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.490
 the game 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.290
 The objective of this game is to be the 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.210
 first to get rid of all the 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.340
 letters that have in front of him and in addition 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.830
 be the only one that comes out during the 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.410
 same round the truth is that the game is 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.180
 quite simple in his turn a game 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.380
 what you should do is choose one of the 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.330
 letters that he has in front of him and 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.610
 place them on the timeline that is 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.380
 It will form the center of the table this 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.910
 either before the events that are 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.220
 after the events that are 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.740
 in between in case there is more than one 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.800
 event for example more to the advanced the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.030
 we will have the morse code in 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.850
 1838 and the rabies vaccine already in 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.830
 1885 then when a player places 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.570
 a letter can be placed on the left 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.460
 from the line to the right to the line or 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.350
 well in between some events for 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.720
 which we will see the events that already 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.280
 are on the table then we count 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.960
 what is the turn this game and decide 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.500
 use this letter the syringe 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.020
 to the center of the table as I mentioned 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.020
 we have the morse code and we have the 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.440
 vaccine against rabies suppose that the 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.760
 player believes that the syringe was 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:30.450
 invented in a year between less than a thousand 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.000
 838 and in 1885 then they continue to place you 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.480
 your letter here once you place it 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.560
 we reveal the letter and in this case it has 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.920
 been accepted 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.540
 since the manager has been invented in 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.790
 1841 in this case as the player 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.750
 accepted will correspond the alcohol turn 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.030
 which is on your left 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.830
 then the player on the left 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.930
 You can choose any of your cards and 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.200
 let's say you decide to place the computer 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.310
 laptop the laptop 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.510
 clearly subsequent to any of 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.370
 those inventions that we just saw 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.820
 then let's say the player decides 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:08.410
 place it on the right reveals it and 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:10.860
 indeed the year is 1981 whereby 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.530
 the timeline is still correct 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.090
 then he will play on the left 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.400
 then let's see the player of the 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.970
 let's say for example that you decide 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.090
 place this letter is the one for greater and 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:30.100
 let's say you think it was invented among 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:32.190
 1841 and 1885 places his letter and reveals it 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.550
 and ops 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.860
 the lightning rod has been invented in 1752 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.630
 this player is wrong or therefore 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.390
 what you will do is place this letter in 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.210
 the discard steal a new letter and 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.150
 place it in your play area so you 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.910
 it will be more difficult to load the game now 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.060
 let's see a special case and it's when two 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.860
 events have the same year when it 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.650
 happen it is simply necessary to place 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.920
 an event side by side does not matter if 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.840
 is placed on the left or on the right 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.760
 so in this example we have two events 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.580
 attended in the year 1962 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.680
 then the game will continue from the 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.079
 same way until some player 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.880
 I managed to place all his cards in the center 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.609
 of the table is to say to stay without any 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.019
 letter in case it's the only game 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.570
 that during the round has been left without 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.220
 cards that player will win 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.539
 automatically however all the 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.630
 players have the same opportunity 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.400
 therefore if two or more players are 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.919
 they have run out of cards during the same 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.660
 round the rest of the players will be 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.430
 eliminated and the players that have 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.410
 achieved is left without letters will follow 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.139
 competing with the superior letter of 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.030
 mallet like that when some of his players 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.750
 I managed to be the only one left without 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.790
 cards this game will be the winner 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.530
