as well now i did clear some space at

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.010 
as well now i did clear some space at
the<00:01:36.830> bottom<00:01:37.570> okay<00:01:38.570> good<00:01:38.840> it's<00:01:39.619> still<00:01:39.890> there

where<00:01:42.020> X<00:01:43.720> now<00:01:46.930> let's<00:01:47.930> rotate<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.619> i<00:01:48.710> suppose

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
where X now let's rotate it i suppose

00:01:48.770 --> 00:02:00.640 
where X now let's rotate it i suppose
and<00:01:49.070> see<00:01:49.600> which<00:01:50.600> angles<00:01:51.110> better<00:01:55.150> hmm<00:01:59.229> yeah<00:02:00.229> you

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
and see which angles better hmm yeah you

and see which angles better hmm yeah you
know<00:02:00.740> what<00:02:00.920> I<00:02:01.130> think<00:02:01.759> like<00:02:02.030> this<00:02:02.150> angle<00:02:02.450> the

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
know what I think like this angle the

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:11.050 
know what I think like this angle the
best<00:02:02.689> so<00:02:03.280> here<00:02:04.280> we<00:02:04.310> go<00:02:07.269> yes<00:02:08.269> for<00:02:09.549> 225<00:02:10.549> donates
