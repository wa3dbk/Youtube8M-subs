00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.820
 the belgian boulder is a natural stone 

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:07.400
 from beijing 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.280
 In the old days you just have arkin out of it 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.650
 broken out of the stone 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.030
 broken and 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.070
 in germany i had easy 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.199
 the name is naturalized 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.330
 Cement rock with up to 43 percent 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.630
 garnet from it can be wonderful 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.530
 on the hardest steal to rockwell 67 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.300
 to edit 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:29.920
 Stone was already mentioned by the Romans 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.960
 - this written down before Christ 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.660
 This knowledge of this experience is 17 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.630
 in Belgium at those years 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.420
 This traditional dismantling arose 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.270
 has these stones as chef stones already 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.920
 at that time worldwide 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.450
 Martin we need water so without 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.150
 water does the system not in 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.820
 this next special feature is here with 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.410
 The Belgian boulders are closed 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.480
 they do not absorb the water 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.820
 that is also meaningful that is 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.180
 we distribute that and we can now 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.690
 already start with sharpness 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.690
 huge advantage 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.659
 so graced 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.500
 in the winter of the knife 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.810
 on the stone for transferred to the 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.070
 to smooth last area to lose 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.810
 90 we again is again sex also 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.810
 this time with slight pressure of back 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.630
 that you look beautiful 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.610
 the gray is already pregnant now 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.320
 if you want to place them 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.229
 There is no resistance 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.729
 the tilting so far was a point where 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.009
 you get the feeling you could purely 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.180
 cut what he does not and the 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.159
 stop 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.409
 because also circles 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.460
 push them journalists stone is the 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.760
 you do not write in it 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.340
 made a game tailor hidden 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.670
 can buckle the paste that results 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.140
 you have nothing injured city 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.380
 some high quality knives the one 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.660
 do not scratch 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.560
 nothing happens 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.560
 be smart of both 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.400
 it is 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.400
 if he was necessarily against 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.659
 The paste today is the cutting edge 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.210
 tried 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.210
 there a 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.140
 back 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.880
 But it offers even more 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.680
 there is one more thing to do with the form 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.319
 the channel enlarges so look 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.480
 this conclusion no cards that what me 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:02.060
 to cut even with the same we 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.060
 anticipated the long life 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.900
 put in the shade 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.390
 punch sharpness too 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.310
 was rated 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.310
 with the 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.780
 for the friends of the country system off and on 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.800
 sets for this system 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.950
 a 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.730
 a tool that means one 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.319
 was alu frame 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.440
 a wish of the blue belgian 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.530
 cooking gave up advantage for the lance 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.569
 is going to be 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.170
 just the application of qs as last 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.170
