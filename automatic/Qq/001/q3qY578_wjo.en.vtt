00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
highest first so that's quite obvious if

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.419 
highest first so that's quite obvious if
the<00:00:26.359> jump<00:00:26.539> in<00:00:26.720> stats<00:00:26.960> are<00:00:27.169> equal<00:00:27.560> for<00:00:27.890> two

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
the jump in stats are equal for two

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.249 
the jump in stats are equal for two
players<00:00:28.699> or<00:00:28.999> next<00:00:29.300> go<00:00:29.449> by<00:00:29.630> their<00:00:29.869> overall

rating obviously if you want to find the

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.869 
rating obviously if you want to find the
best<00:00:32.840> ball<00:00:33.170> winners<00:00:33.469> in<00:00:33.649> the<00:00:33.800> air<00:00:33.920> you'd<00:00:34.699> need

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
best ball winners in the air you'd need

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.549 
best ball winners in the air you'd need
to<00:00:34.969> take<00:00:35.180> into<00:00:35.359> consideration<00:00:35.449> their<00:00:36.289> height

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
to take into consideration their height

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.619 
to take into consideration their height
as<00:00:37.039> well<00:00:37.100> as<00:00:37.399> their<00:00:37.550> jumping<00:00:37.969> but<00:00:38.179> that's<00:00:38.390> not

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
about just they're jumping stats also

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.500 
about just they're jumping stats also
bear<00:00:43.010> in<00:00:43.039> mind<00:00:43.129> their<00:00:43.670> stats<00:00:43.940> I'll<00:00:44.210> read<00:00:44.480> out

to<00:00:44.809> you<00:00:44.839> are<00:00:45.199> their<00:00:45.589> base<00:00:45.859> does<00:00:46.190> not<00:00:46.730> vary<00:00:46.940> in

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
to you are their base does not vary in

to you are their base does not vary in
game<00:00:47.300> stats<00:00:47.539> so<00:00:47.929> it<00:00:48.260> does<00:00:48.410> get<00:00:48.559> a<00:00:48.589> little<00:00:48.649> bit

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
game stats so it does get a little bit

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.889 
game stats so it does get a little bit
confusing<00:00:49.190> but<00:00:49.429> if<00:00:49.550> someone<00:00:49.850> has<00:00:50.000> 94<00:00:50.480> jumping
