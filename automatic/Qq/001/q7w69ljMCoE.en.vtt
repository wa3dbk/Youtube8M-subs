because it really does work now I this
was<00:00:38.190> initially<00:00:38.520> like<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.870> idea<00:00:40.140> was

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
was initially like the idea was

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.260 
was initially like the idea was
initially<00:00:40.530> from<00:00:40.739> syndicate<00:00:41.219> project<00:00:41.270> however

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
initially from syndicate project however

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.299 
initially from syndicate project however
he<00:00:42.629> goes<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.020> lower<00:00:43.290> floors<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:43.860> I've<00:00:44.040> done

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
he goes to the lower floors so I've done

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.729 
he goes to the lower floors so I've done
my<00:00:44.489> own<00:00:44.670> little<00:00:45.000> twist<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.450> also<00:00:46.260> he<00:00:46.530> just

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
my own little twist on it also he just

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.529 
my own little twist on it also he just
runs<00:00:46.950> around<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.309> circles<00:00:47.730> where<00:00:47.910> as<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.059> do<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
runs around in circles where as I do the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.229 
runs around in circles where as I do the
figure<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.809> eight<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:50.160> first<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.820> all<00:00:50.879> I'll<00:00:51.120> be

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
figure of eight so first of all I'll be

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.670 
figure of eight so first of all I'll be
telling<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.750> what<00:00:51.989> weapons<00:00:52.320> i<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.620> i

telling you what weapons i have so i
have<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> silica<00:00:53.309> fire<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.789> if<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.360> haven't

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
have the silica fire and if you haven't

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.000 
have the silica fire and if you haven't
seen<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> tutor<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.199> how<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> build<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.800> then

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
seen the tutor on how to build that then

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.010 
seen the tutor on how to build that then
check<00:00:56.399> my<00:00:56.550> channel<00:00:56.789> out<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.270> should<00:00:57.449> be<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.600> a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
check my channel out it should be on a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.290 
check my channel out it should be on a
previous<00:00:58.770> video<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.070> did<00:00:59.280> about<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.730> couple<00:01:00.239> of

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
previous video I did about a couple of

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.479 
previous video I did about a couple of
weeks<00:01:00.420> ago<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.289> basically<00:01:01.739> i<00:01:01.829> run<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> figure<00:01:02.460> of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
weeks ago so basically i run a figure of

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.759 
weeks ago so basically i run a figure of
a<00:01:02.730> round<00:01:03.000> here<00:01:03.210> i<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> am<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.229> for<00:01:04.530> as<00:01:04.619> well

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
a round here i have the am I for as well

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.100 
a round here i have the am I for as well
upgraded<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.970> reason<00:01:06.299> why<00:01:06.420> see<00:01:06.570> liquify

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
upgraded and the reason why see liquify

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.710 
upgraded and the reason why see liquify
on<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> little<00:01:07.590> bit<00:01:08.189> wet<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.790> risen<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
on the little bit wet like risen so the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.020 
on the little bit wet like risen so the
raised<00:01:10.200> bit<00:01:10.500> there<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.010> because<00:01:11.430> when<00:01:11.760> i<00:01:11.790> run

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
raised bit there is because when i run

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.880 
raised bit there is because when i run
my<00:01:12.060> figure<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.510> eight<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.780> don't<00:01:13.080> go<00:01:13.409> over<00:01:13.770> that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
my figure of eight I don't go over that

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.609 
my figure of eight I don't go over that
bit<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.520> would<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.700> made<00:01:14.880> me<00:01:15.119> slip<00:01:15.619> so

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
bit so it would have made me slip so

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.020 
bit so it would have made me slip so
that's<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:16.950> good<00:01:17.280> technique<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.759> found

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
that's a really good technique I found

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.300 
that's a really good technique I found
out<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.390> took<00:01:18.600> me<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:19.470> I've<00:01:19.650> played<00:01:19.920> loads<00:01:20.159> of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
out it took me like I've played loads of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.520 
out it took me like I've played loads of
games<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.939> hit<00:01:21.240> around<00:01:21.540> 36<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.320> was<00:01:22.409> like

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
games and I hit around 36 and I was like

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.530 
games and I hit around 36 and I was like
no<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.979> hit<00:01:23.100> higher<00:01:23.340> then<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.030> finally<00:01:24.390> hit

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
no I can hit higher then I finally hit

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.140 
no I can hit higher then I finally hit
50<00:01:24.900> i<00:01:24.930> did<00:01:25.200> go<00:01:25.320> around<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.680> did<00:01:26.640> go<00:01:26.759> down<00:01:26.790> around

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
50 i did go around it did go down around

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.240 
50 i did go around it did go down around
50<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.930> you'll<00:01:28.320> see<00:01:28.500> why<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.920> separate

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
50 and you'll see why in a separate

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.100 
50 and you'll see why in a separate
video<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.759> should<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.060> annotated<00:01:30.600> at<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
video that should be annotated at the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.440 
video that should be annotated at the
end<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:31.650> video<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:32.280> i'm<00:01:33.150> doing<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
end of this video as i'm doing the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.969 
end of this video as i'm doing the
comforter<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.840> same<00:01:34.020> day<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.710> as<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.890> can

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
comforter on the same day so as you can

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the end 94 have upgraded has like 600

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.109 
the end 94 have upgraded has like 600
bullets<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:43.320> get<00:01:43.530> those<00:01:43.759> cooler<00:01:44.759> things

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
bullets and you get those cooler things

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.469 
bullets and you get those cooler things
every<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.110> six<00:01:46.439> rounds<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.030> are

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
every like six rounds so if you are

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.030 
every like six rounds so if you are
sufficient<00:01:48.990> on<00:01:49.049> ammo<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.560> use<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.890> properly

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
sufficient on ammo and use it properly

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.830 
sufficient on ammo and use it properly
you<00:01:50.460> wouldn't<00:01:50.759> need<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.420> wouldn't<00:01:51.570> run<00:01:51.750> out

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
you wouldn't need you wouldn't run out

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.600 
you wouldn't need you wouldn't run out
of<00:01:51.899> ammo<00:01:52.200> especially<00:01:52.950> with<00:01:53.009> its<00:01:53.159> liquid<00:01:53.460> fire

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
of ammo especially with its liquid fire

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.510 
of ammo especially with its liquid fire
as<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:53.909> causes<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.750> chain<00:01:55.020> reaction<00:01:55.219> so<00:01:56.219> say<00:01:56.430> if

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
as it causes a chain reaction so say if

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.730 
as it causes a chain reaction so say if
I<00:01:56.640> shoot<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.479> keep<00:01:57.659> running<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:58.049> train<00:01:58.380> then

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
I shoot and I keep running a train then

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.819 
I shoot and I keep running a train then
that<00:01:59.009> would<00:01:59.189> cause<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> other<00:01:59.820> zombie<00:02:00.299> to

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
that would cause the other zombie to

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.560 
that would cause the other zombie to
cause<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.189> catch<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.579> chain<00:02:02.790> reaction<00:02:03.390> and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
cause that catch the chain reaction and

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.220 
cause that catch the chain reaction and
then

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
then

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.530 
then
you<00:02:04.650> know<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.830> make<00:02:05.490> them<00:02:05.700> turn<00:02:05.850> into<00:02:06.090> liquid

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
you know to make them turn into liquid

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.750 
you know to make them turn into liquid
so<00:02:07.110> also<00:02:07.530> when<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:07.860> spread<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.250> floor<00:02:08.520> they

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
so also when I spread the floor they

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.090 
so also when I spread the floor they
tend<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.180> slip<00:02:09.540> here<00:02:09.870> which<00:02:10.440> can<00:02:10.770> basically

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
tend to slip here which can basically

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.610 
tend to slip here which can basically
help<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.880> gain<00:02:12.240> your<00:02:12.270> health<00:02:13.110> backs<00:02:13.410> if

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
help you gain your health backs if

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.550 
help you gain your health backs if
you've<00:02:13.770> been<00:02:13.890> hit<00:02:15.290> unfortunately<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.350> didn't

probably be the best thing to do because
by<00:02:44.430> then<00:02:44.670> by<00:02:45.270> round<00:02:45.480> six<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:46.050> would<00:02:46.200> get<00:02:46.380> the

by quick revive at the starting point
because<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.070> think<00:03:14.280> that's<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.580> only<00:03:14.700> one<00:03:14.970> that

because I think that's the only one that

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.780 
because I think that's the only one that
stays<00:03:15.540> in<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.810> same<00:03:15.959> place<00:03:16.430> so<00:03:17.430> make<00:03:17.550> sure<00:03:17.580> you

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
probably the third most important

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.070 
probably the third most important
because<00:03:25.950> i<00:03:26.220> need<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.610> be<00:03:26.700> Cola<00:03:27.120> much<00:03:27.720> more<00:03:27.900> than

by i'll probably be aiming for around
100<00:04:00.090> if<00:04:00.270> it<00:04:00.690> takes<00:04:00.870> too<00:04:01.020> long<00:04:01.050> like<00:04:01.320> 14<00:04:01.739> hours
