00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.879
 hello how about friends giving x as you can see 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:19.329
 I'm here with the 360 â€‹â€‹motor guard 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:22.689
 bleu de motorola has updated the 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:24.969
 latest version of android 5.02 good 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.250
 let's go into the settings 

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:29.200
 I am going to teach how it is perfectly 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.480
 I actually got upgraded to 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.489
 receive another day and we go to about 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.960
 let's see who has the last 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.820
 version of android 5.05 let's two a 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.010
 of things 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.960
 that I've realized I do not know if I already 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.450
 it would be implemented in versions 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.050
 previous android web but the case 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.730
 is that now having a motorcycle of 2015 I 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.390
 I have realized that one of the great 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.480
 things about having the terminal set 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.470
 motorola plus smart watch or 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.309
 motorola variable 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.480
 a new added support and it's 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.230
 what 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:12.110
 if we go to the terminal if we access 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.800
 the camera automatically when accessing 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.540
 the camera will show us in 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.670
 variable if we do upwards because 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.960
 I have notifications turned off 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.960
 if we do up 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.869
 and leave bad here we have it then it's going 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.880
 to appear the notification to do 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.850
 a photo and we will do to be able to do 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.020
 a photo directly from the clock 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.020
 simply with touching 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.960
 let's go up again 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.840
 simply with touching we appear this 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.540
 icon where as you can see here in the 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.720
 phone when squeezed out an account 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.720
 behind 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.770
 where are we going to take a picture and 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.450
 automatically when the photo is 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.180
 done will show us in the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.490
 smart watch motorcycle 360 â€‹â€‹as you can see 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:09.090
 here we move and we already have it 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.090
 available to take another picture 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.469
 as it is a remote way of making a 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.120
 photo from our watch we are going to take 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:20.120
 another here you see how when the 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.930
 picture is loading perfectly and we go 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.739
 to have the option to perform again 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.739
 another photo 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.030
 good if you did not know already you know another 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.910
 of the compatibilities of the clock 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.700
 smart motorola the 360 motorcycle is 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.460
 that in conjunction with a terminal the 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.280
 moto range or motorbike gp moto xo moto 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.850
 and to activate the camera we will 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.150
 activate the application in the smart work 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.940
 from which we will be able to make a 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.830
 Fast photo capture without the need of 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.750
 touch the phone even leaving the 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.100
 phone to the surface to make a 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.100
 remote capture 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.090
