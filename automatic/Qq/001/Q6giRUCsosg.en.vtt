you<00:00:57.239> kidding<00:00:57.719> me<00:00:57.870> ask<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.649> interviewer<00:00:58.890> there

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
you kidding me ask the interviewer there

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.540 
you kidding me ask the interviewer there
are<00:00:59.699> some<00:01:00.270> scary<00:01:00.629> outcomes<00:01:01.199> said<00:01:01.800> musk<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.280> we

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
are some scary outcomes said musk and we

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.529 
are some scary outcomes said musk and we
should<00:01:02.699> try<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.879> make<00:01:03.059> sure<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.420> the

should try to make sure that the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.719 
should try to make sure that the
outcomes<00:01:03.870> are<00:01:03.989> good<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:04.710> bad

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
outcomes are good not bad

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.149

Hawking warned about the rise of
artificial<00:01:10.380> intelligence<00:01:10.710> saying<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.460> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
artificial intelligence saying that it

could be the worst thing to happen to

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.950 
could be the worst thing to happen to
humanity<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.270> robots<00:01:15.720> may

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960

actually destroy human beings

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.210 
actually destroy human beings
that's<00:01:19.080> right<00:01:19.259> artificial<00:01:19.799> intelligence

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
that's right artificial intelligence

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.120 
that's right artificial intelligence
because<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> end<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.210> mankind<00:01:21.960> says<00:01:22.799> one
