00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.349
 Here I am in the price range in my opinion 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.389
 the cheapest of all the hanse he stands on 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.199
 today's moment is 195 hryvnia 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.449

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.670
 on the same well, legs need where I 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.260
 In general, there are many for those purposes 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.539
 tin can hide a piece of bread 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.850

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.130

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.780

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.540

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.600
 nafig need it so decided it so 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.940
 get familiar with folding knives 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.760
 ganzo firms here start the cheapest 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.020
 we'll see there 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.020

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.360
 all in a plastic bag ki legs i 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.220
 I just want to share my 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.100
 impressions from this knife 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.030
 With this knife I already had time there 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.850
 steel wire cut a couple of times 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.670
 a pocket of strings of bread there 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.820
 cut off sharpening blades 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.740
 ok i liked it i generally 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.960
 Ganza decided to buy this knife after 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.100
 In addition, I have a multitul in my ganzo 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.680
 g202 beat 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.149
 I multitul this one I use here at 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.119
 I was not once rescued when at hand 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.350
 there is no knife tool of some kind 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.909
 instrument that is me multitool 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.520
 liked so decided to buy already 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:53.209
 folding knife inexpensive and there and so 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.520
 she told me that he liked it here 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:56.899
 I am comfortable I like one thing 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.350
 small I like how in him he 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:07.549
 he sits in my hand he sits comfortably not 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:11.510
 slips have these wave these so in 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.489
 hands did not slip this is my first 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.970
 such an impression on him like that leg 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.970
 looks like 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.430
 there is a clip 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.090
 on it opens 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.190
 hand hole can some lanyard 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.140
 a ring that here so hang 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.570
 tie it to your arm there I am still for something 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.490
 Mouthpiece so that it is not lost when selling 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.730
 I pulled up after I bought 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.620
 slightly central bolt 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.330
 as such, there was no backlash but it just 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.450
 very easy to liza and popping out of me 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:01.660
 find the goat a little tighter backlash is no such 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.660
 of fire 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.230
 strong and even when i was you that 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.630
 central pulled up then this stopper is not 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.880
 always there once reached the middle 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:22.100
 stop is not always 100 steamed blade but 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:26.290
 it developed now opens 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:29.720
 ok , what 's interesting to me here 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:34.790
 dads bm to the sides of the blade near the grip 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.320
 there are plastic rings such here 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:43.660
 I don't know how long they will be 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:43.660
 work long enough 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.830
 and so we will use but by now 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.110
 then we'll see later maybe made 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.930
 one more review after already 3 a 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.310
 shaved under his use here still 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.310
 Once the knife looks like 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.850
 that's basically all I wanted to say 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.850
