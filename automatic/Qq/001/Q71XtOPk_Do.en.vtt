00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
one general way of listening you can't

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.020 
one general way of listening you can't
teach<00:01:03.569> a<00:01:03.719> person<00:01:04.129> listening<00:01:05.129> 101<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.850> is

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
teach a person listening 101 this is

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.460 
teach a person listening 101 this is
what<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.960> doesn't<00:01:07.290> work<00:01:07.409> that

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
what you do it just doesn't work that

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.719 
what you do it just doesn't work that
way<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.580> very<00:01:08.880> individual<00:01:09.479> thing<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.729> so

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
way it's a very individual thing and so

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.280 
way it's a very individual thing and so
it<00:01:11.820> became<00:01:12.060> very<00:01:12.300> apparent<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.930> me<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.050> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
it became very apparent to me that the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.469 
it became very apparent to me that the
person<00:01:13.500> who<00:01:14.159> could<00:01:14.340> best<00:01:14.610> teach<00:01:14.880> someone<00:01:15.360> how

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
person who could best teach someone how

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.660 
person who could best teach someone how

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
this story and from there we've

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.929 
this story and from there we've
developed<00:01:21.180> some<00:01:21.930> strategies<00:01:22.649> to<00:01:22.680> help<00:01:22.979> now

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
developed some strategies to help now

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.209 
developed some strategies to help now
the<00:01:24.000> first<00:01:24.390> thing<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.899> I'm<00:01:25.110> being<00:01:25.560> listened<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
the first thing is I'm being listened to

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.609 
the first thing is I'm being listened to
you're<00:01:26.700> my<00:01:26.850> listener<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:28.049> hold<00:01:28.380> up<00:01:28.530> a

you're my listener you hold up a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.100 
you're my listener you hold up a
reflection<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.280> me<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.880> take<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.719> reflection

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
reflection to me I take that reflection

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.230 
reflection to me I take that reflection
in<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.560> resonate<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.369> see<00:01:32.640> does<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.850> fit

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
in and I resonate it I see does it fit

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.910 
in and I resonate it I see does it fit
is<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.450> right<00:01:33.960> where<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.170> am<00:01:34.350> does<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.710> capture

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
is it right where I am does it capture

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.929 
is it right where I am does it capture
it<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:36.409> it<00:01:37.409> might<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.860> dead-on<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.579> which<00:01:38.700> case

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
it and it might be dead-on in which case

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.420 
it and it might be dead-on in which case
I<00:01:39.090> go<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.420> with<00:01:39.630> my<00:01:39.659> story<00:01:40.020> more<00:01:40.380> unfold<00:01:40.829> it

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
I go on with my story more unfold it

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.849 
I go on with my story more unfold it
might<00:01:41.610> be<00:01:41.789> a<00:01:41.820> little<00:01:42.119> bit<00:01:42.240> off<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:43.229> might<00:01:43.530> be

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
might be a little bit off it might be

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:47.420 
might be a little bit off it might be
that<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.719> I<00:01:45.719> did<00:01:46.289> say<00:01:46.500> all<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.039> isn't

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
that I I did say all that but that isn't

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.039 
that I I did say all that but that isn't
really<00:01:47.700> doesn't<00:01:48.030> resonate<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.600> not<00:01:48.810> right

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
really doesn't resonate it's not right

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.510 
really doesn't resonate it's not right
where<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.259> am<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.770> then<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.039> come<00:01:50.189> out<00:01:50.250> with

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
where I am so then I come out with

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.149 
where I am so then I come out with
something<00:01:50.759> else<00:01:51.060> or<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:52.170> might<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
something else or it might be that the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.910 
something else or it might be that the
person<00:01:53.570> maybe<00:01:54.570> got<00:01:54.869> back<00:01:55.109> my<00:01:55.289> words<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:55.890> I

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
person maybe got back my words but I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
said but I don't it doesn't feel like

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.960 
said but I don't it doesn't feel like
you've<00:02:06.990> got<00:02:07.350> how<00:02:07.770> heavy<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.460> how<00:02:08.700> hard

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
you've got how heavy that is how hard

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.420 
you've got how heavy that is how hard
that<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.210> for<00:02:09.360> me<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.780> carry<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.950> just<00:02:11.190> want

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
that is for me to carry and I just want

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.760 
that is for me to carry and I just want
you<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.700> know<00:02:11.880> that's<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.720> really<00:02:13.260> hard<00:02:13.500> place

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
you to know that's a really hard place

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.520 
you to know that's a really hard place
I'm<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:14.460> so<00:02:15.180> here<00:02:15.390> I've<00:02:15.540> given<00:02:15.690> my<00:02:15.990> list<00:02:16.410> or

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
I'm in so here I've given my list or

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.790 
I'm in so here I've given my list or
some<00:02:16.740> feedback<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:19.200> listener<00:02:19.500> will<00:02:19.590> take

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
some feedback the listener will take

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.509 
some feedback the listener will take
that<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.400> respond<00:02:20.970> accordingly

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
that in and respond accordingly

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.230 
that in and respond accordingly
maybe<00:02:23.519> I<00:02:23.670> simply<00:02:24.120> need<00:02:24.300> more<00:02:24.510> time

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
maybe I simply need more time

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.820 
maybe I simply need more time
need<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.420> response<00:02:25.900> just<00:02:26.230> then<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.530> I'll<00:02:26.620> just

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830

it's<00:02:34.000> this<00:02:34.210> continual<00:02:34.420> feedback<00:02:35.080> loop<00:02:35.680> I'm

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
it's this continual feedback loop I'm

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.760 
it's this continual feedback loop I'm
teaching<00:02:36.610> by<00:02:36.760> resonating<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.840> reflection<00:02:38.590> I

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
teaching by resonating the reflection I

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.610 
teaching by resonating the reflection I
put<00:02:39.490> that<00:02:39.670> back<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.270> listener<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:40.990> give<00:02:41.500> the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
put that back to the listener I give the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.590 
put that back to the listener I give the
listener<00:02:42.040> feedback<00:02:42.580> I'm<00:02:42.940> teaching<00:02:43.450> that

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
listener feedback I'm teaching that

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.390 
listener feedback I'm teaching that
listener<00:02:44.020> how<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.230> listen<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.680> Pathak<00:02:45.190> alee

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
listener how to listen and Pathak alee

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.540 
listener how to listen and Pathak alee
and<00:02:45.750> compassionately<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:47.350> me<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:48.220> exact

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
and compassionately to me and the exact

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.380 
and compassionately to me and the exact
way<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.760> will<00:02:49.420> feel<00:02:49.720> listen<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:51.760> seems<00:02:52.120> so

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
way I will feel listen to it seems so

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.120 
way I will feel listen to it seems so
simple<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:53.110> really<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.560> more<00:02:53.710> I<00:02:53.740> think<00:02:53.860> about

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
simple and really the more I think about

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.610 
simple and really the more I think about
it<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.460> easier<00:02:54.850> is<00:02:55.000> more<00:02:55.240> simple<00:02:55.540> it<00:02:55.780> is<00:02:55.930> it's

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
it the easier is more simple it is it's

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.050 
it the easier is more simple it is it's
just<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:57.010> we<00:02:57.130> didn't<00:02:57.340> have<00:02:57.460> an<00:02:57.610> edge<00:02:57.760> on<00:02:58.030> that

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
just that we didn't have an edge on that

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.680 
just that we didn't have an edge on that
we<00:02:58.510> didn't<00:02:58.810> quite<00:02:59.050> understand<00:02:59.770> that<00:03:00.690> key

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
we didn't quite understand that key

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.840 
we didn't quite understand that key
piece<00:03:01.960> about<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.560> storyteller<00:03:03.100> being<00:03:03.760> the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
piece about the storyteller being the

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.280 
piece about the storyteller being the
best<00:03:04.060> teacher<00:03:04.650> we<00:03:05.650> would<00:03:06.130> like<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:07.020> go<00:03:08.020> into

at<00:04:12.070> the<00:04:12.190> Institute<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:12.850> had<00:04:12.970> an<00:04:13.120> observer

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
at the Institute and I had an observer

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.540 
at the Institute and I had an observer
and<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:14.710> know<00:04:14.800> they<00:04:14.920> were<00:04:14.980> writing<00:04:15.400> down

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.760 
and you know they were writing down
things<00:04:16.180> as<00:04:16.450> I<00:04:16.570> was<00:04:16.750> listening<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.230> I<00:04:17.290> and<00:04:17.680> I

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
things as I was listening and I and I

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.260 
things as I was listening and I and I
knew<00:04:17.920> it<00:04:18.070> wasn't<00:04:18.400> all<00:04:18.460> Janet<00:04:18.880> just<00:04:19.000> made<00:04:19.239> a

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
knew it wasn't all Janet just made a

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.230 
knew it wasn't all Janet just made a
brilliant<00:04:20.190> reflection<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.430> think<00:04:21.700> there<00:04:22.120> was

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
brilliant reflection I think there was

some problem there and you know it does

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.230 
some problem there and you know it does

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
other there's a

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.029 
other there's a
we're<00:04:38.330> working<00:04:38.659> together<00:04:38.840> here<00:04:39.289> to<00:04:39.439> to<00:04:39.860> get

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
we're working together here to to get

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:41.499 
we're working together here to to get
this<00:04:40.159> thing<00:04:40.340> really<00:04:40.550> understood<00:04:41.150> so<00:04:41.300> that<00:04:41.330> you

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
this thing really understood so that you

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.140 
this thing really understood so that you
really<00:04:41.719> feel<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:42.349> passively<00:04:42.770> heard<00:04:43.129> no<00:04:43.939> that

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
really feel and passively heard no that

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.839 
really feel and passively heard no that
was<00:04:44.300> I<00:04:44.330> think<00:04:44.770> personally<00:04:45.770> a<00:04:45.800> big<00:04:46.009> step

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
was I think personally a big step

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:48.909 
was I think personally a big step
forward<00:04:47.330> I<00:04:47.449> think<00:04:47.870> another<00:04:48.080> part<00:04:48.409> of<00:04:48.469> it<00:04:48.590> is<00:04:48.710> we

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
forward I think another part of it is we

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.749 
forward I think another part of it is we
want<00:04:49.129> all<00:04:49.310> our<00:04:49.370> teaching<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.180> be<00:04:50.300> experiential

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
want all our teaching to be experiential

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.550 
want all our teaching to be experiential
so<00:04:52.759> what<00:04:52.999> is<00:04:53.150> more<00:04:53.419> experiential<00:04:54.139> than

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
so what is more experiential than

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.679 
so what is more experiential than
getting<00:04:54.860> direct<00:04:55.249> feedback<00:04:55.340> from<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.240> speaker

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:56.689 
getting direct feedback from the speaker

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:59.649 
getting direct feedback from the speaker
so<00:04:57.620> that<00:04:57.650> right<00:04:58.490> then<00:04:58.969> and<00:04:59.180> there<00:04:59.389> in<00:04:59.539> the

00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
so that right then and there in the

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:03.070 
so that right then and there in the
moment<00:04:59.870> I<00:05:00.639> as<00:05:01.639> the<00:05:01.879> listener<00:05:02.270> can<00:05:02.389> say<00:05:02.569> also<00:05:02.779> it

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
moment I as the listener can say also it

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.249 
moment I as the listener can say also it
wasn't<00:05:03.319> like<00:05:03.620> that<00:05:03.800> it's<00:05:04.129> more<00:05:04.370> like<00:05:04.430> this

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:05.259 
wasn't like that it's more like this

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:08.769 
wasn't like that it's more like this
what<00:05:06.259> value<00:05:06.889> is<00:05:07.370> there<00:05:07.699> to<00:05:07.879> my<00:05:08.029> taking<00:05:08.509> notes

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:08.779 
what value is there to my taking notes

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:10.950 
what value is there to my taking notes
and<00:05:09.050> telling<00:05:09.439> the<00:05:09.560> person<00:05:09.740> after<00:05:10.279> it's<00:05:10.400> over

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
and telling the person after it's over

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.200 
and telling the person after it's over
you<00:05:11.960> know<00:05:12.080> it<00:05:12.229> doesn't<00:05:12.710> help<00:05:12.889> them<00:05:13.159> to<00:05:13.370> so<00:05:14.029> it's

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
you know it doesn't help them to so it's

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.050 
you know it doesn't help them to so it's
it's<00:05:14.389> a<00:05:14.539> very<00:05:14.740> experiential<00:05:15.740> way<00:05:16.219> of<00:05:16.490> teaching

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
it's a very experiential way of teaching

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.379 
it's a very experiential way of teaching
the<00:05:17.810> listening<00:05:18.199> yeah<00:05:19.009> yeah<00:05:19.580> that<00:05:20.120> is<00:05:20.270> an

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
the listening yeah yeah that is an

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.499 
the listening yeah yeah that is an
important<00:05:20.870> point<00:05:21.050> because<00:05:21.250> if<00:05:22.250> my<00:05:23.240> feedback

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:23.509 
important point because if my feedback

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:25.719 
important point because if my feedback
comes<00:05:23.930> afterwards<00:05:24.500> it<00:05:24.650> can't<00:05:24.949> anymore<00:05:25.580> right

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
comes afterwards it can't anymore right

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.059 
comes afterwards it can't anymore right
effect<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.389> interaction<00:05:27.110> like<00:05:27.529> you<00:05:27.800> know<00:05:27.860> the

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:28.069 
effect the interaction like you know the

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:37.710 
effect the interaction like you know the
quality<00:05:28.460> of<00:05:28.580> the<00:05:28.909> moment<00:05:29.719> right<00:05:30.020> yes
