00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:07.310
 good night the guy and without the arm of 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.220
 mana is to dignify a little the 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.520
 egg egg consumption in colombia 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:16.580
 every time it is more public it is smaller 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.509
 because most of our 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.789
 colleagues from the health service usually 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:26.089
 they suspend it from the diets thinking that 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.820
 with this cholesterol can improve a 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:31.310
 little in their levels especially the 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.780
 bad cholesterol or the low fraction 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.780
 density that is the protein 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.050
 this is a widespread loss and very 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.870
 common and it really is a practice that 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.090
 has abolished respect that the egg is a 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.769
 very complete food apart from being very 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.930
 complete is one of the most 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.450
 cheap we have 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.670
 this family of Colombians the 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.940
 advantage of the egg versus other proteins 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.460
 is that the game can be isolated 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.370
 lipid fraction ie the fraction 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.920
 of fat simply with removing the yolk 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.989
 and when consuming the clear one we will be 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.210
 consume only the protein fraction 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.490
 that immersed with other substances like 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.240
 the vitamins that are in this case the 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.310
 water-soluble and that are obviously 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.050
 mixed in that liquid and obviously 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.590
 other compounds that come immersed 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.000
 inside this liquid full of protein 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.700
 mostly chain amino acids 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.020
 branching is very common to find in 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.420
 patients with renal failure 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.119
 chronic in terminal stages over 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.830
 all in stadiums and farms that are 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.410
 it also suspends the consumption of 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.680
 game is a practice that really gets 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.399
 has united and it is a practice that 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.960
 medically does not have any 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.260
 justification and much less 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.630
 scientifically 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.870
 the egg has a very small contribution of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.660
 protein really a serial egg to 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.690
 a double a or jumbo series like those that 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.430
 the amount is sold in Colombia 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.210
 of protein you have is more or less than 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.770
 7 grams per maximum per egg including 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.810
 a fraction of the clear and the fraction 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.430
 that brings the grass this means 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.650
 that does not bring a lot of 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.300
 significant to a low diet in 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.490
 proteins a low protein diet 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.710
 as a diet of my renal patient in 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.890
 our protection is a diet that does not 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.470
 contributes more than about 40 grams of protein 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.910
 in 24 hours to those of 7 grams of 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.250
 protein we are talking about a 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.810
 tiny fraction and is a protein of 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.960
 very high value and then that now 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.490
 obviously to affect the state of 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.590
 patient's health regarding his 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.570
 quality of life and above all 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.790
 prosperity of that muscle tissue that 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.610
 is being lost by tissue injury 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.410
 which represents the fact of being with 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.959
 a kidney disease in stadiums 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.700
 advanced 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.819
 it really is a practice that we should 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.450
 meditate a little the companions of the 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.549
 medical service before talking about the 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.040
 diet of Colombians especially the 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.810
 patient sick the egg since 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.629
 obviously the other sources of 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.120
 proteins such as meats and some 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.889
 liquids like milk because they do not have 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.540
 let's say the same composition as 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.599
 the amino acid profile does not have the 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.760
 same protein score and they really are 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.040
 food that you can not give them the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.989
 free attraction devote the fraction 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.439
 let's say carbohydrates as is the case 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.239
 of milk then really the egg is 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:23.939
 a very high biological value food that 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.120
 It should never be abolished by the diet of 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:29.579
 any person to exceptions on 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.949
 which can be diagnosed say 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.780
 already allergic diseases on 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:36.880
 constituent proteins of the egg 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.030
 no other pathology in the 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.440
 modern diet therapy let's say it deserves 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.450
 the limitation of the egg of the diet 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.070
 that final sentiment for this week 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.410
 is that if you have been 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.210
 I eliminated the egg the diet I meditated 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.610
 very well do not use it very well because 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.350
 it really is a food that we 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.540
 favors both the basic basket 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.910
 for consumption is a food of 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.910
 very high biological value good night
