straight okay that's calling over

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.510 
straight okay that's calling over
correct<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:35.350> teaching<00:01:35.770> it<00:01:35.830> really<00:01:36.130> works<00:01:36.340> at

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
correct and teaching it really works at

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.130 
correct and teaching it really works at
hitting<00:01:36.729> and<00:01:37.000> so<00:01:37.479> that's<00:01:37.720> what<00:01:37.870> we'll<00:01:38.020> do

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
hitting and so that's what we'll do

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.080 
hitting and so that's what we'll do
right<00:01:38.170> here<00:01:38.500> with<00:01:38.620> the<00:01:38.710> back<00:01:38.950> of<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.460> chin<00:01:39.909> to

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
right here with the back of the chin to

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.990 
right here with the back of the chin to
your<00:01:40.240> back<00:01:41.220> shoulder<00:01:42.220> and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
your back shoulder and

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.780 
your back shoulder and
or<00:01:43.180> see<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.480> ball<00:01:43.690> right<00:01:44.050> here<00:01:44.520> chin<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.640> your

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
back so it becomes very hard to pull

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.560 
back so it becomes very hard to pull
your<00:01:48.040> front<00:01:48.220> side<00:01:48.550> out<00:01:48.760> pull<00:01:49.060> your<00:01:49.210> head<00:01:49.390> out

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
if you have your chin on your back

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.550
