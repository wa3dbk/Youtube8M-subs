around 550 500 degrees and we should

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.199 
around 550 500 degrees and we should
figure<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:28.709> for<00:03:29.129> most<00:03:29.310> people<00:03:29.700> with<00:03:29.849> a<00:03:29.879> bone

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.009 
figure this for most people with a bone
in<00:03:30.950> promise<00:03:31.950> reading<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.489> prime<00:03:32.760> rib<00:03:33.060> is<00:03:33.510> they

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
in promise reading the prime rib is they

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.860 
in promise reading the prime rib is they
take<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.500> weight<00:03:34.709> of<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.069> meat<00:03:35.609> times<00:03:36.389> five

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
take the weight of the meat times five

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.259 
take the weight of the meat times five
and<00:03:37.470> this<00:03:38.129> one<00:03:38.370> like<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:38.549> say<00:03:38.760> it's<00:03:38.879> about<00:03:38.940> three

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
and this one like I say it's about three

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.830 
and this one like I say it's about three
and<00:03:39.299> a<00:03:39.450> half<00:03:39.480> pounds<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.470> normally<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.459> think

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
and a half pounds and normally you think

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.059 
and a half pounds and normally you think
seventeen<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:43.109> twenty<00:03:43.139> minutes<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:43.980> this

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
seventeen to twenty minutes and this

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.069 
seventeen to twenty minutes and this
thing<00:03:44.340> should<00:03:44.579> be<00:03:44.609> right<00:03:45.000> but<00:03:45.750> we've<00:03:45.900> never

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
thing should be right but we've never

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.319 
thing should be right but we've never
done<00:03:46.290> one<00:03:46.709> it's<00:03:47.340> play<00:03:47.489> gonna<00:03:47.670> take<00:03:47.819> less<00:03:48.060> than

done one it's play gonna take less than
that<00:03:48.450> it's<00:03:48.810> probably<00:03:49.109> gonna<00:03:49.230> take<00:03:49.409> less<00:03:49.620> than

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
that it's probably gonna take less than

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.009 
that it's probably gonna take less than
a<00:03:49.950> yes<00:03:50.340> we're<00:03:50.939> gonna<00:03:51.150> guess<00:03:51.329> tonight<00:03:51.750> and
