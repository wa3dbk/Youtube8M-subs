00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.660
 of course and the other is this that I've 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.370

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:28.320

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:30.030

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.160
 choose the drink we want but 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.910
 inside the drink that we want 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.930
 we can also choose the flavor what 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.620
 I do first is to throw some ice 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.620
 in my glass 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.160

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.160

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.860
 of course the classic cocacola and the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.000
 coca-cola hero 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.940
 so 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.900

 cherry strawberry grape lime 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.750
 peach but I almost prefer a 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.150
 coca-cola zero 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.940
 after all the man burgers 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.180
 you have to make an effort to focus with the 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.040
 of vanilla select and now 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.040

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.810
 really good do not be scared by the 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.060
 camera because this recorded with the htc 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.640
 network that as you know is resistant to 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.130
 good water of the cocacola do not say anything 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.630
 but I should clean it right now 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.630
 if anything, until the next video 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.180
