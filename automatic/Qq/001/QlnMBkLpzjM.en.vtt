usually get around 20 to 22 so let's
still<00:02:03.299> quick<00:02:03.509> test<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.469> video's<00:02:04.770> you

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
still quick test in this video's you

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.770 
still quick test in this video's you
guys<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.159> check<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.460> out<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.700> see<00:02:05.729> how<00:02:05.969> how

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
guys can check it out to see how how

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.919 
guys can check it out to see how how
well<00:02:06.990> del<00:02:07.229> t<00:02:07.409> speeds<00:02:07.860> work<00:02:08.129> for<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.929> Droid

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
well del t speeds work for the Droid

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.880 
well del t speeds work for the Droid
Bionic

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:28.660 

okay<00:02:16.490> be<00:02:16.670> getting<00:02:16.910> tests

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.199 

I'm<00:02:29.300> getting<00:02:29.480> around<00:02:29.810> 13<00:02:31.120> it's<00:02:32.120> actually

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
I'm getting around 13 it's actually

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.500 
I'm getting around 13 it's actually
slowed<00:02:32.569> down<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.780> little<00:02:32.930> bit<00:02:33.140> but<00:02:34.090> on<00:02:35.090> this

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
slowed down a little bit but on this

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.760 
slowed down a little bit but on this
test<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:36.110> was<00:02:36.200> about<00:02:36.470> eight<00:02:38.560> upload<00:02:39.560> and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
test that was about eight upload and

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.400 
test that was about eight upload and
downloads<00:02:40.220> was<00:02:40.400> actually<00:02:40.790> 11<00:02:41.300> ml<00:02:41.810> plus<00:02:42.020> eleven

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
downloads was actually 11 ml plus eleven

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.760 
downloads was actually 11 ml plus eleven
dollars<00:02:42.560> eight<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:44.180> does<00:02:44.870> vary<00:02:45.440> but<00:02:45.709> i

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
dollars eight so it does vary but i

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.520 
dollars eight so it does vary but i
usually<00:02:46.130> get<00:02:46.250> around<00:02:46.750> between<00:02:47.750> 15<00:02:48.200> and<00:02:48.260> 20<00:02:50.530> now

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
usually get around between 15 and 20 now

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.850 
usually get around between 15 and 20 now
and<00:02:51.950> let's<00:02:52.880> take<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.180> look<00:02:53.390> at<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.860> settings

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
and let's take a look at the settings

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.710 
and let's take a look at the settings
here<00:02:54.920> quickly<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:56.600> do<00:02:56.750> have<00:02:56.900> hdmi<00:02:57.470> control<00:02:57.890> so

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
here quickly you do have hdmi control so

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.930 
here quickly you do have hdmi control so
with<00:02:59.720> the<00:03:00.050> hdmi<00:03:00.380> connectivity<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.760> can

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
with the hdmi connectivity you can

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.940 
with the hdmi connectivity you can
actually<00:03:02.269> go<00:03:02.360> in<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:03.080> check<00:03:03.290> change<00:03:03.739> it<00:03:03.860> over

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
actually go in and check change it over

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.759 
actually go in and check change it over
scan<00:03:04.400> but<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.300> automatically<00:03:06.170> detects<00:03:06.530> on<00:03:06.680> on

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
scan but it automatically detects on on

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.229

cables for you so you do have to

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.220 
cables for you so you do have to
purchase<00:03:09.920> that<00:03:10.130> yourself<00:03:10.989> again<00:03:11.989> just

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
purchase that yourself again just
