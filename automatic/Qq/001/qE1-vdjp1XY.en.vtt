practice half of the net in the right

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.740 
practice half of the net in the right
hand<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:06.709> roll<00:04:07.310> it<00:04:07.490> your<00:04:07.970> left<00:04:08.150> thumb<00:04:08.360> like

over the thumb and rest it there now you

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.990 
over the thumb and rest it there now you
have<00:04:17.510> two<00:04:17.690> piles<00:04:17.930> of<00:04:18.109> web<00:04:18.260> again<00:04:18.590> a<00:04:18.830> high<00:04:19.700> pile

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
have two piles of web again a high pile

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.420 
have two piles of web again a high pile
and<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.180> low<00:04:20.359> pile<00:04:20.799> where<00:04:21.799> it<00:04:21.890> goes<00:04:22.010> from<00:04:22.070> high

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
and a low pile where it goes from high

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.360 
and a low pile where it goes from high
to<00:04:22.460> low<00:04:22.610> grab<00:04:23.510> that<00:04:23.720> transition<00:04:24.290> piece<00:04:24.500> and

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
to low grab that transition piece and

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.890 
to low grab that transition piece and
this<00:04:25.610> time<00:04:25.850> instead<00:04:26.030> of<00:04:26.300> putting<00:04:26.480> it<00:04:26.660> in<00:04:26.780> your
