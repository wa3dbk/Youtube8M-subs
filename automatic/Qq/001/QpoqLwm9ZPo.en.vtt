interesting<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> study<00:00:19.289> out<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.470> Denmark<00:00:19.949> and

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
interesting a study out of Denmark and

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.410 
interesting a study out of Denmark and
first<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.400> all<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.490> think<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.820> lot<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:21.000> people<00:00:21.119> do

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
first of all I think a lot of people do

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.179 
first of all I think a lot of people do
use<00:00:21.630> her<00:00:21.750> cell<00:00:21.960> phones<00:00:22.199> despite<00:00:22.710> those<00:00:22.920> signs

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
use her cell phones despite those signs

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.830 
use her cell phones despite those signs
you<00:00:23.460> uh<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.180> know<00:00:24.269> I've<00:00:24.330> use<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
you uh you know I've use it in the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.120 
you uh you know I've use it in the
hospital<00:00:25.050> every<00:00:25.380> now<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.740> then<00:00:25.830> my<00:00:25.920> black

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
hospital every now and then my black

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.040 
hospital every now and then my black
bear<00:00:26.340> or<00:00:26.430> something<00:00:26.550> like<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.849> not<00:00:27.750> not<00:00:27.960> in

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
bear or something like that not not in

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.990 
bear or something like that not not in
certain<00:00:28.349> areas<00:00:28.470> as<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.070> mentioned<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.550> ICU

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
certain areas as you mentioned the ICU

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.299 
certain areas as you mentioned the ICU
for<00:00:30.179> example<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> lot<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.320> people<00:00:31.529> do<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.250> I

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
for example but a lot of people do and I

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.620 
for example but a lot of people do and I
think<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.579> they<00:00:32.669> weren't<00:00:33.030> sure<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.510> there

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
think that they weren't sure that there

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.479 
think that they weren't sure that there
was<00:00:33.719> actually<00:00:34.020> an<00:00:34.079> effect<00:00:34.410> here<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.309> turns

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
was actually an effect here but it turns

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.470 
was actually an effect here but it turns
out<00:00:35.610> there<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.090> study<00:00:36.300> out<00:00:36.450> of

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
out there is and you study out of

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.119 
out there is and you study out of
Denmark<00:00:36.750> actually<00:00:37.230> looking<00:00:37.500> specifically<00:00:38.010> at

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
Denmark actually looking specifically at

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.560 
Denmark actually looking specifically at
this<00:00:38.370> problem<00:00:38.579> looking<00:00:38.969> at<00:00:39.120> whether<00:00:39.329> or<00:00:39.480> not

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
this problem looking at whether or not

pacemaker what they said specifically is
that<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.270> stops<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.750> reading<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.619> pacemaker

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
that it stops the reading the pacemaker

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.700 
that it stops the reading the pacemaker
back<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> EKG<00:01:15.150> machine<00:01:15.509> most<00:01:16.110> concerning

back to the EKG machine most concerning
it<00:01:16.979> actually<00:01:17.310> turned<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.670> mechanical

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
it actually turned a mechanical

ventilator off and someone had to go
turn<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.520> back<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.720> also<00:01:22.080> turn

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
turn it back on and it can also turn

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.109 
turn it back on and it can also turn
feeding<00:01:22.830> tube<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.280> people<00:01:23.549> who<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.729> feeding

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
feeding tube so people who have feeding

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.429 
feeding tube so people who have feeding
tube<00:01:24.270> opponents<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.080> ventilator

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
tube opponents is it a ventilator

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.260 
tube opponents is it a ventilator
something<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> hard<00:01:26.189> switch<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.939> yeah

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
something with a hard switch on it yeah

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.670 
something with a hard switch on it yeah
you<00:01:27.330> think<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.869> mean<00:01:27.990> I'm<00:01:28.080> not<00:01:28.170> sure<00:01:28.229> what<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
you think I mean I'm not sure what the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.990 
you think I mean I'm not sure what the
signal<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.310> somehow<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:29.729> interfering

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
signal is of somehow it's interfering

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.670 
signal is of somehow it's interfering
with<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.299> signal<00:01:30.630> somewhere<00:01:31.049> but<00:01:31.590> it

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
with the signal somewhere but it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.620 
with the signal somewhere but it
actually<00:01:31.829> sent<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.340> signal<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> mechanical

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
actually sent a signal to the mechanical

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.569 
actually sent a signal to the mechanical
ventilator<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.170> turn<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.740> off<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:34.890> basically

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
ventilator and turn it off and basically

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.770 
ventilator and turn it off and basically
what<00:01:35.729> they<00:01:35.820> did<00:01:35.970> was<00:01:36.060> they<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.360> held<00:01:36.600> these

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
what they did was they just held these

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.960 
what they did was they just held these
phones<00:01:37.110> within<00:01:37.860> three<00:01:38.340> feet<00:01:38.369> away<00:01:38.670> they

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
phones within three feet away they

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.399 
phones within three feet away they
weren't<00:01:39.329> even<00:01:39.479> talking<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.229> them<00:01:40.380> just

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
weren't even talking on them just

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.740 
weren't even talking on them just
holding<00:01:40.979> him<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.670> seeing<00:01:42.420> what<00:01:42.570> kind<00:01:42.689> of

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
holding him on and seeing what kind of

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.480 
holding him on and seeing what kind of
electromagnetic<00:01:43.350> interference<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.399> was

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
electromagnetic interference it was

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.999 
electromagnetic interference it was
causing<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:44.970> there<00:01:45.360> any<00:01:45.509> particular<00:01:45.770> model<00:01:46.770> of

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
causing is there any particular model of

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.920 
causing is there any particular model of
phone<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:48.149> worse<00:01:48.360> than<00:01:48.509> others<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.869> know

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
phone that is worse than others I know

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.749 
phone that is worse than others I know

the<00:02:01.619> same<00:02:01.799> question<00:02:02.299> GPRS<00:02:03.299> if<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.840> see<00:02:04.079> that

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the same question GPRS if you see that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.770 
the same question GPRS if you see that
on<00:02:04.649> your<00:02:04.799> phone<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.070> type<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.430> signal<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:06.600> is

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
on your phone a type of signal that is

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.630 
on your phone a type of signal that is
the<00:02:06.869> most<00:02:06.960> problematic<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:08.160> way<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.340> know<00:02:08.429> is

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
the most problematic one way to know is

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.309 
the most problematic one way to know is
if<00:02:08.759> your<00:02:08.910> if<00:02:09.060> your<00:02:09.090> phone<00:02:09.450> or<00:02:09.660> your<00:02:09.690> device<00:02:10.080> can

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
if your if your phone or your device can

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.920 
if your if your phone or your device can
actually<00:02:10.590> connect<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.069> internet

those<00:02:12.109> that<00:02:12.590> or<00:02:12.769> Wi-Fi<00:02:13.310> those<00:02:13.730> seem<00:02:13.909> to<00:02:14.000> be<00:02:14.060> the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
those that or Wi-Fi those seem to be the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.089 
those that or Wi-Fi those seem to be the
most<00:02:14.299> problematic<00:02:14.810> this<00:02:15.409> this<00:02:15.769> is<00:02:15.890> a<00:02:15.920> real

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
most problematic this this is a real

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.949 
most problematic this this is a real
problem<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:17.150> older<00:02:17.450> phones<00:02:17.719> it<00:02:17.870> was

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
problem the older phones it was

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.119 
problem the older phones it was
interesting<00:02:18.349> John<00:02:18.560> there's<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:18.769> study<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:19.010> a

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
interesting John there's a study of a

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.679 
interesting John there's a study of a
Mayo<00:02:19.310> Clinic<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.730> few<00:02:19.909> months<00:02:20.090> ago<00:02:20.299> that<00:02:20.569> said

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689 
Mayo Clinic a few months ago that said

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:21.910 
Mayo Clinic a few months ago that said
just<00:02:20.959> these<00:02:21.079> types<00:02:21.349> of<00:02:21.469> phones<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:21.829> are

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
just these types of phones that are

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.259 
just these types of phones that are
older<00:02:22.040> don't<00:02:22.370> have<00:02:22.609> that<00:02:22.819> type<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.030> capability
