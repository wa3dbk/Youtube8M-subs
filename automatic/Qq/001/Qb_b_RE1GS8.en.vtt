shelter<00:00:12.360> Easter<00:00:12.660> Egg<00:00:12.809> now<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.230> know<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:14.130> have

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
shelter Easter Egg now I know I have

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.580 
shelter Easter Egg now I know I have
pretty<00:00:14.759> much<00:00:14.990> disproven<00:00:15.990> everything<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.440> found

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
pretty much disproven everything I found

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.160 
pretty much disproven everything I found
that<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.010> shelter<00:00:17.369> door<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:18.090> open<00:00:18.539> during<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
that the shelter door is open during the

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.099 
that the shelter door is open during the
cutscene<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.510> you<00:00:21.510> can<00:00:21.660> glitch<00:00:21.869> in

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
cutscene and that you can glitch in

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.120 
cutscene and that you can glitch in
there<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.380> there's<00:00:22.500> nothing<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:22.920> there<00:00:23.100> but

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
there and there's nothing in there but

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.189 
there and there's nothing in there but
that's<00:00:23.760> still<00:00:24.150> iffy<00:00:24.539> but<00:00:25.350> anyways<00:00:27.199> what

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
that's still iffy but anyways what

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.290 
that's still iffy but anyways what
there's<00:00:29.099> still<00:00:29.369> all<00:00:29.550> these<00:00:29.699> theories<00:00:30.029> going

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
there's still all these theories going

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.999 
there's still all these theories going
around<00:00:30.539> people<00:00:30.810> are<00:00:30.900> always<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.349> hey<00:00:31.590> dudes

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
around people are always like hey dudes

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.100 
around people are always like hey dudes
there's<00:00:32.910> those<00:00:33.120> symbols<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.719> bottom<00:00:34.020> of

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
there's those symbols on the bottom of

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.020 
there's those symbols on the bottom of
the<00:00:34.170> sign<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.800> if<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.040> shoot<00:00:35.790> all<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
the sign and if you shoot all the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.049 
the sign and if you shoot all the
symbols<00:00:36.390> then<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:37.430> open<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.520> shelter<00:00:38.879> I

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
symbols then you open the shelter I

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.510 
symbols then you open the shelter I
don't<00:00:39.510> believe<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.320> then<00:00:40.590> someone<00:00:41.190> told

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
don't believe it but then someone told

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.770 
don't believe it but then someone told
me<00:00:41.820> about<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.620> zombies<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
me about this on the zombies on the

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.569 
me about this on the zombies on the
hazard<00:00:45.780> zombies<00:00:46.140> one<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> symbols<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.460> of

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
hazard zombies one of the symbols one of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.650 
hazard zombies one of the symbols one of
the<00:00:47.640> symbols<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.149> couldn't<00:00:48.450> find

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the symbols that we couldn't find

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.510 
the symbols that we couldn't find
anywhere<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> map<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.739> actually<00:00:50.219> there

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
anywhere on the map is actually there

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.670 
anywhere on the map is actually there
which<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.390> interesting<00:00:52.140> thing<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.530> my

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
which is the interesting thing in my

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.549 
which is the interesting thing in my
opinion<00:00:52.829> because<00:00:53.430> take<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> look<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:55.440> gonna

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
opinion because take a look it's gonna

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.380 
opinion because take a look it's gonna
be<00:00:55.710> hard<00:00:55.860> for<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.100> see<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.699> see<00:00:56.940> that

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
be hard for you I see but you see that

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.599 
be hard for you I see but you see that
nuke<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.199> atom<00:00:58.559> symbol<00:00:58.949> I'll<00:00:59.160> show<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.430> it

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
nuke that atom symbol I'll show you it

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.459 
nuke that atom symbol I'll show you it
on<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> sign<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.270> second<00:01:00.570> right<00:01:00.930> there<00:01:01.199> you

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
on the sign in a second right there you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.250 
on the sign in a second right there you
see<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.820> sign<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.719> his<00:01:03.930> little

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
see that that sign is that his little

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.390 
see that that sign is that his little
like<00:01:04.439> fanny<00:01:04.830> pack

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
like fanny pack

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.969 
like fanny pack
now<00:01:05.840> there's<00:01:06.840> two<00:01:07.080> ways<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.290> we<00:01:07.500> can<00:01:07.680> look<00:01:07.860> at

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
now there's two ways that we can look at

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.710 
now there's two ways that we can look at
this<00:01:08.100> two<00:01:08.340> ways<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.760> we<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:09.030> look<00:01:09.240> at<00:01:09.479> if

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
this two ways that we can look at if

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.440 
this two ways that we can look at if
this<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.530> actually<00:01:10.890> more<00:01:11.670> evidence<00:01:12.150> for

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
this is this actually more evidence for

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.380 
this is this actually more evidence for
opening<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> fallout<00:01:13.229> shelter<00:01:13.650> in-game<00:01:14.010> I

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
opening the fallout shelter in-game I

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.240 
opening the fallout shelter in-game I
personally<00:01:15.390> don't<00:01:15.720> believe<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.740> could

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
personally don't believe so but it could

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.980 
personally don't believe so but it could
easily<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.790> because<00:01:18.060> there's<00:01:18.270> also<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.689> bike

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
easily be because there's also that bike

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.240 
easily be because there's also that bike
symbol<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> bike<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.159> garage

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
symbol and the bike is in the garage

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.890 
symbol and the bike is in the garage
which<00:01:20.909> I'll<00:01:21.030> go<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.420> minute<00:01:21.540> but<00:01:21.780> then

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
which I'll go to in a minute but then

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.080 
which I'll go to in a minute but then
there's<00:01:22.110> also<00:01:22.259> these<00:01:22.619> two<00:01:22.830> symbols<00:01:23.070> which<00:01:23.909> are

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
there's also these two symbols which are

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.899 
there's also these two symbols which are
still<00:01:24.240> unexplained<00:01:25.040> so<00:01:26.040> let<00:01:26.610> me<00:01:26.700> talk<00:01:26.850> about

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
still unexplained so let me talk about

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.719 
still unexplained so let me talk about
the<00:01:27.270> atom<00:01:27.600> symbol<00:01:27.960> first<00:01:28.280> these<00:01:29.280> guys<00:01:29.490> are

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the atom symbol first these guys are

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.969 
the atom symbol first these guys are
just<00:01:31.040> scientists<00:01:32.040> or<00:01:32.869> couldn't<00:01:33.979> disease

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
just scientists or couldn't disease

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.350 
just scientists or couldn't disease
control<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.430> not<00:01:35.640> disease<00:01:35.880> control<00:01:36.119> just

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
control and not disease control just

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.600 
control and not disease control just
guys<00:01:36.570> guys<00:01:37.110> coming<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.710> stop<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.400> outbreak

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
guys guys coming in to stop the outbreak

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.080 
guys guys coming in to stop the outbreak
of<00:01:38.939> zombies<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.369> control<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> pollution

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
of zombies and and control the pollution

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.429 
of zombies and and control the pollution
that<00:01:42.119> results<00:01:42.780> from<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.110> nuclear<00:01:43.590> bomb<00:01:44.060> but

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
that results from a nuclear bomb but

my god it's another sign we can get it
in<00:02:09.840> game<00:02:10.050> then<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.830> could<00:02:11.069> be<00:02:11.129> big<00:02:11.459> for<00:02:11.670> you

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
in game then this could be big for you

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.860 
in game then this could be big for you
because<00:02:11.970> we<00:02:12.599> got<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> bicycle<00:02:13.290> we<00:02:13.410> got<00:02:13.530> this

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
because we got the bicycle we got this

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.960 
because we got the bicycle we got this
son<00:02:14.140> without<00:02:14.379> the<00:02:14.530> fallout<00:02:14.860> shelter<00:02:14.890> I<00:02:15.459> just

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
son without the fallout shelter I just

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.240 
son without the fallout shelter I just
got<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.209> connect<00:02:16.540> all<00:02:16.690> these<00:02:16.870> together<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:17.980> I

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
got to connect all these together so I

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.680 
got to connect all these together so I
thought<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.610> was<00:02:18.670> worth<00:02:18.849> making<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.330> video<00:02:19.629> for

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
thought it was worth making a video for

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.170 
thought it was worth making a video for
you<00:02:20.049> guys<00:02:20.080> just<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.530> sort<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.129> recap<00:02:21.610> this<00:02:21.940> and

giving out false credit but as you can

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.990 
giving out false credit but as you can
see<00:02:37.860> they've<00:02:38.860> got<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.250> weird<00:02:39.459> they've<00:02:39.849> got

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
see they've got that weird they've got

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.809 
see they've got that weird they've got
the<00:02:40.150> weird<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.690> nuclear<00:02:41.680> symbol<00:02:42.099> that<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.489> get

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
the weird a nuclear symbol that you get

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.789 
the weird a nuclear symbol that you get
like<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.120> know<00:02:43.390> when<00:02:43.629> in<00:02:44.019> my<00:02:44.290> war<00:02:44.500> for<00:02:44.680> two

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
like you know when in my war for two

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.890 
like you know when in my war for two
when<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.040> get<00:02:45.159> a<00:02:45.190> nuke<00:02:45.879> when<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.480> calm<00:02:46.720> your

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
when you get a nuke when you calm your

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.660 
when you get a nuke when you calm your
nuke<00:02:47.109> you<00:02:47.290> see<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:47.680> spinning<00:02:48.190> symbol<00:02:48.549> on<00:02:48.640> top

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
nuke you see that spinning symbol on top

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.089 
nuke you see that spinning symbol on top
so<00:02:49.540> that's<00:02:49.959> pretty<00:02:50.109> much<00:02:50.200> what<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.530> means

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
so that's pretty much what that means

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.520 
so that's pretty much what that means
and<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.640> think<00:02:51.910> like<00:02:52.750> I've<00:02:52.930> already<00:02:53.319> made<00:02:53.500> my

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
and I think like I've already made my

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.650 
and I think like I've already made my
point<00:02:54.040> I<00:02:54.160> think<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.489> made<00:02:54.640> my<00:02:54.670> point<00:02:54.879> clear<00:02:55.060> I'm

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
point I think I made my point clear I'm

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.960 
point I think I made my point clear I'm
not<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:56.290> still<00:02:56.859> am<00:02:57.010> going<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.220> hold<00:02:57.370> strong<00:02:57.670> with

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
not I still am going to hold strong with

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.330 
not I still am going to hold strong with
my<00:02:58.150> feet<00:02:58.420> with<00:02:58.690> my<00:02:58.870> theories<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.470> proof<00:02:59.769> you

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
my feet with my theories and proof you

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.130 
my feet with my theories and proof you
cannot<00:03:00.609> get<00:03:00.849> in<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.120> shelter<00:03:01.450> in-game<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.840> mean

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
cannot get in the shelter in-game I mean

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.330 
cannot get in the shelter in-game I mean
the<00:03:02.260> door<00:03:02.440> opens<00:03:02.890> on<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.959> cutscene<00:03:05.340> they

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
the door opens on the cutscene they

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.440 
the door opens on the cutscene they
wouldn't<00:03:06.670> just<00:03:06.700> have<00:03:06.909> it<00:03:07.030> open<00:03:07.269> on<00:03:07.329> the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
wouldn't just have it open on the

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.270 
wouldn't just have it open on the
cutscene<00:03:07.810> for<00:03:07.989> no<00:03:08.319> reason<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:08.829> let<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.099> get
