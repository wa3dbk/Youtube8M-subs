00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
hopefully so the old regime was kind of

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.380 
hopefully so the old regime was kind of
there<00:02:30.099> was<00:02:30.220> there<00:02:30.430> was<00:02:30.489> way<00:02:30.819> too<00:02:30.849> many<00:02:31.120> egos

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
there was there was way too many egos

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.360 
there was there was way too many egos
and<00:02:31.720> there<00:02:31.840> was<00:02:31.959> way<00:02:32.110> too<00:02:32.140> much<00:02:32.410> history<00:02:33.280> there

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
and there was way too much history there

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.690 
and there was way too much history there
you<00:02:33.760> know<00:02:33.879> and<00:02:35.099> kind<00:02:36.099> we<00:02:36.250> started<00:02:36.580> with<00:02:36.670> a

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
you know and kind we started with a

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.250 
you know and kind we started with a
clean<00:02:36.940> slate<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.299> we're<00:02:37.660> working<00:02:37.959> with<00:02:38.019> good

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
clean slate and we're working with good

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.319 
clean slate and we're working with good
good<00:02:38.530> people<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.040> have<00:02:39.489> common<00:02:39.879> sense<00:02:39.910> and

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
good people that have common sense and

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.690 
good people that have common sense and
race<00:02:40.540> knowledge<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.680> makes<00:02:41.890> it's

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
race knowledge and it just makes it's

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.360 
race knowledge and it just makes it's
just<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.030> good<00:02:43.209> relationship<00:02:44.069> versus<00:02:45.069> a<00:02:45.099> bad

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
just a good relationship versus a bad

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.539 
just a good relationship versus a bad
one<00:02:45.579> so<00:02:45.849> the<00:02:46.629> series<00:02:46.959> now<00:02:47.140> has<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.829> platform<00:02:48.489> to

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
one so the series now has a platform to

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.589 
one so the series now has a platform to
where<00:02:48.819> we<00:02:48.970> can<00:02:49.120> really<00:02:49.299> go<00:02:50.079> somewhere<00:02:50.440> with<00:02:50.590> it

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
where we can really go somewhere with it

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.610 
where we can really go somewhere with it
they<00:02:52.599> still<00:02:52.870> show<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.049> penalize<00:02:53.410> been

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
they still show to penalize been

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.569 
they still show to penalize been
yesterday<00:02:53.829> I<00:02:55.590> think<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.709> most<00:02:56.859> telling<00:02:57.129> sign

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
yesterday I think the most telling sign

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.550 
yesterday I think the most telling sign
is<00:02:57.849> that<00:02:58.120> all<00:02:58.629> of<00:02:58.870> us<00:02:58.900> are<00:02:59.079> here<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.410> we're

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
is that all of us are here and we're

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.550 
is that all of us are here and we're
focused<00:02:59.739> on<00:03:00.069> racing<00:03:00.579> I<00:03:00.900> think<00:03:01.900> we<00:03:02.019> roll<00:03:02.200> into<00:03:02.440> a

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
focused on racing I think we roll into a

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.020 
focused on racing I think we roll into a
race<00:03:02.829> not<00:03:03.930> being<00:03:04.930> worried<00:03:05.349> about<00:03:05.590> if

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
race not being worried about if

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.610 
race not being worried about if
officiating<00:03:07.030> is<00:03:07.390> going<00:03:07.599> to<00:03:07.660> keep<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.049> playing

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
officiating is going to keep the playing

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.369 
officiating is going to keep the playing
field<00:03:08.980> level<00:03:09.209> I<00:03:10.209> think<00:03:10.870> we<00:03:11.079> all<00:03:11.200> feel<00:03:11.319> like

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
field level I think we all feel like

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.009 
field level I think we all feel like
we'll<00:03:11.680> be<00:03:11.709> treated<00:03:12.129> fairly<00:03:12.810> however<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:13.900> goes

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
we'll be treated fairly however it goes

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.900 
we'll be treated fairly however it goes
most<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:14.980> time<00:03:15.510> but<00:03:16.510> uh<00:03:17.400> well<00:03:18.400> what<00:03:18.669> we

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
most of the time but uh well what we

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.849 
most of the time but uh well what we
have<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:19.060> voice<00:03:19.269> will<00:03:19.540> be<00:03:19.569> heard<00:03:19.859> treated

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
have a voice will be heard treated

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:22.229 
have a voice will be heard treated
fairly<00:03:21.099> so<00:03:21.370> we<00:03:21.459> can<00:03:21.609> focus<00:03:21.730> on<00:03:22.060> what's

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
fairly so we can focus on what's

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.520 
fairly so we can focus on what's
important<00:03:22.660> which<00:03:22.780> is<00:03:22.810> racing<00:03:23.230> against<00:03:23.470> each

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
important which is racing against each

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.440 
important which is racing against each
other<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:23.829> I<00:03:24.010> think<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.280> shows<00:03:24.489> in<00:03:25.299> the

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
other and I think it shows in the

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.150 
other and I think it shows in the
competition<00:03:25.750> it's<00:03:26.200> been<00:03:26.319> a<00:03:26.349> great<00:03:26.560> season<00:03:26.620> and

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
competition it's been a great season and

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.680 
competition it's been a great season and
everybody's<00:03:27.639> having<00:03:27.849> a<00:03:27.910> lot<00:03:28.030> of<00:03:28.060> fun<00:03:28.180> being<00:03:28.599> at

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
everybody's having a lot of fun being at

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.500 
everybody's having a lot of fun being at
the<00:03:28.780> racetrack<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:30.329> whoever's<00:03:31.329> out<00:03:31.450> there

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
the racetrack and whoever's out there

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.270 
the racetrack and whoever's out there
and<00:03:32.049> still<00:03:32.440> thinks<00:03:32.709> there's<00:03:32.859> bad<00:03:33.040> vibes

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
and still thinks there's bad vibes

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.159 
and still thinks there's bad vibes

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.500 
hasn't been watching the series very
closely<00:03:35.500> because<00:03:35.910> it's<00:03:36.910> been<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.120> non-issue

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
closely because it's been a non-issue

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.380 
closely because it's been a non-issue
from<00:03:37.900> day<00:03:38.169> one
