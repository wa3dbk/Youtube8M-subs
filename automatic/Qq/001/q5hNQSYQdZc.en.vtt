00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.500
 unfamiliar yarn from the internet and is it worth 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.660
 buy some knitters know 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.969
 afraid to buy in online stores 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:18.560
 yarn especially unfamiliar to that of 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:24.630
 which already knit it clear but 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:29.009
 unusual I bought this felicia yarn 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.430
 Italian yarn she blended cotton with 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:35.760
 flax, and even pieces of the viscose 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:40.380
 very unusual so bluish with 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:44.000
 white a little bit she does not even know 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.800
 coarse not coarse very unusual i 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.670
 at first even confused think I 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.770
 have done 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:56.060
 and then I liked the yarn 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.150
 by its singularity 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:03.630
 as in the composition there is flax i think she 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.829
 after washing my even softer and now she has 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:11.759
 such a thread structure is unusual she 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:15.530
 I donâ€™t even know someone like a crochet 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:21.240
 woven air loops 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:25.340
 or in general it is not clear how everything is done 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.499
 three strings and woven lace 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:35.670
 thin so much conan 250 meters 

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:39.270
 a hundred grams and I already like it and from 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:44.490
 any yarn any yarn need to pick up 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:48.479
 drawing i really like it i do 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:53.369
 I take the yarn tried to boil the 7-meter 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.240
 crochet different patterns of nothing we do not 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.749
 like 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:03.020
 faith tunisian hook if tunisian 

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:07.649
 I am not satisfied with crochet I take the plug 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:12.269
 Here is a canvas I get from 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.860
 this yarn from 2 to kick I had 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.130
 gray 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.740
 here the truth is not very visible only in 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.830
 here you can see and here is another 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.130
 feature interesting yarn seems to me 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.920
 so that I do not start to knit so 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:35.010
 pattern all turn out 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:38.100
 and honestly I like it a lot. 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.760
 during the first knitting needles and I still 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.850
 Now, Mr. Crochet turns out very 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.990
 soft canvas so probably shoes 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.990
 see this truth
