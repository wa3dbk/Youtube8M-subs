that<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.850> have<00:01:27.060> here<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.780> hard<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.770> argue

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
that we have here it's hard to argue

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.570 
that we have here it's hard to argue
against<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.430> but<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:30.480> plus<00:01:31.380> size<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:32.010> the

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
against that but but plus size that the

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.450 
against that but but plus size that the
atmosphere<00:01:33.180> was<00:01:33.240> amazing<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.350> with<00:01:34.560> guys<00:01:35.280> who

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
atmosphere was amazing and with guys who

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.150 
atmosphere was amazing and with guys who
know<00:01:35.640> how<00:01:35.760> to<00:01:35.850> play<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.270> also<00:01:36.890> unselfish<00:01:37.890> and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
five extremely competitive it was a

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.740 
five extremely competitive it was a
great<00:01:40.920> atmosphere<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.580> think<00:01:41.910> that<00:01:42.120> the<00:01:42.300> jordan

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
great atmosphere I think that the jordan

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.770 
great atmosphere I think that the jordan
brand<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.260> big<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.770> because<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:45.270> know<00:01:45.420> he

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
brand is so big just because you know he

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.980 
brand is so big just because you know he
proved<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:47.010> be<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.160> champion<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.790> winner<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.390> think

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
proved to be a champion a winner I think

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.130 
proved to be a champion a winner I think
we<00:01:49.920> all<00:01:49.950> strive<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.910> be<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.360> best<00:01:51.480> in<00:01:51.840> what<00:01:51.990> we

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
we all strive to be the best in what we

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.770 
we all strive to be the best in what we
do<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.650> think<00:01:52.680> by<00:01:53.210> worrying<00:01:54.210> footings

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
do and I think by worrying footings

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.380 
do and I think by worrying footings
footwear<00:01:55.230> or<00:01:55.260> peril<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.340> think<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.760> helps<00:01:57.120> to

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
footwear or peril I think it helps to

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.630 
footwear or peril I think it helps to
give<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.690> that<00:01:57.870> that<00:01:58.500> feeling<00:01:58.950> we're<00:01:59.550> gonna

gosh these are the heroes of basketball
and<00:04:31.470> I<00:04:32.220> remember<00:04:33.210> sitting<00:04:33.479> in<00:04:33.689> front<00:04:33.870> of<00:04:33.960> my<00:04:34.080> TV

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319 
and I remember sitting in front of my TV

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:35.890 
and I remember sitting in front of my TV
so<00:04:34.710> we're<00:04:34.860> that's<00:04:35.009> probably<00:04:35.250> I<00:04:35.310> can't<00:04:35.580> see<00:04:35.729> now

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
so we're that's probably I can't see now

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.719 
so we're that's probably I can't see now
because<00:04:36.900> I<00:04:37.229> would<00:04:37.620> sit<00:04:37.830> so<00:04:38.069> close<00:04:38.099> to<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.580> TV

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
because I would sit so close to the TV

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.429 
because I would sit so close to the TV
and<00:04:39.060> just<00:04:39.270> watch<00:04:39.479> it<00:04:39.509> I'm<00:04:39.810> amazed<00:04:40.199> by

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
basketball I remember my father and a

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.360 
basketball I remember my father and a
lot<00:04:42.930> of<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.110> men<00:04:43.259> in<00:04:43.379> my<00:04:43.409> life<00:04:43.500> like<00:04:43.979> just

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.100 
so excited Magic Johnson and Larry Bird
like<00:04:48.900> I<00:04:49.229> think<00:04:50.039> that's<00:04:50.189> just<00:04:50.250> insurmountable

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
like I think that's just insurmountable

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.469 
like I think that's just insurmountable
just<00:04:52.110> as<00:04:52.979> you<00:04:53.310> can't<00:04:53.550> you'll<00:04:53.879> never<00:04:54.090> get<00:04:54.360> that

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
just as you can't you'll never get that

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.089 
just as you can't you'll never get that
again<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:54.990> so<00:04:55.169> I<00:04:55.229> just<00:04:55.409> think<00:04:55.620> sing<00:04:55.830> them<00:04:55.979> play

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
again and so I just think sing them play

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.920 
again and so I just think sing them play
on<00:04:56.219> the<00:04:56.310> same<00:04:56.490> team<00:04:56.520> just<00:04:57.000> coming<00:04:57.539> from<00:04:57.629> a<00:04:57.750> huge
