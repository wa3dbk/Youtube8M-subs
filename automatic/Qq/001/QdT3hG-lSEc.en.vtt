00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.239
 range and in general provides for 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.990

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.700

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.330
 Some features of the blister kit 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.000
 This place is equipped with a small 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.810
 cushion to our headset to 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.680
 accordingly did not scratch at 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.680

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.560

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:53.450

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.490
 Inside we are waiting for here such headphones with 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.640
 very soft ear cushions they are made 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.399
 foam and some skin on them too 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.140
 there are handles regulated accordingly 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.050
 under almost any head with two 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.260
 parties, I think it is very convenient 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.120
 such shiny plastic on themselves 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.230
 headphones also present a small 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.519
 remote that turns on and off 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.459
 microphone also it adjusts the volume 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.440
 from the bottom waiting for us first promised 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.549
 adapter which is used for 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.250
 connect to mobile phones 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.500
 tablet or maybe some 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:36.790
 ultrabook or something like that actually 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:39.620

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.660
 microphone one headphones themselves and to this 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.540
 everything is not hanging there is such 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.290
 gum which fixes it like this 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.290

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.000
 there is also such a flexible 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.770
 microphone that connects to 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.800
 The headset is also very convenient that 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:14.140
 can be disconnected and reattached 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:22.330
 this microphone is like this all you 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:27.900
 afraid and in general then let's see 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.900
 what it looks like on the user 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.990
 This is how it looks on an ordinary person. 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.340
 by the way this section of the video is recorded 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.660
 on built-in microphone 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.630
 this is done so that you can 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.620
 appreciate its quality yes of course it is not 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.270
 style icon 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.560
 However, from these headphones it is not 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.840
 it is required like this 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.860
 adjust the microphone and you can do it at all 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.860
 remove if you don't need it 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.460
 I think it's quite good. 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.930
 headset for my money I advise everyone 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.930
