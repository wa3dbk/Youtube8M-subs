that<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.750> put<00:00:15.960> up<00:00:16.109> probably<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:17.039> solid<00:00:17.250> ten

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
that I put up probably a solid ten

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.370 
that I put up probably a solid ten
minutes<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.029> just<00:00:18.270> me<00:00:18.420> doing<00:00:18.570> eyeliner<00:00:19.020> and

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
minutes of just me doing eyeliner and

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.439 
minutes of just me doing eyeliner and
there's<00:00:19.890> no<00:00:20.189> reason<00:00:20.609> for<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.180> really

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
there's no reason for that so you really

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.929 
there's no reason for that so you really
wanted<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.779> do<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> full<00:00:22.439> tutorial<00:00:22.650> on<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.369> this

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
wanted to do a full tutorial on it this

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.120 
wanted to do a full tutorial on it this
is<00:00:24.090> going<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.359> be<00:00:24.449> using<00:00:24.779> gel<00:00:25.289> eyeliner<00:00:25.859> and

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
is going to be using gel eyeliner and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.120 
is going to be using gel eyeliner and
that<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.640> because<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.150> find<00:00:27.630> for<00:00:28.080> me<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:28.890> gel

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
that is because I find for me I like gel

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.160 
that is because I find for me I like gel
eyeliner<00:00:29.460> better<00:00:29.670> than<00:00:29.939> liquid<00:00:30.240> eyeliner<00:00:30.599> you

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
eyeliner better than liquid eyeliner you

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.690 
eyeliner better than liquid eyeliner you
could<00:00:31.380> easily<00:00:31.650> follow<00:00:32.040> these<00:00:32.369> same<00:00:32.669> steps

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
could easily follow these same steps

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.120 
could easily follow these same steps
just<00:00:33.630> using<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.050> liquid<00:00:34.170> eyeliner<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.950> might

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
just using a liquid eyeliner it might

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.470 
just using a liquid eyeliner it might
take<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> little<00:00:35.610> bit<00:00:35.730> more<00:00:35.790> practice<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.420> a

to<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.810> lash<00:01:12.990> line<00:01:13.020> as<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.530> possibly<00:01:14.189> can<00:01:14.460> all

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
to the lash line as I possibly can all

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.370

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
you're gonna want to do is keep the line

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.840

thinner<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:16.979> inner<00:01:17.220> corner<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.700> get

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
thinner on the inner corner and get

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.790 
thinner on the inner corner and get
