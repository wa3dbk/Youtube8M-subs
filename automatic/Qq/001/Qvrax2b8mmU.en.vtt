00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.129
 need to get me better to the starting point 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.800
 50 meters the start has fallen robert be 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.510
 begin to calm down that mouth goes to 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.429
 the lead that matthieu also on the 2nd 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.369
 place them to the outside 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:22.080
 already there the emerging desert river desert 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.640
 weaver today went fast start is 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.810
 currently in second place 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.579
 don't get a position 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.779
 means that you have to push through and 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.400
 then see if there is something for her 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.380
 steel falls the answer is still for us 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.330
 no this was of course all perfect 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.970
 in the street of robert b die not 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.050
 participates in this set of titan duels every 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.820
 best positions 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.620
 robert those right now so very quiet 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.430
 can come forward to his stable mate 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.870
 to redeem 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.430
 robert bar and robin baker iron to 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.410
 second track so that Jan van Dooyeweerd 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.200
 parked long and wide and there 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.890
 he comes to the new leader in 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.710
 iron is coming 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.720
 robert who goes to the lead here and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.330
 grabs a length ahead of Thailand 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.060
 robert ii taymans third dimadzio boko 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.860
 then the 4 and that is desert river 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.320
 rear cover remained there is connection 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.840
 for domani toscana 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.670
 well yes the question is just yet 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.679
 exciting so they normally do not 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.850
 let's just enjoy the horse there 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:13.679
 currently has the pipes 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.030
 robert be or may one later on 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:16.799
 giant surprise may come 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.329
 from his stable mate to someone in the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.829
 second place if you are an idiot 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:21.149
 what makes you look like that is what you think 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.799
 of not looking at is a feeder of apples 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.759
 here today walking in the crowd 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.259
 to play 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.179
 interesting maybe to the latter 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.469
 kilometers but once to record 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.939
 Robin Baker on his way to the last 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.219
 kilometer that is the victoria park 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.509
 finish sport and we now press start 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.219
 on the samsung 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.109
 and there they are en route on the second 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.389
 rather than on the inner side which 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.219
 wall behind it is the macho boko 

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:43.409
 behind that macho boko then also follow 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.179
 place is fear of death or twitter and the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.850
 fifth place is behind domani 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.619
 toscana participants go through the bend 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.899
 way to the other side of the lane that is 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.459
 the point about 800 meters from home that 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.479
 is the point that he is probably full 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.009
 may robert be 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.469
 and he is going to accelerate there too 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.719
 but that mouth stays good at the 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.369
 are second behind that mouth 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.039
 then follow on the inside that makes 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.479
 choco it is of course the case to 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.200
 get that mouth as far as possible 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.849
 today 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.470
 Stefan clean about what looks inside 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.180
 today and he goes in pursuit 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.150
 that they don't march on even though it comes next 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.379
 that your mouth 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.909
 these two pairs then have small ones 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.560
 ahead of test kind of prefer that 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.299
 has done a lot at the start but now 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.400
 clever to the three for at tapers 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.870
 it's that but the marie tuscana that it 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.489
 herb still has bone dry and that goes 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.599
 try your luck inside 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.489
 we are so clear in the latter 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.560
 straight line and robert who has one here 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.840
 taken the lead compared to op 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.250
 Second garden is there w2 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.900
 before the stable heard her at the moment 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.150
 it looks like it unless it 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.950
 Macho bar on crossover a black 2 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.989
 that is not going to happen it certainly was 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.150
 not an exciting course but about oil 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.980
 He did win with a lot of power 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.690
 Robbert who headed for the finish below 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.650
 audience applause on the second 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.420
 place teeth 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.859
 the island ahead of them in third place 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.200
 someone's chocolate 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.780
 tamari toscana and desert river last 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.980
 km according to my calculation and there are 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.519
 fixed what clocks can't do 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.629
 confirm 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.629
