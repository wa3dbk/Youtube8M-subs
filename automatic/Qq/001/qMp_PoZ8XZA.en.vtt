00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
see the consistency so very smooth with

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.750 
see the consistency so very smooth with
little<00:04:08.450> bits<00:04:08.630> of<00:04:08.780> chunks<00:04:09.169> that<00:04:09.230> I<00:04:09.639> pulsed<00:04:10.639> if

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
little bits of chunks that I pulsed if

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.360 
little bits of chunks that I pulsed if
you<00:04:10.849> don't<00:04:11.030> want<00:04:11.239> the<00:04:11.930> chunks<00:04:12.290> as<00:04:12.410> fine

you<00:04:14.030> can<00:04:14.209> obviously<00:04:14.419> pulse<00:04:15.049> it<00:04:15.200> less<00:04:15.459> if<00:04:16.459> I

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
you can obviously pulse it less if I

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:17.680 
you can obviously pulse it less if I
just<00:04:16.700> wanted<00:04:16.910> to<00:04:17.000> add<00:04:17.090> a<00:04:17.120> little<00:04:17.389> bit<00:04:17.570> of<00:04:17.599> a
