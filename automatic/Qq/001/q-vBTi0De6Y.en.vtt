00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
want to put it the N on here so you got

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.280 
want to put it the N on here so you got
MIDI<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> out<00:01:14.010> out<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> end<00:01:15.509> so

MIDI in to the out out to the end so

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.420 
MIDI in to the out out to the end so
they<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.560> start<00:01:16.770> communicating<00:01:16.920> each<00:01:17.280> other

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
they can start communicating each other

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.480 
they can start communicating each other
because<00:01:17.610> MIDI<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.450> only<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:19.140> know<00:01:19.189> data<00:01:20.189> it's

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
because MIDI is only you know data it's

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.940 
because MIDI is only you know data it's
not<00:01:20.580> sound<00:01:21.150> ain't<00:01:21.540> nothing<00:01:21.869> it's<00:01:22.080> musical

not sound ain't nothing it's musical

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.740 
not sound ain't nothing it's musical
instrumental<00:01:23.520> digital<00:01:23.880> interface<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.600> just

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
instrumental digital interface it's just

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.289 
instrumental digital interface it's just
some<00:01:24.930> no<00:01:25.700> communication<00:01:26.700> between<00:01:26.820> them<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
some no communication between them to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.950 
some no communication between them to
okay<00:01:28.290> once<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.619> got<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.890> squared<00:01:29.130> away<00:01:29.369> I

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
okay once you got that squared away I

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.149 
okay once you got that squared away I
mean<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> MV<00:01:32.270> they<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.450> here

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
sure do you see that you get that all

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.990 
sure do you see that you get that all
squared<00:04:15.930> away<00:04:16.370> you<00:04:17.370> want<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.579> make<00:04:17.699> sure<00:04:17.729> that

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
squared away you want to make sure that

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.319 
squared away you want to make sure that
these<00:04:18.239> are<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.989> know<00:04:19.909> sums<00:04:20.909> there'd<00:04:21.180> only

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
these are you know sums there'd only

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.120 
these are you know sums there'd only
gonna<00:04:21.599> be<00:04:21.690> none<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:22.049> want<00:04:22.200> it<00:04:22.289> to<00:04:22.409> be<00:04:22.530> one<00:04:22.860> and

make sure that's checked out and

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.469 
make sure that's checked out and
sometimes<00:04:59.610> you<00:04:59.880> might<00:05:00.000> want<00:05:00.150> to<00:05:00.210> check<00:05:00.419> all

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479

features I mean I got 7.4 here because

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.350

I'm<00:05:29.280> comfortable<00:05:29.520> with<00:05:29.820> that<00:05:29.970> so<00:05:30.530> but<00:05:31.530> and

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
I'm comfortable with that so but and

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.320 
I'm comfortable with that so but and
from<00:05:33.360> that<00:05:33.539> on<00:05:33.750> you<00:05:34.289> should<00:05:34.560> be<00:05:34.680> set<00:05:35.280> to<00:05:35.460> go<00:05:35.640> and

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
from that on you should be set to go and

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.050 
from that on you should be set to go and
the<00:05:36.570> record<00:05:36.930> button<00:05:37.610> and<00:05:38.610> I<00:05:38.669> mean<00:05:38.880> you're

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
the record button and I mean you're

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.630 
the record button and I mean you're
going<00:05:39.180> to<00:05:39.300> see<00:05:39.990> what's<00:05:40.169> going<00:05:40.440> on<00:05:40.590> here<00:05:41.010> a<00:05:41.130> lot

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
going to see what's going on here a lot

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.340 
going to see what's going on here a lot
of<00:05:41.669> times<00:05:41.789> I'll<00:05:42.180> end<00:05:42.360> up<00:05:42.390> doing<00:05:42.690> mine<00:05:42.870> maybe

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
of times I'll end up doing mine maybe

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.260 
of times I'll end up doing mine maybe
one<00:05:43.680> bar<00:05:43.950> in<00:05:44.190> because<00:05:44.430> sometimes<00:05:44.820> when<00:05:45.060> you<00:05:45.090> do

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
one bar in because sometimes when you do

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.010 
one bar in because sometimes when you do
MIDI<00:05:45.510> sync<00:05:45.950> the<00:05:46.950> timing<00:05:47.460> won't<00:05:48.090> be<00:05:48.270> aligned<00:05:48.870> up

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
MIDI sync the timing won't be aligned up

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.170 
MIDI sync the timing won't be aligned up
because<00:05:49.169> it'll<00:05:49.320> record<00:05:49.710> it<00:05:49.919> because<00:05:50.160> I<00:05:50.310> wait

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
because it'll record it because I wait

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.700 
because it'll record it because I wait
too<00:05:51.360> early<00:05:51.840> because<00:05:51.990> the<00:05:52.200> yeah<00:05:52.350> it<00:05:52.440> takes<00:05:52.620> a

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
too early because the yeah it takes a

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.710 
too early because the yeah it takes a
while<00:05:52.830> for<00:05:52.889> the<00:05:53.130> data<00:05:53.370> from<00:05:53.880> the<00:05:53.970> MIDI<00:05:54.180> to<00:05:54.539> get

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
while for the data from the MIDI to get

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.960 
while for the data from the MIDI to get
to<00:05:54.840> the<00:05:54.960> computer<00:05:55.470> so<00:05:55.710> sometimes<00:05:56.550> people<00:05:56.850> will

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
to the computer so sometimes people will

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.610 
to the computer so sometimes people will
change<00:05:57.240> the<00:05:57.389> MIDI<00:05:57.570> offset<00:05:58.080> but<00:05:58.229> I<00:05:58.320> don't<00:05:58.500> want

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
change the MIDI offset but I don't want

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.980 
change the MIDI offset but I don't want
to<00:05:58.710> end<00:05:58.830> up<00:05:58.889> confusing<00:05:59.610> you<00:05:59.910> with<00:05:59.940> the<00:06:00.270> MIDI

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
to end up confusing you with the MIDI

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.659 
to end up confusing you with the MIDI
offset<00:06:01.500> whatever<00:06:01.590> whatnot<00:06:02.039> so<00:06:02.190> I<00:06:02.220> was<00:06:02.340> in<00:06:02.460> a<00:06:02.550> do

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
offset whatever whatnot so I was in a do
