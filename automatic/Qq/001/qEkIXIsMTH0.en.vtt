00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.780
 year 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.640
 Hello dear friends with you camp 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.800
 and today I will have a mod to herbs 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.080
 really help will help finally 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.930
 ok charm because it used to be 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.480
 just randomly poking that is before 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.000
 if you wanted to enchant then we 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.880
 just didn't know what we got and how 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.160
 it will fall but now if we have 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.710
 a certain thing laid out in this window 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.630
 as we see immediately the texture changes 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.090
 there is that we did not put here and 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.100
 will give and let's say probably pants 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.680
 put here is the wind texture pants so 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.230
 really cool this how would such 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.440
 a small bonus to cool toastmaster 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:06.070
 wait see we lay down and the sword and 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.430
 it offers us even in Russian 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.860
 enchant him with what we need 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.710
 let's say i want recoil and wash not here 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.870
 this here we see that recoil first 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.750
 level it costs 4 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.180
 it costs 4 left that is even here 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.220
 shows how much level of us 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.670
 will need i now have 31 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.380
 maximum 24 can be used as far as 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.360
 I realized 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.000
 recoil can be enchanted on the second 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.950
 level it would become 12 levels that is 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.860
 I can still enchant myself 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.170
 I will not need much spoil for my sword 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.619
 but make it hot 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.200
 again we why when are we fascinated 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.689
 sharpen the heavenly crown already use 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.130
 cannot that is either sharpness either 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.859
 heavenly corr or the death of insects 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.039
 one thing I choose sharpness 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:02:00.130
 pumped to a whole level of 5 returns 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.750
 I pump the recoil automatically 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.170
 pumped up one level that is 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.500
 it is impossible to pump over further though plot 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.230
 fire is also possible only on level 1 and 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.030
 give then extraction also only 1 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.530
 level that is, we have completely updated 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:21.760
 our ball click on pin e and voila 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.920
 us super mega nagibatorsky sword true 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.860
 as you can see that we enchanted so much 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.160
 how could and enchanted as much as 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.980
 four items ie let's try 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.500
 our guns of death on anyone 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.909
 or on anything anyone here da damn 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.219
 skeleton 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:44.629
 og sure no let's not put up 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:48.409
 ap that is, we see that the sword is completely 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:50.980
 corrected works and basically on this 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.989
 and all but there is one so small 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.379
 cap for g tick if you 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.060
 put a pillar just give i even 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:01.670
 I'll show you where our table is just 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.650
 just a table here we just have a table 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.680
 enchantment we his you to him here and 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.650
 let's say why we want pants 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.159
 try but we fail 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.590
 know why 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.700
 and all because we do not have these here 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.239
 wonderful books 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.239
 that is, if we donâ€™t have these books 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.060
 here that we will not be fascinated then 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.250
 there is everything clear and understandable and on this 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.659
 basically everything if you liked the video 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.209
 then like if you want more 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:32.739
