00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
silenced carbines and that was a big

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.609 
silenced carbines and that was a big
deal<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.060> me<00:01:33.390> when<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.630> finally<00:01:33.990> discovered

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
deal for me when I finally discovered

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.530 
deal for me when I finally discovered
these<00:01:34.799> because<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.579> wasn't<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> huge<00:01:36.060> fan<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
these because I wasn't a huge fan of the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.060 
these because I wasn't a huge fan of the
silencer<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:36.960> battlefield<00:01:37.350> 3<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.680> took<00:01:37.890> me<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
silencer in battlefield 3 it took me a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.890 
silencer in battlefield 3 it took me a
while<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.369> get<00:01:38.670> adjusted<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.540> here<00:01:39.780> in

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
while to get adjusted to it here in

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.780 
while to get adjusted to it here in
battlefield<00:01:40.320> 4<00:01:40.350> but<00:01:41.189> once<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.430> learned<00:01:41.610> how<00:01:41.759> to

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
battlefield 4 but once I learned how to

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.670 
battlefield 4 but once I learned how to
use<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.420> worked<00:01:42.659> really<00:01:42.960> well<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.500> you

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
use it it worked really well and you

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.749 
use it it worked really well and you
know<00:01:43.799> some<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> weapons<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.549> thought

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
know some of the weapons I thought

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.450 
know some of the weapons I thought
worked<00:01:44.970> well<00:01:45.210> with<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.570> were<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.930> 8<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.320> 91<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
worked well with it were the 8 a 91 the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.800 
worked well with it were the 8 a 91 the
mtar<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.360> ak5c<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.710> sg553<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.880> acw-r<00:01:51.479> all

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
mtar the ak5c the sg553 the acw-r all

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.050 
mtar the ak5c the sg553 the acw-r all
those<00:01:52.259> worked<00:01:52.560> really<00:01:52.979> awesome<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
those worked really awesome but the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.190 
those worked really awesome but the
great<00:01:54.240> thing<00:01:54.270> about<00:01:54.540> those<00:01:54.930> being

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
great thing about those being

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.780 
great thing about those being
all-purpose<00:01:55.799> kits<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.460> could<00:01:56.610> use<00:01:56.759> a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
all-purpose kits is you could use a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.090 
all-purpose kits is you could use a
weapon<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.420> consider<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.079> par<00:01:58.560> with<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
weapon that I consider on par with the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.830 
weapon that I consider on par with the
assault<00:01:59.399> rifles<00:01:59.790> so<00:01:59.939> you're<00:02:00.060> not<00:02:00.210> going<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.659> be

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
assault rifles so you're not going to be

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.929 
assault rifles so you're not going to be
kind<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.560> crippled<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> engineer<00:02:02.759> kit

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
kind of crippled like the engineer kit

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.690 
kind of crippled like the engineer kit
was<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.299> felt<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:04.159> m4a1<00:02:05.159> was<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> little

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
was I felt like the m4a1 was a little

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.609 
was I felt like the m4a1 was a little
bit<00:02:05.790> weaker<00:02:06.180> than<00:02:06.210> like<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.689> m16<00:02:07.350> just

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
bit weaker than like the m16 just

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.169 
bit weaker than like the m16 just
because<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.979> damage<00:02:08.310> drop-off<00:02:08.670> happens<00:02:09.090> a

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
because the damage drop-off happens a

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.729 
because the damage drop-off happens a
little<00:02:09.300> bit<00:02:09.479> quicker<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.440> don't<00:02:10.619> have

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
little bit quicker so you don't have

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.080 
little bit quicker so you don't have
that<00:02:11.009> really<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.400> don't<00:02:11.640> think<00:02:11.879> with<00:02:12.000> the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
that really I don't think with the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.130 
that really I don't think with the
carbine<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.840> all

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
carbine the all

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.740 
carbine the all
purpose<00:02:13.470> weapons<00:02:13.860> here<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.100> battlefield<00:02:14.520> 4<00:02:14.750> so

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
purpose weapons here in battlefield 4 so

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.720 
purpose weapons here in battlefield 4 so
I've<00:02:15.870> said<00:02:16.050> myself<00:02:16.290> using<00:02:16.830> them<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.160> ton<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.520> felt

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
I've said myself using them a ton I felt

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.210 
I've said myself using them a ton I felt
like<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.240> where<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:19.170> sweet<00:02:19.470> spot<00:02:19.800> was

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
like this is where the sweet spot was

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.880 
like this is where the sweet spot was
for<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.730> game<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.450> really<00:02:22.230> did<00:02:22.410> enjoy<00:02:22.560> using

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
for the game so I really did enjoy using

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.290 
for the game so I really did enjoy using
these<00:02:23.100> on<00:02:23.250> all<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.550> different<00:02:23.700> kits<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.120> see

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
these on all the different kits you see

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.300 
these on all the different kits you see
me<00:02:24.420> running<00:02:24.569> support<00:02:25.110> here<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.560> had<00:02:26.040> three

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
me running support here I had three

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.070 
me running support here I had three
service<00:02:26.670> stars<00:02:26.880> with<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.120> support<00:02:27.750> for

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
service stars with the support for

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.960 
service stars with the support for
service<00:02:28.319> stars<00:02:28.650> with<00:02:28.800> assault<00:02:29.160> 3<00:02:29.640> service

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
service stars with assault 3 service

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.430 
service stars with assault 3 service
stars<00:02:30.150> with<00:02:30.300> recon<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.959> majority<00:02:31.320> of<00:02:31.350> the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
stars with recon and the majority of the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.290 
stars with recon and the majority of the
time<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.650> was<00:02:31.950> using<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.340> all-purpose<00:02:32.730> weapons

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
time I was using the all-purpose weapons

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.840 
time I was using the all-purpose weapons
like<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.630> carbine<00:02:33.990> so<00:02:34.320> simons<00:02:35.310> carbines<00:02:35.730> were

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
like the carbine so simons carbines were

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.070 
like the carbine so simons carbines were
the<00:02:36.000> way<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.150> go<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.690> could<00:02:36.870> probably

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
the way to go and I could probably

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.530 
the way to go and I could probably
replicate<00:02:37.770> this<00:02:37.980> game<00:02:38.250> you're<00:02:38.459> watching<00:02:38.940> 15

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
replicate this game you're watching 15

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.530 
replicate this game you're watching 15
different<00:02:39.870> times<00:02:40.110> with<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.370> ACR<00:02:41.820> or<00:02:42.270> like<00:02:42.510> I

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
different times with the ACR or like I

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.110 
different times with the ACR or like I
said<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.870> a91<00:02:43.319> silence<00:02:44.160> just<00:02:44.640> because<00:02:45.000> it

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
said the a91 silence just because it

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.580 
said the a91 silence just because it
doesn't<00:02:45.420> really<00:02:45.510> matter<00:02:45.810> what<00:02:46.080> weapon<00:02:46.470> you're

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
doesn't really matter what weapon you're

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.170 
doesn't really matter what weapon you're
using<00:02:46.800> it's<00:02:47.100> all<00:02:47.220> about<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.580> silencer<00:02:48.000> and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
using it's all about the silencer and

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.360 
using it's all about the silencer and
how<00:02:48.360> you<00:02:48.420> approach<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.140> maps<00:02:49.350> because<00:02:49.800> the

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
how you approach the maps because the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.949 
how you approach the maps because the
one<00:02:50.550> thing<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.820> learned<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.480> wanted<00:02:51.900> to

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
one thing I learned that I wanted to

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.680 
one thing I learned that I wanted to
really<00:02:52.769> for<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.730> guys<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.090> take<00:02:54.239> away<00:02:54.390> from

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
really for you guys that take away from

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.860 
really for you guys that take away from
this<00:02:54.810> video<00:02:55.110> was<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:55.890> for<00:02:56.100> whatever<00:02:56.310> reason

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
this video was that for whatever reason

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.770 
this video was that for whatever reason
in<00:02:57.870> Battlefield<00:02:58.470> 4<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:58.860> very<00:02:59.310> very<00:02:59.780> risky

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
in Battlefield 4 it is very very risky

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.080 
in Battlefield 4 it is very very risky
to<00:03:01.620> say<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.920> least<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.370> play<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.000> objective

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
to say the least to play the objective

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.690 
to say the least to play the objective

quite an adjustment for me to go from
battlefield<00:03:35.820> 3<00:03:36.090> where<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.329> felt<00:03:36.720> like<00:03:36.900> people

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
battlefield 3 where I felt like people

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.160 
battlefield 3 where I felt like people
were<00:03:37.440> generally<00:03:37.970> wanting<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.180> win<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.540> game<00:03:39.780> -

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
were generally wanting to win the game -

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.930 
were generally wanting to win the game -
like<00:03:40.380> battlefield<00:03:40.860> 4<00:03:41.010> where<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.280> often<00:03:41.790> feel

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
like battlefield 4 where I often feel

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.180 
like battlefield 4 where I often feel
like<00:03:42.090> my<00:03:42.209> team<00:03:42.269> is<00:03:42.540> just<00:03:42.630> apathetic<00:03:43.019> I<00:03:43.470> don't

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
like my team is just apathetic I don't

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.380 
like my team is just apathetic I don't
know<00:03:44.250> if<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:44.459> guys<00:03:44.640> have<00:03:44.790> experienced<00:03:45.329> the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
know if you guys have experienced the

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.550 
know if you guys have experienced the
same<00:03:45.570> thing<00:03:45.810> but<00:03:45.959> it's<00:03:46.110> almost<00:03:46.230> like<00:03:46.380> people

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
same thing but it's almost like people

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.479 
same thing but it's almost like people
just<00:03:46.829> don't<00:03:47.040> care

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
just don't care

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.180 
just don't care
so<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.480> silencer<00:03:48.870> helps<00:03:49.260> me<00:03:49.410> be<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.680> little<00:03:50.040> bit

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
so the silencer helps me be a little bit

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.759 
so the silencer helps me be a little bit
more<00:03:50.519> sneaky<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.690> helps<00:03:51.959> me<00:03:52.110> stay<00:03:52.350> off<00:03:52.590> the

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
more sneaky it helps me stay off the

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.590 
more sneaky it helps me stay off the
radar<00:03:53.100> I<00:03:53.160> know<00:03:53.400> that<00:03:53.850> there's<00:03:54.060> commanders

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
radar I know that there's commanders

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.600 
radar I know that there's commanders
that<00:03:54.780> will<00:03:54.900> oftentimes<00:03:55.260> pop<00:03:56.160> you<00:03:56.340> up<00:03:56.489> on

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
that will oftentimes pop you up on

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.910 
that will oftentimes pop you up on
radars<00:03:57.060> but<00:03:57.420> you<00:03:57.900> know<00:03:57.989> any<00:03:58.350> advantage<00:03:58.769> I<00:03:58.890> can

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
radars but you know any advantage I can

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.160 
radars but you know any advantage I can
get<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.489> will<00:03:59.640> take<00:03:59.880> and<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.209> suppressor<00:04:00.959> does

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
get I will take and the suppressor does

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.750 
get I will take and the suppressor does
give<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:01.500> a<00:04:01.530> slight<00:04:01.829> advantage<00:04:01.980> over<00:04:02.340> people

give you a slight advantage over people
and<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:02.910> helps<00:04:03.090> you<00:04:03.180> cap<00:04:03.390> flags<00:04:03.750> so<00:04:04.140> being

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
and it helps you cap flags so being

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
would argue it is the best because

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.140 
would argue it is the best because

say<00:04:33.270> that<00:04:33.479> oddly<00:04:34.110> because<00:04:34.409> I<00:04:34.530> don't<00:04:34.680> often<00:04:35.009> use

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
say that oddly because I don't often use

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.580 
say that oddly because I don't often use
the<00:04:35.699> LMGs<00:04:36.180> I<00:04:36.389> find<00:04:36.659> there's<00:04:36.900> only<00:04:36.960> really<00:04:37.440> two

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
the LMGs I find there's only really two

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.950 
the LMGs I find there's only really two
or<00:04:37.889> three<00:04:38.069> LMGs<00:04:38.490> that<00:04:38.639> I<00:04:38.699> really<00:04:39.060> like<00:04:39.270> but

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
or three LMGs that I really like but

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.839 
or three LMGs that I really like but
giving<00:04:40.319> ammo<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:40.740> people<00:04:41.159> is<00:04:41.370> pretty

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
giving ammo to people is pretty

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.309 
giving ammo to people is pretty
important<00:04:42.360> in<00:04:42.449> this<00:04:42.539> game<00:04:42.659> because<00:04:42.990> I've<00:04:43.110> run

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:43.319 
important in this game because I've run

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:45.469 
important in this game because I've run
out<00:04:43.349> of<00:04:43.470> ammo<00:04:43.830> all<00:04:44.009> a<00:04:44.069> frickin<00:04:44.669> time<00:04:44.879> I<00:04:45.150> don't

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
out of ammo all a frickin time I don't

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.089 
out of ammo all a frickin time I don't
know<00:04:45.569> what<00:04:45.720> it<00:04:45.810> is<00:04:45.930> but<00:04:46.110> I'm<00:04:46.229> always<00:04:46.500> asking<00:04:46.979> a

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
know what it is but I'm always asking a

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.159 
know what it is but I'm always asking a
support<00:04:47.430> player<00:04:47.580> for<00:04:47.819> ammo<00:04:48.120> so<00:04:48.360> I<00:04:48.569> know<00:04:48.870> that

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
support player for ammo so I know that

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.809 
support player for ammo so I know that
if<00:04:49.289> I'm<00:04:49.470> a<00:04:49.500> support<00:04:49.919> player<00:04:50.069> out<00:04:50.280> there<00:04:50.490> giving

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
if I'm a support player out there giving

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.520 
if I'm a support player out there giving
ammo<00:04:51.120> I'm<00:04:51.300> doing<00:04:51.629> the<00:04:51.720> opposite<00:04:52.169> of<00:04:52.259> what<00:04:52.500> I

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
ammo I'm doing the opposite of what I

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.990 
ammo I'm doing the opposite of what I
always<00:04:52.860> feel<00:04:53.069> like<00:04:53.099> where<00:04:53.490> there's<00:04:53.759> never

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
always feel like where there's never

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.700 
always feel like where there's never
enough<00:04:54.479> support<00:04:54.870> players<00:04:55.169> out<00:04:55.379> there<00:04:55.409> now<00:04:55.680> a

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
enough support players out there now a

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.529 
enough support players out there now a
lot<00:04:55.889> of<00:04:55.979> people<00:04:56.190> will<00:04:56.310> play<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.550> soul<00:04:56.849> I<00:04:57.090> would

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
lot of people will play a soul I would

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.240 
lot of people will play a soul I would
say<00:04:57.659> that's<00:04:57.840> probably<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.470> second<00:04:58.860> most<00:04:58.979> play

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
say that's probably the second most play

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.100 
say that's probably the second most play
class<00:04:59.580> but<00:05:00.150> it's<00:05:00.270> pretty<00:05:00.389> useless<00:05:00.840> in

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
class but it's pretty useless in

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.570 
class but it's pretty useless in
battlefield<00:05:01.500> 4<00:05:01.530> in<00:05:01.830> my<00:05:02.009> opinion<00:05:02.460> unless

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
battlefield 4 in my opinion unless

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.320 
battlefield 4 in my opinion unless
you're<00:05:02.940> playing<00:05:03.120> like<00:05:03.360> TDM<00:05:03.780> or<00:05:04.349> domination

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
you're playing like TDM or domination

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.760 
you're playing like TDM or domination
domination<00:05:06.330> I<00:05:06.569> usually<00:05:06.930> go<00:05:07.080> assault<00:05:07.530> or

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
domination I usually go assault or

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.610 
domination I usually go assault or
support<00:05:08.280> I<00:05:08.490> very<00:05:09.030> rarely<00:05:09.120> run<00:05:09.840> engineer<00:05:10.349> on

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
support I very rarely run engineer on

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.379 
support I very rarely run engineer on
denomination<00:05:11.490> just<00:05:11.699> because<00:05:11.909> it<00:05:12.030> just<00:05:12.180> it's

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
denomination just because it just it's

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.820 
denomination just because it just it's
kind<00:05:12.629> of<00:05:12.690> pointless<00:05:13.020> I<00:05:13.289> mean<00:05:13.440> there's<00:05:13.650> not

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
kind of pointless I mean there's not

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.439 
kind of pointless I mean there's not
really<00:05:13.979> any<00:05:14.190> vehicles<00:05:14.639> so<00:05:14.789> there's<00:05:14.940> no<00:05:15.090> reason

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
really any vehicles so there's no reason

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.350 
really any vehicles so there's no reason
for<00:05:15.479> ng<00:05:16.440> to<00:05:16.530> be<00:05:16.650> out<00:05:16.770> there<00:05:17.039> but<00:05:17.310> I<00:05:17.639> really

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
for ng to be out there but I really

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.360 
for ng to be out there but I really
think<00:05:18.479> the<00:05:18.659> engineer<00:05:19.319> class<00:05:19.440> is<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:20.009> best

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
think the engineer class is the best

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.670 
think the engineer class is the best
class<00:05:20.669> in<00:05:20.879> battlefield<00:05:21.330> 4<00:05:21.440> so<00:05:22.440> let<00:05:22.530> me<00:05:22.590> know

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
class in battlefield 4 so let me know

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.170 
class in battlefield 4 so let me know
what<00:05:22.770> you<00:05:22.889> guys<00:05:23.009> have<00:05:23.069> been<00:05:23.190> playing<00:05:23.520> far<00:05:24.030> as

what you guys have been playing far as

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.969 
what you guys have been playing far as
classes<00:05:24.719> cuz<00:05:24.870> I'm<00:05:24.990> curious<00:05:25.349> what<00:05:25.650> everyone

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
classes cuz I'm curious what everyone

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.619 
classes cuz I'm curious what everyone
seems<00:05:26.190> alike<00:05:26.520> I<00:05:26.639> still<00:05:26.849> see<00:05:27.000> a<00:05:27.030> lot<00:05:27.120> of<00:05:27.300> noobs

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.129 
could say engineer is the best kit in my
opinion<00:05:59.340> and<00:06:00.060> battlefield<00:06:00.479> 4<00:06:00.509> has<00:06:00.659> been<00:06:00.840> an

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
opinion and battlefield 4 has been an

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:02.480 
opinion and battlefield 4 has been an
up-and-down<00:06:01.379> experience<00:06:02.039> but<00:06:02.219> I'm<00:06:02.340> very

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
up-and-down experience but I'm very

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.550 
up-and-down experience but I'm very
positive<00:06:02.849> about<00:06:03.300> the<00:06:03.449> game<00:06:03.719> going<00:06:04.080> forward<00:06:04.469> I

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
positive about the game going forward I

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.740 
positive about the game going forward I
try<00:06:04.830> to<00:06:04.889> be<00:06:05.129> just<00:06:05.940> because<00:06:06.120> I<00:06:06.270> know<00:06:06.330> if<00:06:06.629> you're

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
try to be just because I know if you're

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.089 
try to be just because I know if you're
really<00:06:07.050> negative<00:06:07.500> about<00:06:07.620> the<00:06:07.770> game<00:06:07.919> usually

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
really negative about the game usually

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.040 
really negative about the game usually
it's<00:06:08.430> just<00:06:08.610> like<00:06:08.789> it's<00:06:09.120> not<00:06:09.210> fun<00:06:09.509> to<00:06:09.539> play<00:06:09.779> and

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
it's just like it's not fun to play and

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.930 
it's just like it's not fun to play and
I've<00:06:10.199> been<00:06:10.409> having<00:06:10.620> probably<00:06:11.460> five<00:06:11.759> or<00:06:11.789> six

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
I've been having probably five or six

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.700 
I've been having probably five or six
good<00:06:12.330> days<00:06:12.599> in<00:06:12.779> a<00:06:12.840> row<00:06:12.990> of<00:06:13.169> playing<00:06:13.379> the<00:06:13.500> game

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
good days in a row of playing the game

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.649 
good days in a row of playing the game
so<00:06:13.740> hopefully<00:06:14.610> that's<00:06:14.940> that's<00:06:15.210> a<00:06:15.270> good<00:06:15.449> sign

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
so hopefully that's that's a good sign

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:16.610 
so hopefully that's that's a good sign
