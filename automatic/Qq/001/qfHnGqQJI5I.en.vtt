00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:03.550
 for our classic Pina Colada we need 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.550
 Pineapple juice 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.389
 orange juice 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:09.929
 and coconut cream 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.969
 yes, there are in every one as he pushed in poses 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.289
 Be aware that Mirko Culic is worried about eating coconut milk 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.449
 Unsweetened focus must be sweetened cream we need the healthiest 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.999
 Making it a little bit in a water bath makes it wonderful to shake up 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.769
 You have a nice Stans to work with 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.769
 Of course, then we need something very important 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.000
 it can do that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 mainly to the group 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.780
 you can use punches in three lines at home 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.830
 or one has a post Schefke portrayed Boston Chicago 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.800
 from two parts 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.130
 we fill that with 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.190
 it's all over 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.190
 and we're going with the coconut cream now 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.680
 in weir 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.050
 three parts 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.340
 Prokop get started 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.250
 the little syringe 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.550
 and juice 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.200
 makes the whole thing fruity 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.240
 and ours 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.660
 Pineapple juice then tightens 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.160
 four parts 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.330
 and then 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.580
 a particularly Karnn rummst also number four parts 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.130
 close 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.800
 the whole will be 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.800
 strong 20 seconds 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.450
 I add that in addition, Lars dismissed the Simon Johnson 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.910
 with a little bit of Warstein 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.110
 my base EB helps me the suffering 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.680
 that women light 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.800
 absolute 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.800
 7 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.000
 as needed 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.070
 Victory with Richter 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.140
 simply a retirement 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.490
 or 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.160
 there can also be nice but what use Blatter 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.950
 the cocktail Krischel 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.420
 finished 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.320
 it's ours 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.910
 Pina Colada
