00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.489 
you only have three it's sort of like it
just<00:05:52.099> kind<00:05:52.339> of<00:05:52.399> like<00:05:52.579> moves<00:05:52.909> for<00:05:53.329> you<00:05:53.539> it's

that's<00:06:08.520> how<00:06:08.760> I<00:06:08.790> put<00:06:09.000> for<00:06:09.710> its<00:06:10.710> way<00:06:10.860> better

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
that's how I put for its way better

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:18.500 
that's how I put for its way better
before<00:06:11.430> oh<00:06:15.650> yeah<00:06:16.650> I<00:06:16.980> read<00:06:17.340> just<00:06:17.970> you<00:06:18.150> can<00:06:18.300> sort

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
before oh yeah I read just you can sort

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.390 
before oh yeah I read just you can sort
of<00:06:18.630> like<00:06:18.750> a<00:06:18.780> random<00:06:19.020> wall<00:06:19.410> did<00:06:19.920> the<00:06:20.040> year<00:06:20.220> level

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
of like a random wall did the year level

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.170 
of like a random wall did the year level
to<00:06:20.640> do<00:06:21.110> just<00:06:22.110> going<00:06:22.620> to<00:06:22.680> put<00:06:22.860> it<00:06:23.070> around<00:06:23.340> random

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.010 

this<00:06:27.180> is<00:06:27.330> this<00:06:28.110> looks<00:06:28.380> a<00:06:28.470> little<00:06:28.620> better<00:06:30.020> like

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
this is this looks a little better like

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.200 
this is this looks a little better like
this<00:06:31.350> so<00:06:31.890> let's<00:06:32.100> look<00:06:32.220> like<00:06:32.490> a<00:06:32.520> window<00:06:32.940> to<00:06:33.000> look

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
this so let's look like a window to look

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.660 
this so let's look like a window to look
through<00:06:33.510> whatever<00:06:34.320> it's<00:06:35.160> really<00:06:35.520> about

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.670 
through whatever it's really about

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.640 
through whatever it's really about
focusing<00:06:36.330> really<00:06:36.570> on<00:06:36.750> the<00:06:36.960> thing<00:06:37.230> it's<00:06:37.560> just

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
focusing really on the thing it's just

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.650 
focusing really on the thing it's just
the<00:06:37.890> fact<00:06:38.190> that<00:06:38.580> this<00:06:39.120> kind<00:06:39.360> of<00:06:39.450> looks<00:06:39.630> like

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
the fact that this kind of looks like

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.680 
the fact that this kind of looks like
the<00:06:39.870> twilight<00:06:40.080> I<00:06:40.700> just<00:06:41.700> a<00:06:41.820> custom-made<00:06:42.270> ship

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
the twilight I just a custom-made ship

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.200 
the twilight I just a custom-made ship
so<00:06:42.990> see<00:06:43.950> it<00:06:44.250> looks<00:06:44.550> like<00:06:44.730> hitting<00:06:45.030> from<00:06:45.150> the

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
so see it looks like hitting from the

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.760 
so see it looks like hitting from the
back<00:06:46.580> and<00:06:47.580> then<00:06:47.790> you<00:06:47.940> can<00:06:48.150> so<00:06:49.110> it<00:06:49.140> starts<00:06:49.620> out

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
back and then you can so it starts out

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.720 
back and then you can so it starts out
like<00:06:49.980> this<00:06:50.390> flies<00:06:51.390> out<00:06:51.720> terms<00:06:52.320> like<00:06:52.470> that<00:06:52.980> and

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:53.730 
like this flies out terms like that and

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.240 
like this flies out terms like that and
it's<00:06:54.180> just<00:06:54.390> like<00:06:54.800> probably<00:06:55.800> using<00:06:56.040> it<00:06:56.130> from

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
it's just like probably using it from

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:01.400 
it's just like probably using it from
this<00:06:56.550> side<00:06:56.690> just<00:06:57.690> like<00:06:57.840> fly<00:06:58.200> cool<00:07:00.050> yeah<00:07:01.050> let<00:07:01.380> it

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:01.410 
this side just like fly cool yeah let it

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:10.460 
this side just like fly cool yeah let it
lags<00:07:01.920> a<00:07:04.370> bit<00:07:06.380> here<00:07:07.380> is<00:07:07.530> here<00:07:07.770> I<00:07:09.110> use<00:07:10.110> a<00:07:10.140> mascara

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:10.470 
lags a bit here is here I use a mascara

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.740 
lags a bit here is here I use a mascara
so<00:07:11.100> we<00:07:11.310> change<00:07:11.550> that<00:07:11.850> but<00:07:12.000> I'm<00:07:12.150> hoping<00:07:12.450> for<00:07:12.690> a

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
so we change that but I'm hoping for a

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.650 
so we change that but I'm hoping for a
