this<00:00:00.240> target<00:00:00.570> was<00:00:00.690> working<00:00:01.020> all<00:00:01.230> right<00:00:01.290> for

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
this target was working all right for

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.889 
this target was working all right for
when<00:00:02.040> I<00:00:02.070> was<00:00:02.220> no<00:00:02.429> spin<00:00:02.760> throwing<00:00:03.179> with<00:00:03.449> 10-inch

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
when I was no spin throwing with 10-inch

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.720 
when I was no spin throwing with 10-inch
knives<00:00:04.140> all<00:00:04.529> I<00:00:04.560> did<00:00:04.799> was<00:00:05.009> use<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.220> little<00:00:05.460> hammer

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
knives all I did was use a little hammer

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.059 
knives all I did was use a little hammer
to<00:00:06.120> knock<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.509> blocks<00:00:06.779> back<00:00:07.080> in<00:00:07.259> place<00:00:07.500> and<00:00:07.859> I

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
to knock the blocks back in place and I

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.680 
to knock the blocks back in place and I
thought<00:00:08.280> well<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:08.790> need<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.059> try<00:00:09.269> these<00:00:09.330> with

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
thought well I need to try these with

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.870 
thought well I need to try these with
spin<00:00:10.050> throws<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.590> see<00:00:10.710> how<00:00:10.860> it<00:00:10.980> works<00:00:11.219> so

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
spin throws and see how it works so

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.209 
spin throws and see how it works so
first<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.330> tried<00:00:12.570> spin<00:00:12.900> throwing<00:00:13.290> some<00:00:13.740> seven

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
first I tried spin throwing some seven

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.250 
first I tried spin throwing some seven
ounce<00:00:14.400> knives<00:00:17.330> then<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.449> tried<00:00:18.720> 10<00:00:19.050> ounce

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
ounce knives then I tried 10 ounce

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.500 
ounce knives then I tried 10 ounce
knives<00:00:21.619> and<00:00:22.619> then<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.430> finally<00:00:23.760> tried<00:00:24.029> some

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
knives and then I finally tried some

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.529 
knives and then I finally tried some
heavy<00:00:25.080> knives<00:00:25.439> 18<00:00:26.039> ounces<00:00:26.400> each<00:00:26.580> over<00:00:26.970> pounds

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
heavy knives 18 ounces each over pounds

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.200 
heavy knives 18 ounces each over pounds
and<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:28.349> just<00:00:28.590> destroyed<00:00:28.980> my<00:00:29.220> target<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.179> I

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
and it just destroyed my target so I

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.730 
and it just destroyed my target so I
thought<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.570> need<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.869> go<00:00:30.990> back<00:00:31.170> watch<00:00:31.470> that

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
thought I need to go back watch that

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.459 
thought I need to go back watch that
YouTube<00:00:32.130> video<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.210> Russian<00:00:33.719> target<00:00:34.140> it

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
YouTube video with the Russian target it

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.020 
YouTube video with the Russian target it
looked<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:34.950> everything<00:00:35.430> was<00:00:35.579> held<00:00:35.880> together

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
looked like everything was held together

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.660 
looked like everything was held together
with<00:00:36.270> wood<00:00:37.140> glue<00:00:37.410> my<00:00:37.710> husband<00:00:38.070> says<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.550> works

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
with wood glue my husband says it works

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.000 
with wood glue my husband says it works
like<00:00:38.969> magic<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:39.690> cement<00:00:40.170> for<00:00:40.410> wood<00:00:40.649> it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
like magic it's like cement for wood it

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.340 
like magic it's like cement for wood it
would<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.640> really<00:00:41.940> strong<00:00:42.180> once<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.870> grew<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.200> in

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
would be really strong once I grew it in

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.619 
would be really strong once I grew it in
so<00:00:43.739> let<00:00:44.340> me<00:00:44.430> take<00:00:44.610> his<00:00:44.760> word<00:00:44.910> for<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:45.510> it

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
so let me take his word for it and if it

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.450 
so let me take his word for it and if it
doesn't<00:00:45.989> work<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.320> could<00:00:46.530> always<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.739> nail<00:00:47.309> in

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
doesn't work I could always just nail in

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.760 
doesn't work I could always just nail in
a<00:00:47.550> backboard<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.239> make<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.899> easier<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.350> me<00:00:49.649> to

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
a backboard to make it easier for me to

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.069 
a backboard to make it easier for me to
attach<00:00:50.010> my<00:00:50.250> target<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.820> my<00:00:50.940> stand<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.480> first

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
attach my target to my stand I first

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.869 
attach my target to my stand I first
attached<00:00:52.410> hose<00:00:52.710> clamps<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.340> both<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
attached hose clamps to both of the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.389 
attached hose clamps to both of the
threaded<00:00:54.149> rods<00:00:54.480> then<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.739> would<00:00:56.039> glue<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
threaded rods then I would glue the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.500 
threaded rods then I would glue the
blocks<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.850> one<00:00:57.000> another

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
blocks to one another

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.299 
blocks to one another
I<00:00:57.539> didn't<00:00:58.079> wood<00:00:58.230> glue<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.559> blocks<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.070> two

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
I didn't wood glue the blocks to the two

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.130 
I didn't wood glue the blocks to the two
by<00:00:59.489> fours<00:00:59.789> because<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.390> wanted<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.780> able<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
by fours because I wanted to be able to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.529 
by fours because I wanted to be able to
reuse<00:01:01.559> these<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:02.070> also<00:01:02.640> make<00:01:03.000> sure<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.359> any

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
reuse these I also make sure that any

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.149 
reuse these I also make sure that any
blocks<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.019> had<00:01:04.199> knots<00:01:04.439> in<00:01:04.650> them<00:01:04.799> were<00:01:05.010> on

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
blocks that had knots in them were on

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.890 
blocks that had knots in them were on
the<00:01:05.309> ends<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.729> target<00:01:06.150> rather<00:01:06.479> than<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the ends of the target rather than the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.690 
the ends of the target rather than the
middle<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.320> fellow<00:01:07.830> knife<00:01:08.070> thrower<00:01:08.369> from

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
middle a fellow knife thrower from

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.280 
middle a fellow knife thrower from
Russia<00:01:08.909> told<00:01:09.420> me<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.780> end<00:01:09.990> grain

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
Russia told me that the end grain

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.160 
Russia told me that the end grain
targets<00:01:10.799> there<00:01:11.100> are<00:01:11.430> not<00:01:11.760> wood<00:01:12.150> glued<00:01:12.450> you're

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
targets there are not wood glued you're

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.499 
targets there are not wood glued you're
a<00:01:13.200> botha<00:01:13.710> target<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.189> see<00:01:14.369> here<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.909> he<00:01:15.330> said

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
a botha target you see here and he said

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.330 
a botha target you see here and he said
that<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.689> blocks<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:16.140> large<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.590> heavy<00:01:16.770> they

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that the blocks are large and heavy they

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.100 
that the blocks are large and heavy they
won't<00:01:17.549> move<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.150> there's<00:01:18.330> no<00:01:18.600> need<00:01:18.869> for<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
won't move so there's no need for a

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.560 
won't move so there's no need for a
backboard<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:19.860> if<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.820> blocks<00:01:21.060> are<00:01:21.240> small

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
backboard but if the blocks are small

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.440 
backboard but if the blocks are small
then<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.140> backboard<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.710> used<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.400> addition<00:01:24.150> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
then a backboard is used in addition to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.020 
then a backboard is used in addition to
further<00:01:24.930> tighten<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.530> frame<00:01:25.860> Yuri<00:01:26.340> uses<00:01:26.880> an

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
further tighten the frame Yuri uses an

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.149 
further tighten the frame Yuri uses an
upper<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.659> bottom<00:01:27.689> plane<00:01:28.290> connects<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.920> rods

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
upper and bottom plane connects the rods

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.670 
upper and bottom plane connects the rods
these<00:01:29.909> planks<00:01:30.299> are<00:01:30.570> slightly<00:01:31.079> shorter<00:01:31.500> than

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
these planks are slightly shorter than

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.679 
these planks are slightly shorter than
the<00:01:31.799> width<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.220> target<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.850> doesn't<00:01:33.540> need<00:01:33.630> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the width the target and doesn't need to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.770 
the width the target and doesn't need to
be<00:01:33.840> fastened<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.579> lastly<00:01:35.579> Yuri<00:01:36.210> told<00:01:36.540> me<00:01:36.630> that

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
be fastened and lastly Yuri told me that

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.300 
be fastened and lastly Yuri told me that
in<00:01:36.960> order<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.259> get<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> blocks<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.009> broom

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
in order to get the blocks to broom

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.670 
in order to get the blocks to broom
rather<00:01:38.850> than<00:01:39.060> split<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:40.049> must<00:01:40.290> soak<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
rather than split one must soak the
