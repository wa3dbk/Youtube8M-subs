00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello hello there I am again 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.390
 Wanted and again the evening the fence of LT of tanks and 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.099
 today will be a small such 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.870
 relaxing fight on all of you already 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.740
 probably the famous Fri-Sau level 5 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.020
 America t49 that can be briefly said 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.690
 about this machine medium tank with good 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.490
 fast gun but like any 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.769
 medium tank he has no armor at all 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.720
 no millimeter by the way has 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.390
 the value of what is t-34 is that for z 3 4 what are you 49 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.329
 they do not have armor equally 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.550
 so absolutely no difference with 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.170
 average tanks she probably does not have but 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.399
 she has much better gun 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.829
 than medium tanks and that's why 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.180
 I like this machine very much while I am 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.370
 pass very well 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.370
 I have on them kolobanov the truth of it 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.600
 show it is not interesting there was such 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.399
 the midnight fight is perfect 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.070
 where I took the base against eight 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.320
 opponents remaining they just don't 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.829
 deigned to return base which base 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.469
 base 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.140
 only to be run wow and weaklings but 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.210
 no matter we got on not very pleasant 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.670
 map for pt but pretty normal 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.560
 map for the average tank in which we 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.600
 Today we will play this Himmelsdorf 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.130
 as you have long noticed first I 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.380
 trying to take some position here 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.110
 to amuse but it comes to me quickly 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.250
 that this is not the best idea also i 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.670
 see about 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.520
 alignment of enemy forces and 20 flew to 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.009
 end of the street died as it should 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.500
 decent a-20 die in the first minute 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.119
 I understand that there is a middle ground 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.259
 tank and you most likely no one else 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.990
 will go because everyone else 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.009
 somewhere around corners here with us 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.240
 gradually ours are given but nonetheless 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.430
 bout i already said relaxing 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.200
 so it will be pretty simple so I 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.520
 even very surprised when I got 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.930
 for him the master because it seemed to me 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.990
 that nothing at all did this fight 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.640
 especially well ok e34 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.960
 he by the way he does not hold most likely 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.570
 does not see only he does not try for us 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.250
 shoot we punch him every 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.439
 shot fortunately why you can even 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.750
 not always shoot in sniper scope 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.980
 because 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.960
 This gun has very good information 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.020
 The accuracy is excellent and in general the machine 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.330
 very good this is one of those pro machines 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.250
 who can be said to bend them 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.620
 skillful hands but since not skillful hands 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.540
 us 95 percent then no one ever 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.680
 will nerf because what does 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.110
 alyoshka on her he will try 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.570
 tank it will go there for a long time 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.310
 come down to stand under fire in such 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.320
 situations this car dies extremely 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.420
 fast yes she is very fast 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.050
 Naturally Alyosha will want me true 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.900
 also alexey but i'm not alyoshka poleshko 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.420
 words deer then too or Oleg but okay 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.060
 no matter b1 here one suddenly 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.920
 turns out to be so dangerous 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.959
 the adversary that punches us with those not 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.940
 less every shot we're still a coffin 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.160
 rolls out the coffin need even with her three 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.600
 put it here destroy destroy 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.880
 destroy but by rate of fire I 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.280
 shoots there that t49 which 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.750
 trying to get to me but I'm on time 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.820
 go to the adjacent street that I wanted 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.610
 to say but never mind 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.160
 shine on this machine probably 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.320
 so they have everything to be great 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.269
 sent but did the tower slowly 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.400
 rotates but really god 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.870
 how it is when not installed and so 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.640
 and how we see our team the same way 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.769
 not bad to win opponents took 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.680
 slide but as usual it is nothing to them 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.110
 Dala brilliant broken through here 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.700
 t49 which has a full HP in contrast to 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.269
 me and therefore it is very important to give it became 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.840
 the first to support me is our average 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:36.940
 collect 34 tons-but no, he thought better of it here would 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.980
 for 4 rides I think that together 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.769
 can can t49 destroy she was 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.230
 somewhere in the yard but here she is for some reason 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.760
 looked in an incomprehensible side first 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.739
 shot fails and give for 4 but in general 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.600
 sets on fire and then I do not understand how 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.310
 at all 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.739
 shot and take 4 frags from me 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.380
 1100 damage but I didnâ€™t notice how they were 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.000
 filled as i said it was a fight just 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.400
 so relaxed last battle for 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.300
 evening he passed there late late 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.980
 late 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.220
 if there is a time in the replay 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.600
 when i record video they are that time 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.500
 when I played it I must be somewhere 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.780
 one o'clock was here and here we all get up 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.060
 base score 10:06 and now the simplest 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.650
 just brothers shoot at opponents 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.630
 who are trying to knock down the grip 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.420
 it's very simple and I don't see it 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.550
 no problem the more tanks vk 3001 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.590
 h bones they platoon yes they platoon 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.660
 they have no chance about what they have 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.240
 no booking they are quite long 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.380
 comes down and here suddenly suddenly us 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.250
 base covenanter 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.230
 I'll ask t-34 but answer you back but 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.660
 will be second to the base to capture to 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.430
 faster time because while you them 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.160
 shoot down go maybe this 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.230
 covenanter everyone else there and destroy 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.130
 Well it does not matter guessed still stand 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:54.590
 my allies on the capture of my 1300 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.330
 damage is a very small figure i'm still 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.370
 I repeat again and almost did nothing 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.730
 the bones of something here even captured from the base 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:04.130
 Well, here's another thousand 400 damage God 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.510
 What is the figure of a thousand 400 damage? 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.480
 Generally some kind of garbage especially for 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.460
 Fri-Sau Yes, I do not have time for T34 to shoot and 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.100
 pick a warrior yourself but nonetheless 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.050
 this will be got masters of God what 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.360
 same crayfish they play on such 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.280
 wonderful cars 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.070
 master's bar is so low but in any 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.110
 what kind of case will you see in 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.860
 the outcome of the battle which by tradition I will show 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.010
 in the end 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.510
 and now I say goodbye to you on this 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.970

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.590
