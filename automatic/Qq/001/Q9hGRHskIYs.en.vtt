00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.050 

so<00:02:13.440> after<00:02:13.560> listening<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.430> kind<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.820> stuff

so after listening to that kind of stuff
for<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.240> little<00:02:15.330> while<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.720> gotta<00:02:16.050> balance<00:02:16.350> it

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
for a little while I gotta balance it

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:34.130 
for a little while I gotta balance it
out<00:02:16.860> with<00:02:17.180> something<00:02:18.180> more<00:02:18.420> like<00:02:18.660> this

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.920 

and<00:02:35.140> then<00:02:35.530> sometimes<00:02:36.569> something<00:02:37.569> more

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
and then sometimes something more

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:53.790 
and then sometimes something more
contemplative<00:02:39.030> like<00:02:40.030> this

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.010 

and<00:02:54.160> then<00:02:54.490> inevitably<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:55.240> work<00:02:55.570> your<00:02:55.780> way

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
and then inevitably you work your way

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.650 
and then inevitably you work your way
back<00:02:56.440> around<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.940> get<00:02:58.870> up<00:02:58.990> but<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.530> think<00:03:00.660> you

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
back around to get up but I think you

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.010 
back around to get up but I think you
better<00:03:01.960> get<00:03:02.950> up<00:03:02.980> off<00:03:03.340> that<00:03:03.520> thing<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.690> dance

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
better get up off that thing and dance

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:14.250 
better get up off that thing and dance
to<00:03:05.170> things<00:03:05.830> not<00:03:06.010> get<00:03:07.000> up<00:03:10.080> get<00:03:11.080> up<00:03:11.110> oh<00:03:13.020> and<00:03:14.020> then

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
to things not get up get up oh and then

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.520 
to things not get up get up oh and then
finally<00:03:14.860> you<00:03:15.240> know<00:03:16.240> you<00:03:16.750> gotta<00:03:16.990> like<00:03:17.230> ease

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
finally you know you gotta like ease

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:33.699 
finally you know you gotta like ease
back<00:03:17.800> into<00:03:17.860> something<00:03:18.640> like<00:03:18.850> a<00:03:18.910> deals

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.380 

and<00:03:34.709> then<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:35.100> know<00:03:35.130> sometimes<00:03:36.060> there's

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
and then you know sometimes there's

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.880 
and then you know sometimes there's
really<00:03:36.510> only<00:03:36.630> one<00:03:36.840> word<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.290> describe<00:03:37.319> how<00:03:37.830> you

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890
