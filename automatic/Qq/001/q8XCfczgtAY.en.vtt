and contract them as up as possible the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.380 
and contract them as up as possible the
thing<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.710> main<00:01:31.920> important<00:01:32.579> point<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.060> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
thing the main important point is to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.240 
thing the main important point is to
contract<00:01:33.990> your<00:01:34.110> calf<00:01:34.560> muscle<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
contract your calf muscle you the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.450 
contract your calf muscle you the
maximum<00:01:35.509> another<00:01:36.509> fine<00:01:36.840> tuning

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
maximum another fine tuning

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.310 
maximum another fine tuning
this<00:01:37.880> muscle<00:01:38.210> is<00:01:38.330> that<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:38.570> can<00:01:38.750> slightly

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
this muscle is that you can slightly

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.039 
this muscle is that you can slightly
bend<00:01:39.860> your<00:01:40.040> knees<00:01:40.250> from<00:01:40.520> them<00:01:40.760> from<00:01:41.390> here<00:01:41.570> and

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
bend your knees from them from here and

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.170 
bend your knees from them from here and
then<00:01:42.290> go<00:01:42.320> from<00:01:42.650> this<00:01:42.950> puts<00:01:43.250> an<00:01:43.430> extra<00:01:43.640> stress

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
then go from this puts an extra stress

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.540 
then go from this puts an extra stress
of<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.450> calf<00:01:44.659> muscles<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.800> better<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.340> calf

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
of the calf muscles the better the calf

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.609 
of the calf muscles the better the calf
muscle<00:01:47.000> then<00:01:47.270> it<00:01:47.630> looks<00:01:47.869> better<00:01:48.080> on<00:01:48.260> the<00:01:48.440> range

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
muscle then it looks better on the range

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.539 
muscle then it looks better on the range
shots<00:01:48.890> so<00:01:49.670> guys<00:01:49.900> put<00:01:50.900> it<00:01:51.080> hard<00:01:51.350> take<00:01:52.040> him<00:01:52.280> waves

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
shots so guys put it hard take him waves
