 kassel huskies with the lions frankfurt 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.610
 so far this season progressed keep both 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.710
 teams already thrice together 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.699
 but always with the better end for 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.010
 jason jaspers sets off like the fire department 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.380
 Metzinger turned the first attack 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.010
 of the game equal to the much acclaimed 1 0 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.010

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.360
 Berlin the lions one by one fast 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.460
 Norman's answer is above all 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.649
 martens and clarke broad cross 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.710

 wall left christian her master in 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.309
 This phase survived the huskies 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.220
 Despite several good chances in Frankfurt 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.570
 two under-pay games hardly damaged 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.239
 The second punishment was over 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.920
 fake east and west in the castle 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.089

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.550
 Stopped were just out of the cottage 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.110
 but also of it could be in 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.210
 This time of the game is strong 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.990
 table leader of the upper league west not 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.970
 stop 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.979
 an accidental attack of the husky 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.560
 use the lions in the 15 minute game 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.720
 to a quick 3 on two counter 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.030
 nico oprée with a shot through the 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.750
 saver from kai kristian to 2 1 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.000

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.670
 With this score, there were five 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.869
 minutes later in the break 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.610
 and like the huskies in the first passage 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.710
 The lions were born in the 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.869
 second section was going on for 18 seconds 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.110
 played as may likes to look out of the 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.780
 groan before christian to 2 2 balance 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.060
 everything was open again and the huskies 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.280
 stayed in the game but missed 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.380
 a shooting in the 24 minute game 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.660
 the new leader of the kassel 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.369
 huskies just and straight as the 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.890
 huskies had found back into play 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.300
 hit again with one 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.119
 unhappy back from the gang 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.459
 bouncing slice chicoree norman 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.709
 martens also the journey of christian 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.780
 First get out and then the disc 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:06.009
 the net let in the consequence 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.149
 Both teams neutralized each other 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.250
 to see 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.569
 rarely had björn linda or 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.569
 christian you can show 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.330
 that a goalkeeper brought mistakes to Linders 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.550
 the huskies back to the shop 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.320
 with a clear view , he pointed a tight 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.360
 shot of tobias schwab over the 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.640
 catching hand and was thus 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.500
 co-responsible to drive to three 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.950
 but the joy of the huskies only lasted 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.930
 short 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.210
 in excess, falsified richard müllerin 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.920
 shot by marc schaub untenable and 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.960
 thus provided for about four minutes 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.270
 third parties for the re-leadership of the 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.190
 Lions in the final section remained both 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.990
 set to music by fast-casting teams 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.700
 but because the frankfurter from then on 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.680
 error time in your own rows 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.180
 minimized the chances disappeared 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.700
 balancing the huskies with everyone 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.380
 passed minute in the 58 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.900
 minute after boss husky jürgen 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.030
 rumrich christian for a 46 again 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.680
 from the ice but that too should be at the exit 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.900
 the game will not change anything 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.760
 the best chance of another goal 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.220
 awarded landon gare of the alleingang 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.480
 The huskies failed at the empty gate 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.050
