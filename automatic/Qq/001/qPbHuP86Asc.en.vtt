00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.649
Hello It's Subin here. 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:09.900
Today I'm going to show you how I cleanse and what I use for my skin care.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.690
Then, let's get started!

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.010
First of all, I'm going to use a deep cleasning oil that takes off even heavy make up.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.230
I use 3 to 4 pumps and massage it all over my face for 30 seconds

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.740
This is my third or fourth bottle since I love it very much.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.789
It removes white and black heads and really deep cleanses your pore with Mugwort Extract

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.550
It's really gentle so it doesn't irritate my eyes 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.550
It's really gentle so it doesn't irritate my eyes 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.400
I'm going to wash my face after I melt down all the make up (it shouldn't take more than 1minute)

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.640
After I wash my face, I use this detox soap that not only whitens my skin but also exfoliates  

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:03.649
After I wash my face, I use this detox soap that not only whitens my skin but also exfoliates  

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.050
I massage directly on my face with the soap, and carefully massage around my nose and chin where I get more oily.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.750
I massage directly on my face with the soap, and carefully massage around my nose and chin where I get more oily.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.750
And for the jar line, I massage from bottom to up so that I can get lifting effect

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.410
Then, I make some bubble with the soap and massage. 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.140
This detox soap is made of organic ingredients but makes great bubble.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.440
Use this soft bubble, I massage all over my face

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.600
During the massage your skin may get irritated or itchy.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.990
But that's one of the detox process on your skin.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.250
It will go way as you use the soap. 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.930
I always get itchy around my nose and jar line. 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.930

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.810
After I finish massaging with the bubble, I wait about a minute to detox.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.769
My skin gets itchy the most at this time. 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.799
I consider this itchiness as a part of the detox and just bear with it. 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:20.489
After a minute, I will wash my face with cool water.

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.180
If you want to get extreme result, do this whole process one more time. 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.579
If you want to get extreme result, do this whole process one more time. 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.200
After I wash my face, I use this cleansing water as my toner.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.980
I put some of the product on a cotton pad and wipe off my face. 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.909
This process not only makes the skin smooth 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:51.170
but also removes makeup residual

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.170
Pat pat pat

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:06.189
Then, I apply this daily renewal fluid 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.260
it gradually exfoliates the skin texture to reduce pores and regain a smooth and clear complexion

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.239
I use about 6 drops of this facial oil that is good for all skin type.

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:27.069
Rup it beween your hands and apply it like this.

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.549
This oil has really light formula, so you skin will absorb it right after you apply.

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:38.549

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.680
Then, I apply this light moisturing cream that is for complex skin type.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.040
It really moisturizes my skin well. 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.040
Pat Pat Pat until your skin absorbs all the product.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.900
And I apply this cream that is intense soothing care for sensitive skin

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.090
This cream is really good when I have itchy skin

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.989
I don't use it everyday but when I feel like my skin is sensitive

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.819
I don't use it everyday but when I feel like my skin is sensitive

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:27.910
Pat Pat Pat

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.910

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.910

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.910

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.910

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.910

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:38.760
For the last step, I put some lip balm. 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.410
Then, my skin care routine is finished!

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.129
No one has perfect skin, but we can always try ! and it will get better sooner or later. let's not give up! 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.350
