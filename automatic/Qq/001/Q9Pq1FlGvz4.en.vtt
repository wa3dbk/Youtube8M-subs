 dj 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.170
 Hello everyone can see the oricon style 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.090
 My relationship is mine 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.070
 I am the previous film 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.110
 I saw it for the first time a 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.880
 Very real Day 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.880
 Scared you look at one person 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:33.029
 Do you think that it is net in support town 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.029
 I say so much apart from myself 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.810
 I have a very good head at the government office 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.280
 Let's go to work logically 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.130
 Or I think 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.640
 Kana was minus one step things 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:54.280
 Say that look analytically this 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:58.940
 And I don't think it's too fancy even in such a situation where the aoni was over 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:01.020
 Workers say word is unexpected sunny but is cans 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.770
 I think I will cry 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.070
 If there is a y 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.900
 I 'm not afraid I'm hiding 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:13.159
 It is somehow somehow line 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.579
 I'm not doing my best, but I'll use it in conflict 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.579
 People 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:25.810
 Since it is democratically put you, is not it or Nen 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.390
 I do not want to believe the members of the water Polo Yankees 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.960
 For rice 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.480
 Yeah Toka and go 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.740
 I still keep in touch with you 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:42.399
 It is not limited immediately 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:45.480
 Portion of the jaw that eats sashimi 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:49.320
 I did not eat there Wow 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.310
 I think that recently has come to something also to eat 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.270
 re 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.760
 Want to produce 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.880
 But if 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.960
 Kind of feeling does 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.710
 If there is a gap that is not zero 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.640
 It's a Kasako who wants to poke in. I have no chance to talk so much. 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.640
 Hmmm 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:16.040
 I just want to be away from myself 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.489
 I like cooking before but 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.489
 not really 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.350
 Does it recently had less less opportunity to make 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:29.430
 A little beg for more 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.300
 Full made even actively Chinese and at the end Kedo' 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.770
 Hmmm 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.630
 Well tofu and kaon 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.530
 Sweet and sour pork and money do not be made in the southern part 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.910
 I want to eat 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.550
 now 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.550
 I can only do what I can do now 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.550
 Hmm 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:56.230
 I'm a good student but in real life yeah 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.840
 Or it is now mound or Mai 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.110
 Even after becoming another adult 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.200
 To be 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.200
 It is it 's such a good or a postponed 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:12.950
 Well, it is the business of that child 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.900
 Well Kedomo it's a movie based on it if there is a game of Aomori in the original 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.440
 Character 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.310
 Same feelings in the same 2 races 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:26.280
 this 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:28.180
 It turns blue, and a character called Fatty that appears for the first time this time comes out 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.770
 Here 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:35.480
 Run around 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:38.770
 It's like playing a game or a sense of traction. 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.200
 I think it has become a movie, so by all means 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.879
 To the cinema 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.879
