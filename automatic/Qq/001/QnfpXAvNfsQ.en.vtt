00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.130
 be Baptists so much 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.510
 batista70phone friends today I do 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:20.460
 see our colors for samsung 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:23.640
 galaxy s 4 and now we are providing 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.859
 a reorganization indeed we have already done and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.560
 we will make some of them be branded 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.349
 I'll show you those for the moment 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.220
 without a brand we start with one 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:39.809
 normal tpu cover as you can 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:43.129
 note it is very classic adheres 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:47.460
 perfectly to the smartphone 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.620
 we have to put it on as you see stocking 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.440
 perfectly there are no problems 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.019
 volume button is below the button 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.780
 ignition styled by and in this part 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.870
 you click it as you see it lights up 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.090
 quietly the grip below is 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.339
 free there are no adherence problems 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.960
 we have the microphone button 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.230
 so there is to say that the cover is made 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.420
 well what you just need to make it join a 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.400
 little bit better 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.050
 sorry for the constant notifications but it's one 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.050
 breaking of bales continues every day 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:29.070
 now in a moment like the cheese 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:31.550
 then then we have a hard cover like 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.860
 you can see this is not rigid 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.060
 flexible repairs a lot you can't 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.260
 to see 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.870
 let's go and hang it remains uncovered 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.890
 the part above is the part you can find under 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:51.150
 I repeat it is really very resistant and has 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:55.110
 also a very good grip and now we continue 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.570
 with our covers not used not by 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.530
 I would ruin them by removing this 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.330
 really very rigid we go to see 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.099
 the covers and those we say ultraslim 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.209
 these are very light indeed 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.580
 also behind 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.040
 what kind of 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.800
 they are rough have a great grip one for 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.770
 the other one, however, I show all 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.920
 wear if we want to say let's go 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.569
 to hook it look perfectly 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.840
 as you can see the key of the remains 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:34.490
 volume the various holes are centered 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:40.350
 however the effect remains perfectly 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:42.720
 let's say glitter you can see here 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.440
 under I told you this adheres 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.830
 perfectly to the smartphone 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.970
 now let's go and take it off I'll show you 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:58.430
 the practically white transparent one 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:02.850
 we come now to insert it so we see 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.890
 the effect it makes as you see that also 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.019
 these are very nice bubbles 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.860
 just pass then your fingers come off 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:15.870
 it's not a problem because you see this 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.579
 very beautiful very tight holes 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.940
 they fit together perfectly 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:23.400
 no doubt really good to me here 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.120
 I had not closed it well anyway ok 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:32.190
 let's go and take it off we always see 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:38.780
 another that serves as this too 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.780
 ultraslim we go to hook it 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:47.040
 we perfectly engage 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:49.470
 match all the various holes 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.120
 ok perfect this is completely dark 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.489
 on the back here we say that it went to 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.650
 lose some of the effect but there is to say 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.280
 which is very elegant and I assure you that 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.250
 the crif is really great heard on 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.290
 my hands have no particular hands 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.250
 I saw him not even particularly smooth 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.310
 anyway how you can feel a grip 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.140
 we say very good that you don't 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.530
 escape the phone from the mother 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.780
 and we come to the cool of the cover 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.750
 you know you have already seen it now there 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.560
 I show also in function yes 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:28.220
 quietly hooks in here 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.980
 now everything turned on as expected 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.610
 I'm going to close the moment you close 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:38.080
 as you can see the display above appears 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.070
 and the display is still completely 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.780
 working now I've never tried to 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.700
 pull the actual curtain what happens no 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.210
 I think it only works during one 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.020
 call 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.320
 now I make a call of course 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.320
 obscured my number 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.660
 let's see what happens when the comes 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:58.310
 call here it is to do number 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.860
 private 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.210
 you can reply or reject the 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.830
 call as you have seen we have 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:10.760
 refused the call not answered a 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.680
 nobody as you see we have a glass 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.190
 protective a film ahead 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.510
 protective that still allows us to 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.980
 obviously answer if we have to do 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.730
 other operation we do nothing 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.050
 other than going to open it and do it 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.670
 all we have to do 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:30.650
 also understood who was the Roma who talks about 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:33.260
 first as you see very functional in the 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:38.060
 the moment it closes it passes directly 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:40.250
 at this stage and I can't tell you about 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.440
 precise what price we will put these but 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.760
 I think we will be around the fortnight 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.530
 euros also because they cost us 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.860
 quite let's say and it wasn't either 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:54.860
 it's really easy to find the quality 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.020
 good repairs very well is held in well 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.570
 hand and I told you we have the comfort 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.520
 that we can respond calmly 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.350
 from the phone and talk because anyway 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.020
 so we have a microphone here below 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:08.210
 the interlocutor feels quietly 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.740
 ok you have seen all of ours 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:15.560
 these are all good or bad series 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:19.040
 the shop misses the ones I have 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:22.880
 said customized and we must enter 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:26.590
 the former cover let's call it what we want 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.390
 and I think it's something we'll do 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.870
 quite soon this veil 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.360
 I highly recommend it because 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.970
 repairs really well both front and back 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.660
 therefore you don't need a col 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:42.610
 extra film and you have the 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.340
 comfort just to be able to answer 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.830
 without having to open the flip cover like 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.810
 we did before and see here above mind 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.210
 all your nice notifications that 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.400
 however they appear but I hope to have you 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.330
 the well illustrated for a greeting from 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.080
 loris arias batista70 speaks 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:06.210
 batista70phone shop 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:10.440
 hello thirst quenching 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.440
 in the sense that they seek I know
