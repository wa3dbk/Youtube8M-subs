going to show you an oil change on the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.310 
going to show you an oil change on the
Rotax<00:00:09.960> engine

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.320 
Rotax engine

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.970 
Rotax engine
Percy<00:00:11.890> Richard<00:00:12.370> he's<00:00:13.210> removing<00:00:14.050> the<00:00:14.170> cat<00:00:14.380> and

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
Percy Richard he's removing the cat and

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.880 
Percy Richard he's removing the cat and
then<00:00:15.460> he<00:00:15.790> will<00:00:16.000> burp<00:00:16.690> the<00:00:16.900> engine<00:00:17.290> very

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
then he will burp the engine very

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.400 
then he will burp the engine very
critical<00:00:18.520> that<00:00:18.640> the<00:00:18.790> engine<00:00:19.180> is<00:00:19.270> turned<00:00:19.750> the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
critical that the engine is turned the

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.040 
critical that the engine is turned the
way<00:00:20.560> it<00:00:20.710> normally<00:00:21.009> runs<00:00:21.610> so<00:00:22.390> this<00:00:22.660> way<00:00:22.869> it's

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
way it normally runs so this way it's

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.130 
way it normally runs so this way it's
counterclockwise<00:00:23.529> and<00:00:24.430> he'll<00:00:25.360> turn<00:00:25.660> that<00:00:25.930> too

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
counterclockwise and he'll turn that too

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.470 
counterclockwise and he'll turn that too
we<00:00:26.290> hear<00:00:26.500> gurgle<00:00:29.669> there's<00:00:30.669> your<00:00:30.880> girdle<00:00:31.119> so

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
we hear gurgle there's your girdle so

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.720 
we hear gurgle there's your girdle so
now<00:00:31.689> we<00:00:31.750> know<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:32.529> oil<00:00:32.739> is<00:00:32.980> drained<00:00:33.340> from<00:00:33.460> the

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
now we know the oil is drained from the

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.880 
now we know the oil is drained from the
tank<00:00:34.180> from<00:00:34.750> the<00:00:34.870> engine<00:00:35.320> back<00:00:35.710> into<00:00:36.250> the<00:00:36.399> tank

and there's our tape at nine o'clock and
that's<00:05:03.149> how<00:05:03.509> tight<00:05:03.899> it<00:05:04.079> needs<00:05:04.319> today

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:06.629 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:11.149 

very<00:05:07.259> important<00:05:07.919> to<00:05:09.379> remove<00:05:10.379> the<00:05:10.619> oil<00:05:10.649> filter

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
very important to remove the oil filter

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:16.159 
very important to remove the oil filter
and<00:05:12.080> put<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:14.009> new<00:05:14.249> oil<00:05:14.520> filter<00:05:14.909> on<00:05:15.330> as<00:05:15.719> soon<00:05:16.020> as

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
and put the new oil filter on as soon as

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.179 
and put the new oil filter on as soon as
possible<00:05:16.830> to<00:05:17.369> eliminate<00:05:17.909> an<00:05:19.009> abundant<00:05:20.009> amount

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:20.189 
possible to eliminate an abundant amount

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:23.059 
possible to eliminate an abundant amount
of<00:05:20.610> oil<00:05:20.879> coming<00:05:21.360> out<00:05:21.539> of<00:05:21.599> the<00:05:21.749> oil<00:05:22.199> okay

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:23.069 
of oil coming out of the oil okay

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:24.649 
of oil coming out of the oil okay
so<00:05:23.369> that's<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.759> critical<00:05:24.059> part<00:05:24.360> that<00:05:24.629> that

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
so that's the critical part that that

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.869 
so that's the critical part that that
oil<00:05:25.020> filter<00:05:25.319> goes<00:05:25.499> right<00:05:25.740> on<00:05:25.979> and<00:05:26.279> that<00:05:26.759> the

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:26.879 
oil filter goes right on and that the

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:28.939 
oil filter goes right on and that the
oil<00:05:26.909> gets<00:05:27.389> replaced<00:05:27.869> immediately<00:05:28.559> we're<00:05:28.740> now

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
oil gets replaced immediately we're now

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:31.070 
oil gets replaced immediately we're now
going<00:05:29.249> to<00:05:29.429> replace<00:05:29.610> the<00:05:30.059> oil<00:05:30.300> because<00:05:30.929> it

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
going to replace the oil because it

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.260 
going to replace the oil because it
needs<00:05:31.289> to<00:05:31.469> be<00:05:31.559> done<00:05:31.740> immediately<00:05:31.999> we<00:05:32.999> don't

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
needs to be done immediately we don't

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.779 
needs to be done immediately we don't
let<00:05:33.449> it<00:05:33.509> drain<00:05:33.869> overnight<00:05:34.409> just<00:05:34.860> we<00:05:35.279> drain<00:05:35.580> it
