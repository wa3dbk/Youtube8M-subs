00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.120
 dear gaming friends or should i today 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.040
 rather say love lifestyle friends 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.190
 my name sirius and i will be you 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.950
 today a part of the brand new nagarro 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.430
 introduce series of razer and there 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.010
 is just the ada ruined 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.430
 where is now a series of razer the 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.039
 A total of four headphones covers the front 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.539
 all are intended for listening to music so 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.060
 which is a bit off the beaten track 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.130
 pure gaming range move out 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.370
 which we just simply the razer 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.440
 headsets know today's video is 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.239
 Definitely a pure unboxing 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.219
 video by looking together 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.100
 what's in the boxes like 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.809
 See the good parts of Hanaus there 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.000
 it still depends on accessories and what 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.190
 in the user manual in it and me 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.410
 I'll try a few facts 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.390
 to blow one's ears and one says one 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.989
 In any case, these are precision 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.149
 manufactured and resistant 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.710
 aluminum headphones so here was 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.909
 not saved one should not also 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.030
 Expect the whopping in ears cost 79th 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.799
 eur 990 alone at the price you can 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.439
 actually already recognize where racer 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.509
 position with this new series 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.939
 would like and it is probably the 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.220
 absolute high fidelity area so 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.500
 people on the highest sound pleasure 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.950
 stand and there just no 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.420
 want to make compromises on the 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.890
 Back here you can see is already 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.509
 a little manual there wants 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.130
 I'll talk about that later 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.920
 and below that you can see such a 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.570
 transportcase in which is now in the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.710
 moment the cable 0 can find later 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.450
 Of course you can also do this here 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.970
 individual plugs and the complete in 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.270
 Stow it carefully when you get the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.380
 times just do not want to have the ear yes 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.390
 if I all here still such a 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.649
 little bit from the packaging pulle can 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.180
 you might still tell that 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.909
 razer just says that the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.649
 engineers at countless prototypes 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.170
 have been working just now 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.299
 Final design to find something with 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.159
 this high fidelity sound matches 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.469
 and you 're supposed to be thundering bass and 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.060
 crystal clear heights on the ears 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.150
 So you get the music just 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.430
 can experience 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.479
 how they should be heard so you can 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.899
 but still see a small bag 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.730
 in it 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.950
 But I'll deal with it today 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.660
 a little more with these earplugs like 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.150
 The cable looks interesting is 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.980
 a relatively flat cable so not only 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.770
 under cable thin cable but rather 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.310
 a very wide cable with 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.970
 gold plated jack so you can 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.070
 we see is a little one 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.020
 Sliding mechanism with which you can open 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.500
 introduce the cables and also beautiful 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.470
 the razer logo on the little headphones 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.910
 pieces in the user manual 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.190
 then always the individual parts stop 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.630
 described and also how to use the pegs 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.820
 changes in the reason but that is very 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.600
 easy we have here again in addition 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.520
 three interchangeable earplugs one man 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.320
 just pull down and back on 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.920
 can put as you go quite the 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.360
 different sizes which ones take 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.890
 even a down and put one 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.030
 smaller and on top of that are really great 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.430
 have different with me now 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.900
 already the standard plugs quite well 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.790
 fit the exposed but 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.440
 maybe then you realize that you do that 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.110
 really just fine with his own 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.450
 ear can tackle the parts exist 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.790
 just made of silicone and should be a total 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.970
 sound isolation still outside offer us 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.519
 as well with the sound experience and the 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.140
 bass and so everything increase so me 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.510
 I heard it first 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.640
 experience on iphone with casper and 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.500
 materia were really good i hope 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.640
 this little unboxing has you up 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.019
 I liked it a lot 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.459
 I will be a bit soon 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.959
 something to tell the things in the 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.150
 Wear late night and walk 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.010
 I'll say thanks for that until then 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.239
 watch until next time 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.239
 and skin in
