think I have a setting on my films your

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.690 
think I have a setting on my films your
second<00:00:44.989> it's<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> little<00:00:46.289> bit<00:00:46.379> better<00:00:46.469> there<00:00:46.710> my

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
second it's a little bit better there my

light<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.059> my<00:00:48.239> camera<00:00:48.559> my<00:00:49.559> cell<00:00:49.800> phone<00:00:49.980> now<00:00:50.100> so

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
light on my camera my cell phone now so

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.459 
light on my camera my cell phone now so
you<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.449> see<00:00:51.570> they're<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> little<00:00:51.899> staggered

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
you can see they're a little staggered

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.939 
you can see they're a little staggered
there<00:00:53.629> so<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.110> seats<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.559> lean<00:00:55.739> back<00:00:55.770> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
there so the seats can lean back a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.910 
there so the seats can lean back a
little<00:00:56.219> bit<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.699> comfortable<00:00:57.920> this

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
little bit and be comfortable this

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.619 
little bit and be comfortable this
bottom<00:00:59.340> bar<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.000> gonna<00:01:00.180> be<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.449> one<00:01:00.600> that's

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
bottom bar is gonna be the one that's

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.920 
bottom bar is gonna be the one that's
gonna<00:01:00.960> we're<00:01:01.440> gonna<00:01:01.500> link<00:01:01.829> off<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.460> and

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
gonna we're gonna link off of it and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.600 
gonna we're gonna link off of it and
then<00:01:03.930> we're<00:01:04.080> going<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.379> shoot<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.339> ever

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
then we're going to shoot in just ever

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.260 
then we're going to shoot in just ever
so<00:01:05.850> slightly<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.390> Link<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.350> into<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:09.000> front

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
so slightly and Link it into the front

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.640 
so slightly and Link it into the front
end<00:01:09.450> do<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.869> same<00:01:10.140> thing<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.470> other<00:01:10.500> side

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
end do the same thing on the other side

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.100 
end do the same thing on the other side
but<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.220> one<00:01:11.490> we're<00:01:12.420> going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.689> take<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
but this one we're going to take the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.980 
but this one we're going to take the
same<00:01:13.260> type<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.530> square<00:01:13.860> tubing<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.900> link<00:01:15.900> it

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
same type of square tubing and link it

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.410 
same type of square tubing and link it
down<00:01:16.380> into<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.369> bar<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:18.030> goes<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.360> way

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
down into that bar that goes that way

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.410 
down into that bar that goes that way
and<00:01:18.810> then<00:01:19.590> we're<00:01:19.740> probably<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.850> top<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.270> that

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and then we're probably on top of that

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.210 
and then we're probably on top of that
just<00:01:21.689> making<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:22.619> structurally<00:01:23.009> sound

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
just making a really structurally sound

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.249 
just making a really structurally sound
so<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.520> doesn't<00:01:23.880> move<00:01:24.030> or<00:01:24.330> go<00:01:24.509> anywhere<00:01:24.600> Bend

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
so this doesn't move or go anywhere Bend

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.969 
so this doesn't move or go anywhere Bend
or<00:01:25.439> anything<00:01:25.790> but<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.270> piece<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:28.110> know

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
or anything but then this piece you know

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.410 
or anything but then this piece you know
it's<00:01:29.100> gonna<00:01:29.189> go<00:01:29.369> down<00:01:29.549> we're<00:01:30.090> probably<00:01:30.240> going

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
it's gonna go down we're probably going

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.780 
it's gonna go down we're probably going
to<00:01:30.509> have<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.659> round<00:01:31.079> piece<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.500> tubing<00:01:31.799> come<00:01:32.670> out

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
to have a round piece of tubing come out

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.730 
to have a round piece of tubing come out
of<00:01:32.939> there<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.420> maybe<00:01:33.689> link<00:01:33.990> up<00:01:34.140> with<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.470> or

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
of there and maybe link up with that or

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.170 
of there and maybe link up with that or
one<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.159> these<00:01:35.250> maybe<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:36.060> right

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
one of these maybe that that one right

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.300 
one of these maybe that that one right
there<00:01:36.360> spot<00:01:36.659> will<00:01:37.170> link<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.590> up<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:40.250> trying<00:01:41.250> to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
there spot will link it up at trying to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.200 
there spot will link it up at trying to
think<00:01:41.490> what<00:01:41.640> was<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.790> other<00:01:41.909> thing<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.150> was

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
think what was the other thing I was

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.450 
think what was the other thing I was
going<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.450> say<00:01:42.570> oh<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:44.009> then<00:01:44.130> we're<00:01:44.280> also

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
going to say oh and then we're also

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.120 
going to say oh and then we're also
we're<00:01:44.759> gonna<00:01:44.820> build<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.210> nice<00:01:45.930> big<00:01:46.320> cage<00:01:46.740> here

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
we're gonna build a nice big cage here

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.480 
we're gonna build a nice big cage here
and<00:01:47.960> Link<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.770> know<00:01:49.860> we're<00:01:50.040> gonna<00:01:50.130> kind

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
and Link it in you know we're gonna kind

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.819 
and Link it in you know we're gonna kind
of<00:01:50.549> plane<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.939> out<00:01:51.030> right<00:01:51.299> here<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.810> Link<00:01:52.680> it

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
of plane it out right here and Link it

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.950 
of plane it out right here and Link it
into<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.610> rear<00:01:53.790> end<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.479> gonna<00:01:54.750> be

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
into the rear end so it's gonna be

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.450 
into the rear end so it's gonna be
really<00:01:55.110> structurally<00:01:55.560> sound<00:01:55.770> this
