00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
hammer of dawn into their like you could

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.450 
hammer of dawn into their like you could
in<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> other<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> other<00:01:20.220> one

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
in the other one and in the other one

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.100 
in the other one and in the other one
you<00:01:20.610> could<00:01:20.759> only<00:01:20.939> ever<00:01:21.150> see<00:01:21.450> him<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.869> threw

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
you could only ever see him if you threw

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.719 
you could only ever see him if you threw
a<00:01:22.140> smoke<00:01:22.500> grenade<00:01:22.530> into<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.250> right<00:01:23.430> hole

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
a smoke grenade into the right hole

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.760 
a smoke grenade into the right hole
right<00:01:23.780> now<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.229> throw<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> smoke<00:01:25.619> grenade

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
right now if you throw a smoke grenade

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.249 
right now if you throw a smoke grenade
into<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.610> window<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.180> try<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> look<00:01:28.020> at<00:01:28.140> him

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
into the window and try to look at him

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.870 
into the window and try to look at him
it<00:01:28.380> actually<00:01:28.650> makes<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.890> harder<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.369> see<00:01:29.700> him

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it actually makes it harder to see him

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.810 
it actually makes it harder to see him
instead<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.390> easier<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.430> yeah<00:01:32.430> that's<00:01:32.640> about

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
instead of easier and yeah that's about

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.630 
instead of easier and yeah that's about
