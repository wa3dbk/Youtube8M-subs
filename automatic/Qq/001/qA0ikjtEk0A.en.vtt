going<00:00:53.090> to<00:00:53.150> do<00:00:53.300> a<00:00:53.330> little<00:00:53.570> experiment<00:00:54.020> here

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
going to do a little experiment here

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.590 
going to do a little experiment here
since<00:00:54.860> we<00:00:55.040> know<00:00:55.550> there's<00:00:55.910> bugs<00:00:56.180> in<00:00:56.360> here

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
since we know there's bugs in here

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.790 
since we know there's bugs in here
because<00:00:56.780> we<00:00:56.960> showed<00:00:57.170> them<00:00:57.320> to<00:00:57.500> you<00:00:57.530> in<00:00:57.650> the

can kill these little Behrman what we're
going<00:01:05.720> to<00:01:05.750> do<00:01:05.960> is<00:01:06.710> I'm<00:01:06.950> going<00:01:07.100> to<00:01:07.540> take<00:01:08.540> some<00:01:08.750> of

going to kill any larvae bugs whatever

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.520 
going to kill any larvae bugs whatever
ah<00:01:30.909> I'll<00:01:31.909> probably<00:01:32.179> get<00:01:32.390> a<00:01:32.530> infrared

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
ah I'll probably get a infrared

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.840 
ah I'll probably get a infrared
thermometer<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:34.249> show<00:01:34.429> you<00:01:34.490> what<00:01:34.700> the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
thermometer and show you what the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.270 
thermometer and show you what the
freezer<00:01:35.439> temperature<00:01:36.439> is<00:01:36.499> before<00:01:36.950> I<00:01:37.009> pulled

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
freezer temperature is before I pulled

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.319 
freezer temperature is before I pulled
out<00:01:37.399> I<00:01:37.429> don't<00:01:37.520> have<00:01:37.640> it<00:01:37.850> with<00:01:37.969> me<00:01:38.030> right<00:01:38.299> now

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
out I don't have it with me right now

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.950 
out I don't have it with me right now
but<00:01:38.719> on<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.710> early<00:01:40.039> experiment<00:01:40.729> my<00:01:41.509> freezer

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
but on the early experiment my freezer

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.910 
but on the early experiment my freezer
was<00:01:42.460> probably<00:01:43.460> about<00:01:43.639> negative<00:01:44.119> 15<00:01:44.689> so<00:01:44.929> I'm

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
was probably about negative 15 so I'm

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.760 
was probably about negative 15 so I'm
pretty<00:01:46.219> sure<00:01:46.399> it's<00:01:46.579> way<00:01:47.270> cold<00:01:48.200> enough<00:01:48.409> to<00:01:48.560> kill

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
pretty sure it's way cold enough to kill

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.730 
pretty sure it's way cold enough to kill
anything<00:01:49.569> so<00:01:50.569> anyway<00:01:50.840> I've<00:01:51.200> already<00:01:51.350> turn

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
anything so anyway I've already turn

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.590 
anything so anyway I've already turn
around<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.130> I<00:01:52.189> shook<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.759> heck<00:01:53.179> out<00:01:53.359> of<00:01:53.389> this

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
around and I shook the heck out of this

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.749 
around and I shook the heck out of this
bucket<00:01:54.079> like<00:01:54.829> you<00:01:54.920> saw<00:01:55.069> yesterday<00:01:55.340> all<00:01:55.609> that

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
bucket like you saw yesterday all that

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.580 
bucket like you saw yesterday all that
rice<00:01:55.939> is<00:01:56.119> all<00:01:56.209> brown<00:01:56.509> and<00:01:56.539> dusty<00:01:57.139> and<00:01:57.229> little

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
rice is all brown and dusty and little

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.889 
rice is all brown and dusty and little
crypto<00:01:57.950> little<00:01:58.310> bugs<00:01:58.999> crawling<00:01:59.359> around<00:01:59.509> so

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
crypto little bugs crawling around so

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.899 
crypto little bugs crawling around so
figure<00:02:00.590> out<00:02:00.649> Gayle<00:02:00.859> nice<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:01.310> riled<00:02:01.639> up<00:02:01.729> and

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
figure out Gayle nice and riled up and

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.029

whatever just like you would before you

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.730 
whatever just like you would before you

pack it in your buckets with mylar and
we'll<00:05:03.740> see<00:05:03.890> if<00:05:04.010> it<00:05:04.130> kills<00:05:04.340> them<00:05:04.430> I'll<00:05:04.669> turn

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
we'll see if it kills them I'll turn

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.040 
we'll see if it kills them I'll turn
around<00:05:05.030> and<00:05:05.150> dump<00:05:05.360> them<00:05:05.510> out<00:05:05.630> on<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.810> white

of these little guys crawling around bye
if<00:05:13.340> it<00:05:13.490> kills<00:05:13.729> them<00:05:14.379> then<00:05:15.379> you<00:05:15.830> know<00:05:15.919> we<00:05:16.280> all

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
if it kills them then you know we all

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:21.439 
race we said the other day there's

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:23.770 
race we said the other day there's
nothing<00:05:21.710> wrong<00:05:21.800> fit<00:05:22.330> besides<00:05:23.330> having<00:05:23.719> a

nothing wrong fit besides having a

nothing wrong fit besides having a

little bit of the dust from the little

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:30.969 
little bit of the dust from the little
critters<00:05:26.360> eating<00:05:26.960> away<00:05:29.110> there's<00:05:30.110> not<00:05:30.319> much

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
critters eating away there's not much

critters eating away there's not much
else<00:05:31.189> for<00:05:31.280> off<00:05:31.490> it<00:05:32.139> so<00:05:33.280> you<00:05:34.280> could<00:05:34.400> probably

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
else for off it so you could probably

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.429 
else for off it so you could probably
turn<00:05:34.789> around<00:05:34.849> and<00:05:35.650> rinse<00:05:36.650> it<00:05:36.770> off<00:05:36.919> in<00:05:37.219> a

turn around and rinse it off in a

bucket

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.029 
bucket
dry<00:05:44.330> it<00:05:44.389> off<00:05:44.599> and<00:05:44.870> cook<00:05:45.020> it<00:05:45.199> or<00:05:45.530> cook<00:05:45.740> it<00:05:45.770> right

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
dry it off and cook it or cook it right

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:47.529 
dry it off and cook it or cook it right
then<00:05:46.219> and<00:05:46.250> there<00:05:46.400> and<00:05:46.819> probably<00:05:47.000> not<00:05:47.270> have<00:05:47.389> any

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
then and there and probably not have any

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.899 
then and there and probably not have any
problems<00:05:47.960> at<00:05:48.020> all<00:05:48.110> so<00:05:49.039> we'll<00:05:49.400> see<00:05:49.639> if<00:05:49.729> this

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:49.909 
problems at all so we'll see if this

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:52.689 
problems at all so we'll see if this
works<00:05:50.210> and<00:05:50.360> see<00:05:50.539> if<00:05:50.629> it's<00:05:50.780> one<00:05:50.990> way<00:05:51.169> that<00:05:51.699> could

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
works and see if it's one way that could

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:54.520 
works and see if it's one way that could
save<00:05:52.909> you<00:05:53.030> from<00:05:53.180> having<00:05:53.360> to<00:05:53.479> throw<00:05:53.750> away<00:05:53.840> some

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
save you from having to throw away some

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.559 
save you from having to throw away some
of<00:05:55.370> your<00:05:55.460> short-term<00:05:55.819> preps<00:05:56.270> that<00:05:56.360> this

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:56.569 
of your short-term preps that this

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:57.730 
of your short-term preps that this
happens<00:05:56.900> or<00:05:57.020> even<00:05:57.050> some<00:05:57.349> of<00:05:57.379> your<00:05:57.530> long-term

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
stuff if you're one to turn around and

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.689 
stuff if you're one to turn around and
not<00:06:02.449> save<00:06:02.840> it<00:06:03.020> there's<00:06:03.949> a<00:06:04.069> whole<00:06:04.250> bunch<00:06:04.460> of

not save it there's a whole bunch of
them<00:06:04.819> in<00:06:04.909> our<00:06:05.620> right<00:06:06.620> in<00:06:06.740> there<00:06:06.949> I<00:06:07.310> don't<00:06:08.029> know

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
them in our right in there I don't know

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.670 
them in our right in there I don't know
if<00:06:08.270> you<00:06:08.330> can<00:06:08.479> see<00:06:08.659> it<00:06:08.750> real<00:06:08.930> good<00:06:09.139> but<00:06:09.379> see<00:06:09.560> all

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
if you can see it real good but see all

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.140 
if you can see it real good but see all
this<00:06:09.889> right<00:06:10.129> through<00:06:10.279> here<00:06:10.430> that's<00:06:10.639> nothing

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
this right through here that's nothing

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.540 
this right through here that's nothing
but<00:06:11.180> bugs<00:06:11.620> so<00:06:12.620> they're<00:06:13.009> in<00:06:13.189> there

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
but bugs so they're in there

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.080 
but bugs so they're in there
so<00:06:14.300> anyway<00:06:15.259> I'm<00:06:15.889> Bob<00:06:16.190> from<00:06:16.370> PAH<00:06:16.550> productions

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
so anyway I'm Bob from PAH productions

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.279 
so anyway I'm Bob from PAH productions
and<00:06:17.360> then<00:06:17.569> three<00:06:18.050> days<00:06:18.199> will<00:06:18.500> yank<00:06:18.710> this<00:06:18.889> out

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289 
and then three days will yank this out

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:25.180 
and then three days will yank this out
set<00:06:21.289> it<00:06:21.379> out<00:06:21.469> for<00:06:21.680> three<00:06:21.889> more<00:06:22.069> and<00:06:24.039> we'll<00:06:25.039> see

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
set it out for three more and we'll see

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.839 
set it out for three more and we'll see
if<00:06:25.279> this<00:06:25.400> works

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849 
if this works

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:28.719 
if this works
and<00:06:26.240> that<00:06:26.659> way<00:06:27.190> people<00:06:28.190> can<00:06:28.310> give<00:06:28.460> it<00:06:28.550> a<00:06:28.610> whirl

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
and that way people can give it a whirl

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:29.920 
and that way people can give it a whirl
on<00:06:28.879> their<00:06:29.029> own<00:06:29.150> if<00:06:29.300> they<00:06:29.419> got<00:06:29.539> some<00:06:29.750> stuff

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
on their own if they got some stuff

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.089 
on their own if they got some stuff
that's<00:06:30.080> got<00:06:30.289> bugs<00:06:30.529> and<00:06:30.710> so<00:06:30.800> they<00:06:30.889> happen<00:06:31.069> to

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
that's got bugs and so they happen to

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:35.170 
that's got bugs and so they happen to
toss<00:06:31.310> it<00:06:31.460> out<00:06:32.500> like<00:06:33.500> I<00:06:33.560> said<00:06:33.819> it's<00:06:34.819> really<00:06:34.879> up

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
toss it out like I said it's really up

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.490 
toss it out like I said it's really up
to<00:06:35.330> you<00:06:35.419> what<00:06:35.539> you<00:06:35.690> want<00:06:35.839> to<00:06:35.870> do<00:06:36.020> if<00:06:36.139> it<00:06:36.319> but<00:06:36.469> I

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:36.500 
to you what you want to do if it but I

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.649 
to you what you want to do if it but I
figured<00:06:36.919> was<00:06:37.159> said<00:06:37.909> of<00:06:37.969> just<00:06:38.120> throwing<00:06:38.360> it<00:06:38.539> out

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:38.659 
figured was said of just throwing it out

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:40.329 
figured was said of just throwing it out
or<00:06:38.930> giving<00:06:39.259> it<00:06:39.349> to<00:06:39.440> the<00:06:39.560> livestock<00:06:39.740> might<00:06:40.250> as

00:06:40.329 --> 00:06:40.339 
or giving it to the livestock might as

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:42.070 
or giving it to the livestock might as
well<00:06:40.460> do<00:06:40.969> it

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
well do it

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.390 
well do it
so<00:06:42.319> I<00:06:42.500> said<00:06:43.460> six<00:06:44.300> days<00:06:44.860> we'll<00:06:45.860> see<00:06:46.039> if<00:06:46.129> the<00:06:46.250> rice

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
so I said six days we'll see if the rice
