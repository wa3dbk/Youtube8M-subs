up<00:01:16.039> now<00:01:16.069> all<00:01:16.399> we<00:01:16.459> got<00:01:16.580> to<00:01:16.610> do<00:01:16.789> is<00:01:16.910> tweak<00:01:17.330> how

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
up now all we got to do is tweak how

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.260 
up now all we got to do is tweak how
deep<00:01:17.929> we<00:01:18.110> seat<00:01:18.349> the<00:01:18.470> bullet<00:01:18.770> with<00:01:18.890> this

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
deep we seat the bullet with this

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.910 
deep we seat the bullet with this
adjuster<00:01:20.270> on<00:01:20.420> top<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:21.470> we're<00:01:21.560> going<00:01:21.649> to<00:01:21.740> lock

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
adjuster on top so we're going to lock

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:32.859 
adjuster on top so we're going to lock
this<00:01:22.360> collar<00:01:25.330> collar<00:01:26.330> is<00:01:26.630> locked<00:01:27.020> down<00:01:31.750> and<00:01:32.750> at

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
this collar collar is locked down and at

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.320 
this collar collar is locked down and at
this<00:01:33.050> point<00:01:33.410> I<00:01:33.649> should<00:01:34.250> be<00:01:34.580> able<00:01:34.759> to<00:01:34.970> pull<00:01:35.209> the

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
this point I should be able to pull the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.240 
this point I should be able to pull the
case<00:01:35.509> back<00:01:35.750> up<00:01:36.020> there<00:01:36.860> should<00:01:37.009> have<00:01:37.039> been<00:01:37.160> no

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
case back up there should have been no

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.680 
case back up there should have been no
undue<00:01:37.729> pressure<00:01:37.940> on<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.300> case<00:01:38.509> I<00:01:38.660> should

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
undue pressure on the case I should

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.359 
undue pressure on the case I should
still<00:01:39.140> have<00:01:39.289> enough<00:01:39.500> expansion<00:01:40.009> of<00:01:40.099> the<00:01:40.160> mouth

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
still have enough expansion of the mouth

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.300 
still have enough expansion of the mouth
to<00:01:41.060> put<00:01:41.209> that<00:01:41.360> bullet<00:01:41.539> in<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:41.899> I<00:01:41.959> do<00:01:45.099> so<00:01:46.099> what

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
to put that bullet in and I do so what

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.130 
to put that bullet in and I do so what
we've<00:01:46.489> done<00:01:46.700> is<00:01:46.759> there's<00:01:47.330> there's<00:01:47.569> a<00:01:47.660> standoff

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
we've done is there's there's a standoff

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.650 
we've done is there's there's a standoff
inside<00:01:48.649> this<00:01:48.830> die<00:01:49.069> and<00:01:49.880> we've<00:01:50.030> run<00:01:50.209> this<00:01:50.360> up<00:01:50.569> to

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
inside this die and we've run this up to

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.300 
inside this die and we've run this up to
the<00:01:50.780> standoff<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:51.530> now<00:01:51.709> we're<00:01:51.920> going<00:01:52.099> to<00:01:52.190> be

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
the standoff and now we're going to be

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.130 
the standoff and now we're going to be
plunging<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.810> seating<00:01:54.649> stem<00:01:56.050> into<00:01:57.050> the

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
plunging the seating stem into the

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.580 
plunging the seating stem into the
bullet<00:01:58.539> so<00:01:59.539> here<00:01:59.720> we're<00:01:59.929> going<00:01:59.959> to<00:02:00.110> go<00:02:00.289> ahead

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
bullet so here we're going to go ahead

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.350 
bullet so here we're going to go ahead
and<00:02:00.950> back<00:02:01.910> off<00:02:03.610> we're<00:02:04.610> going<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.759> run<00:02:05.000> this<00:02:05.149> up

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
and back off we're going to run this up

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.889 
and back off we're going to run this up
pull<00:02:06.289> it<00:02:06.319> in<00:02:06.619> case<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.599> now<00:02:08.599> we're<00:02:08.720> going<00:02:08.840> to

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
pull it in case and now we're going to

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.040 
pull it in case and now we're going to
run<00:02:09.200> this<00:02:09.379> down<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:10.399> it's<00:02:11.209> already<00:02:11.690> giving<00:02:12.020> me

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
run this down and it's already giving me

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.680 
run this down and it's already giving me
resistance<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:14.390> for<00:02:14.660> five-0

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.480 

so<00:02:20.690> when<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:20.930> comes<00:02:21.020> to<00:02:21.230> seating<00:02:21.620> very<00:02:22.190> similar

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
so when it comes to seating very similar

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.490 
so when it comes to seating very similar
to<00:02:22.610> expanding<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.330> lot<00:02:23.959> of<00:02:24.080> little<00:02:24.260> minor

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
to expanding a lot of little minor

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.840 
to expanding a lot of little minor
tweaks<00:02:25.600> all<00:02:26.600> right<00:02:26.780> through<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:26.990> press<00:02:27.850> take

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
tweaks all right through the press take

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.490 
tweaks all right through the press take
a<00:02:28.880> caliper<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:31.130> measure<00:02:31.400> or<00:02:32.300> right<00:02:32.840> there<00:02:33.080> you

a caliper and measure or right there you

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.750 
a caliper and measure or right there you
can<00:02:33.650> see<00:02:33.800> we've<00:02:33.950> got<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.100> pretty<00:02:34.190> good<00:02:34.580> amount

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
can see we've got a pretty good amount

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.400 
can see we've got a pretty good amount
