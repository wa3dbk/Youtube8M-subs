00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
really dry so I always advise people to

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.690 
really dry so I always advise people to
use<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> lot<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.660> moisturizer<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.680> one<00:00:41.219> tip<00:00:41.520> as

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
well people don't tend to use a lot of

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.310 
well people don't tend to use a lot of
SPF<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.450> wintertime<00:00:45.750> they<00:00:45.930> think<00:00:46.260> because

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
SPF in the wintertime they think because

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.319 
SPF in the wintertime they think because
their<00:00:46.590> bundles<00:00:46.980> up<00:00:47.190> they're<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:47.489> exposed<00:00:48.059> or

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
their bundles up they're not exposed or

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.790 
their bundles up they're not exposed or
not<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.570> tank<00:00:48.780> tops<00:00:49.050> or<00:00:49.230> not<00:00:49.350> running<00:00:49.559> around

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
not in tank tops or not running around

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.250 
not in tank tops or not running around
in<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.950> Sun<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.600> they<00:00:51.600> don't<00:00:51.930> need<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.140> use

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
in the Sun that they don't need to use

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.319 
in the Sun that they don't need to use
SPF<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.920> its<00:00:53.190> really<00:00:53.460> really<00:00:53.699> important<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
SPF and its really really important to

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.970 
SPF and its really really important to
do<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.899> put<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> lot<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:55.530> your<00:00:55.829> face

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
do that just put a lot on your face

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.680 
do that just put a lot on your face
