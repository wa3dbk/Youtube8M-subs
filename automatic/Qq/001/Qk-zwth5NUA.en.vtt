scene in the background has changed and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.110 
scene in the background has changed and
not<00:00:55.110> entirely<00:00:55.469> sure<00:00:55.860> what<00:00:56.610> scene<00:00:56.850> that's

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
not entirely sure what scene that's

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.180 
not entirely sure what scene that's
supposed<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.510> depict<00:00:57.930> obviously<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.160> a

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
supposed to depict obviously this is a

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.770 
supposed to depict obviously this is a
mix<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.550> match<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.969> various<00:01:00.329> figures<00:01:00.629> that

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
mix and match of various figures that

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
mix and match of various figures that
have<00:01:00.870> appeared<00:01:01.079> throughout<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> Clone<00:01:01.770> Wars

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
series and the movie and so I don't

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.910 
series and the movie and so I don't
think<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.040> really<00:01:05.729> seems<00:01:06.060> specific<00:01:06.920> on

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
think this is really seems specific on

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.399 
think this is really seems specific on
the<00:01:07.979> back<00:01:08.159> you've<00:01:08.580> got<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:09.060> image<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.960> figures

is the fact that the packaging refers to

core troopers now if you look at the
markings<00:01:54.780> don't<00:01:55.500> know<00:01:55.590> how<00:01:55.680> well<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.100> will

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
markings don't know how well it will

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.700 
markings don't know how well it will
show<00:01:56.460> without<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.180> comparison<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:58.530> they're

show without a comparison but they're

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.700 
show without a comparison but they're
actually<00:01:58.860> much<00:01:59.280> closer<00:01:59.670> of<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.630> match<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
backpack you do also get the alternate

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.110 
backpack you do also get the alternate
missile<00:02:58.960> and<00:02:59.380> to<00:03:00.070> plug<00:03:00.280> into<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.640> jetpack<00:03:00.970> as

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
missile and to plug into the jetpack as

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.640 
missile and to plug into the jetpack as
well<00:03:01.270> which<00:03:01.480> again<00:03:01.600> I<00:03:01.750> don't<00:03:01.930> have<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.440> hand

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
well which again I don't have to hand

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.190 
well which again I don't have to hand
but<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.460> is<00:03:03.550> just<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:04.000> missile<00:03:04.660> that<00:03:04.870> comes

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
but it is just the missile that comes

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.300 
but it is just the missile that comes
out<00:03:05.350> at<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.470> bottom<00:03:05.740> and<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:05.920> flick<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.220> at

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
out at the bottom and you flick it at

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.270 
out at the bottom and you flick it at
the<00:03:06.370> bottom<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:06.670> it<00:03:06.760> slips<00:03:07.240> out<00:03:07.770> so<00:03:08.770> that's

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
the bottom and it slips out so that's

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.050 
the bottom and it slips out so that's
the<00:03:09.490> jet<00:03:09.790> trooper<00:03:13.410> next<00:03:14.410> up<00:03:14.560> we<00:03:15.160> have<00:03:15.190> the

the jet trooper next up we have the

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.920 
the jet trooper next up we have the
standard<00:03:16.930> clone<00:03:17.580> which<00:03:18.580> is<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:19.450> same<00:03:19.660> as<00:03:19.840> the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
standard clone which is the same as the

other one even down to the hole in the
back<00:03:22.060> although<00:03:22.959> you<00:03:23.110> don't<00:03:23.230> get<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.440> jetpack

just tear the watcher tear the elastic
band<00:03:45.670> off<00:03:45.880> because<00:03:46.030> i've<00:03:46.239> wrapped<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:46.570> up<00:03:46.660> but

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
band off because i've wrapped it up but

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.229 
band off because i've wrapped it up but
you<00:03:47.500> get<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.739> idea<00:03:47.770> you<00:03:48.250> know<00:03:48.400> you<00:03:48.430> eventually

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
you get the idea you know you eventually

get to pull this apart and you'll have a

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.520 
get to pull this apart and you'll have a

really long rope and you can hook that

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.350 
really long rope and you can hook that
around<00:03:53.860> shelves<00:03:54.310> or<00:03:54.430> whatever<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:54.880> display

I think from I gather that this Arabic

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.510 
I think from I gather that this Arabic
spells<00:05:00.640> danger<00:05:01.510> danger<00:05:02.190> but<00:05:03.190> I<00:05:03.250> could<00:05:03.430> be

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
spells danger danger but I could be

spells danger danger but I could be
