00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.749 
the spacebar and right away you can see
that<00:01:39.960> I've<00:01:40.079> been<00:01:40.560> able<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.829> maximize<00:01:41.100> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
that I've been able to maximize the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.870 
that I've been able to maximize the
workspace<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.540> I'm<00:01:42.990> looking<00:01:43.710> at<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.159> this

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
workspace that I'm looking at and this

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.999 
workspace that I'm looking at and this
is<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> great<00:01:45.270> way<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.420> just<00:01:45.659> starting<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.409> turn

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
is a great way of just starting to turn

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.740 
is a great way of just starting to turn
things<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.549> learning<00:01:48.090> Maya<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.540> way

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
things on and learning Maya that way

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.630 
things on and learning Maya that way
versus<00:01:49.470> being<00:01:49.619> presented<00:01:50.040> with<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> whole<00:01:50.399> lot

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
versus being presented with a whole lot

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.450 
versus being presented with a whole lot
of<00:01:50.670> user<00:01:51.210> interface<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.960> trying<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.920> kind<00:01:53.430> of

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
of user interface and trying to kind of

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.240 
of user interface and trying to kind of
wade<00:01:53.670> through<00:01:54.000> what's<00:01:54.240> what's<00:01:54.630> there

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
wade through what's what's there

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.830 
wade through what's what's there
essentially<00:01:56.250> what<00:01:56.369> i<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.520> did<00:01:56.909> was<00:01:57.240> turn<00:01:57.509> off

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
essentially what i just did was turn off

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.440 
essentially what i just did was turn off
all<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.890> user<00:01:59.159> interface<00:01:59.430> elements<00:02:00.299> and

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
all of the user interface elements and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.660 
all of the user interface elements and
those<00:02:00.780> are<00:02:00.899> all<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.290> different<00:02:01.619> sort<00:02:02.579> of

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
those are all of the different sort of

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.340 
those are all of the different sort of
tools<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.149> mechanisms<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.869> surround<00:02:04.229> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
tools and mechanisms that surround the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.370 
tools and mechanisms that surround the
screen<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.240> where<00:02:06.240> they're<00:02:06.420> accessed<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.259> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
screen and where they're accessed in the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.529 
screen and where they're accessed in the
menus<00:02:07.770> are<00:02:08.009> up<00:02:08.610> here<00:02:08.819> under<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.119> display<00:02:09.509> menu

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
menus are up here under the display menu

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.690 
menus are up here under the display menu
and<00:02:10.200> what<00:02:10.560> I'm<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.800> do<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.250> turn<00:02:11.489> them

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
and what I'm going to do is turn them

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.550 
and what I'm going to do is turn them
back<00:02:11.849> on<00:02:12.060> by

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
back on by

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
back on by
tearing<00:02:13.830> off<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:15.060> UI<00:02:15.510> elements<00:02:16.310> menu<00:02:17.310> and

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
tearing off the UI elements menu and

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.949 
tearing off the UI elements menu and
we'll<00:02:18.120> just<00:02:18.270> turn<00:02:18.390> them<00:02:18.569> on<00:02:18.599> and<00:02:18.660> talk<00:02:18.930> about

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
we'll just turn them on and talk about

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.360 
we'll just turn them on and talk about
them<00:02:19.260> just<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.470> little<00:02:19.500> bit<00:02:19.770> as<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:19.950> turn<00:02:20.130> them<00:02:20.250> on

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
them just a little bit as I turn them on

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.330 
them just a little bit as I turn them on
so<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.150> status<00:02:21.480> line<00:02:21.569> is<00:02:21.930> where<00:02:22.739> we<00:02:22.860> find<00:02:23.069> our

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
so the status line is where we find our

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.309 
so the status line is where we find our
menu<00:02:23.640> sets<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.209> these<00:02:24.569> just<00:02:24.840> are<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.080> menu

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
menu sets and these just are the menu

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.470 
menu sets and these just are the menu
sets<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:26.340> you'll<00:02:26.489> see<00:02:26.700> up<00:02:26.790> in<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:26.940> menus<00:02:27.270> and

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
sets that you'll see up in the menus and

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.180 
sets that you'll see up in the menus and
in<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.780> little<00:02:27.989> bit<00:02:28.080> we'll<00:02:28.230> look<00:02:28.319> at<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.560> same

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
in a little bit we'll look at the same

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.009 
in a little bit we'll look at the same
menu<00:02:29.370> sets<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.819> hot<00:02:29.970> box<00:02:30.000> but<00:02:30.720> essentially

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
menu sets in the hot box but essentially

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.420 
menu sets in the hot box but essentially
they<00:02:31.200> turn<00:02:31.380> on<00:02:31.410> things<00:02:31.769> like<00:02:31.980> lighting<00:02:32.220> and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
they turn on things like lighting and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.180 
they turn on things like lighting and
shading<00:02:32.930> rendering<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:34.230> forth<00:02:34.530> with<00:02:35.069> the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
shading rendering and so forth with the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.690 
shading rendering and so forth with the
rendering<00:02:35.489> menu<00:02:35.690> polygons<00:02:37.040> has<00:02:38.040> menus<00:02:38.459> and

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
rendering menu polygons has menus and

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.850 
rendering menu polygons has menus and
tools<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:40.170> would<00:02:40.290> expect<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.739> find

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
tools that you would expect to find

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.800 
tools that you would expect to find
inside<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.370> polygons<00:02:41.790> menu<00:02:42.060> set<00:02:42.300> which<00:02:42.510> mesh

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
inside of polygons menu set which mesh

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.470 
inside of polygons menu set which mesh
edit<00:02:43.200> mashed<00:02:43.380> UVs<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.160> forth<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.610> things

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
edit mashed UVs and so forth and things

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.600 
edit mashed UVs and so forth and things
like<00:02:45.600> animation<00:02:46.069> creating<00:02:47.069> skeletons

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
like animation creating skeletons

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.900 
like animation creating skeletons
skinning<00:02:48.330> tools<00:02:48.600> deformation<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.700> of<00:02:50.700> course

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
skinning tools deformation and of course

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.490 
skinning tools deformation and of course
we've<00:02:51.060> got<00:02:51.209> some<00:02:51.480> in<00:02:51.630> dynamics<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.290> forth

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
we've got some in dynamics and so forth

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.110 
we've got some in dynamics and so forth
and<00:02:52.620> there's<00:02:52.799> also<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.100> customized<00:02:53.670> menu<00:02:53.970> so<00:02:54.060> if

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
and there's also a customized menu so if

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.090 
and there's also a customized menu so if
you<00:02:54.180> want<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.390> customize<00:02:54.569> your<00:02:54.959> own<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.500> get

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
you want to customize your own and get

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.920 
you want to customize your own and get
rid<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.280> any<00:02:56.459> tools<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.060> don't<00:02:57.360> want<00:02:57.750> to

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
rid of any tools that you don't want to

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.720 
rid of any tools that you don't want to
have<00:02:58.110> showing<00:02:58.500> up<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.709> your<00:02:58.830> menus<00:02:59.130> this<00:02:59.580> is<00:02:59.700> a

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
have showing up in your menus this is a

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.210 
have showing up in your menus this is a
great<00:02:59.970> way<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.150> doing<00:03:00.510> that<00:03:00.830> so<00:03:01.830> from<00:03:02.040> there

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
great way of doing that so from there

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.610 
great way of doing that so from there
there's<00:03:03.060> file<00:03:03.269> save<00:03:03.599> and<00:03:03.780> open<00:03:03.870> easy<00:03:04.380> to

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
there's file save and open easy to

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.680 
there's file save and open easy to
access<00:03:04.980> buttons<00:03:05.340> there<00:03:05.970> are<00:03:06.180> things<00:03:06.480> that

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
access buttons there are things that

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.170 
access buttons there are things that
allow<00:03:07.049> you<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.230> parse<00:03:08.190> out<00:03:08.400> your<00:03:08.610> selection

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
allow you to parse out your selection

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.570 
allow you to parse out your selection
sets<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:09.930> we<00:03:10.260> can<00:03:10.470> select<00:03:11.099> things<00:03:11.430> like

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
sets so we can select things like

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.570 
sets so we can select things like
hierarchy<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.209> groups<00:03:12.540> there<00:03:13.440> are<00:03:13.580> selection

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
hierarchy and groups there are selection

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.640 
hierarchy and groups there are selection
filters<00:03:15.090> for<00:03:15.510> objects<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.319> then<00:03:16.500> we<00:03:16.620> also

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
filters for objects and then we also

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.199 
filters for objects and then we also
have<00:03:16.950> selection<00:03:17.430> filters<00:03:17.700> for<00:03:17.910> different

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
have selection filters for different

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.030 
have selection filters for different
components<00:03:18.780> one<00:03:19.380> thing<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.650> point<00:03:19.829> out<00:03:19.980> here

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
components one thing to point out here

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
scale tool we get the correct response

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.310 
scale tool we get the correct response
in<00:05:32.730> the<00:05:32.820> tool<00:05:33.000> settings<00:05:33.240> so<00:05:34.050> we're<00:05:34.140> going<00:05:34.230> to

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
in the tool settings so we're going to

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.440 
in the tool settings so we're going to
close<00:05:34.530> that<00:05:34.560> out<00:05:34.770> below<00:05:35.610> that<00:05:35.820> or<00:05:35.970> just<00:05:36.000> panel

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
close that out below that or just panel

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.000 
close that out below that or just panel
layout<00:05:36.630> configurations<00:05:37.500> we'll<00:05:37.710> talk<00:05:37.890> about

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
layout configurations we'll talk about

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.310 
layout configurations we'll talk about
that<00:05:38.130> when<00:05:38.280> I<00:05:38.400> talk<00:05:38.580> about<00:05:38.610> panels<00:05:39.150> but<00:05:39.750> that

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
that when I talk about panels but that

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.350 
that when I talk about panels but that
is<00:05:40.530> just<00:05:40.560> kind<00:05:40.890> of<00:05:40.919> a<00:05:41.010> way<00:05:41.190> of<00:05:41.220> accessing<00:05:42.060> these

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
is just kind of a way of accessing these

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.540 
is just kind of a way of accessing these
individual<00:05:43.050> items<00:05:43.440> one<00:05:44.100> thing<00:05:44.250> to<00:05:44.340> note<00:05:44.520> is

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
individual items one thing to note is

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.580 
individual items one thing to note is
let's<00:05:45.000> say<00:05:45.090> I<00:05:45.180> have<00:05:45.300> a<00:05:45.810> few<00:05:46.140> of<00:05:46.200> these<00:05:46.260> turned

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
let's say I have a few of these turned

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.620 
let's say I have a few of these turned
on<00:05:46.770> maybe<00:05:47.640> in<00:05:47.730> this<00:05:47.790> case<00:05:47.880> just<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.300> status

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
on maybe in this case just the status

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.170 
on maybe in this case just the status
line<00:05:48.690> in<00:05:48.900> the<00:05:48.990> shelf<00:05:49.260> and<00:05:49.550> I<00:05:50.550> hide<00:05:50.880> all<00:05:51.060> of<00:05:51.090> my

navigating through all those another way
of<00:06:26.430> learning<00:06:26.760> these<00:06:27.030> is<00:06:27.300> if<00:06:27.990> you<00:06:28.110> notice<00:06:28.380> each

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
of learning these is if you notice each

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.080 
of learning these is if you notice each
one<00:06:28.800> of<00:06:28.830> these<00:06:28.980> user<00:06:29.280> interface<00:06:29.640> elements<00:06:30.000> has

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
one of these user interface elements has

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.360 
one of these user interface elements has
a<00:06:30.120> little<00:06:30.300> dotted<00:06:30.600> line<00:06:30.930> surrounding<00:06:31.370> the

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
a little dotted line surrounding the

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.100 
a little dotted line surrounding the
element<00:06:32.970> itself<00:06:33.030> you<00:06:33.540> can<00:06:33.570> see<00:06:33.810> that<00:06:33.840> there's

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
element itself you can see that there's

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.779 
element itself you can see that there's
a<00:06:34.169> little<00:06:34.380> dotted<00:06:34.620> line<00:06:34.830> here<00:06:35.280> there's<00:06:35.729> one

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
a little dotted line here there's one

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:37.640 
a little dotted line here there's one
next<00:06:36.090> to<00:06:36.300> the<00:06:36.330> range<00:06:36.600> slider<00:06:36.900> and<00:06:37.200> I'm<00:06:37.260> pulling

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
next to the range slider and I'm pulling

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.890 
next to the range slider and I'm pulling
up<00:06:37.830> my<00:06:38.010> my<00:06:38.550> toolbar<00:06:39.120> there<00:06:39.270> from

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
up my my toolbar there from

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.350 
up my my toolbar there from
windows<00:06:40.110> but<00:06:40.770> one<00:06:41.520> way<00:06:41.669> of<00:06:41.820> learning<00:06:42.060> what

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
windows but one way of learning what

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.999 
windows but one way of learning what
these<00:06:42.509> are<00:06:42.660> called<00:06:42.690> is<00:06:43.169> just<00:06:43.380> to<00:06:43.560> just<00:06:43.770> right

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:44.009 
these are called is just to just right

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:47.600 
these are called is just to just right
mouse<00:06:44.190> button<00:06:44.460> click<00:06:44.669> on<00:06:44.850> the<00:06:46.310> the<00:06:47.310> dotted

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
mouse button click on the the dotted

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.749 
mouse button click on the the dotted
line<00:06:47.850> and<00:06:48.120> let<00:06:48.840> go<00:06:49.050> and<00:06:49.350> that<00:06:49.530> pulls<00:06:49.770> up<00:06:49.949> a<00:06:50.070> menu

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 
line and let go and that pulls up a menu

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:53.360 
line and let go and that pulls up a menu
item<00:06:50.910> that<00:06:51.690> just<00:06:51.840> allows<00:06:52.050> me<00:06:52.259> to<00:06:52.380> turn<00:06:52.830> each

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
item that just allows me to turn each

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.279 
item that just allows me to turn each
one<00:06:53.610> of<00:06:53.639> those<00:06:53.820> individual<00:06:54.479> items<00:06:54.780> on<00:06:54.960> and<00:06:55.199> off

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289 
one of those individual items on and off

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:57.200 
one of those individual items on and off
so<00:06:55.949> this<00:06:56.130> mimics<00:06:56.340> the<00:06:56.610> menu<00:06:56.820> that<00:06:56.970> we<00:06:57.060> had

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.210 
so this mimics the menu that we had

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.409 
so this mimics the menu that we had
earlier<00:06:57.479> in<00:06:57.930> terms<00:06:58.590> of<00:06:59.000> turning<00:07:00.000> off<00:07:00.180> those

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 
earlier in terms of turning off those

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.330 
earlier in terms of turning off those
user<00:07:01.050> interface<00:07:01.440> elements<00:07:01.919> and<00:07:02.039> turning<00:07:02.280> them

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
user interface elements and turning them

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.420 
user interface elements and turning them
back<00:07:02.400> on<00:07:02.720> so<00:07:03.720> that<00:07:04.050> is<00:07:04.289> a<00:07:04.770> look<00:07:04.979> at<00:07:05.130> the<00:07:05.280> user

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.430 
back on so that is a look at the user

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.180 
back on so that is a look at the user
interface<00:07:05.610> elements
