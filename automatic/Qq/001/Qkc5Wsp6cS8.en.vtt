we're here to do today is to pass
through<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.599> gate<00:00:30.660> over<00:00:31.170> there<00:00:31.579> without

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
through that gate over there without

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.650 
through that gate over there without
actually<00:00:33.890> tricking<00:00:34.890> pounding<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.420> chain

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
actually tricking pounding on the chain

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.220 
actually tricking pounding on the chain
chomps<00:00:37.140> wouldn't<00:00:37.820> stuff<00:00:38.820> alright<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:40.110> it

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
chomps wouldn't stuff alright so it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.810

looks like oh okay you actually go
through<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> gate<00:00:48.329> backwards<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.289> I'm<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
through the gate backwards so I'm a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.770 
through the gate backwards so I'm a
little<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.579> careful<00:00:50.910> okay<00:00:51.180> I'm<00:00:51.360> really<00:00:51.570> bad

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
what happened see what happened what you

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.959 
what happened see what happened what you
do<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:01.350> get<00:01:01.469> pickup<00:01:01.770> bump<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.520> then<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.730> need

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
do to get pickup bump and then you need

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.090 
do to get pickup bump and then you need
to<00:01:03.030> jump<00:01:03.210> twice<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.320> right<00:01:04.559> after<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.830> jump

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
to jump twice and right after you jump

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.679 
to jump twice and right after you jump
you<00:01:05.189> got<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.339> throw<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.939> you're<00:01:06.420> gonna<00:01:06.510> end<00:01:06.659> up

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
you got a throw and you're gonna end up

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.289 
you got a throw and you're gonna end up
catching<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.080> bottom<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:09.380> so<00:01:11.299> gonna

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
catching the bottom like that so gonna

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.789 
catching the bottom like that so gonna
reload<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:12.930> cuz<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.320> makes<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.680> really

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
reload here cuz this makes it really

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.160 
reload here cuz this makes it really
easy<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.670> jump<00:01:15.000> twice<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.450> then<00:01:15.540> let<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.869> go

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
easy so jump twice and then let that go

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.880 
easy so jump twice and then let that go
and<00:01:16.380> then<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.590> got<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.830> catch<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.220> um<00:01:17.460> I

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
and then you got to catch it um I

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.950 
and then you got to catch it um I
personally<00:01:19.890> think<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.159> trick<00:01:20.759> Kings<00:01:21.330> kind

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
personally think this trick Kings kind

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.039 
personally think this trick Kings kind
of<00:01:22.110> harder<00:01:22.320> than<00:01:22.439> cannonless<00:01:22.799> just<00:01:23.220> because<00:01:23.549> I

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
of harder than cannonless just because I

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.450 
of harder than cannonless just because I
went<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.140> diff<00:01:25.290> candles<00:01:25.680> candles<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
went to diff candles candles in the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.190 
went to diff candles candles in the
first<00:01:26.729> 10<00:01:26.970> minutes<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.390> actually<00:01:27.540> tried<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
first 10 minutes I actually tried and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.359 
first 10 minutes I actually tried and
this<00:01:28.290> trick<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.650> took<00:01:28.770> me<00:01:28.890> an<00:01:28.979> hour<00:01:29.159> to

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
this trick it took me an hour to

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.219 
this trick it took me an hour to
actually<00:01:29.610> get<00:01:29.939> through<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.180> gate<00:01:30.360> once<00:01:30.689> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
actually get through the gate once and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.039 
actually get through the gate once and
also<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.280> gate<00:01:32.520> or<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.750> trick

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
also this gate or this this trick

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.499 
also this gate or this this trick
technically<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.490> objective<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.150> clip

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
technically the objective is to clip

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.780 
technically the objective is to clip
through<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.869> wall<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.560> bomb<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.549> there

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
through the wall with the bomb but there

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.789 
through the wall with the bomb but there
are<00:01:39.090> multiple<00:01:39.720> variables<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.430> okay

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
are multiple variables and it like okay

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.039 
are multiple variables and it like okay
the<00:01:43.799> height<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.130> your<00:01:44.189> jump<00:01:44.549> oh<00:01:44.909> my<00:01:45.750> goodness

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
the height of your jump oh my goodness

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.660 
the height of your jump oh my goodness
yeah<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.590> can<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.189> good<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.490> practice

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
yeah so you can in it's good to practice

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.969 
yeah so you can in it's good to practice
doing<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.270> anywhere<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:49.439> there<00:01:49.530> are

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
doing this anywhere but there are

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.469 
doing this anywhere but there are
multiple<00:01:50.280> variables<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.659> one<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:53.479> when

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
multiple variables in this one like when

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.450 
multiple variables in this one like when
you<00:01:54.600> pick<00:01:54.750> up<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.990> bomb

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.180 

how<00:01:58.330> fast<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:59.290> bomb<00:01:59.440> makes<00:01:59.740> you<00:01:59.860> go<00:01:59.979> because

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
how fast the bomb makes you go because

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.830 
how fast the bomb makes you go because
they're<00:02:00.400> different<00:02:00.640> because<00:02:01.030> when<00:02:01.210> depending

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
they're different because when depending

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.570 
they're different because when depending
on<00:02:01.930> when<00:02:02.020> you<00:02:02.080> pick<00:02:02.290> up<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.470> bomb<00:02:02.680> it'll<00:02:03.460> be<00:02:03.550> a

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
on when you pick up the bomb it'll be a

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.460 
on when you pick up the bomb it'll be a
different<00:02:03.729> size<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.300> bigger<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:04.690> bomb<00:02:04.870> is<00:02:05.170> a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
different size the bigger the bomb is a

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.050 
different size the bigger the bomb is a
faster<00:02:06.100> you'll<00:02:06.310> go<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:09.190> let's<00:02:09.700> see<00:02:09.850> if<00:02:09.970> I

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
faster you'll go and so let's see if I

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.940 
faster you'll go and so let's see if I
can<00:02:10.300> show<00:02:11.110> you<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.320> okay<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:11.860> remember

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
can show you that okay you remember

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.949 
can show you that okay you remember
earlier<00:02:12.490> when<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.730> threw<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.270> bomb<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.810> I

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
earlier when I threw the bomb and I

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.340 
earlier when I threw the bomb and I
caught<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:15.070> was<00:02:16.140> normal<00:02:17.140> size<00:02:17.320> I

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
caught it and it was normal size I

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.380 
caught it and it was normal size I
didn't<00:02:17.680> blow<00:02:17.800> up<00:02:17.890> well<00:02:18.280> if<00:02:18.490> you<00:02:18.610> can<00:02:19.030> blow<00:02:19.209> it

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
didn't blow up well if you can blow it

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.449 
didn't blow up well if you can blow it
up<00:02:19.510> but<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:19.810> can<00:02:19.959> catch<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.470> few<00:02:21.040> frames

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
up but you can catch it a few frames

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.920 
up but you can catch it a few frames
after<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.330> it'll<00:02:22.480> be<00:02:22.600> just<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.840> little

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
after that and it'll be just a little

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.900 
after that and it'll be just a little
bit<00:02:23.110> bigger<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.530> you'll<00:02:23.800> move<00:02:23.980> relatively

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
bit bigger and you'll move relatively

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.650 
bit bigger and you'll move relatively
slow<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:26.070> this<00:02:27.070> trick<00:02:27.370> is<00:02:27.610> it's<00:02:28.330> really<00:02:28.570> hard

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
slow and this trick is it's really hard

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.430 
slow and this trick is it's really hard
all<00:02:29.020> right

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
all right

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.080 
all right
not<00:02:29.770> this<00:02:30.040> is<00:02:30.250> probably<00:02:30.580> one<00:02:30.760> of<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.850> harder

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
not this is probably one of the harder

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.760 
not this is probably one of the harder
tricks<00:02:31.270> by<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.200> way<00:02:32.380> I'm<00:02:32.440> going<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.620> show<00:02:32.680> you

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
tricks by the way I'm going to show you

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.320 
tricks by the way I'm going to show you
this<00:02:32.890> neat<00:02:33.310> neat<00:02:33.730> trick

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
this neat neat trick

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.740 
this neat neat trick
boom<00:02:35.170> look<00:02:35.950> at<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.250> he's<00:02:36.910> just<00:02:37.090> like<00:02:37.209> flying

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
boom look at that he's just like flying

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.229 
boom look at that he's just like flying
up<00:02:37.840> there

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
up there

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.030 
up there
alright<00:02:40.239> so<00:02:41.080> good<00:02:41.320> way<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.440> practice<00:02:41.860> this<00:02:41.980> is

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
alright so good way to practice this is

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.930 
alright so good way to practice this is
just<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:43.770> just<00:02:44.770> try<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.040> catch<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.459> bomb<00:02:45.640> out

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
just to just try and catch the bomb out

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.630 
just to just try and catch the bomb out
on<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.360> field

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.790 

just<00:02:51.640> grab<00:02:51.820> it<00:02:51.850> jump<00:02:52.360> twice<00:02:52.540> throw<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.380> and

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
just grab it jump twice throw it and

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.610 
just grab it jump twice throw it and
catch<00:02:54.640> it

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
catch it

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.930 
catch it
the<00:02:56.620> other<00:02:56.739> variables<00:02:57.250> in<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:57.489> or<00:02:57.670> like<00:02:57.760> how

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
the other variables in this or like how

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.410 
the other variables in this or like how
high<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.209> jump<00:03:00.480> how<00:03:01.480> fast<00:03:01.810> you're<00:03:02.080> going<00:03:02.110> like

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
high you jump how fast you're going like

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.520 
high you jump how fast you're going like
okay<00:03:04.420> if<00:03:04.540> I'm<00:03:04.720> going<00:03:05.110> I<00:03:05.730> reload<00:03:06.930> if<00:03:07.930> I'm<00:03:08.140> going

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
okay if I'm going I reload if I'm going

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.500 
okay if I'm going I reload if I'm going
this<00:03:09.010> slow<00:03:10.230> then<00:03:11.230> obviously<00:03:11.910> bomb<00:03:12.910> speed<00:03:13.420> is

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
this slow then obviously bomb speed is

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.990 
this slow then obviously bomb speed is
gonna<00:03:13.690> be<00:03:13.780> different<00:03:13.959> than<00:03:14.230> when<00:03:14.350> I'm<00:03:14.440> going

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
gonna be different than when I'm going

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.069 
gonna be different than when I'm going
that<00:03:16.000> fast<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:18.130> this<00:03:19.030> trick<00:03:19.299> this<00:03:19.600> trick<00:03:19.840> has

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
that fast so this trick this trick has

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:25.530 
that fast so this trick this trick has
like<00:03:20.350> multiple<00:03:21.220> variables<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:25.180> like<00:03:25.360> I<00:03:25.390> said

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
like multiple variables so like I said

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.960 
like multiple variables so like I said
jump<00:03:26.320> twice<00:03:26.530> right<00:03:26.950> after<00:03:27.220> you<00:03:27.310> jump<00:03:27.579> the

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
jump twice right after you jump the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.580 
jump twice right after you jump the
second<00:03:28.570> time<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:28.840> want<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.049> throw<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.440> bomb

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
second time you want to throw the bomb

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.449 
second time you want to throw the bomb
so<00:03:30.430> it's<00:03:30.700> not<00:03:30.820> like<00:03:31.090> jump<00:03:31.810> come<00:03:32.230> throw<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:32.829> mean

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
so it's not like jump come throw I mean

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:34.050 
so it's not like jump come throw I mean
you<00:03:33.549> could<00:03:33.670> do<00:03:33.760> with<00:03:33.880> that

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
you could do with that

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.720 
you could do with that
I<00:03:34.239> guess<00:03:34.660> that<00:03:34.840> looks<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.890> looks<00:03:36.100> proper<00:03:36.549> but

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
I guess that looks it looks proper but

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.600 
I guess that looks it looks proper but
it's<00:03:37.299> kind<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.570> easier<00:03:37.959> I<00:03:38.230> think<00:03:38.620> to<00:03:39.040> jump<00:03:39.400> and

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
it's kind of easier I think to jump and

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.060 
it's kind of easier I think to jump and
then<00:03:39.730> jump<00:03:39.910> through<00:03:40.180> instead<00:03:41.140> of<00:03:41.260> just<00:03:41.350> at<00:03:41.950> the

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
then jump through instead of just at the

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.229 
then jump through instead of just at the
same<00:03:42.220> time<00:03:42.400> what's<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.670> foot<00:03:42.940> I<00:03:43.180> just<00:03:43.360> do<00:03:44.160> so

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
same time what's the foot I just do so

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.569 
same time what's the foot I just do so
this<00:03:46.380> because<00:03:47.380> then<00:03:47.560> see<00:03:47.739> you<00:03:47.860> go<00:03:47.950> way<00:03:48.190> too<00:03:48.250> far

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
this because then see you go way too far

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.350 
this because then see you go way too far
ahead<00:03:48.700> of<00:03:48.880> the<00:03:49.030> bomb<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:51.340> one<00:03:51.610> if<00:03:52.209> you

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
ahead of the bomb and this one if you

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.650 
ahead of the bomb and this one if you
let<00:03:52.660> go<00:03:52.810> of

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
let go of

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.570 
let go of
that<00:03:54.050> you<00:03:54.170> know<00:03:54.260> if<00:03:54.560> you<00:03:54.710> let<00:03:54.890> go<00:03:55.040> of<00:03:55.160> the

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
that you know if you let go of the

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.260 
that you know if you let go of the
direction<00:03:56.030> you're<00:03:56.150> moving<00:03:57.700> see<00:03:58.700> that's<00:03:59.090> what

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
direction you're moving see that's what

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.150 
direction you're moving see that's what
I<00:03:59.300> see<00:03:59.660> this<00:03:59.870> this<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.590> speed<00:04:00.830> of<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.010> bomb

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
I see this this the speed of the bomb

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.610 
I see this this the speed of the bomb
won't<00:04:01.400> get<00:04:01.610> you<00:04:01.700> through<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.000> gate<00:04:02.620> that's

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
won't get you through the gate that's

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.680 
won't get you through the gate that's
what<00:04:03.950> I<00:04:04.010> was<00:04:04.130> talking<00:04:04.280> about<00:04:04.430> sighs<00:04:04.820> the<00:04:05.030> bomb

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.410 

really<00:04:08.690> this<00:04:08.990> trick<00:04:09.200> dish<00:04:09.380> requires<00:04:09.770> like

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
really this trick dish requires like

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.340 
really this trick dish requires like
boatloads<00:04:11.420> practice<00:04:13.030> because<00:04:14.350> actually

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
boatloads practice because actually

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.699 
boatloads practice because actually
being<00:04:15.890> able<00:04:16.040> to<00:04:16.220> a<00:04:16.790> bomb<00:04:17.450> jump<00:04:18.170> twice<00:04:18.380> through

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
being able to a bomb jump twice through

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.320 
being able to a bomb jump twice through
it<00:04:19.150> and<00:04:20.150> catch<00:04:20.570> it<00:04:20.650> is<00:04:21.650> hard<00:04:21.890> all<00:04:22.250> right<00:04:22.520> so

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
it and catch it is hard all right so

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.730 
it and catch it is hard all right so
when<00:04:23.780> it<00:04:23.870> comes<00:04:23.990> to<00:04:24.050> actually<00:04:24.350> doing<00:04:24.380> the

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
when it comes to actually doing the

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.460 
when it comes to actually doing the
trick<00:04:25.360> you've<00:04:26.360> got<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.690> catch<00:04:26.840> it<00:04:26.870> later<00:04:27.230> than

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
trick you've got to catch it later than

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.720 
trick you've got to catch it later than
I<00:04:27.560> did<00:04:27.770> there<00:04:28.210> you<00:04:29.210> got<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.360> look<00:04:29.800> you<00:04:30.800> gotta<00:04:30.950> go

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
I did there you got a look you gotta go

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.320 
I did there you got a look you gotta go
grab<00:04:32.000> it

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
grab it

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.480 
grab it
all<00:04:32.930> right<00:04:33.050> hold<00:04:33.770> left<00:04:34.310> jump<00:04:34.760> twice<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:36.490> what

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
all right hold left jump twice and what

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.310 
all right hold left jump twice and what
I<00:04:37.550> usually<00:04:38.090> do<00:04:38.600> is<00:04:39.140> right<00:04:39.770> when<00:04:39.980> I<00:04:41.230> jump<00:04:42.230> the

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
I usually do is right when I jump the

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.860 
I usually do is right when I jump the
second<00:04:42.800> time<00:04:42.980> I<00:04:43.250> will<00:04:43.460> let<00:04:43.670> go<00:04:43.970> and<00:04:44.690> when<00:04:44.840> I

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
second time I will let go and when I

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.900 
second time I will let go and when I
land<00:04:45.170> I<00:04:45.320> move<00:04:45.500> forward<00:04:45.980> and<00:04:46.160> when<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:46.430> bomb<00:04:46.610> is

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
land I move forward and when the bomb is

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.570 
land I move forward and when the bomb is
about<00:04:47.240> to<00:04:47.450> push<00:04:47.720> me<00:04:47.930> out<00:04:47.960> of<00:04:48.170> the<00:04:48.230> way<00:04:48.350> I<00:04:48.620> hit

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
about to push me out of the way I hit

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.170 
about to push me out of the way I hit
down<00:04:49.880> and<00:04:50.660> what<00:04:50.810> this<00:04:50.930> does<00:04:51.170> is<00:04:51.700> it<00:04:52.700> turns<00:04:52.940> it

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
down and what this does is it turns it

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.870 
down and what this does is it turns it
allows<00:04:53.390> me<00:04:53.540> to<00:04:53.660> look<00:04:53.840> down<00:04:54.250> but<00:04:55.250> get<00:04:55.520> still<00:04:55.760> get

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
allows me to look down but get still get

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.520 
allows me to look down but get still get
pushed<00:04:56.180> upwards<00:04:56.660> to<00:04:56.870> where<00:04:56.990> I<00:04:57.020> can<00:04:57.230> grab<00:04:57.350> it

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
pushed upwards to where I can grab it

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.020 
pushed upwards to where I can grab it
the<00:04:57.590> reason<00:04:57.710> you<00:04:57.920> want<00:04:58.070> to<00:04:58.100> look<00:04:58.280> towards<00:04:58.910> the

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
the reason you want to look towards the

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.620 
the reason you want to look towards the
camera<00:04:59.330> which<00:04:59.810> is<00:04:59.960> down<00:05:00.170> is<00:05:00.470> because<00:05:01.630> though

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
camera which is down is because though

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.690 
camera which is down is because though
that<00:05:02.930> way<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.380> bomb<00:05:03.590> will<00:05:03.830> already<00:05:04.190> push<00:05:04.550> you

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
that way the bomb will already push you

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.300 
that way the bomb will already push you
along<00:05:04.820> here<00:05:05.300> and<00:05:05.870> when<00:05:06.770> it<00:05:06.860> pushes<00:05:07.010> you<00:05:07.190> along

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
along here and when it pushes you along

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.280 
along here and when it pushes you along
here<00:05:07.700> you'll<00:05:07.880> be<00:05:08.000> right<00:05:08.210> here<00:05:08.510> and<00:05:08.660> then

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
here you'll be right here and then

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.930 
here you'll be right here and then
you'll<00:05:09.830> be<00:05:09.919> facing<00:05:10.160> this<00:05:10.490> way<00:05:10.550> and<00:05:10.700> you<00:05:10.910> can

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
you'll be facing this way and you can

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.310 
you'll be facing this way and you can
just<00:05:11.150> chuck<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.510> bomb<00:05:11.690> and<00:05:12.050> you'll<00:05:12.230> go

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
just chuck the bomb and you'll go

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.250 
just chuck the bomb and you'll go
through<00:05:12.530> the<00:05:12.620> wall<00:05:13.030> sometimes<00:05:14.030> if<00:05:14.930> you<00:05:16.000> if<00:05:17.260> you

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
through the wall sometimes if you if you

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.100 
through the wall sometimes if you if you
don't<00:05:18.440> well<00:05:18.860> actually<00:05:19.520> I<00:05:19.910> guess<00:05:20.600> it's<00:05:20.840> just<00:05:20.870> uh

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
don't well actually I guess it's just uh

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.159 
don't well actually I guess it's just uh
there's<00:05:21.440> some<00:05:22.010> times<00:05:22.190> you<00:05:22.310> can<00:05:22.460> fail<00:05:22.730> and

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
there's some times you can fail and

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.090 
there's some times you can fail and
it'll<00:05:24.169> push<00:05:24.320> it<00:05:24.470> back<00:05:24.560> to<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:24.770> wall<00:05:24.950> and<00:05:25.040> just

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
it'll push it back to the wall and just

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.860 
it'll push it back to the wall and just
make<00:05:25.340> sure<00:05:25.370> you<00:05:25.610> go<00:05:26.210> to<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.419> other<00:05:26.570> side<00:05:26.780> of

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
make sure you go to the other side of

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.770 
make sure you go to the other side of
the<00:05:26.960> wall<00:05:27.080> fast<00:05:27.550> see<00:05:28.550> this<00:05:29.300> won't<00:05:29.480> get<00:05:29.600> you

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
the wall fast see this won't get you

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.620 
the wall fast see this won't get you
through<00:05:30.370> because<00:05:31.370> it's<00:05:31.790> you<00:05:32.360> don't<00:05:32.450> move

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
through because it's you don't move

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.750 
through because it's you don't move
faster<00:05:33.080> so<00:05:34.010> that<00:05:34.040> means<00:05:34.250> I<00:05:34.310> gotta<00:05:34.490> catch<00:05:34.730> it

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
faster so that means I gotta catch it

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.980 
faster so that means I gotta catch it
later<00:05:35.210> so<00:05:37.180> see<00:05:38.180> that's<00:05:38.300> still<00:05:38.540> not<00:05:38.630> that's<00:05:38.840> too

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
later so see that's still not that's too

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.760 
later so see that's still not that's too
still<00:05:39.320> too<00:05:39.470> late

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
still too late

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.950 
still too late
like<00:05:41.520> I<00:05:41.550> said<00:05:41.820> this<00:05:41.910> trick<00:05:42.120> is<00:05:42.240> difficult<00:05:42.810> but

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
like I said this trick is difficult but

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.130 
like I said this trick is difficult but
at<00:05:43.020> least<00:05:43.080> I'm<00:05:43.260> catching<00:05:43.560> the<00:05:43.650> ball<00:05:43.800> now<00:05:44.040> oh

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
at least I'm catching the ball now oh

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:14.730 
know how hard this is and then let go

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.900 
know how hard this is and then let go
and<00:06:15.200> then<00:06:16.250> right<00:06:17.250> on<00:06:17.370> the<00:06:17.460> ball<00:06:17.610> that's<00:06:17.760> about

and then right on the ball that's about

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.590 
and then right on the ball that's about
it<00:06:18.180> and<00:06:19.190> then<00:06:20.190> why<00:06:20.520> will<00:06:20.670> you<00:06:20.820> write<00:06:21.240> when<00:06:21.450> you
