events<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:15.679> I<00:01:16.100> just<00:01:16.670> continued<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.179> kind<00:01:17.330> of

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
events and I just continued to kind of

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.240 
events and I just continued to kind of
get<00:01:17.600> worse<00:01:17.780> over<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.679> summer<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.130> then

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
get worse over the summer and then

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.919 
get worse over the summer and then
coming<00:01:19.520> into<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:19.850> fall<00:01:20.030> and<00:01:21.429> so<00:01:22.429> in<00:01:23.270> October<00:01:23.509> I

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
coming into the fall and so in October I

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.139 
coming into the fall and so in October I
believe<00:01:24.050> I<00:01:24.560> had<00:01:24.770> another<00:01:25.520> just<00:01:25.850> little

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
believe I had another just little

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.859 
believe I had another just little
surgery<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.780> clean<00:01:27.020> it<00:01:27.229> out<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:29.390> plan<00:01:29.630> was

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
surgery to clean it out and the plan was

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.809 
surgery to clean it out and the plan was
for<00:01:30.200> me<00:01:30.229> to<00:01:30.319> just<00:01:30.590> do<00:01:30.709> bars<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:31.310> as<00:01:31.429> soon<00:01:31.610> as<00:01:31.700> I

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
came out I wasn't really happy with that

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.190

which doesn't seem like a lot but I've
been<00:02:08.250> doing<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.580> fall<00:02:08.789> since<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.390> was<00:02:10.110> about

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
been doing this fall since I was about

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.890 
been doing this fall since I was about
12<00:02:10.500> years<00:02:10.709> old<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.670> don't<00:02:12.120> really<00:02:12.450> need<00:02:12.720> to

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
12 years old so I don't really need to

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.420 
12 years old so I don't really need to
do<00:02:13.019> it<00:02:13.170> very<00:02:13.349> much<00:02:13.590> I<00:02:13.709> mean<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.950> first<00:02:14.160> meet<00:02:14.400> I

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
do it very much I mean the first meet I

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.250 
do it very much I mean the first meet I
think<00:02:14.700> everybody<00:02:15.030> could<00:02:15.120> tell<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:15.780> hadn't

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
think everybody could tell that I hadn't

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.809 
think everybody could tell that I hadn't
trained<00:02:16.470> as<00:02:16.590> much<00:02:16.739> as<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:16.950> did<00:02:17.190> last<00:02:17.220> year<00:02:17.549> it

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
trained as much as I did last year it

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.410 
trained as much as I did last year it
wasn't<00:02:17.970> my<00:02:18.209> usual<00:02:18.500> stuck<00:02:19.500> ball<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:20.459> know<00:02:20.610> to

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.020 
wasn't my usual stuck ball you know to
start<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:21.780> team<00:02:21.930> off<00:02:22.140> but<00:02:22.530> each<00:02:23.129> week<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.849> think

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
start the team off but each week I think

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.229 
start the team off but each week I think
it's<00:02:24.390> getting<00:02:24.629> stronger<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.819> last<00:02:26.819> week<00:02:27.120> is

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
it's getting stronger and last week is

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.640 
it's getting stronger and last week is
definitely<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.660> lot<00:02:28.080> better<00:02:28.200> than<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.500> first

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
definitely a lot better than the first

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.920 
definitely a lot better than the first
week<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.099> I<00:02:29.340> just<00:02:29.519> listen<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.450> my<00:02:30.540> coaches<00:02:30.900> a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
week so I just listen to my coaches a

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.680 
week so I just listen to my coaches a
lot<00:02:31.170> like<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:32.069> have<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.489> tendency<00:02:32.849> to<00:02:33.209> rush<00:02:33.480> when

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
lot like I have a tendency to rush when

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.509 
lot like I have a tendency to rush when
I<00:02:33.750> get<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.049> competition<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:34.650> Jay<00:02:35.190> always

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
I get in the competition so Jay always

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.030 
I get in the competition so Jay always
tells<00:02:35.970> me<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.420> like<00:02:36.599> just<00:02:37.260> take<00:02:37.410> my<00:02:37.560> run<00:02:37.739> easy

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
tells me to like just take my run easy

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.280 
tells me to like just take my run easy
and<00:02:38.400> slow<00:02:38.549> down<00:02:38.849> and<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:39.540> know<00:02:39.569> focus<00:02:39.989> on<00:02:40.110> just

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
and slow down and you know focus on just

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.020 
and slow down and you know focus on just
the<00:02:40.440> technique<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.160> know<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.519> I<00:02:41.760> have

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
the technique that I know that I have

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.600 
the technique that I know that I have
that<00:02:42.390> they've<00:02:43.019> had<00:02:43.230> for<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.099> many<00:02:44.190> years<00:02:44.459> since

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
that they've had for so many years since

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.979 
that they've had for so many years since
I've<00:02:44.819> been<00:02:44.849> doing<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.239> for<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.510> long<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.750> just

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
I've been doing it for so long and just

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.289 
I've been doing it for so long and just
focus<00:02:46.260> on<00:02:46.379> that<00:02:46.440> instead<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:47.940> kind<00:02:48.239> of

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
focus on that instead of like kind of

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.000 
focus on that instead of like kind of
letting<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.629> emotions<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.379> hype<00:02:49.560> get<00:02:49.890> me

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
letting the emotions and the hype get me

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.800 
letting the emotions and the hype get me
all<00:02:50.160> pumped<00:02:50.190> up<00:02:50.579> sometimes<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.510> causes

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
all pumped up sometimes that that causes

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.200 
all pumped up sometimes that that causes
me<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.019> rush
