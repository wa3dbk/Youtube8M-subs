00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.270 
now Cory we come across a lot of the
markers<00:01:42.509> out<00:01:42.659> there<00:01:42.869> today<00:01:43.049> really<00:01:43.979> what<00:01:44.159> are

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
markers out there today really what are

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.880 
markers out there today really what are
we<00:01:44.340> looking<00:01:44.640> those<00:01:44.790> for<00:01:45.090> well<00:01:45.899> yeah<00:01:46.290> if<00:01:46.619> we<00:01:46.740> go

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
we looking those for well yeah if we go

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.529 
we looking those for well yeah if we go
outside<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.430> those<00:01:47.520> cave<00:01:47.850> wind<00:01:48.090> up<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
outside of those cave wind up in the

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.960 
outside of those cave wind up in the
sand<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.140> think<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.619> best<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:50.130> stay<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
sand so I think it's best to stay in the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.789 
sand so I think it's best to stay in the
mark<00:01:51.180> channels<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.840> all<00:01:52.350> should<00:01:52.649> be<00:01:52.680> good

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
mark channels and all should be good

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.520 
mark channels and all should be good
then<00:01:53.789> when<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.090> end<00:01:54.270> up<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.720> scene<00:01:54.960> you're
