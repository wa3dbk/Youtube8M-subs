 so on I'm almost uncomfortable 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:51.090

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.740
 just do not want to go home 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.600

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.290

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.540
 shipbuilding of the bdb andrÃ© or the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.540
 professor 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.380
 in all honesty that this is unfortunate 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.450
 when you grow up in such a family 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.250
 the spectacle wearer of the project 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.440
 nothing to do at all 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.030
 It 's the second year I'm wearing 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.369
 a glasses because I sometimes in the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.470

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.739
 to get to know the whole family 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.690

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.459
 Shakespeare collage did so 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.600
 always short excerpts from the right 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.640
 to apply for big checks 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.170

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.989
 my mother is allowed to come 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.720

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.890
 was so nervous and was so beautiful 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.209
 sascha had the end of the first act me 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.600
 because you also have a short first name 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.700
 the sascha soon played the door 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.170

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.800
 turn back and so on anyway 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.320
