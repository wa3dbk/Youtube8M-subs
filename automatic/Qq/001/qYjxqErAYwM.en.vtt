this routine or this way of applying

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.159 
this routine or this way of applying
your<00:04:52.280> foundation<00:04:53.199> it<00:04:54.199> also<00:04:54.530> allows<00:04:55.280> you<00:04:55.550> to

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
use less Foundation and in that case

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:08.260 
use less Foundation and in that case
your<00:05:02.180> foundation<00:05:02.690> lasts<00:05:02.930> so<00:05:03.650> much<00:05:03.710> longer<00:05:07.270> so

I'm just gonna take a little bit let me
back<00:05:12.380> up<00:05:12.410> my<00:05:12.770> hand<00:05:13.009> like<00:05:13.190> this<00:05:13.250> and<00:05:14.590> I'm<00:05:15.590> gonna

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
back up my hand like this and I'm gonna

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:22.050 
back up my hand like this and I'm gonna
use<00:05:15.889> my<00:05:15.919> fingers<00:05:20.199> and<00:05:21.199> then<00:05:21.380> I'm<00:05:21.530> just<00:05:21.770> gonna

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
use my fingers and then I'm just gonna

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.200 
use my fingers and then I'm just gonna
go<00:05:23.060> over<00:05:23.389> that<00:05:24.260> I'm<00:05:25.100> doing<00:05:25.340> it<00:05:25.520> section<00:05:26.030> by

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
go over that I'm doing it section by

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:33.530 
go over that I'm doing it section by
section

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.300 

and<00:05:33.810> that<00:05:34.320> we<00:05:34.910> the<00:05:35.910> foundation<00:05:36.720> dries<00:05:37.170> so<00:05:38.070> much

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
and that we the foundation dries so much

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.720 
and that we the foundation dries so much
easier<00:05:38.880> as<00:05:39.530> we<00:05:40.530> already<00:05:40.800> applied<00:05:40.950> all<00:05:41.580> our

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
easier as we already applied all our

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:48.770 
easier as we already applied all our
primer<00:05:42.620> or<00:05:43.640> mattifying<00:05:44.640> gel<00:05:45.030> and<00:05:47.150> the<00:05:48.150> setting

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
primer or mattifying gel and the setting

00:05:48.780 --> 00:06:00.879 
primer or mattifying gel and the setting
powder

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:00.889 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:06.629 

so<00:06:01.490> the<00:06:01.969> foundation<00:06:02.509> goes<00:06:02.719> on<00:06:03.159> seamlessly<00:06:04.840> as

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
so the foundation goes on seamlessly as

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:19.410 
so the foundation goes on seamlessly as
you<00:06:07.639> can<00:06:07.849> see<00:06:08.120> and<00:06:09.159> so<00:06:10.159> much<00:06:10.400> quicker

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.420 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.780 

oh<00:06:19.620> you<00:06:20.620> don't<00:06:20.950> have<00:06:21.070> to<00:06:21.220> use<00:06:21.310> your<00:06:21.460> fingers
