00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:14.719
 hello dear friends of me 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.110
 asked to talk about how to live 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.789
 children here 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.519
 answering very short 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.609
 children live well here in general 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:29.619
 It is believed that Canada is the perfect place to 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:33.140
 children and old people because everything is here 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.660
 built so that old men and 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.019
 the children were as comfortable as possible 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.250
 conditions for if we are talking about children then 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:46.190
 children have plenty of opportunities 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.399
 for self-development in schools there 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.739
 a large number of circles 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.479
 where can i specialize in 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.949
 any science or engage 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:59.360
 there is a lot of creativity in school 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.100
 number of social workers and 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.729
 psychologists who tell 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.930
 about what children have rights and 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:13.299
 cares about their mental health as if 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.700
 physical way important point is that 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:20.950
 Children here school tells about their 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:24.850
 rights and asked to speak enough 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.520
 hard form ask about if they have 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:32.259
 problems in the house that is whether they shout 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.090
 their parents punish them 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.520
 physically that is computer by 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.850
 anything because according to local laws 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.399
 if the parents beat the children then 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.740
 accordingly it is a bell right away 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:49.539
 child protection 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.450
 in particular come the police neighbors 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:55.360
 can the top calmly call the police 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.229
 if they see a child being treated 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:03.250
 something wrong and the police can just 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.740
 take the baby up and tackle the special 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.739
 guardianship the child may be 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.929
 parents don't see a special boarding school 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:15.730
 no and the market will not have access giving birth 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.650
 child also many things that are there on 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.560
 territory of the former committing completely 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.450
 logical and normal is prohibited 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.640
 it is forbidden to do in particular let's say 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.120
 is prohibited from baby cotton wool dairy 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.310
 teeth fall out is forbidden to pull out 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.450
 these teeth are children that is medical 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.760
 assistance in dentistry 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.030
 whatever they have any help not 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.790
 was supposed to render teach on 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.629
 licensed by certified doctors 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.629
 if they find out that 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:52.510
 parents pulled the baby tooth well 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.489
 they say that even it is almost criminal 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.010
 criminal case and for that you can really 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.890
 go to jail 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.650
 what else important point is that it is impossible 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.230
 leave a child under the age of 14 at home 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.480
 unsupervised ie a child under 14 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.340
 must stay in the house 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.980
 only with some adult if 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.200
 there is no adult then again sit in 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.390
 the neighboring can push this down 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.030
 here is quite a normal thing 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:24.130
 have a citizen responsible care 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:26.549
 oh baby this is only encouraged again 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.920
 same take the police and 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.930
 child can pick in and give birth and then 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.299
 may be problems due to careless 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:41.860
 large child relationships are prohibited 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:44.380
 children leave cars on tv 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.840
 regularly show plots when 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.829
 some not for his parents leave 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.780
 baby baby may even die there 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:56.700
 suffocate something else there pressed 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.079
 let's say in the summer such things happen and if 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.239
 someone from vigilant citizens again 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.799
 believes the car is parked somewhere near 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.530
 shopping center in it is a child 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.750
 in the car except for the child there is no one 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.090
 again this is a reason to call the police 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.829
 reason for the police to come and 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.750
 freed the child and punished the parents with 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:21.609
 such an attitude 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.500
 further that in the morning as you as you see 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.610
 plot goes to punish a large number 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:31.990
 school buses of all children who 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:35.430
 live far from school or on uncomfortable 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.660
 routes take these school buses 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:42.430
 school bus on ravan sedan and 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:45.490
 no one can see the children themselves 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.440
 in the morning and evening about this pretty 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.710
 so busy traffic on the road because 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.710
 what 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.669
 buses stop when 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.740
 stop and the school bus is all 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.199
 the movement is also obliged to stop among 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.050
 wait while in this how much school 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.710
 bus about and landings will occur and 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.430
 landings 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.430
 children 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.930
 Well, actually all I said was all this 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.230
 tell school uniform in schools not 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.360
 sure some schools 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.980
 private in particular they introduce their 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.980
 own export 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:25.430
 sports school uniform with emblem 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:28.360
 school well again this is a lot of photodiode 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.360
 lining on the school usually school they 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.990
 this suffer 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.219
 and for this I wish you all a good day 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.219
 all good-bye
