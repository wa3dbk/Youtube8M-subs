then we move again like before from
Caesar<00:04:14.080> we<00:04:14.319> went<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.830> see<00:04:15.010> some<00:04:15.190> progress<00:04:15.340> now

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
we start from a star when we got to see

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.830 
we start from a star when we got to see
some<00:04:18.609> over<00:04:18.820> F<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.480> rest<00:04:19.690> are<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.900> same<00:04:20.380> so

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:33.750 

the<00:04:26.790> Caesar<00:04:30.780> so<00:04:31.780> this<00:04:32.110> is<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:33.220> main<00:04:33.460> thing

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
the Caesar so this is the main thing

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.240 
the Caesar so this is the main thing
that<00:04:33.790> is<00:04:34.060> going<00:04:34.330> on<00:04:34.480> all<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.470> time<00:04:35.500> that

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
that is going on all the time that

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.550 
that is going on all the time that
English<00:04:36.640> song<00:04:36.850> speak<00:04:37.210> one<00:04:37.419> more<00:04:37.450> time<00:04:37.810> a<00:04:38.110> bit

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
English song speak one more time a bit

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:50.909 
English song speak one more time a bit
slower

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:05:21.490 

so

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.960 

so<00:05:22.500> this<00:05:22.830> is<00:05:22.949> what's<00:05:23.129> going<00:05:23.340> on<00:05:23.460> in<00:05:23.639> adverts

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
so this is what's going on in adverts

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.969 
so this is what's going on in adverts
now<00:05:24.150> in<00:05:24.270> the<00:05:24.360> course<00:05:24.629> you<00:05:24.780> can<00:05:25.080> do<00:05:25.409> exactly<00:05:25.620> the

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
now in the course you can do exactly the

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.580 
now in the course you can do exactly the
same<00:05:26.009> thing<00:05:26.370> just<00:05:26.550> we<00:05:27.240> can<00:05:27.419> add<00:05:27.599> a<00:05:27.960> few<00:05:28.020> more

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
same thing just we can add a few more

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:36.890 
same thing just we can add a few more
keys<00:05:29.039> for<00:05:29.669> for<00:05:29.849> example<00:05:35.599> first<00:05:36.599> quarter

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
keys for for example first quarter

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.909 
keys for for example first quarter
system<00:05:38.060> in<00:05:39.060> after<00:05:39.539> we<00:05:39.780> can<00:05:39.930> happen<00:05:40.259> so<00:05:40.440> this<00:05:40.560> is

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
system in after we can happen so this is

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:51.200 
system in after we can happen so this is
up<00:05:41.069> on<00:05:41.220> the<00:05:41.340> right<00:05:41.520> hand<00:05:49.370> same<00:05:50.370> dessert<00:05:50.940> you

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
up on the right hand same dessert you

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.270 
up on the right hand same dessert you
can<00:05:51.240> at<00:05:51.599> least<00:05:51.629> this<00:05:52.379> dessert<00:05:52.860> on<00:05:53.039> the<00:05:53.129> right

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
can at least this dessert on the right

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.689 
can at least this dessert on the right
hand<00:05:55.789> and<00:05:57.050> also<00:05:58.050> in<00:05:58.110> the<00:05:58.259> itself<00:05:58.650> and<00:05:59.039> this<00:05:59.370> F

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
hand and also in the itself and this F

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.270 
hand and also in the itself and this F
so<00:06:00.690> the<00:06:01.110> only<00:06:01.229> difference<00:06:01.440> between<00:06:01.770> the

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
so the only difference between the

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.450 
so the only difference between the
version<00:06:02.639> the<00:06:02.729> courses<00:06:03.120> are<00:06:03.240> in<00:06:03.419> the<00:06:03.539> course

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
version the courses are in the course

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.029 
version the courses are in the course
after<00:06:05.460> we<00:06:05.969> cannot<00:06:06.240> miss<00:06:06.870> this<00:06:07.199> decision<00:06:07.860> on

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
after we cannot miss this decision on

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:11.540 
after we cannot miss this decision on
the<00:06:08.129> right<00:06:08.310> hand<00:06:08.960> in<00:06:09.960> G<00:06:10.319> sub<00:06:10.590> major<00:06:10.889> we<00:06:11.190> can<00:06:11.370> add

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
the right hand in G sub major we can add

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.959 
the right hand in G sub major we can add
this<00:06:11.789> research<00:06:12.419> on<00:06:12.629> the<00:06:12.719> right<00:06:12.870> hand<00:06:13.639> in<00:06:14.639> a

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:14.969 
this research on the right hand in a

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:16.820 
this research on the right hand in a
sharp<00:06:15.330> major<00:06:15.509> we<00:06:15.840> can<00:06:15.990> add<00:06:16.110> this<00:06:16.259> tab<00:06:16.560> right

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
sharp major we can add this tab right

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:29.019 
sharp major we can add this tab right
rest<00:06:17.729> are<00:06:17.879> exactly<00:06:18.300> the<00:06:18.419> same<00:06:18.449> so

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:29.029 

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:31.329 

so<00:06:29.569> keep<00:06:29.869> doing<00:06:29.899> exactly<00:06:30.409> the<00:06:30.860> same<00:06:31.099> thing

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:31.339 
so keep doing exactly the same thing

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:32.949 
so keep doing exactly the same thing
will<00:06:31.579> be<00:06:31.610> the<00:06:31.789> same<00:06:31.969> thing<00:06:32.149> for<00:06:32.329> as<00:06:32.479> long<00:06:32.629> as<00:06:32.809> is

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:32.959 
will be the same thing for as long as is

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:43.100 
will be the same thing for as long as is
necessary<00:06:33.049> for<00:06:33.559> the<00:06:33.679> chorus

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.900 

so<00:06:44.110> this<00:06:44.290> has<00:06:44.500> played<00:06:44.800> the<00:06:45.280> verse<00:06:45.520> and<00:06:45.820> the

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:45.910 
so this has played the verse and the

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.969 
so this has played the verse and the
course<00:06:46.330> really<00:06:46.810> similar<00:06:47.020> and<00:06:47.440> then<00:06:47.620> after<00:06:47.860> the

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:47.979 
course really similar and then after the

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:49.469 
course really similar and then after the
core<00:06:48.160> you<00:06:48.280> have<00:06:48.310> another<00:06:48.760> part<00:06:49.090> let's<00:06:49.360> see

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 
core you have another part let's see

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:52.050 
core you have another part let's see
what's<00:06:49.660> going<00:06:49.870> on
