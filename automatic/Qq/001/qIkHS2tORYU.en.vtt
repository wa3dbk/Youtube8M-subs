00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:10.780
 Hey-this time I took a video of this kind of shot, and the character of the character matched to the movement of the camera 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:16.020
 I will explain how to compose 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.020
 At first we will place the video material in the current position 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.220
 Let's take a look at 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:29.140
 Something like this 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.789
 a An animation 3d camera that first analyzes this material first 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.890
 Do the track 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:38.970
 Then , it becomes like the analysis in the background, and the progress on the effect panel 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.970
 It is displayed 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:46.860
 Now that the analysis is complete, we will look at it 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.150
 Innumerable on the screen 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.079
 Point is displayed, but to say that it is track point 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.860
 this 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:01.120
 It's a point in the video, it's what you're looking for in action 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.120
 In this point is to 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:09.820
 Make the target size smaller once once composed of 3 points 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:14.670
 It is the noodle which was tied with these 3 points 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.670
 Because you will use it with this sense of perspective 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:23.670
 The one that matches the view of the paas that places this Perth building letter 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.770
 I will choose yet and from the beginning to the end of the video 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.770
 I will search for what is displayed 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.000
 This and this and this is this point 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.000
 from the beggining to the end 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.010
 Keeping track of it without deviation 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.090
 You can buy it 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:59.770
 Then, while shifting this point, 3 points are selected 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.770
 Return the size of the target to the customer 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.270
 so 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:13.640
 Right click on the finished noodle 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.640
 Click on create text and camera in 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.180
 Text and camera are created like this 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.350
 If you move it 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:27.069
 Something like this 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:31.780
 If the camera has become the enemy side 3 d 0 ea was earlier analysis 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.819
 A camera with a god frame set to move in the same way as the camera you shot 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.050
 I will 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.050
 First of all, the enemy 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.190
 I will come 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:48.830
 Since the slope feeling is shifted 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.830
 z-axis rotation z rotation 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.050
 I'll do in the negative feeling 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.349
 You Yes to small because even ear is also large in 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.870
 It feels like 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:17.670
 We will continue to adjust the position in 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.670
 Yes bring before grabbing the z-axis 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.390
 Even where to place 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.490
 Also leave by implanting ear in 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.890
 go likely 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.890
 Toto 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.750
 In addition this layer 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.780
 I will copy to Rory next time 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.319
 eh 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.319
 1 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.010
 Take it 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.610
 Change text characters 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.610
 Suet 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:06.120
 Make the font size slightly smaller 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.120
 I will arrange 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.930
 Then 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.900
 Something like this 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.780
 Mochoi or Mai have seeded 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.849
 I will move in 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.849
 Strike a keyframe to 1 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.340
 Start position at 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.350
 It's long 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.350
 In the housing city 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.830
 I feel like I'm going to slide right now 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:09.050
 Furthermore from animation presets 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.050
 I also put an animation of appearance 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.880
 Text too 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.690
 Animate is good 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.510
 It'll do you a high degree of Katarigeki now 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.659
 With that 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.440
 Something like this 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.990
 It can be synthesized like this 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:46.680
 So now I've combined the aftereffects text, for example here 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:48.630
 If you want to combine graphic material etc in 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.930
 In the same way 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.979
 Track point 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.979
 Choose 3 points 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.729
 Choose to create a plane and a camera 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:06.339
 Then 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:10.810
 It has been arranged plane like this in the previous target instead 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:14.100
 Perth sense in the same way as is roughly just 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:18.200
 While correcting 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.200
 Kazuo placed roughly 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.770
 Set Leave 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:36.280
 It is a feeling and you were the Project panel 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:40.729
 Select the material you want to place 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:46.660
 Select the plane in the timeline 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:49.810
 I will do control o- slash and it and this plane and this 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:56.370
 Material is replaced and arranged 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:59.389
 I like this, I will adjust the position 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.389
 Size is also in scale 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.400
 Something like this 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.900
 I can go on synthesizing like this This time is over, let's meet again
