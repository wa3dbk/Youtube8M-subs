in<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.490> video<00:00:08.849> I'm<00:00:09.360> going<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.630> show<00:00:09.780> you<00:00:09.840> how

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.570 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:10.110> sprout<00:00:10.650> whole<00:00:11.160> grains<00:00:13.219> now<00:00:14.219> it's<00:00:14.370> really

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
to sprout whole grains now it's really

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.970 
to sprout whole grains now it's really
important<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.599> not<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.260> eat<00:00:16.410> whole<00:00:16.650> grains

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
important to not to eat whole grains

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.849 
important to not to eat whole grains
that<00:00:17.310> aren't<00:00:17.609> sprouted<00:00:18.210> or<00:00:18.330> soaked<00:00:18.859> obviously

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
that aren't sprouted or soaked obviously

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.540 
that aren't sprouted or soaked obviously
because<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.630> anti<00:00:22.619> nutrients<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.400> are

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
because of the anti nutrients that are

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.290 
because of the anti nutrients that are
present<00:00:24.150> in<00:00:24.930> whole<00:00:25.230> grains<00:00:25.820> these<00:00:26.820> are<00:00:26.939> really

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
present in whole grains these are really

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.170 
present in whole grains these are really
just<00:00:27.330> seeds<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.699> you<00:00:29.699> know<00:00:30.260> it's<00:00:31.260> like<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:32.180> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
just seeds and you know it's like a the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.240 
just seeds and you know it's like a the
seeds<00:00:33.480> don't<00:00:33.809> want<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.110> be<00:00:34.200> eaten<00:00:34.559> by<00:00:34.920> animals

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
seeds don't want to be eaten by animals

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.540 
seeds don't want to be eaten by animals
they<00:00:36.149> want<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.480> be<00:00:36.899> able<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.550> continue

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
they want to be able to continue

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.540 
they want to be able to continue
reproducing<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.899> they're<00:00:40.559> anti<00:00:40.980> nutrients

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
reproducing so they're anti nutrients

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.970 
reproducing so they're anti nutrients
unless<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.510> seed<00:00:42.719> germinates<00:00:42.899> when<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.620> opens

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
unless the seed germinates when it opens

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.350 
unless the seed germinates when it opens
up<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.660> it's<00:00:45.660> sprouts<00:00:46.280> that's<00:00:47.280> when<00:00:48.000> it's

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
up and it's sprouts that's when it's

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.479 
up and it's sprouts that's when it's
okay<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.960> eat<00:00:50.570> soaking<00:00:51.570> grain<00:00:52.530> simulates<00:00:53.309> that

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
okay to eat soaking grain simulates that

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.040 
okay to eat soaking grain simulates that
it<00:00:53.940> simulates<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.129> germination<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.340> seeds

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
it simulates the germination of seeds

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.569 
it simulates the germination of seeds
but<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.350> go<00:00:58.649> ahead<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.949> sprout<00:00:59.340> your

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
but you can go ahead and sprout your

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.849 
but you can go ahead and sprout your
brains<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.059> then<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.270> can<00:01:00.449> grind<00:01:01.020> them<00:01:01.320> into

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
brains and then you can grind them into

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.899 
brains and then you can grind them into
flour<00:01:02.340> or<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.270> cook<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:03.899> them<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.909> this

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
flour or you can cook with them and this

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.359 
flour or you can cook with them and this
is<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.210> healthiest<00:01:06.689> way<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.229> just

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
is the healthiest way just it just

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.730 
is the healthiest way just it just
activates<00:01:08.369> all<00:01:08.640> those<00:01:08.790> nutrients<00:01:09.330> and

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
activates all those nutrients and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.640 
activates all those nutrients and
deactivates<00:01:10.740> all<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.549> anti<00:01:12.030> nutrients<00:01:12.650> or

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
deactivates all the anti nutrients or

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.200 
deactivates all the anti nutrients or
neutralizes<00:01:14.520> them<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.880> guess<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.299> should<00:01:15.450> say

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
neutralizes them I guess you should say

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.020 
neutralizes them I guess you should say
so<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.720> really<00:01:19.380> easy<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.740> do<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.820> do

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
so this is really easy to do you can do

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.380 
so this is really easy to do you can do
this<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.390> any<00:01:21.720> whole<00:01:22.110> grains<00:01:22.970> corn<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
this with any whole grains corn is a

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.969 
this with any whole grains corn is a
little<00:01:24.780> bit<00:01:24.930> different<00:01:25.380> than<00:01:25.500> how<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.650> soak

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
little bit different than how you soak

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.520 
little bit different than how you soak
you<00:01:26.159> have<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.369> use<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> lime<00:01:26.820> water<00:01:27.049> but<00:01:28.049> all<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
you have to use a lime water but all the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.249 
you have to use a lime water but all the
other<00:01:28.680> grains<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.640> soak<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
other grains you can soak like this the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.289 
other grains you can soak like this the
only<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:31.829> that's<00:01:32.340> difficult<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.390> use<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:34.020> oats

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
only one that's difficult to use is oats

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.030 
only one that's difficult to use is oats
because<00:01:36.299> most<00:01:36.869> Oaks<00:01:37.200> are<00:01:37.470> heat<00:01:38.159> treated<00:01:38.189> and

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
because most Oaks are heat treated and

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.370 
because most Oaks are heat treated and
you've<00:01:41.040> got<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.280> find<00:01:41.520> holus<00:01:42.210> oats<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:43.259> are

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
you've got to find holus oats that are

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.130 
you've got to find holus oats that are
raw<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:44.250> are<00:01:44.399> not<00:01:44.579> he<00:01:44.820> treated<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.869> it's

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
raw that are not he treated it's it's

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.160 
raw that are not he treated it's it's
hard<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.409> find<00:01:46.680> ones<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.070> will<00:01:47.189> actually

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
hard to find ones that will actually

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.160 
hard to find ones that will actually
sprout<00:01:49.170> you're<00:01:50.009> certainly<00:01:50.310> welcome<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.700> try

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
sprout you're certainly welcome to try

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.999 
sprout you're certainly welcome to try
but<00:01:52.170> from<00:01:53.070> what<00:01:53.340> I've<00:01:53.430> heard<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:54.090> very<00:01:54.240> hard

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
but from what I've heard it's very hard

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
using filtered water I really think it's

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.780 
using filtered water I really think it's
a<00:04:43.230> good<00:04:43.350> idea<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.650> use<00:04:43.860> filtered<00:04:44.250> water<00:04:44.280> I<00:04:44.580> mean

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
a good idea to use filtered water I mean

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.420 
a good idea to use filtered water I mean
you<00:04:44.970> could<00:04:45.180> use<00:04:45.650> regular<00:04:46.650> water<00:04:46.980> but<00:04:47.280> there's

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
you could use regular water but there's

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.550 
you could use regular water but there's
just<00:04:47.580> so<00:04:47.700> many<00:04:47.790> chemicals<00:04:48.330> in<00:04:48.450> it<00:04:48.570> a<00:04:48.750> toxic

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
just so many chemicals in it a toxic

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.120 
just so many chemicals in it a toxic
stuff<00:04:50.340> you<00:04:51.030> don't<00:04:51.120> want<00:04:51.240> your<00:04:51.920> your<00:04:52.920> wheat

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
stuff you don't want your your wheat

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.770 
stuff you don't want your your wheat
berries<00:04:53.490> or<00:04:53.640> your<00:04:53.790> grains<00:04:54.120> whatever<00:04:54.570> kind<00:04:54.750> of

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
berries or your grains whatever kind of

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.970 
berries or your grains whatever kind of
rains<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.920> is<00:04:56.040> warming<00:04:56.340> all<00:04:56.460> that<00:04:56.610> stuff

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
rains that is warming all that stuff

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.700

now you don't want your sprouts to be
longer<00:07:01.530> than<00:07:01.650> a<00:07:01.710> quarter<00:07:02.220> of<00:07:02.250> an<00:07:02.550> inch<00:07:02.840> it's

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 
longer than a quarter of an inch it's

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.020 
longer than a quarter of an inch it's
enough<00:07:04.260> just<00:07:04.650> for<00:07:04.830> them<00:07:04.950> to<00:07:05.220> have<00:07:05.400> germinated

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
enough just for them to have germinated

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.700 
enough just for them to have germinated
you'll<00:07:06.540> just<00:07:06.750> start<00:07:07.020> to<00:07:07.170> see<00:07:07.320> this<00:07:07.500> at<00:07:07.620> the

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:07.710 
you'll just start to see this at the

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.510 
you'll just start to see this at the
white<00:07:07.920> sprouts<00:07:08.400> popping<00:07:09.000> out<00:07:09.150> on<00:07:09.630> the<00:07:10.110> wheat

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
white sprouts popping out on the wheat

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.490 
white sprouts popping out on the wheat
that's<00:07:11.520> good<00:07:11.790> enough<00:07:11.880> if<00:07:12.630> they're<00:07:12.930> too<00:07:13.230> long

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 
that's good enough if they're too long

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.140 
that's good enough if they're too long
if<00:07:13.950> they<00:07:14.100> get<00:07:14.250> to<00:07:14.370> be<00:07:14.490> a<00:07:14.520> quarter<00:07:14.850> of<00:07:14.940> an<00:07:15.060> inch

if they get to be a quarter of an inch
or<00:07:15.390> longer<00:07:15.960> that's<00:07:16.380> too<00:07:16.890> much<00:07:17.130> according<00:07:17.640> to

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:17.900 
or longer that's too much according to

out<00:07:23.580> if<00:07:23.880> it<00:07:24.060> goes<00:07:24.240> longer<00:07:24.540> for<00:07:24.720> a<00:07:24.870> quarter<00:07:25.320> of

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:25.410 
out if it goes longer for a quarter of

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.280
