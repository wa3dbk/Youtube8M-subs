00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
any measurements it just have to do it

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.969

until<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.189> looks<00:01:35.340> right<00:01:35.509> so<00:01:36.560> you<00:01:37.560> get<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.860> until

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
until it looks right so you get it until

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.210 
until it looks right so you get it until
it's<00:01:38.340> kind<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.729> rough<00:01:38.939> paste<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.829> then<00:01:40.829> just

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
it's kind of a rough paste and then just

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.340 
it's kind of a rough paste and then just
add<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> little<00:01:42.090> bit<00:01:42.270> more<00:01:42.299> water<00:01:42.630> as<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.170> need

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.520 
to to get it to the consistency that you
want

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.840 

it's<00:01:50.530> better<00:01:50.799> to<00:01:50.920> mix<00:01:51.130> your<00:01:51.220> paste<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:51.640> little

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
it's better to mix your paste a little

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.850 
it's better to mix your paste a little
bit<00:01:52.060> too<00:01:52.270> thick<00:01:52.630> than<00:01:52.840> to<00:01:52.990> mix<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.380> too<00:01:53.560> thin

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
bit too thick than to mix it too thin

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.580 
bit too thick than to mix it too thin
it's<00:01:54.820> very<00:01:55.060> hard<00:01:55.360> to<00:01:55.450> make<00:01:55.960> thin<00:01:56.290> paste

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
it's very hard to make thin paste

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.200 
it's very hard to make thin paste
thicker<00:01:56.950> but<00:01:57.250> it's<00:01:57.399> very<00:01:57.549> easy<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:58.030> make<00:01:58.180> a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
thicker but it's very easy to make a

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.969 
thicker but it's very easy to make a
thick<00:01:58.509> paste<00:01:58.750> thinner<00:01:59.079> just<00:01:59.170> by<00:01:59.439> adding<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.829> few

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
thick paste thinner just by adding a few

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.620 
thick paste thinner just by adding a few
more<00:02:00.039> drops<00:02:00.369> of<00:02:00.610> water<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:01.030> even<00:02:01.329> if<00:02:01.450> your

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
more drops of water and even if your

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.330 
more drops of water and even if your
paste<00:02:01.869> is<00:02:02.079> already<00:02:02.409> in<00:02:02.590> your<00:02:02.710> bottle<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:03.189> can

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
paste is already in your bottle you can

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.039 
paste is already in your bottle you can
have<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.700> water<00:02:03.939> right<00:02:04.240> to<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.479> bottle<00:02:04.869> and

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
have the water right to the bottle and

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.050 
have the water right to the bottle and
then<00:02:05.740> just<00:02:05.979> mix<00:02:06.130> it<00:02:06.280> up<00:02:06.340> with<00:02:06.460> a<00:02:06.520> skewer<00:02:06.939> or

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
then just mix it up with a skewer or

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.270 
then just mix it up with a skewer or
something<00:02:07.539> or<00:02:07.689> chopstick<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.380> get<00:02:09.130> the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
something or chopstick and get the

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.270 
something or chopstick and get the
consistency<00:02:10.030> of<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.179> pace<00:02:10.360> that<00:02:10.390> you<00:02:10.690> want<00:02:11.280> so

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
consistency of the pace that you want so

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.509 
consistency of the pace that you want so
right<00:02:12.489> now<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.700> have<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.910> pretty<00:02:13.330> thick<00:02:13.800> paste<00:02:14.800> so

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
right now I have a pretty thick paste so

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:16.890 
right now I have a pretty thick paste so
I'm<00:02:15.670> going<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:15.849> add<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.030> little<00:02:16.269> bit<00:02:16.480> more<00:02:16.660> water

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
I'm going to add a little bit more water

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.670 
I'm going to add a little bit more water
just<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.440> thin<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.800> out<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.950> little<00:02:18.190> bit<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:22.680> one

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
just to thin it out a little bit so one

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.280 
just to thin it out a little bit so one
thing<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.190> need<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.510> pay<00:02:25.510> attention<00:02:26.049> to

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
thing that you need to pay attention to

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.130 
thing that you need to pay attention to
is<00:02:26.620> something<00:02:27.100> called<00:02:27.430> dye<00:02:27.610> release<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.360> dye

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
is something called dye release and dye

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.009 
is something called dye release and dye
release<00:02:29.319> happens<00:02:29.950> when<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.730> dye<00:02:31.209> that<00:02:31.239> is<00:02:31.660> in

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
release happens when the dye that is in

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.009 
release happens when the dye that is in
the<00:02:32.260> henna<00:02:32.500> plant<00:02:33.370> in<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.480> cells<00:02:34.750> of<00:02:34.900> the

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
the henna plant in the cells of the

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.949 
the henna plant in the cells of the
plant<00:02:35.200> becomes<00:02:36.130> available<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:37.060> able<00:02:37.780> to

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
plant becomes available and able to

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.850 
plant becomes available and able to
sustain<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.099> skin<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:40.319> that's<00:02:41.319> why<00:02:41.530> we<00:02:41.650> call

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
sustain the skin so that's why we call

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.500 
sustain the skin so that's why we call
it<00:02:41.890> dye<00:02:42.130> release<00:02:42.310> I'm<00:02:42.880> not<00:02:43.120> really<00:02:43.239> sure

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
it dye release I'm not really sure

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.870 
it dye release I'm not really sure
what's<00:02:43.780> going<00:02:44.080> on<00:02:44.260> when<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.860> dye<00:02:45.069> is<00:02:45.340> made

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
what's going on when the dye is made

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.880 
what's going on when the dye is made
available<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.720> may<00:02:46.989> be<00:02:47.049> chemistry<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.709> may<00:02:47.830> be

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
available it may be chemistry it may be

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.120 
available it may be chemistry it may be
elves<00:02:48.310> I'm<00:02:48.489> really<00:02:48.730> not<00:02:48.880> sure<00:02:49.380> but<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.650> will

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
elves I'm really not sure but I will

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.310 
elves I'm really not sure but I will
show<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.430> how<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.730> tell<00:02:52.090> when<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:52.810> have<00:02:52.989> dye

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
show you how to tell when you have dye

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:00.030 
show you how to tell when you have dye
release<00:02:55.829> so<00:02:56.829> here's<00:02:57.340> your<00:02:58.290> fresh<00:02:59.290> paste<00:02:59.650> just

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
release so here's your fresh paste just

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.550 
release so here's your fresh paste just
mix<00:03:00.340> with<00:03:00.579> water<00:03:00.850> sugar<00:03:01.299> and<00:03:01.570> Hanan<00:03:02.200> powder

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
mix with water sugar and Hanan powder

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.309 
mix with water sugar and Hanan powder
and<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.519> see<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:03.910> it's<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.269> pretty<00:03:04.989> bright

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
and you see that it's a pretty bright

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.880 
and you see that it's a pretty bright
green<00:03:05.650> still<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:07.380> once<00:03:08.380> you<00:03:08.530> have<00:03:08.680> dye

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
green still and once you have dye

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.400 
green still and once you have dye
release<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:10.120> paste<00:03:10.480> turns<00:03:10.870> kind<00:03:11.230> of<00:03:11.350> a

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
release the paste turns kind of a

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.370 
release the paste turns kind of a
brownish<00:03:12.180> green<00:03:13.180> so<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:13.900> can<00:03:14.079> see<00:03:14.260> the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
brownish green so you can see the

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.319 
brownish green so you can see the
difference<00:03:14.739> here<00:03:14.829> this<00:03:15.190> is<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.609> paste<00:03:16.000> that

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
difference here this is the paste that

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.360 
difference here this is the paste that
has<00:03:16.810> achieved<00:03:16.989> eye<00:03:17.380> release<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.100> is<00:03:18.250> the

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
has achieved eye release and this is the

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.449 
has achieved eye release and this is the
pace<00:03:18.549> that<00:03:18.579> we're<00:03:19.000> mixing<00:03:19.150> right<00:03:19.569> now<00:03:19.810> so<00:03:20.650> what

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
pace that we're mixing right now so what

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.849 
pace that we're mixing right now so what
I<00:03:21.489> like<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:21.850> do<00:03:22.120> is<00:03:22.420> mix<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.989> paste<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.530> just

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
I like to do is mix the paste to just

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.300 
I like to do is mix the paste to just
about<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.190> consistency<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.000> I<00:03:25.150> want<00:03:26.310> which

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
about the consistency that I want which

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.830 
about the consistency that I want which
is<00:03:27.489> what<00:03:27.639> I'm<00:03:27.730> doing<00:03:27.880> right<00:03:28.030> now<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.660> then<00:03:28.810> I

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
is what I'm doing right now and then I

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.190 
is what I'm doing right now and then I
let<00:03:29.109> this<00:03:29.290> sit<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:30.090> every<00:03:31.090> type<00:03:31.480> of<00:03:31.510> henna<00:03:31.900> has

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
let this sit and every type of henna has

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.120 
let this sit and every type of henna has
its<00:03:32.590> own<00:03:33.510> time<00:03:34.510> period<00:03:34.930> that<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.380> need<00:03:35.650> for

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
its own time period that you need for

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.490 
its own time period that you need for
dye<00:03:36.310> release<00:03:36.760> some<00:03:37.569> henna<00:03:37.810> is<00:03:37.989> get<00:03:38.350> dye

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
dye release some henna is get dye

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.020 
dye release some henna is get dye
release<00:03:38.560> very<00:03:39.069> quickly<00:03:39.370> after<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.790> few<00:03:40.000> hours

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
release very quickly after a few hours

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.120 
release very quickly after a few hours
some<00:03:40.630> you<00:03:40.959> need<00:03:41.109> to<00:03:41.319> leave<00:03:41.680> it<00:03:41.829> overnight

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
some you need to leave it overnight

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.250 
some you need to leave it overnight
sometimes<00:03:42.579> two<00:03:43.060> days<00:03:43.239> so<00:03:43.900> you<00:03:43.989> have<00:03:44.139> to

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
sometimes two days so you have to

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.020 
sometimes two days so you have to
experiment<00:03:45.160> with<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.430> different<00:03:45.700> kinds<00:03:45.970> of

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
experiment with the different kinds of

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.870 
experiment with the different kinds of
henna<00:03:46.239> that<00:03:46.359> you<00:03:46.690> try<00:03:47.200> this<00:03:48.160> what<00:03:48.519> I'm<00:03:48.639> using

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
henna that you try this what I'm using

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.449 
henna that you try this what I'm using
now<00:03:49.120> is<00:03:49.299> Moroccan<00:03:49.660> henna

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
now is Moroccan henna

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.849 
now is Moroccan henna
and<00:03:50.549> it<00:03:50.760> tends<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.090> achieve<00:03:51.480> divers<00:03:52.140> die

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
and it tends to achieve divers die

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.190 
and it tends to achieve divers die
release<00:03:53.159> very<00:03:53.459> quickly<00:03:53.790> so<00:03:54.569> this<00:03:54.870> could<00:03:55.049> be

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
release very quickly so this could be

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.730 
release very quickly so this could be
ready<00:03:55.409> in<00:03:55.680> three<00:03:56.129> or<00:03:56.250> four<00:03:56.430> hours
