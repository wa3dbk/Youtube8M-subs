00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.290
 the second question I study in grade 10 is not 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.900
 I understand why torment the objects that 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.730
 i'm not interested and they are not needed when 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.070
 entering a university I want 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.640
 they do not come to me that 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.789
 do score but parents don't understand 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.850
 They say I need a certificate with 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:28.050
 good grades although it does not matter 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.330
 why do you even understand that you 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.040
 you want to score and why do you want to score 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.100
 before you do something you need to understand 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:40.530
 What is our goal to score in order to 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.170
 score just like that is not the goal this is 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.760
 mess friends i can understand the situation 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.309
 when did you decide what is more for you 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.020
 important that less important here is what's for 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.690
 you more importantly you can't do it 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.430
 devote enough time because 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.960
 parents you there or there from yours 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.780
 surroundings require spending time on 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.820
 something else less important yes yours 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.129
 conscious choice you understand this 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.619
 for me in the essential is more important to me 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.330
 will allow to live better it will allow me 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.750
 earn better and be more successful 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.369
 and so on, but they don't give you that 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.439
 You can deal with such a situation 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.540
 redistribute your resources your time 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.979
 In particular, I will not do this a 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.460
 this more efficiently 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.090
 but most often most often in young people 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.110
 it's not like that at young people 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.150
 question and fuck 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.250
 like i won't use it 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.320
 start and generally will not do anything 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.799
 so I will sit at home and play 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.590
 toys 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.610
 excuse me for scoring in order to 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.780
 to score it is meaningless and in this regard I 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.210
 parents will support 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.420
 it's better then learn at least something than 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.340
 not much because any knowledge 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.880
 they ultimately can afford 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:58.380
 I used to learn a lot of things 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.540
 when was school and after school and in those 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.000
 moments seemed like they were perfect 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.229
 meaningless never will be useful to me 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.970
 but five ten years have passed and I realized that 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.340
 they have come in handy for many of those things 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.629
 which I remembered since then 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.810
 not useful there when shooting 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:18.090
 certain plots when moving when 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.950
 conversations with many people they showed 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.170
 general level of scholarship so on 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.849
 like you can not guess what you 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.410
 will come in handy for your future life so 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.569
 if you don't like something here and 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.980
 now it does not mean that it will not 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.209
 need you then 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.760
 and somewhere you can refuse it 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.430
 only if you have 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.010
 better replacement if you have more 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:49.220
 there is no better important replacement then it is better 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.220
 learn anything than teach nothing
