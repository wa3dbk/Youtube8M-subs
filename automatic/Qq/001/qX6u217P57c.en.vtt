00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
really glad that they pull off effort

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.680 
really glad that they pull off effort
into<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.340> design<00:01:15.550> now<00:01:16.060> certainly<00:01:16.480> not

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
into the design now certainly not

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.140 
into the design now certainly not
designed<00:01:17.020> amazingly<00:01:17.770> but<00:01:18.310> I<00:01:18.550> really<00:01:18.910> like<00:01:19.030> the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
designed amazingly but I really like the

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.870 
designed amazingly but I really like the
lip<00:01:19.300> of<00:01:19.420> them<00:01:19.540> and<00:01:19.750> first<00:01:20.050> impressions<00:01:20.620> and

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
lip of them and first impressions and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.970 
lip of them and first impressions and
also<00:01:21.880> they<00:01:22.390> do<00:01:22.450> look<00:01:22.720> a<00:01:22.930> lot<00:01:23.200> nicer<00:01:23.350> than<00:01:23.530> the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
also they do look a lot nicer than the

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.210 
also they do look a lot nicer than the
most<00:01:24.340> headphones<00:01:25.060> that<00:01:25.300> are<00:01:25.360> on<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.600> low<00:01:25.810> budget

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
most headphones that are on a low budget

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.490 
most headphones that are on a low budget
so<00:01:27.220> from<00:01:27.430> using<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.940> case<00:01:28.270> I<00:01:28.570> was<00:01:28.900> amazingly

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
so from using the case I was amazingly

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.620 
so from using the case I was amazingly
surprised<00:01:30.040> by<00:01:30.250> how<00:01:30.580> stiff<00:01:30.940> and<00:01:31.090> difficult<00:01:31.240> it

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
surprised by how stiff and difficult it

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.600 
surprised by how stiff and difficult it
was<00:01:31.810> I<00:01:32.050> actually<00:01:32.440> spent<00:01:32.890> so<00:01:33.190> long<00:01:33.370> in<00:01:33.520> the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
was I actually spent so long in the

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.340 
was I actually spent so long in the
unboxing<00:01:34.120> actually<00:01:34.480> had<00:01:34.570> to<00:01:34.690> pause<00:01:34.930> it<00:01:35.140> and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
unboxing actually had to pause it and

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.770 
unboxing actually had to pause it and
try<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.370> jam<00:01:36.700> out<00:01:36.910> with<00:01:36.970> a<00:01:37.180> knife<00:01:37.540> or

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
try and jam out with a knife or

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.080 
try and jam out with a knife or
something<00:01:37.960> like<00:01:38.230> that<00:01:38.290> and<00:01:38.880> quite<00:01:39.880> frankly

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
something like that and quite frankly

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.760 
something like that and quite frankly
this<00:01:40.420> is<00:01:40.600> really<00:01:40.840> too<00:01:40.930> bad<00:01:41.140> mainly<00:01:41.590> because

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
this is really too bad mainly because

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.400 
this is really too bad mainly because
you<00:01:42.220> have<00:01:42.580> to<00:01:42.670> get<00:01:42.820> used<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.120> as<00:01:43.240> well<00:01:43.420> also

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
you have to get used to as well also

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.590 
you have to get used to as well also
what's<00:01:44.590> nice<00:01:44.770> in<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.340> packaging<00:01:46.180> hands<00:01:46.390> the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
what's nice in the packaging hands the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.900 
what's nice in the packaging hands the

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
case are such a simple instructions now

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.370 
case are such a simple instructions now
to<00:01:48.970> be<00:01:49.150> honest<00:01:49.300> I'm<00:01:49.510> not<00:01:49.750> gonna<00:01:49.960> read<00:01:50.200> them

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
to be honest I'm not gonna read them

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.200 
to be honest I'm not gonna read them
because<00:01:50.740> they<00:01:50.920> look<00:01:51.070> incredibly<00:01:51.580> boring<00:01:51.940> I

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
because they look incredibly boring I

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.910 
because they look incredibly boring I
wish<00:01:52.600> they'd<00:01:52.750> just<00:01:52.780> put<00:01:52.990> this<00:01:53.170> online<00:01:53.380> or<00:01:53.740> put

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
wish they'd just put this online or put

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.560 
wish they'd just put this online or put
it<00:01:54.010> into<00:01:54.160> a<00:01:54.190> simple<00:01:54.490> video<00:01:54.730> but<00:01:55.360> I<00:01:55.390> guess

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
it into a simple video but I guess

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.940 
it into a simple video but I guess
they've<00:01:55.750> got<00:01:55.900> a<00:01:55.930> bit<00:01:56.140> of<00:01:56.230> illegal

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
they've got a bit of illegal

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.830 
they've got a bit of illegal
as<00:01:57.009> well<00:01:57.189> so<00:01:57.759> we've<00:01:57.880> got<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.090> case<00:01:58.119> there<00:01:58.630> and

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
as well so we've got the case there and

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.499 
as well so we've got the case there and
also<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.409> provided<00:01:59.920> earmuffs<00:02:00.280> I<00:02:00.610> don't<00:02:01.390> know

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
also the provided earmuffs I don't know

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.569 
also the provided earmuffs I don't know
why<00:02:01.750> Skullcandy<00:02:02.469> made<00:02:02.649> these<00:02:02.799> headphones<00:02:03.039> so

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
why Skullcandy made these headphones so

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.219 
why Skullcandy made these headphones so
difficult<00:02:03.939> to<00:02:04.060> get<00:02:04.149> out<00:02:04.329> I<00:02:04.509> guess<00:02:04.960> it's<00:02:05.140> just

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
difficult to get out I guess it's just

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.709 
difficult to get out I guess it's just
the<00:02:05.439> first<00:02:05.829> time<00:02:05.979> using<00:02:06.549> them<00:02:06.729> but<00:02:07.240> I<00:02:07.420> found<00:02:07.570> it

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
the first time using them but I found it

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.300 
the first time using them but I found it
really<00:02:07.929> frustrated<00:02:08.649> because<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:08.979> ended<00:02:09.250> up

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
really frustrated because I ended up

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.220 
really frustrated because I ended up
crumpling<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:09.970> quite<00:02:10.209> a<00:02:10.239> lot<00:02:10.300> of<00:02:10.420> times<00:02:10.720> but

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
crumpling it quite a lot of times but

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.809 
crumpling it quite a lot of times but
luckily<00:02:11.470> once<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:11.920> can<00:02:12.069> open<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.519> you<00:02:12.670> can

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
luckily once you can open it you can

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.050 
luckily once you can open it you can
push<00:02:13.000> it<00:02:13.150> back<00:02:13.180> into<00:02:13.450> place<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.110> preformance

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
push it back into place and preformance

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.490 
push it back into place and preformance
I'll<00:02:16.060> admit<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.660> would<00:02:16.810> have<00:02:16.930> been<00:02:17.080> nice<00:02:17.290> if

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
I'll admit it would have been nice if

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.140 
I'll admit it would have been nice if
Skullcandy<00:02:18.010> puts<00:02:18.220> a<00:02:18.280> little<00:02:18.550> bit<00:02:18.730> more<00:02:19.000> effort

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
Skullcandy puts a little bit more effort

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.270 
Skullcandy puts a little bit more effort
into<00:02:19.630> making<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:20.019> case<00:02:20.230> because<00:02:20.830> while<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.160> is

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
into making the case because while it is

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.490 
into making the case because while it is
light<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.849> really<00:02:22.090> simple<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.840> just<00:02:23.200> doesn't

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
light and really simple it just doesn't

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.650 
light and really simple it just doesn't
look<00:02:23.530> very<00:02:23.620> strong<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.489> also<00:02:25.180> it's<00:02:25.299> easy<00:02:25.450> to

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
look very strong and also it's easy to

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.199 
look very strong and also it's easy to
crumple<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.170> ruin<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:27.489> Skullcandy<00:02:28.120> have

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
crumple and ruin so Skullcandy have

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.940 
crumple and ruin so Skullcandy have
become<00:02:28.510> one<00:02:28.690> of<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.930> most<00:02:29.110> distinctive<00:02:29.470> audio

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
become one of the most distinctive audio

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.070 
become one of the most distinctive audio
brands<00:02:30.220> in<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.489> world<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.000> they've<00:02:31.720> produced

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
brands in the world and they've produced

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.979 
brands in the world and they've produced
a<00:02:32.260> huge<00:02:32.739> array<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.250> headphones<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.150> because

a huge array of headphones and because

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.180

of<00:02:35.019> this<00:02:35.200> have<00:02:35.410> reduced<00:02:35.769> high<00:02:35.980> budget

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
of this have reduced high budget

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
built quite nicely with a polycarbonate

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.699 
built quite nicely with a polycarbonate
backside<00:02:52.239> and<00:02:52.480> also<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.840> aluminium<00:02:53.410> front

backside and also a aluminium front
sight<00:02:53.890> I<00:02:54.239> think<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.329> design<00:02:55.660> is<00:02:55.690> nice<00:02:56.049> and

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
sight I think the design is nice and

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.160 
sight I think the design is nice and
smooth<00:02:56.950> but<00:02:56.980> it's<00:02:57.400> not<00:02:57.549> great<00:02:57.840> it's<00:02:58.840> just<00:02:58.930> a

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
smooth but it's not great it's just a

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.990 
smooth but it's not great it's just a
simple<00:02:59.500> smooth<00:02:59.799> plastic<00:03:00.190> design<00:03:00.370> with<00:03:00.970> a

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
simple smooth plastic design with a

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.270 
simple smooth plastic design with a
great<00:03:01.269> range<00:03:01.510> of<00:03:01.630> colors<00:03:01.930> what's<00:03:02.859> also<00:03:03.069> quite

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
great range of colors what's also quite

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.280 
great range of colors what's also quite
nice<00:03:03.519> is<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.030> 1550s<00:03:04.480> come<00:03:04.930> with<00:03:05.019> a<00:03:05.079> built

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
nice is that the 1550s come with a built

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.979 
nice is that the 1550s come with a built
in<00:03:05.410> microphone<00:03:05.650> marker<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:07.269> only<00:03:07.480> problem<00:03:07.870> is

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
in microphone marker the only problem is

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.449 
in microphone marker the only problem is
that<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.380> volume<00:03:08.650> rocker<00:03:08.889> doesn't<00:03:09.160> work<00:03:09.310> on

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
that the volume rocker doesn't work on

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.099 
that the volume rocker doesn't work on
Android<00:03:09.760> devices<00:03:10.090> if<00:03:10.630> you<00:03:10.750> go<00:03:10.870> into<00:03:10.989> the

iOS<00:03:14.139> devices<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.769> I<00:03:14.950> find<00:03:15.190> this<00:03:15.280> really

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
iOS devices and I find this really

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.490 
iOS devices and I find this really
stupid<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:16.569> now<00:03:16.690> let's<00:03:16.870> go<00:03:16.989> into<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.290> sound

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
stupid so now let's go into the sound

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.559 
stupid so now let's go into the sound
Skullcandy<00:03:18.370> claimed<00:03:18.639> that<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.850> 50<00:03:19.180> 50s

having supreme sound with attacking bass
and<00:03:22.209> quite<00:03:22.660> frankly<00:03:22.870> this<00:03:23.200> is<00:03:23.380> not<00:03:23.410> I've<00:03:24.010> done

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310

quite a lot of heavy testing with these

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.569 
quite a lot of heavy testing with these
headphones<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.620> I<00:03:26.769> found<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.220> bass<00:03:27.370> was

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
headphones and I found that the bass was

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.370 
headphones and I found that the bass was
really<00:03:27.850> weak<00:03:28.030> while<00:03:28.389> it<00:03:28.510> did<00:03:28.660> produce<00:03:28.840> quite<00:03:29.319> a

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
really weak while it did produce quite a

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.770 
really weak while it did produce quite a
fairly<00:03:29.859> low<00:03:30.040> sound<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:31.090> problem<00:03:31.480> was<00:03:31.600> is<00:03:31.750> that

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
fairly low sound the problem was is that

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.240 
fairly low sound the problem was is that
I<00:03:31.900> couldn't<00:03:32.200> get<00:03:32.380> any<00:03:32.500> bass<00:03:32.709> out<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.130> it

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
I couldn't get any bass out of it

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.280 
I couldn't get any bass out of it
however<00:03:33.519> I<00:03:33.730> did<00:03:34.030> find<00:03:34.329> that<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.690> clarity<00:03:35.109> was

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
however I did find that the clarity was

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.949 
however I did find that the clarity was
impressive<00:03:35.889> and<00:03:36.040> also<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:37.120> volume<00:03:37.420> was<00:03:37.660> also

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
impressive and also the volume was also

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.660 
impressive and also the volume was also
good<00:03:38.109> as<00:03:38.200> well<00:03:38.350> I've<00:03:38.620> used<00:03:38.680> quite<00:03:39.190> long<00:03:39.340> in<00:03:39.519> ear

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
good as well I've used quite long in ear

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.819 
good as well I've used quite long in ear
headphones<00:03:40.090> before<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:40.750> I'll<00:03:41.200> probably<00:03:41.440> say

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
headphones before and I'll probably say

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.740 
headphones before and I'll probably say
that<00:03:42.130> these<00:03:42.280> headphones<00:03:42.609> are<00:03:43.150> fairly<00:03:43.599> good

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
that these headphones are fairly good

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.580 
that these headphones are fairly good
compared

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
compared

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.350 
compared
the<00:03:44.650> other<00:03:44.769> heads<00:03:45.190> are<00:03:45.310> tested<00:03:45.849> what's<00:03:46.060> also

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
the other heads are tested what's also

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.640 
the other heads are tested what's also
included<00:03:46.750> with<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:46.900> headphones<00:03:47.290> it's<00:03:47.560> a

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
included with the headphones it's a

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.890 
included with the headphones it's a
travel<00:03:48.010> case<00:03:48.220> now<00:03:48.790> I<00:03:48.819> found<00:03:49.269> when<00:03:49.629> I<00:03:49.660> was<00:03:49.780> only

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
travel case now I found when I was only

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.750 
travel case now I found when I was only
unboxing<00:03:50.410> of<00:03:50.500> this<00:03:50.680> is<00:03:50.860> that<00:03:51.010> was<00:03:51.160> incredibly

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
unboxing of this is that was incredibly

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.750 
unboxing of this is that was incredibly
frustrating<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.690> pull<00:03:52.930> these<00:03:53.050> apart<00:03:53.220> but<00:03:54.220> when

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
frustrating to pull these apart but when

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.759 
frustrating to pull these apart but when
you<00:03:54.910> do<00:03:55.090> use<00:03:55.360> them<00:03:55.599> more<00:03:55.840> they<00:03:56.319> do<00:03:56.379> get

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
you do use them more they do get

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.550 
you do use them more they do get
slightly<00:03:57.220> less<00:03:57.519> stiff<00:03:57.849> and<00:03:58.080> I<00:03:59.080> found<00:03:59.410> that

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
slightly less stiff and I found that

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.809 
slightly less stiff and I found that
they<00:03:59.739> are<00:03:59.769> quite<00:04:00.099> nice<00:04:00.280> because<00:04:00.489> they're

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
they are quite nice because they're

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.220 
they are quite nice because they're
incredibly<00:04:00.940> light<00:04:01.569> and<00:04:01.750> also<00:04:02.080> there's<00:04:02.200> quite

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
incredibly light and also there's quite

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.289 
incredibly light and also there's quite
a<00:04:02.440> simple<00:04:02.739> case<00:04:03.160> as<00:04:03.340> well<00:04:03.519> they<00:04:03.819> also<00:04:03.970> came

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
a simple case as well they also came

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.059 
a simple case as well they also came
with<00:04:04.360> extra<00:04:04.930> earbuds<00:04:05.290> as<00:04:05.410> well<00:04:05.560> which<00:04:05.709> I<00:04:05.830> found

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
with extra earbuds as well which I found

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.920 
with extra earbuds as well which I found
really<00:04:06.250> important<00:04:06.819> because<00:04:07.150> I<00:04:07.390> found<00:04:07.810> the

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
really important because I found the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.320 
really important because I found the
earbuds<00:04:08.349> on<00:04:08.500> these<00:04:08.680> headphones<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.879> standard

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
earbuds on these headphones the standard

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.600 
earbuds on these headphones the standard
default<00:04:10.750> ones<00:04:11.200> were<00:04:11.410> too<00:04:11.620> big<00:04:11.830> for<00:04:11.950> me<00:04:12.069> at<00:04:12.340> just

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
default ones were too big for me at just

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.490 
default ones were too big for me at just
16<00:04:12.910> grams<00:04:13.360> these<00:04:13.810> headphones<00:04:14.110> are<00:04:14.290> going<00:04:14.440> to

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
16 grams these headphones are going to

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.949 
16 grams these headphones are going to
be<00:04:14.560> really<00:04:14.950> great<00:04:15.099> for<00:04:15.479> travel<00:04:16.479> as<00:04:16.600> well<00:04:16.630> but

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
be really great for travel as well but

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.270 
be really great for travel as well but
they're<00:04:17.109> not<00:04:17.260> going<00:04:17.470> to<00:04:17.560> be<00:04:17.709> very<00:04:17.919> good<00:04:18.130> for

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
they're not going to be very good for

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.069 
they're not going to be very good for
jogging<00:04:18.669> on<00:04:18.729> any<00:04:18.940> exercise<00:04:19.570> because<00:04:19.900> they<00:04:20.019> do

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
jogging on any exercise because they do

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.110 
jogging on any exercise because they do
fall<00:04:20.440> out<00:04:20.560> very<00:04:20.769> easily<00:04:20.979> but<00:04:21.459> for<00:04:21.639> 20<00:04:21.940> pounds

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
fall out very easily but for 20 pounds

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.170 
fall out very easily but for 20 pounds
I'd<00:04:22.389> probably<00:04:22.690> choose<00:04:23.290> the<00:04:23.500> beach<00:04:23.740> one<00:04:24.180> dc9

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
I'd probably choose the beach one dc9

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.150 
I'd probably choose the beach one dc9
fifty<00:04:25.510> headphones<00:04:25.900> over<00:04:26.050> these<00:04:26.290> ones<00:04:26.530> mainly

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
fifty headphones over these ones mainly

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.010 
fifty headphones over these ones mainly
because<00:04:27.430> of<00:04:27.700> the<00:04:27.820> sound<00:04:28.060> quality<00:04:28.450> and<00:04:28.660> also

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
because of the sound quality and also

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.780 
because of the sound quality and also
because<00:04:29.410> of<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.590> design<00:04:29.830> but<00:04:30.310> generally<00:04:30.669> the

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
because of the design but generally the

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.520 
because of the design but generally the
design<00:04:31.060> isn't<00:04:31.240> really<00:04:31.600> important<00:04:32.020> at<00:04:32.110> all<00:04:32.260> I

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
design isn't really important at all I

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.050 
design isn't really important at all I
also<00:04:32.800> found<00:04:33.130> that<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.340> beach<00:04:33.490> one<00:04:33.669> headphones

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
also found that the beach one headphones

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.700 
also found that the beach one headphones
had<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.240> much<00:04:34.540> more<00:04:34.750> impressive<00:04:35.020> base<00:04:35.290> and<00:04:35.590> were

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
had a much more impressive base and were

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.920 
had a much more impressive base and were
much<00:04:35.950> better<00:04:36.190> at<00:04:36.370> lows<00:04:36.669> so<00:04:37.419> here<00:04:37.600> is<00:04:37.690> just<00:04:37.840> an

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
much better at lows so here is just an

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.420 
much better at lows so here is just an
example<00:04:37.990> of<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.620> headphones<00:04:38.979> not<00:04:39.190> really

on<00:04:55.419> my<00:04:55.660> Motorola<00:04:56.080> G<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:57.250> found<00:04:57.490> this<00:04:57.550> really

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
on my Motorola G and I found this really

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.120 
on my Motorola G and I found this really
frustrating<00:04:58.419> because<00:04:58.450> I<00:04:59.020> found<00:04:59.740> that<00:04:59.919> the

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
frustrating because I found that the

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.529 
frustrating because I found that the
volume<00:05:00.370> rockers<00:05:00.610> a<00:05:00.639> really<00:05:00.910> nice<00:05:01.060> feature<00:05:01.300> but

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
volume rockers a really nice feature but

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.170 
volume rockers a really nice feature but
I<00:05:01.599> couldn't<00:05:01.960> even<00:05:01.990> use<00:05:02.349> them<00:05:02.530> if<00:05:03.130> i<00:05:03.460> OS<00:05:03.729> have

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
I couldn't even use them if i OS have

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.150 
I couldn't even use them if i OS have
prioritized<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.110> volume<00:05:05.410> rocker<00:05:05.590> for<00:05:05.830> this<00:05:05.979> I

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
prioritized the volume rocker for this I

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.610 
prioritized the volume rocker for this I
think<00:05:06.400> this<00:05:06.639> is<00:05:06.820> really<00:05:07.270> really<00:05:07.450> bad<00:05:07.750> mainly

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
think this is really really bad mainly

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.140 
think this is really really bad mainly
because<00:05:08.740> there's<00:05:09.099> so<00:05:09.340> much<00:05:09.460> more<00:05:09.760> Android

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
because there's so much more Android

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.270 
because there's so much more Android
devices<00:05:10.419> out<00:05:10.630> there<00:05:10.840> than<00:05:10.990> iOS<00:05:11.289> and<00:05:11.710> a<00:05:12.039> lot<00:05:12.220> of

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
devices out there than iOS and a lot of

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.710 
devices out there than iOS and a lot of
people<00:05:12.520> gonna<00:05:12.580> be<00:05:12.760> frustrated<00:05:13.360> if<00:05:13.450> they<00:05:13.570> use

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
people gonna be frustrated if they use

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.659 
people gonna be frustrated if they use
these<00:05:13.870> headphones<00:05:14.080> and<00:05:14.500> of<00:05:15.070> course<00:05:15.310> it<00:05:15.490> sort

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
these headphones and of course it sort

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:16.890 
these headphones and of course it sort
of<00:05:15.700> defeats<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.090> point<00:05:16.360> of<00:05:16.510> having<00:05:16.630> them<00:05:16.780> in

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
of defeats the point of having them in

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.170 
of defeats the point of having them in
the<00:05:16.930> first<00:05:17.020> place<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:18.190> sound<00:05:18.430> insulation<00:05:18.970> is

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
the first place the sound insulation is

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.339 
the first place the sound insulation is
quite<00:05:19.389> impressive<00:05:19.780> and<00:05:19.930> here's<00:05:20.169> an<00:05:20.289> example

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
quite impressive and here's an example

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:25.650 
quite impressive and here's an example
of<00:05:20.860> them<00:05:21.039> playing<00:05:21.250> at<00:05:21.400> full<00:05:21.610> volume<00:05:24.450> so<00:05:25.450> as<00:05:25.539> you

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
of them playing at full volume so as you

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.540 
of them playing at full volume so as you
can<00:05:25.780> tell<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.530> sound<00:05:26.710> insulation<00:05:27.130> is<00:05:27.340> fairly

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
can tell the sound insulation is fairly

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.279 
can tell the sound insulation is fairly
impressive<00:05:27.940> even<00:05:28.300> when<00:05:28.450> is<00:05:28.630> playing<00:05:28.900> at<00:05:29.050> full

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
impressive even when is playing at full

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:29.700 
impressive even when is playing at full
volume

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
volume

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.920 
volume
but<00:05:29.919> generally<00:05:30.310> I<00:05:30.340> usually<00:05:30.910> find<00:05:31.210> that<00:05:31.419> in<00:05:31.750> ear

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
but generally I usually find that in ear

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.210 
but generally I usually find that in ear
headphones<00:05:32.349> have<00:05:32.440> much<00:05:32.710> better<00:05:32.950> sound

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
headphones have much better sound

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.370 
headphones have much better sound
insulation<00:05:33.700> and<00:05:33.970> over<00:05:34.270> here<00:05:34.479> Edwards<00:05:34.840> so

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
insulation and over here Edwards so

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.900 
insulation and over here Edwards so
overall<00:05:35.740> I<00:05:35.919> think<00:05:35.979> that<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:36.460> Skullcandy

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
overall I think that the Skullcandy

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.450 
overall I think that the Skullcandy
50/50<00:05:37.599> headphones<00:05:38.020> are<00:05:38.200> fairly<00:05:38.800> good<00:05:38.950> pick<00:05:39.190> I

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
50/50 headphones are fairly good pick I

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.129 
50/50 headphones are fairly good pick I
don't<00:05:40.060> think<00:05:40.300> I'd<00:05:40.419> choose<00:05:40.630> them<00:05:40.840> because<00:05:41.050> I

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
don't think I'd choose them because I

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.690 
don't think I'd choose them because I
think<00:05:41.380> there<00:05:41.530> are<00:05:41.560> other<00:05:41.770> better<00:05:42.070> options<00:05:42.520> out

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
think there are other better options out

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.490 
think there are other better options out
there<00:05:42.940> but<00:05:43.120> then<00:05:43.690> again<00:05:43.810> it<00:05:44.110> does<00:05:44.260> come<00:05:44.470> with

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
there but then again it does come with

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.170 
there but then again it does come with
the<00:05:44.620> built<00:05:44.800> in<00:05:44.919> mic<00:05:45.160> and<00:05:45.400> a<00:05:45.580> lot<00:05:45.729> of<00:05:45.760> headphones

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
the built in mic and a lot of headphones

ten<00:05:53.290> years<00:05:53.500> ago<00:05:53.740> that<00:05:54.130> the<00:05:54.340> original

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
ten years ago that the original

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.510 
ten years ago that the original
fantastic<00:05:55.750> fort<00:05:56.020> was<00:05:56.200> released<00:05:56.770> in<00:05:56.980> cinemas

fantastic fort was released in cinemas
in<00:05:58.000> 2005<00:05:58.870> and<00:05:59.290> I<00:05:59.680> think<00:05:59.889> ten<00:06:00.040> years<00:06:00.070> later<00:06:00.370> they

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
in 2005 and I think ten years later they

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.640 
in 2005 and I think ten years later they
wanted<00:06:00.880> to<00:06:00.940> reboot<00:06:01.270> it<00:06:01.330> mainly<00:06:01.690> because<00:06:01.810> even

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
wanted to reboot it mainly because even

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.350 
wanted to reboot it mainly because even
though<00:06:02.860> it<00:06:03.100> did<00:06:03.340> do<00:06:03.550> well<00:06:03.700> in<00:06:03.850> the<00:06:03.910> box<00:06:04.120> office

it got very very bad reviews mainly

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.500 
it got very very bad reviews mainly
