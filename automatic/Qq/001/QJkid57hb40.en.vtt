way<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:20.830> mean<00:02:21.040> when<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.459> say<00:02:21.670> shocking<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.120> mean<00:02:22.329> it

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
way I mean when I say shocking I mean it

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.509 
way I mean when I say shocking I mean it
completely<00:02:23.049> took<00:02:23.170> me<00:02:23.230> by<00:02:23.319> surprise<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:24.340> it's

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
completely took me by surprise and it's

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.309 
completely took me by surprise and it's
probably<00:02:24.730> one<00:02:24.939> of<00:02:24.969> the<00:02:25.090> best<00:02:25.239> cliffhangers

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
probably one of the best cliffhangers

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.410 
probably one of the best cliffhangers
I've<00:02:26.530> ever<00:02:26.739> read<00:02:26.980> or<00:02:27.040> seen<00:02:27.489> or<00:02:27.610> anything<00:02:27.790> but

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
I've ever read or seen or anything but

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.880 
I've ever read or seen or anything but
this<00:02:29.349> is<00:02:31.049> completely<00:02:32.049> out<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.290> ordinary<00:02:32.379> I

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
this is completely out of the ordinary I

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.360 
this is completely out of the ordinary I
mean<00:02:33.069> Luke<00:02:33.849> Cage<00:02:34.299> is<00:02:34.750> disguised<00:02:35.650> as<00:02:36.040> Miles

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
mean Luke Cage is disguised as Miles

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.149 
mean Luke Cage is disguised as Miles
Morales<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.239> that<00:02:37.959> his<00:02:38.260> picture<00:02:38.500> for<00:02:39.069> the

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 
Morales and that his picture for the

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.789 
Morales and that his picture for the
school<00:02:39.489> is<00:02:39.819> an<00:02:40.360> older<00:02:40.780> version<00:02:40.810> of<00:02:41.500> Miles

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
school is an older version of Miles

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.750 
school is an older version of Miles
Morales<00:02:42.870> now<00:02:43.870> what<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:44.560> actually<00:02:44.890> think<00:02:45.370> is

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
Morales now what I actually think is

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.610 
Morales now what I actually think is
that<00:02:46.379> Miles<00:02:47.379> Morales<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.190> Luke<00:02:48.670> Cage<00:02:49.620> that's

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
that Miles Morales is Luke Cage that's

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.240 
that Miles Morales is Luke Cage that's
the<00:02:50.769> only<00:02:51.159> way<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.459> can<00:02:51.579> see<00:02:51.849> it<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:53.250> honestly

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
the only way I can see it so honestly

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.809 
the only way I can see it so honestly
this<00:02:54.579> is<00:02:55.120> blowing<00:02:55.480> my<00:02:55.840> mind<00:02:55.870> man<00:02:56.819> because

universe in spider-man issue 5 basically

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.050 
universe in spider-man issue 5 basically
nobody<00:03:06.609> knows<00:03:06.909> which<00:03:07.540> answer<00:03:07.989> is<00:03:08.109> right<00:03:08.670> now<00:03:09.670> I

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
nobody knows which answer is right now I

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.030 
nobody knows which answer is right now I
know<00:03:10.480> this<00:03:10.780> is<00:03:10.930> just<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.230> cartoon<00:03:11.650> so<00:03:11.889> it's

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
know this is just the cartoon so it's

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.190 
know this is just the cartoon so it's
going<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.310> put<00:03:13.090> in<00:03:13.239> silly<00:03:13.569> Easter<00:03:13.959> eggs<00:03:14.109> and

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
going to put in silly Easter eggs and

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.520 
going to put in silly Easter eggs and
everything<00:03:14.319> but<00:03:14.849> it<00:03:15.849> looks<00:03:16.239> exactly<00:03:16.569> like<00:03:17.170> an

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
everything but it looks exactly like an

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.589 
everything but it looks exactly like an
older<00:03:17.799> version<00:03:17.829> of<00:03:18.250> Miles<00:03:18.459> Morales<00:03:18.970> yeah<00:03:19.569> I

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
older version of Miles Morales yeah I

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.330 
older version of Miles Morales yeah I
know<00:03:19.810> that's<00:03:20.109> not<00:03:20.260> proof<00:03:20.590> or<00:03:20.799> anything<00:03:21.010> but

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
know that's not proof or anything but

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.220 
know that's not proof or anything but
but<00:03:21.819> we<00:03:22.000> need<00:03:22.150> all<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.389> answers<00:03:22.659> we<00:03:22.840> can<00:03:22.989> get

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
but we need all the answers we can get

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.610 
but we need all the answers we can get
basically<00:03:23.859> because<00:03:25.139> we<00:03:26.139> don't<00:03:26.379> know<00:03:26.470> which

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
basically because we don't know which

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.319 
basically because we don't know which
answers<00:03:27.010> right<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.579> the<00:03:27.670> more<00:03:27.849> we<00:03:27.970> add<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.239> the

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
answers right and the more we add to the

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.330 
answers right and the more we add to the

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:00.699 
Cage is Miles Morales wave basically

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.759 
Cage is Miles Morales wave basically
stirs<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.180> same<00:04:01.359> thing<00:04:01.599> Miles<00:04:02.199> Morales<00:04:02.560> is

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
stirs the same thing Miles Morales is

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.900 
stirs the same thing Miles Morales is
Luke<00:04:03.069> Cage<00:04:03.400> now<00:04:04.000> I<00:04:04.030> don't<00:04:04.239> know<00:04:04.480> how<00:04:04.859> Miles

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
Luke Cage now I don't know how Miles

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.890 
Luke Cage now I don't know how Miles
Morales<00:04:06.910> would<00:04:07.209> get<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:08.169> power<00:04:09.010> of<00:04:09.370> his<00:04:10.239> skin

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
Morales would get the power of his skin

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.569 
Morales would get the power of his skin
not<00:04:11.139> being<00:04:11.409> able<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:11.709> be<00:04:11.949> caught<00:04:12.190> and<00:04:12.400> he's

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
not being able to be caught and he's

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.369 
not being able to be caught and he's
bulletproof<00:04:13.120> two<00:04:13.690> bullets<00:04:14.109> and<00:04:14.290> everything

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
bulletproof two bullets and everything

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.170 
bulletproof two bullets and everything
but<00:04:15.599> that's<00:04:16.599> probably<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.579> best<00:04:18.579> answer<00:04:18.880> I

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
but that's probably the best answer I

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.750 
but that's probably the best answer I
can<00:04:19.389> come<00:04:19.419> up<00:04:19.659> with<00:04:19.690> that<00:04:20.049> Miles<00:04:20.829> Morales<00:04:21.310> does

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
can come up with that Miles Morales does

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.820 
can come up with that Miles Morales does
turn<00:04:22.000> out<00:04:22.150> to<00:04:22.210> be<00:04:22.360> Luke<00:04:22.599> Cage<00:04:22.840> cause<00:04:23.110> why<00:04:23.620> else

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
turn out to be Luke Cage cause why else

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.589 
turn out to be Luke Cage cause why else
would<00:04:23.979> be<00:04:24.070> he'll<00:04:24.159> be<00:04:24.220> like<00:04:24.340> this<00:04:24.400> you<00:04:25.180> like<00:04:25.360> so

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
would be he'll be like this you like so
