00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.999
 you dream to create a hydrogen bomb 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:01.559
 and then the side has already created 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:04.739

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.199
 nothing helped the west 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.539
 after the second world war rehabilitation

 profitable in terms of prestige 

00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:00.229
 the issue 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.229
 in the eyes of the world, the west trudged behind 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.900
 it came to the point that in the 60s he 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.720
 he passed any Soviet resolution 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.790
 union since the vast majority 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.650
 spending voted for them only later 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.009
 worth pushing the world leader this
