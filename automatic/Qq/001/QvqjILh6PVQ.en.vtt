all about music of the future and being

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.870 
all about music of the future and being
futuristic<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.780> think<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.049> things<00:02:07.229> are<00:02:07.409> two

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
futuristic and I think of things are two

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.390 
futuristic and I think of things are two
to<00:02:08.880> like<00:02:09.600> set<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.560> an<00:02:10.739> error<00:02:10.920> whether<00:02:11.250> it's

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
to like set in in an error whether it's

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.310 
to like set in in an error whether it's
an<00:02:11.519> 80's<00:02:11.820> disco<00:02:12.000> tune<00:02:12.420> or<00:02:12.600> a<00:02:12.630> nice<00:02:12.780> house<00:02:13.049> tune

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
an 80's disco tune or a nice house tune

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.500 
an 80's disco tune or a nice house tune
they<00:02:13.769> just<00:02:13.980> become<00:02:14.250> sounding<00:02:15.120> like<00:02:15.180> something

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
they just become sounding like something

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.790

of<00:02:15.599> their<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:15.930> think<00:02:16.140> dance<00:02:16.349> music<00:02:16.709> has

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
of their and I think dance music has

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.559 
of their and I think dance music has
always<00:02:16.980> gotta<00:02:17.370> lean<00:02:17.580> towards<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.060> future<00:02:18.209> as
