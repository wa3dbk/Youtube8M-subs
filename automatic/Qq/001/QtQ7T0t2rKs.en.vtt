00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
reaching 261 miles per gallon this thing

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.070 
reaching 261 miles per gallon this thing
will<00:00:18.720> be<00:00:18.869> hitting<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.260> streets<00:00:19.680> soon<00:00:20.010> now

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080

these<00:00:22.080> numbers<00:00:22.560> are<00:00:22.890> calculated<00:00:23.760> with<00:00:24.090> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
these numbers are calculated with the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.050 
these numbers are calculated with the
Imperial<00:00:25.260> gallon<00:00:25.740> most<00:00:26.010> likely<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:26.849> we're

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
Imperial gallon most likely so we're

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.060 
Imperial gallon most likely so we're
going<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.240> see<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.630> number<00:00:28.320> change<00:00:28.710> just<00:00:28.980> a

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
going to see that number change just a

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.679 
going to see that number change just a
little<00:00:29.400> bit<00:00:29.550> when<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.880> see<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> conversion

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
little bit when you see the conversion

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.340 
little bit when you see the conversion
as<00:00:30.810> far<00:00:31.019> as<00:00:31.170> American<00:00:32.809> US<00:00:33.809> gallons<00:00:34.230> are

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
as far as American US gallons are

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.740 
as far as American US gallons are
concerned<00:00:34.710> okay<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:36.120> might<00:00:36.270> see<00:00:36.420> about<00:00:36.570> 2

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
concerned okay so we might see about 2

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.920 
concerned okay so we might see about 2
45<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.620> 50<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.280> nonetheless<00:00:38.719> amazing<00:00:39.719> gas

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
like the old school just a gasoline

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.500 
like the old school just a gasoline

all<00:01:00.719> these<00:01:00.750> things<00:01:01.320> coming<00:01:01.739> about<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.910> just

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
all these things coming about it's just

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.490 
all these things coming about it's just
really<00:01:03.329> not<00:01:03.570> going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.809> be<00:01:03.930> feasible<00:01:04.350> you're

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
really not going to be feasible you're

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.329 
really not going to be feasible you're
going<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.949> learn<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.280> new

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
going to have to learn this new

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.789 
going to have to learn this new
technology<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.240> roll<00:01:07.140> with<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.380> punches

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
technology and roll with the punches

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.429 
technology and roll with the punches
unfortunately<00:01:08.549> but<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.780> bright<00:01:09.810> side<00:01:10.140> of

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
unfortunately but on the bright side of

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.859 
unfortunately but on the bright side of
things<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:11.040> get<00:01:11.250> amazing<00:01:11.850> gas<00:01:12.210> mileage<00:01:12.659> out<00:01:12.810> of

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
things we get amazing gas mileage out of

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.570 
things we get amazing gas mileage out of
it<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:14.030> let's<00:01:15.030> proceed<00:01:15.740> this<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:17.130> came<00:01:17.340> out

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
it so let's proceed this just came out

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.340 
it so let's proceed this just came out
and<00:01:17.689> 261<00:01:18.689> miles<00:01:19.020> per<00:01:19.350> gallon<00:01:19.909> it's<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.350> plug-in

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
and 261 miles per gallon it's a plug-in

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.240 
and 261 miles per gallon it's a plug-in
diesel<00:01:23.340> hybrid<00:01:23.580> system<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.659> see<00:01:24.930> too<00:01:25.320> so

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
diesel hybrid system it can see too so

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.140 
diesel hybrid system it can see too so
you<00:01:27.150> know<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.900> does<00:01:28.170> kind<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.799> cut<00:01:29.579> back<00:01:29.820> and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
you know that does kind of cut back and

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.700 
you know that does kind of cut back and
you<00:01:30.270> know<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.780> might<00:01:30.960> not<00:01:31.079> work<00:01:31.140> for<00:01:31.470> some

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
you know it might not work for some

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.230 
you know it might not work for some
people<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.310> know<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:32.939> kids

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
people you know if you have kids

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.080 
people you know if you have kids
whatever<00:01:33.860> but<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.159> put<00:01:35.340> two<00:01:35.490> people<00:01:35.729> will

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
whatever but you can put two people will

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.910 
whatever but you can put two people will
obviously<00:01:36.390> have<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.900> trunk<00:01:37.259> here<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:37.890> you

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
obviously have a trunk here and as you

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.690 
obviously have a trunk here and as you
can<00:01:38.189> see<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.430> very<00:01:39.090> well<00:01:39.869> designed<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:41.009> far<00:01:41.640> as

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
can see a very well designed as far as

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.249 
can see a very well designed as far as

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
aerodynamics is concerned vehicle you

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.800 
aerodynamics is concerned vehicle you
have<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.740> rear<00:01:47.130> tire<00:01:47.460> covered<00:01:48.119> preventing

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
have this rear tire covered preventing

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.719 
have this rear tire covered preventing
