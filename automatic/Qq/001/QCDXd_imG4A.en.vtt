this one I'm going to go ahead and go
darker<00:02:53.020> around<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.590> bottom<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.160> then<00:02:54.370> I'll

darker around the bottom and then I'll

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.060 
darker around the bottom and then I'll
let<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:55.000> ink<00:02:55.300> kind<00:02:55.990> of<00:02:56.170> run<00:02:56.320> out<00:02:56.500> as<00:02:56.740> I<00:02:56.890> get

towards the top so it has a little bit

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.480 
towards the top so it has a little bit
more<00:02:58.810> depth<00:02:59.080> as<00:02:59.350> if<00:02:59.710> it's<00:02:59.920> heavier<00:03:00.190> on<00:03:00.460> the

going<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.209> try<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.480> use<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:47.500> heavier<00:03:47.800> color<00:03:48.130> at

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
going to try to use the heavier color at

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.280 
going to try to use the heavier color at
the<00:03:48.459> bottom<00:03:48.580> of<00:03:48.880> the<00:03:48.940> flower<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.540> as<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.140> runs

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
the bottom of the flower and as it runs

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.730 
the bottom of the flower and as it runs
out<00:03:50.500> it's<00:03:50.890> lighter<00:03:51.130> at<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.430> top<00:03:52.530> to<00:03:53.530> get<00:03:53.709> a

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
out it's lighter at the top to get a

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.010 
out it's lighter at the top to get a
little<00:03:53.980> more<00:03:54.220> intense<00:03:54.700> color<00:03:55.060> I'm<00:03:55.390> using<00:03:55.690> the

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
little more intense color I'm using the

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.930 
little more intense color I'm using the
same<00:03:56.260> color<00:03:56.320> marker<00:03:57.040> so<00:03:57.280> this<00:03:57.459> is<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:57.760> ripe

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
same color marker so this is the ripe

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.510 
same color marker so this is the ripe
persimmon<00:03:58.570> marker<00:03:59.080> and<00:03:59.380> again<00:04:00.190> I'm<00:04:00.370> just

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
persimmon marker and again I'm just

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.190 
persimmon marker and again I'm just
going<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:00.790> add<00:04:00.910> some<00:04:00.940> deeper<00:04:01.600> color<00:04:01.810> at<00:04:02.050> the

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200

going to add some deeper color at the
bottom<00:04:02.320> and<00:04:02.740> I'll<00:04:03.459> just<00:04:03.610> go<00:04:03.760> back<00:04:03.940> over<00:04:04.420> a

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
bottom and I'll just go back over a

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.840 
bottom and I'll just go back over a
couple<00:04:05.230> times<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.680> couple<00:04:05.950> passes<00:04:06.370> just<00:04:06.580> to<00:04:06.670> get

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
little bit of fuzzy there that I wiped

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.760 
little bit of fuzzy there that I wiped

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.539 
I'll do the same with my wild honey and
also<00:04:19.720> my<00:04:20.109> peacock<00:04:20.620> feathers<00:04:21.010> so<00:04:21.310> I've<00:04:21.520> just

also my peacock feathers so I've just

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.159 
also my peacock feathers so I've just
added<00:04:21.880> a<00:04:22.060> little<00:04:22.090> bit<00:04:22.300> of<00:04:22.450> color<00:04:22.630> and<00:04:22.750> again

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
added a little bit of color and again

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.860 
added a little bit of color and again
used<00:04:23.380> that<00:04:23.530> water<00:04:23.710> brush<00:04:24.010> just<00:04:24.220> to<00:04:24.340> blend<00:04:24.840> so<00:04:25.840> I

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
used that water brush just to blend so I

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.220 
used that water brush just to blend so I
have<00:04:26.290> trimmed<00:04:26.620> my<00:04:26.890> panel<00:04:27.400> and<00:04:27.669> I've<00:04:27.790> put

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
have trimmed my panel and I've put

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.350 
have trimmed my panel and I've put
to<00:04:28.560> a<00:04:28.590> piece<00:04:29.040> of<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.310> Simon<00:04:29.700> Says<00:04:29.910> black

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
to a piece of the Simon Says black

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.060 
to a piece of the Simon Says black
cardstock<00:04:30.750> and<00:04:31.320> so<00:04:31.560> here's<00:04:31.770> my<00:04:31.830> little

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
cardstock and so here's my little

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.950 
cardstock and so here's my little
flowers<00:04:32.490> I've<00:04:32.670> used<00:04:32.880> some<00:04:33.030> pop<00:04:33.270> dots<00:04:33.570> to<00:04:33.780> pop

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
flowers I've used some pop dots to pop

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.570 
flowers I've used some pop dots to pop
them<00:04:34.200> up<00:04:34.380> so<00:04:34.620> it's<00:04:34.770> just<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:35.040> couple<00:04:35.340> of<00:04:35.460> them

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
them up so it's just a couple of them

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.880 
them up so it's just a couple of them
not<00:04:35.820> every<00:04:36.210> one<00:04:36.390> of<00:04:36.420> them<00:04:36.660> are<00:04:37.140> popped<00:04:37.500> up<00:04:37.710> but

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
not every one of them are popped up but

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.310 
not every one of them are popped up but
it<00:04:37.980> gives<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.310> really<00:04:38.580> nice<00:04:39.320> dimensional

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
it gives a really nice dimensional

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.300 
it gives a really nice dimensional
effect<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:40.920> so<00:04:41.550> I<00:04:41.580> have<00:04:42.000> this<00:04:42.180> piece<00:04:42.750> of<00:04:43.310> black

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
effect and so I have this piece of black

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.800 
effect and so I have this piece of black
cardstock<00:04:44.490> that's<00:04:44.970> left<00:04:45.180> over<00:04:45.330> and<00:04:45.630> I<00:04:45.660> thought

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
cardstock that's left over and I thought

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.570 
cardstock that's left over and I thought
this<00:04:45.930> would<00:04:46.080> be<00:04:46.140> really<00:04:46.260> great<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.980> stamp<00:04:47.430> my

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
this would be really great to stamp my

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.870 
this would be really great to stamp my
message<00:04:47.910> on<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:48.840> this<00:04:49.620> message<00:04:50.040> is<00:04:50.280> actually

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
message on and this message is actually

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.480 
message on and this message is actually
almost<00:04:51.330> a<00:04:51.720> full<00:04:52.020> card<00:04:52.350> length<00:04:52.650> and<00:04:53.010> for<00:04:53.400> the

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
almost a full card length and for the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.770 
almost a full card length and for the
first<00:04:53.730> time<00:04:53.910> I<00:04:53.970> don't<00:04:54.210> think<00:04:54.360> I've<00:04:54.450> ever<00:04:54.600> done

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
first time I don't think I've ever done

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.440 
first time I don't think I've ever done
this<00:04:54.840> but<00:04:55.230> I'm<00:04:55.410> going<00:04:55.560> to<00:04:55.650> go<00:04:55.770> ahead<00:04:55.890> and<00:04:56.460> cut

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
this but I'm going to go ahead and cut

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.010 
this but I'm going to go ahead and cut
into<00:04:57.690> this<00:04:57.960> because<00:04:58.890> I<00:04:58.920> can't<00:04:59.750> try<00:05:00.750> to<00:05:00.810> ink

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
into this because I can't try to ink

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.690 
into this because I can't try to ink
this<00:05:01.260> in<00:05:01.470> two<00:05:01.620> separate<00:05:01.950> pieces<00:05:02.130> because

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
this in two separate pieces because

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.100 
this in two separate pieces because
these<00:05:02.880> letters<00:05:03.210> are<00:05:03.360> really<00:05:03.600> close<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:04.020> each

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
these letters are really close to each

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.720 
these letters are really close to each
other<00:05:04.230> so<00:05:04.500> I'm<00:05:04.890> going<00:05:05.040> to<00:05:05.100> go<00:05:05.250> ahead<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.610> use

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
other so I'm going to go ahead and use

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.370 
other so I'm going to go ahead and use
my<00:05:05.940> scissors<00:05:06.150> like<00:05:06.540> I<00:05:06.660> would<00:05:06.840> with<00:05:06.960> my<00:05:07.110> clear
