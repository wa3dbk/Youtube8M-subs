are<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.070> few<00:00:20.310> changes<00:00:20.789> or<00:00:21.060> mechanics<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.600> I

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
are a few changes or mechanics that I

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.290 
are a few changes or mechanics that I
didn't<00:00:22.050> recognize<00:00:22.410> her<00:00:22.560> PTR<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.850> listen<00:00:24.210> up

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
didn't recognize her PTR so listen up

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.150 
didn't recognize her PTR so listen up
for<00:00:24.480> those<00:00:24.689> but<00:00:25.230> mainly<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.830> fight<00:00:26.010> is

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
for those but mainly the fight is

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.910 
for those but mainly the fight is
similar<00:00:26.609> for<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.910> execution<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:28.529> kind<00:00:28.800> of

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
similar for in execution it's kind of

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.189 
similar for in execution it's kind of
complex<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.820> sort<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.119> akin<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.570> your<00:00:30.960> saj

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
complex and is sort of akin to your saj

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.130 
complex and is sort of akin to your saj
from<00:00:31.560> Dragon<00:00:31.949> Soul<00:00:32.420> so<00:00:33.420> why<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.899> fight

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
from Dragon Soul so why is this fight

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.889 
from Dragon Soul so why is this fight
like<00:00:34.380> your<00:00:34.620> saj<00:00:34.940> well<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.480> pick<00:00:36.660> how<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
like your saj well you can pick how the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.990 
like your saj well you can pick how the
fight<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.290> going<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.680> go<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.190> what<00:00:38.460> mechanics

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
fight is going to go and what mechanics

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.970 
fight is going to go and what mechanics
you<00:00:39.090> want<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.329> deal<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:39.719> every<00:00:40.410> half<00:00:40.590> minute

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
you want to deal with every half minute

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.880 
you want to deal with every half minute
or<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:42.300> assembly<00:00:42.750> line<00:00:42.930> over<00:00:43.230> here<00:00:43.260> will

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
or so this assembly line over here will

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.560 
or so this assembly line over here will
bring<00:00:44.129> out<00:00:44.340> three<00:00:44.640> different<00:00:45.090> weapons<00:00:45.420> that

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
bring out three different weapons that

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.410 
bring out three different weapons that
you<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.899> kill<00:00:46.110> off<00:00:46.460> but<00:00:47.460> once<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.789> kill<00:00:48.059> one

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
you can kill off but once you kill one

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.600 
you can kill off but once you kill one
of<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.719> set<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.020> three<00:00:49.050> all<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:50.370> rest

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
of the set of three all of the rest

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.090 
of the set of three all of the rest
become<00:00:51.090> immune<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.390> damage<00:00:51.920> once<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
become immune to damage once the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.740 
become immune to damage once the
remaining<00:00:53.520> weapons<00:00:53.670> reach<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.360> machine

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
remaining weapons reach this machine

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.990 
remaining weapons reach this machine
here<00:00:55.110> they<00:00:55.710> pop<00:00:55.980> out<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.550> other<00:00:56.670> side<00:00:56.789> of

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
here they pop out on the other side of

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.360 
here they pop out on the other side of
the<00:00:57.149> machine<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.050> become<00:00:58.350> active<00:00:58.829> until<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the machine and become active until the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.510 
the machine and become active until the
next<00:00:59.550> set<00:00:59.760> comes<00:01:00.000> out<00:01:00.680> so<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.829> course<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.399> need

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
next set comes out so of course you need

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.039 
next set comes out so of course you need
to<00:01:02.670> send<00:01:02.820> some<00:01:03.000> people<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> assembly

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
will need to be well-versed in this run

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.929 
will need to be well-versed in this run
so<00:02:18.930> remember<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.650> kill<00:02:19.859> one<00:02:20.099> weapon<00:02:20.549> out<00:02:20.700> of

three and the other to come out that

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.489 
three and the other to come out that
means<00:02:23.999> you<00:02:24.180> will<00:02:24.329> have<00:02:24.389> to<00:02:24.689> deal<00:02:24.870> with<00:02:25.079> two<00:02:25.379> of

through all four the weapon types and

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.000 
through all four the weapon types and
you<00:02:30.420> can<00:02:30.540> decide<00:02:30.810> for<00:02:31.019> yourself<00:02:31.409> which<00:02:31.739> one<00:02:31.980> of

you can decide for yourself which one of
these<00:02:32.219> you<00:02:32.459> don't<00:02:32.730> want<00:02:32.939> to<00:02:33.030> deal<00:02:33.180> with<00:02:33.950> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
these you don't want to deal with the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.379 
these you don't want to deal with the
shockwave<00:02:35.400> missile<00:02:35.790> will<00:02:36.060> have<00:02:36.239> you

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
shockwave missile will have you

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.319

remembering<00:02:36.870> Regnerus<00:02:37.530> from<00:02:37.739> Firelands<00:02:38.400> it

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
remembering Regnerus from Firelands it

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.179 
remembering Regnerus from Firelands it
basically<00:02:39.719> does<00:02:39.959> this<00:02:40.200> kind<00:02:40.469> of<00:02:40.590> wave<00:02:40.919> like

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
basically does this kind of wave like

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.940 
basically does this kind of wave like
ground<00:02:41.669> AoE<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.019> just<00:02:43.260> need<00:02:43.439> to<00:02:43.590> avoid

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
ground AoE that you just need to avoid

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.000 
ground AoE that you just need to avoid
just<00:02:44.849> stand<00:02:45.120> near<00:02:45.329> the<00:02:45.359> active<00:02:45.930> zone<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.469> then

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
just stand near the active zone and then

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.069 
just stand near the active zone and then
get<00:02:47.219> ready<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.579> move<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:48.000> when<00:02:48.419> it<00:02:48.540> disappears

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
get ready to move in when it disappears

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.280 
get ready to move in when it disappears
just<00:02:49.709> like<00:02:49.889> on<00:02:50.069> rag<00:02:50.689> laser<00:02:51.689> turrets<00:02:52.139> are

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
just like on rag laser turrets are

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.020 
just like on rag laser turrets are
pretty<00:02:52.530> simple<00:02:52.949> they<00:02:53.340> will<00:02:53.489> focus<00:02:53.699> on<00:02:54.000> a

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
pretty simple they will focus on a

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.080 
pretty simple they will focus on a
person<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.719> pursue<00:02:55.109> them<00:02:55.290> for<00:02:55.469> 10<00:02:55.650> seconds

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
any place the laser hits will be

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.920 
any place the laser hits will be
superheated<00:02:59.129> and<00:02:59.459> hurt<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.299> if<00:03:00.449> you<00:03:00.540> stand<00:03:00.780> in

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930

it obviously the electro magic does a

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.559 
it obviously the electro magic does a
bunch<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.859> just<00:03:05.159> pulsing<00:03:05.549> AoE<00:03:05.879> damage<00:03:05.969> and

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
bunch of just pulsing AoE damage and

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:08.699 
pull saw blades from the boss to them

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:11.659 
pull saw blades from the boss to them
and<00:03:09.199> lastly<00:03:10.199> the<00:03:10.439> caller<00:03:10.680> minds<00:03:11.010> will<00:03:11.310> fixate

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:11.669 
and lastly the caller minds will fixate

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.280 
and lastly the caller minds will fixate
on<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.879> raid<00:03:12.180> member<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.780> if<00:03:12.989> they<00:03:13.109> reach

missiles<00:03:30.180> on<00:03:30.419> top<00:03:30.629> of<00:03:30.780> everything<00:03:30.900> else<00:03:31.290> so

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189 
missiles on top of everything else so

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:33.860 
missiles on top of everything else so
they<00:03:32.220> disabled<00:03:32.819> them<00:03:33.000> and<00:03:33.269> dealt<00:03:33.599> with<00:03:33.750> the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
they disabled them and dealt with the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.259 
they disabled them and dealt with the
other<00:03:33.989> mechanics<00:03:34.560> just<00:03:35.489> find<00:03:35.699> out<00:03:35.819> what<00:03:35.879> works

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
other mechanics just find out what works

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.050 
other mechanics just find out what works
best<00:03:36.569> for<00:03:36.810> your<00:03:36.989> team<00:03:37.349> we<00:03:38.340> also<00:03:38.489> chose<00:03:38.849> to

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
best for your team we also chose to

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.210 
best for your team we also chose to
disable<00:03:39.479> missiles<00:03:39.870> whenever<00:03:40.650> they<00:03:40.829> came<00:03:41.069> out

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
disable missiles whenever they came out

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.460 
disable missiles whenever they came out
and<00:03:41.549> if<00:03:41.669> they<00:03:41.729> weren't<00:03:42.030> there<00:03:42.299> we<00:03:42.930> disabled<00:03:43.379> a

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
and if they weren't there we disabled a

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.770 
and if they weren't there we disabled a
laser<00:03:43.709> although<00:03:44.639> it<00:03:44.729> was<00:03:44.849> rare<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.299> not<00:03:45.479> see<00:03:45.750> a

electromagnet and you just need to avoid
them<00:04:04.169> as<00:04:04.409> they<00:04:04.650> hurt<00:04:04.829> pretty<00:04:05.009> bad<00:04:05.310> as<00:04:05.609> well<00:04:06.419> you

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
them as they hurt pretty bad as well you

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.689 
them as they hurt pretty bad as well you
need<00:04:07.199> to<00:04:07.319> make<00:04:07.439> sure<00:04:07.680> none<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.250> ads<00:04:08.430> in

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
need to make sure none of the ads in

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
tank with electrostatic charge which

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.320 
tank with electrostatic charge which
does<00:04:22.500> some<00:04:22.740> nature<00:04:23.039> damage<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.760> each<00:04:24.000> deck

does some nature damage and each deck

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.510 
does some nature damage and each deck
increases<00:04:25.050> subsequent<00:04:25.590> damage<00:04:25.740> taken<00:04:26.130> from

increases subsequent damage taken from
the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
the

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.850 
the
Raja's<00:04:27.069> but<00:04:28.030> more<00:04:28.210> importantly<00:04:28.840> they<00:04:29.530> let<00:04:29.710> you

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
Raja's but more importantly they let you

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.860 
Raja's but more importantly they let you
do<00:04:30.039> a<00:04:30.069> ton<00:04:30.580> of<00:04:30.610> damage<00:04:30.939> to<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.419> shredders

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
do a ton of damage to the shredders

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.860 
do a ton of damage to the shredders
specifically<00:04:32.879> the<00:04:33.879> shredders<00:04:34.240> that<00:04:34.449> come<00:04:34.659> out

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
specifically the shredders that come out

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.140 
specifically the shredders that come out
must<00:04:35.319> be<00:04:35.530> tanked<00:04:35.800> of<00:04:35.889> course<00:04:36.159> but<00:04:36.879> they<00:04:37.000> have<00:04:37.120> a

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
must be tanked of course but they have a

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.209 
must be tanked of course but they have a
buff<00:04:37.449> on<00:04:37.659> them<00:04:37.870> that<00:04:38.199> makes<00:04:38.349> them<00:04:38.469> take<00:04:38.800> 90

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:39.219 
buff on them that makes them take 90

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:41.999 
buff on them that makes them take 90
percent<00:04:39.550> less<00:04:39.699> damage<00:04:40.120> so<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.199> tanks<00:04:41.680> need<00:04:41.889> to

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
percent less damage so the tanks need to

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:43.830 
percent less damage so the tanks need to
get<00:04:42.129> a<00:04:42.159> few<00:04:42.430> stacks<00:04:42.699> of<00:04:43.000> the<00:04:43.120> electrostatic

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
get a few stacks of the electrostatic

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.140 
get a few stacks of the electrostatic
charge<00:04:44.169> and<00:04:44.530> then<00:04:45.159> beat<00:04:45.400> on<00:04:45.550> these<00:04:45.729> shredders

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
charge and then beat on these shredders

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.080 
charge and then beat on these shredders
in<00:04:46.889> addition<00:04:47.889> you<00:04:48.340> can<00:04:48.370> also<00:04:48.639> have<00:04:49.000> the

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
in addition you can also have the

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.059 
in addition you can also have the
shredders<00:04:49.449> be<00:04:49.629> damaged<00:04:50.050> by<00:04:50.229> saw<00:04:50.500> blades<00:04:50.830> and

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:51.069 
shredders be damaged by saw blades and

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:53.189 
shredders be damaged by saw blades and
the<00:04:51.639> superheated<00:04:52.180> ground<00:04:52.419> from<00:04:52.629> the<00:04:52.689> lasers

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
the superheated ground from the lasers

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:55.860 
the superheated ground from the lasers
so<00:04:54.069> go<00:04:54.400> ahead<00:04:54.550> and<00:04:54.729> drag<00:04:55.120> them<00:04:55.270> into<00:04:55.509> anything

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
so go ahead and drag them into anything

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.379 
so go ahead and drag them into anything
you<00:04:56.139> can<00:04:56.409> but<00:04:57.310> always<00:04:57.520> make<00:04:57.789> sure<00:04:57.819> that<00:04:58.000> they

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
you can but always make sure that they

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.629 
you can but always make sure that they
are<00:04:58.479> away<00:04:58.930> from<00:04:59.229> the<00:04:59.349> boss<00:04:59.560> where<00:05:00.250> else<00:05:00.490> they

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
are away from the boss where else they

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.240 
are away from the boss where else they
will<00:05:00.789> get<00:05:00.909> healed<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:02.289> tanks<00:05:02.590> I<00:05:02.710> was<00:05:02.949> running

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
will get healed the tanks I was running

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.219 
will get healed the tanks I was running
with<00:05:03.370> seem<00:05:03.789> to<00:05:03.969> say<00:05:04.150> two<00:05:04.569> to<00:05:04.599> three<00:05:04.930> stacks

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
with seem to say two to three stacks

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:06.839 
with seem to say two to three stacks
would<00:05:05.530> help<00:05:05.770> kill<00:05:06.009> the<00:05:06.159> shredders<00:05:06.460> off<00:05:06.639> in

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
would help kill the shredders off in

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:08.850 
would help kill the shredders off in
time<00:05:07.120> for<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.870> next<00:05:07.900> one<00:05:08.199> to<00:05:08.319> come<00:05:08.349> out<00:05:08.620> and

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
time for the next one to come out and

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.490 
time for the next one to come out and
tanks<00:05:09.250> whoa<00:05:09.930> shredders<00:05:10.930> do<00:05:11.110> a<00:05:11.139> few<00:05:11.440> things

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
tanks whoa shredders do a few things

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.040 
tanks whoa shredders do a few things
themselves<00:05:11.979> such<00:05:12.729> as<00:05:12.909> casting<00:05:13.330> overload<00:05:13.810> and

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
themselves such as casting overload and

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.100 
themselves such as casting overload and
death<00:05:14.259> from<00:05:14.440> above<00:05:15.300> overload<00:05:16.300> is<00:05:16.539> just<00:05:16.840> a<00:05:16.930> big

slowed and beat down so that you can

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.409 
slowed and beat down so that you can
explode<00:05:57.039> them<00:05:57.279> when<00:05:57.610> the<00:05:57.699> healers<00:05:58.060> are<00:05:58.210> ready
