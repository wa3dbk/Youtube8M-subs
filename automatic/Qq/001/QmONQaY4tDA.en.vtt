00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
gonna get around to doing that it's just

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.190 
gonna get around to doing that it's just
a<00:03:41.610> matter<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:41.970> when<00:03:42.480> I<00:03:42.510> have<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.750> time<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.959> do

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
a matter of when I have the time to do

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.949 
a matter of when I have the time to do
that<00:03:43.230> because<00:03:43.620> what<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.579> guy<00:03:45.060> requested<00:03:45.690> for

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
that because what the guy requested for

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.340 
that because what the guy requested for
that<00:03:46.140> was<00:03:47.150> it's<00:03:48.150> not<00:03:48.299> so<00:03:48.420> much<00:03:48.570> that<00:03:48.630> takes<00:03:49.140> so

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
that was it's not so much that takes so

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.440 
that was it's not so much that takes so
long<00:03:49.650> it's<00:03:50.100> just<00:03:50.430> kind<00:03:50.670> of<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.790> lot<00:03:50.910> of<00:03:51.000> code<00:03:51.209> and

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
long it's just kind of a lot of code and

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.020 
long it's just kind of a lot of code and
so<00:03:52.170> it<00:03:52.739> takes<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.040> while<00:03:53.070> to<00:03:53.190> explain<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:53.850> and

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
so it takes a while to explain that and

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.600 
so it takes a while to explain that and

we can get to the tutorial now we've
created<00:04:04.950> our<00:04:05.130> sprites<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.730> objects<00:04:06.390> okay<00:04:06.900> so

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
created our sprites and objects okay so

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.920 
created our sprites and objects okay so
we<00:04:07.650> have<00:04:07.769> an<00:04:08.010> SBR<00:04:08.430> Wally<00:04:08.670> will<00:04:09.299> basically<00:04:09.900> a

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
we have an SBR Wally will basically a

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.460 
we have an SBR Wally will basically a
ball<00:04:10.260> sprite<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.920> a<00:04:11.310> wall<00:04:11.640> spray<00:04:12.180> okay<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.200> we

ball sprite and a wall spray okay and we
create<00:04:13.799> two<00:04:13.980> objects<00:04:14.459> for<00:04:14.609> those<00:04:14.760> and<00:04:15.000> named

diagonal arrows and I'm going to go a

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.330 
diagonal arrows and I'm going to go a
speed<00:04:50.580> of<00:04:50.759> 10<00:04:51.060> for<00:04:51.419> my<00:04:51.539> ball<00:04:51.979> all<00:04:52.979> right<00:04:53.099> so

00:04:57.739 --> 00:04:57.749 
way when you click more than one arrow

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:58.760 
way when you click more than one arrow
on<00:04:57.900> here

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
on here

on here
it's<00:04:59.159> especially<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.759> diagonal<00:05:00.270> arrows<00:05:00.479> your

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
it's especially the diagonal arrows your

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.959 
it's especially the diagonal arrows your
ball<00:05:01.319> pretty<00:05:01.620> much<00:05:01.860> just<00:05:02.129> to<00:05:02.370> it<00:05:02.490> when<00:05:02.610> it<00:05:02.729> gets

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:02.969 
ball pretty much just to it when it gets

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.480 
ball pretty much just to it when it gets
created<00:05:03.240> it<00:05:03.599> just<00:05:03.810> chooses<00:05:04.169> at<00:05:04.409> random<00:05:04.919> which

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
created it just chooses at random which

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.990 
created it just chooses at random which
direction<00:05:05.939> it<00:05:06.180> wants<00:05:06.779> to<00:05:07.020> go<00:05:07.169> so<00:05:07.650> yeah<00:05:08.009> alright

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:11.219 
and what we wanna do now is add event

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:13.730 
and what we wanna do now is add event
collision<00:05:11.969> with<00:05:12.180> our<00:05:12.300> wall<00:05:12.479> and<00:05:12.840> click<00:05:13.620> and

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
collision with our wall and click and

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.480 
collision with our wall and click and
drag<00:05:13.800> over<00:05:14.129> a<00:05:14.539> bounce<00:05:15.539> and<00:05:16.080> all<00:05:17.009> we<00:05:17.129> need<00:05:17.279> to<00:05:17.370> do

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
drag over a bounce and all we need to do

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.320 
drag over a bounce and all we need to do
is<00:05:18.020> hit<00:05:19.020> OK<00:05:19.460> alright<00:05:20.460> and<00:05:20.729> actually<00:05:21.120> really
