00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.580
 Won skins dot ru link is in

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.550
 thugs with you panda bistmaster against 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.130
 jagernaau as a bistmaster not feeling in 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.170
 him a lot of popularity play a little 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.320
 this kid though it would seem yes that is 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.050
 lively ward great little wicked 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.990
 mate boar cool cartoon who 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.489
 lets in batch confidently enough 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.290
 feel good for control 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.380
 opponents but in principle axes 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.910
 they are flying far normally, I don't know those 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.910
 no less without a master is not particularly popular 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.710
 the hero does not understand what it is connected 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.570
 maybe microcontrol accurately 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.910
 the microcontrol is also a boar and the bird is not 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.660
 I know g-canon right now on the contrary 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.640
 they play a lot especially after 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.260
 you yourself know what events if you him 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.739
 slightly raised the hero feels 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.379
 confident enough and many at 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.940
 as his last time has been picking 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.379
 regards tons modes here of course 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.600
 control is very important 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.340
 while the Juggernaut with the bad that is, 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.310
 Jacks on this essentially no control and 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.740
 no difference from no master who 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.689
 somehow slows down his hog and 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.869
 at the very least, but ultimately it gives 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.549
 and the evil stunning accordingly 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.799
 asphalt if it is true that they will have time 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.540
 time to get stuck properly fly then 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.220
 without master confident enough them 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.420
 doing it just because at first 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.270
 drives them away with axes 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.360
 here of course there is a great thing in the mouth to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.689
 silishi which basically save the ass 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.970
 juggernaut first with our appearance 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.369
 ulta if dinalt did not have time 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.509
 zaiveydit accordingly they 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.990
 get stunning then another 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.630
 improvement at this time they are cut and in the end 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.759
 youtube jiri just die 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.950
 unable to withstand this tough load 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.170
 so without a master of course more powerful is 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.000
 fairly obvious simply because 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.860
 it has more different possibilities and 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.079
 at the very least he has the opportunity to once and 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.909
 forest feed unlike logs 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.799
 for which this business is quite complicated 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.360
 so confident victory without masters 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.660
 even without any big 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:17.780
 effort five master kill points and two 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.760
