bit later let's start off by selecting
guitar<00:01:42.470> head<00:01:42.820> right<00:01:43.820> now<00:01:43.970> we've<00:01:44.150> got<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:44.860> 1965

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
guitar head right now we've got the 1965

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.270 
guitar head right now we've got the 1965
bright<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:46.810> selected<00:01:47.810> let's<00:01:48.710> actually<00:01:48.830> hear

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
bright and selected let's actually hear

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.820 
bright and selected let's actually hear
how<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:49.909> sounds<00:01:50.440> just<00:01:51.440> playing<00:01:51.740> through

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
how that sounds just playing through

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.370 
how that sounds just playing through
Stratocaster<00:01:52.610> plugged<00:01:52.940> directly<00:01:53.210> in<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:54.170> the

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
Stratocaster plugged directly in to the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:06.280 
Stratocaster plugged directly in to the
input<00:01:54.619> on<00:01:54.979> the

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.990 

already<00:02:06.980> here<00:02:07.130> a<00:02:07.160> little<00:02:07.430> bit<00:02:07.580> of<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:07.760> tube

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
already here a little bit of that tube

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.020 
already here a little bit of that tube
grit<00:02:08.420> I've<00:02:08.990> got<00:02:09.170> my<00:02:09.350> tube<00:02:10.220> saturation<00:02:10.460> at

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
grit I've got my tube saturation at

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.900 
grit I've got my tube saturation at
about<00:02:11.270> 12<00:02:12.230> o'clock<00:02:12.260> right<00:02:12.650> now<00:02:12.830> let's<00:02:13.460> tune<00:02:13.760> it

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
about 12 o'clock right now let's tune it

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:30.540 
about 12 o'clock right now let's tune it
up<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.750> 3:00

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.400 

so<00:02:31.550> in<00:02:31.850> addition<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.360> input<00:02:32.750> controls<00:02:33.140> on

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
so in addition to the input controls on

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.060 
so in addition to the input controls on
the<00:02:33.650> actual<00:02:33.950> st2<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:35.150> can<00:02:35.300> control<00:02:35.770> all<00:02:36.770> the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
the actual st2 you can control all the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.410 
the actual st2 you can control all the
little<00:02:37.570> parameters<00:02:38.570> on<00:02:39.500> each<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.790> the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
little parameters on each of the the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.360 
little parameters on each of the the
actual<00:02:41.720> amps<00:02:42.020> here<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:42.380> like<00:02:42.530> here<00:02:43.160> we've<00:02:43.280> got

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
actual amps here so like here we've got

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.700 
actual amps here so like here we've got
our<00:02:43.430> little<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:44.720> know<00:02:44.810> our<00:02:44.930> fender<00:02:45.230> emulation

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
our little you know our fender emulation

00:02:45.710 --> 00:03:10.759 
our little you know our fender emulation
to<00:02:45.800> switch<00:02:46.040> them<00:02:46.250> with<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.300> bright<00:02:47.510> switch

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.020 

and<00:03:11.769> there's<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.040> ton<00:03:12.219> of<00:03:12.250> amp<00:03:12.489> heads<00:03:12.700> in<00:03:12.849> here

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
and there's a ton of amp heads in here

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.459 
and there's a ton of amp heads in here
so<00:03:13.150> there's<00:03:13.299> a<00:03:13.359> lot<00:03:13.569> of<00:03:13.750> stuff<00:03:14.049> to<00:03:14.230> play<00:03:14.349> with

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:14.469 
so there's a lot of stuff to play with

you can see we got a little sennheiser
421<00:05:11.190> let's<00:05:12.190> move<00:05:12.370> that<00:05:12.550> over<00:05:12.610> here<00:05:17.160> pronounced

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
421 let's move that over here pronounced

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:31.589 
421 let's move that over here pronounced
mid-range<00:05:18.610> of<00:05:18.910> the<00:05:19.210> 14

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:34.739 

we<00:05:32.259> get<00:05:32.409> a<00:05:32.439> little<00:05:32.679> c4<00:05:33.369> 14<00:05:33.999> action<00:05:34.330> here<00:05:34.479> who

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:34.749 
we get a little c4 14 action here who

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:58.330 
we get a little c4 14 action here who
knows<00:05:34.960> which<00:05:35.289> one

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340

and<00:05:59.340> then<00:05:59.430> even<00:05:59.670> a<00:05:59.790> a<00:06:00.030> u87<00:06:00.810> emulator

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.840 

so<00:06:14.020> each<00:06:14.140> bike<00:06:14.320> has<00:06:14.500> its<00:06:14.650> own<00:06:14.800> you<00:06:15.430> know<00:06:15.520> basic
