00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.040
 January 16, 2013 in Novosibirsk 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.530
 in the Siberian center of modern 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.980
 Art held an exhibition United 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.020
 the states of Siberia according to the organizers 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.240
 we quote the exhibition concept 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.070
 siberica is a funny look at geography 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.290
 in Siberia and the Urals people 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.180
 nationality is not particularly distinguished in 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.460

 values to Siberia is boundlessness 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.140
 fun and freedom but not Siberian 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.840
 nationality and after all consciousness and cheerfully 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.120
 vital activity judging by the pictures on 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.309
 exhibition consciousness of modern siberian 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.140
 artists above fun and 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.659
 freedom went wild in earnest 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.819
 because to call this art in 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:48.819
 quotes of the canvas do not turn the language 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.460
 and what does Siberia have to do with 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.460

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.090

 dispersal of Cossacks such exhibitions 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.110
 overclocking considering quite fair and 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.869
 correct because such dirt 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.590

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.920
 separatism and no political goals 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.530
 the exhibition does not pursue but the name itself 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.510
 united states of siberia and and flag symbol

 Sasha stylized as Siberian colors 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.129
 say the opposite is clearly visible 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.590
 political overtones are meant to 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:03:11.750
 to shape the image of a Siberian man 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:03:13.910
 without nationalities and roots like 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.760

 not the first time it forms a ridiculous and 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.030
 abusive have in Siberia and and 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.459
 peoples only confirming the well-established 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.010

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.120
 such exhibitions rooted a similar image 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.069

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.959

 generations which seeing such exhibitions in 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.079
 powerlessness gives up 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.620

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.510
 Siberian Sovereign Union does not impose 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.120
 no one’s point of view and if you don’t 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.310
 like national cultures 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.100

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.840
 principles that we promote within 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.359
