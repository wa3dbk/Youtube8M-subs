 It is 00 if we introduce this time 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.999
 Seeing from the side 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:23.519
 As you can see, the atmosphere is very heavy 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.179

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.200

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.640
 We say that we roll up in Kawaoka River 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.690
 Because it is a screen

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.380
 in this way 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.800
 Of course, the ease of use as a shoulder 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.370
