this<00:00:00.390> video<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:00.930> an<00:00:01.079> introduction<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.709> ionic

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
this video is an introduction to ionic

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.059 
this video is an introduction to ionic
bonds<00:00:02.790> and<00:00:02.909> ionic<00:00:03.300> bonding<00:00:03.980> don't<00:00:04.980> know

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
bonds and ionic bonding don't know

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.619 
bonds and ionic bonding don't know
anything<00:00:05.430> about<00:00:05.520> these<00:00:05.730> things<00:00:06.029> or<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.330> feel

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
anything about these things or you feel

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.960 
anything about these things or you feel
a<00:00:06.660> little<00:00:06.839> bit<00:00:06.990> rusty<00:00:07.470> it's<00:00:07.890> no<00:00:08.220> big<00:00:08.519> deal

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
a little bit rusty it's no big deal

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.009 
a little bit rusty it's no big deal
because<00:00:09.300> we're<00:00:09.480> going<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.660> start<00:00:09.870> from

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
because we're going to start from

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.600 
because we're going to start from
scratch<00:00:10.260> so<00:00:11.240> the<00:00:12.240> ionic<00:00:12.540> bonds<00:00:13.049> are<00:00:13.200> one<00:00:14.160> type

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
scratch so the ionic bonds are one type

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.230 
scratch so the ionic bonds are one type
of<00:00:14.910> chemical<00:00:15.809> bond<00:00:16.460> chemical<00:00:17.460> bonds<00:00:17.789> are<00:00:17.880> like

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
of chemical bond chemical bonds are like

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.640 
of chemical bond chemical bonds are like
glue<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.710> holds<00:00:20.609> atoms<00:00:21.210> together<00:00:21.570> okay<00:00:22.410> like

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
glue that holds atoms together okay like

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.679 
glue that holds atoms together okay like
here<00:00:23.010> two<00:00:23.279> atoms<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:23.850> are<00:00:23.970> bonded<00:00:24.060> together

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
here two atoms that are bonded together

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.609 
here two atoms that are bonded together
they're<00:00:25.050> connected<00:00:25.680> they're<00:00:26.070> glued<00:00:26.510> now

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
they're connected they're glued now

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.830 
they're connected they're glued now
ionic<00:00:28.619> bonds<00:00:29.039> are<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.789> type<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.179> chemical

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
ionic bonds are the type of chemical

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.410 
ionic bonds are the type of chemical
bond<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.679> hold<00:00:32.070> together<00:00:32.960> metal<00:00:33.960> atoms<00:00:34.380> with

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
bond that hold together metal atoms with

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.389 
bond that hold together metal atoms with
nonmetal<00:00:36.420> atoms<00:00:36.649> okay<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.710> if<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.100> look<00:00:38.129> at<00:00:38.340> a

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
nonmetal atoms okay so if you look at a

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.810 
nonmetal atoms okay so if you look at a
periodic<00:00:38.820> table<00:00:39.300> there's<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.410> big<00:00:41.219> thick

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
periodic table there's this big thick

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.610 
periodic table there's this big thick
staircase<00:00:42.540> over<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.170> side<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.500> this

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
staircase over on this side and this

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.209 
staircase over on this side and this
staircase

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
staircase

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.700 
staircase
separates<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.329> metals<00:00:45.809> which<00:00:46.200> are<00:00:46.289> all<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
separates the metals which are all the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.310 
separates the metals which are all the
elements<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.640> side<00:00:47.940> from<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.660> nonmetals

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
elements on this side from the nonmetals

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.799 
elements on this side from the nonmetals
which<00:00:49.530> are<00:00:49.739> mostly<00:00:50.280> elements<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.539> side

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
which are mostly elements on this side

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.040 
which are mostly elements on this side
so<00:00:52.500> whenever<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.760> chemical<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.840> has

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
so whenever we have a chemical that has

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.029 
so whenever we have a chemical that has
a<00:00:55.079> metal<00:00:55.730> connected<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.239> nonmetal<00:00:58.039> that's

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
a metal connected to a nonmetal that's

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.299 
a metal connected to a nonmetal that's
held<00:00:59.489> together<00:00:59.670> by<00:01:00.180> ionic<00:01:01.079> bonds<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.160> some

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
held together by ionic bonds so some

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.939 
held together by ionic bonds so some
examples<00:01:02.850> are<00:01:03.090> silver<00:01:03.960> chloride<00:01:04.229> magnesium

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
examples are silver chloride magnesium

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.090 
examples are silver chloride magnesium
iodide<00:01:05.790> or<00:01:06.119> aluminum<00:01:06.689> oxide<00:01:07.049> each<00:01:07.470> one<00:01:07.979> of

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
iodide or aluminum oxide each one of

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.910 
iodide or aluminum oxide each one of
these<00:01:08.189> chemicals<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.689> metal<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.650> one

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
these chemicals have a metal this one

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.350 
these chemicals have a metal this one
this<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.400> or<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.549> one<00:01:11.700> from<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.090> side<00:01:12.270> of

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
this one or this one from this side of

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.750 
this one or this one from this side of
the<00:01:12.420> periodic<00:01:12.840> table<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> nonmetal<00:01:14.070> this

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the periodic table with a nonmetal this

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.999 
the periodic table with a nonmetal this
one<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.540> or<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.780> one<00:01:15.840> from<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.950> side

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
one this one or this one from this side

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.880 
one this one or this one from this side
so<00:01:17.670> ionic<00:01:18.570> bonds<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.020> all<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.200> these<00:01:19.320> because

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
so ionic bonds and all of these because

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.490 
so ionic bonds and all of these because
there<00:01:20.070> are<00:01:20.189> metals<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.909> nonmetals<00:01:21.500> connected

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
there are metals and nonmetals connected

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.240 
there are metals and nonmetals connected
together<00:01:23.030> okay<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.720> now<00:01:25.560> we're<00:01:25.799> going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.009> talk

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
together okay so now we're going to talk

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.240 
together okay so now we're going to talk
a<00:01:26.460> little<00:01:26.729> bit<00:01:26.880> more<00:01:27.030> about<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.900> how<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.710> why

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
a little bit more about the how and why

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.399 
a little bit more about the how and why
that's<00:01:30.060> going<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> bonding<00:01:31.229> here

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
that's going on with a bonding here

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.620 
that's going on with a bonding here
right<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.159> how<00:01:32.759> do<00:01:32.820> these<00:01:33.060> atoms

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
right it's like how do these atoms

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.109 
right it's like how do these atoms
actually<00:01:34.290> connect<00:01:34.740> together<00:01:35.100> what's<00:01:35.670> holding

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
actually connect together what's holding

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.219 
actually connect together what's holding
them<00:01:36.210> that's<00:01:36.659> we're<00:01:36.840> going<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> talk<00:01:37.200> about

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
them that's we're going to talk about

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.410 
them that's we're going to talk about
next<00:01:37.590> okay<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.250> learn<00:01:38.490> more<00:01:38.729> about<00:01:38.790> ionic

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
next okay so to learn more about ionic

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.940 
next okay so to learn more about ionic
bonds<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.990> are<00:01:40.110> going<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.350> focus<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.740> a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
bonds we are going to focus on a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.880 
bonds we are going to focus on a
chemical<00:01:41.549> called<00:01:41.759> sodium<00:01:42.320> chloride<00:01:43.320> sodium

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
chemical called sodium chloride sodium

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.300 
chemical called sodium chloride sodium
chloride<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.909> fancy<00:01:45.689> scientific<00:01:46.140> name<00:01:46.710> for

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
chloride is a fancy scientific name for

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.249 
chloride is a fancy scientific name for
table<00:01:47.759> salt<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.509> stuff<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.049> put

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
table salt it's the stuff that you put

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.280 
table salt it's the stuff that you put
on<00:01:49.350> your<00:01:49.500> food<00:01:49.820> so<00:01:50.820> sodium<00:01:51.210> chloride<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.869> made

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
on your food so sodium chloride is made

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.630 
on your food so sodium chloride is made
of<00:01:52.500> two<00:01:52.920> types<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.939> atoms<00:01:54.240> we<00:01:54.869> got<00:01:55.049> sodium

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
of two types of atoms we got sodium

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.190 
of two types of atoms we got sodium
here's<00:01:56.640> its<00:01:56.909> symbol<00:01:57.509> from<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.780> periodic

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
here's its symbol from the periodic

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.130 
here's its symbol from the periodic
table<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.920> here<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.600> sodium<00:02:00.600> atom<00:02:00.840> right

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
chlorine or chloride I'll tell you what

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.359 
chlorine or chloride I'll tell you what
the<00:02:07.020> difference<00:02:07.290> between<00:02:07.469> those<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.129> in<00:02:08.310> a

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
the difference between those is in a

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.650 
the difference between those is in a
minute<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.970> don't<00:02:09.209> have<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.420> worry<00:02:09.599> about

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
minute but you don't have to worry about

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.219 
minute but you don't have to worry about
it<00:02:09.899> right<00:02:10.050> now

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
it right now

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.510 
it right now
and<00:02:10.700> here<00:02:11.700> is

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
and here is

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.080 
and here is
here's<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.180> chlorine<00:02:13.510> atom<00:02:13.780> now<00:02:15.090> sodium

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
here's a chlorine atom now sodium

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.300 
here's a chlorine atom now sodium
chloride<00:02:16.540> happens<00:02:17.110> when<00:02:17.350> these<00:02:17.650> two<00:02:17.980> atoms

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
chloride happens when these two atoms

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.340 
chloride happens when these two atoms
come<00:02:19.000> together<00:02:19.180> when<00:02:19.660> they're<00:02:19.870> glued

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
come together when they're glued

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.580 
come together when they're glued
together<00:02:20.650> by<00:02:21.100> ionic<00:02:21.790> bonds<00:02:22.330> but<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.260> atoms

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
together by ionic bonds but the atoms

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.830 
together by ionic bonds but the atoms
that<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:23.770> have<00:02:24.010> right<00:02:24.280> here<00:02:24.730> they're<00:02:25.360> not<00:02:25.390> glued

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
that I have right here they're not glued

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.180 
that I have right here they're not glued
together<00:02:26.020> they're<00:02:26.440> just<00:02:26.680> kicking<00:02:26.890> it<00:02:27.100> over

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
together they're just kicking it over

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.950 
together they're just kicking it over
here<00:02:27.430> they<00:02:27.520> have<00:02:27.670> nothing<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.390> do<00:02:28.660> with<00:02:28.840> each

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
here they have nothing to do with each

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.250 
here they have nothing to do with each
other<00:02:29.220> so<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.550> want<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.180> talk<00:02:31.390> about<00:02:31.720> what

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
other so I want to talk about what

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.480 
other so I want to talk about what
happens<00:02:32.740> to<00:02:33.460> get<00:02:33.670> these<00:02:33.850> separate<00:02:34.630> atoms

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
happens to get these separate atoms

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.760 
happens to get these separate atoms
connected<00:02:36.490> and<00:02:36.670> glued<00:02:37.480> together<00:02:37.720> like<00:02:38.560> these

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
connected and glued together like these

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.570 
connected and glued together like these
how<00:02:39.070> we<00:02:39.130> go<00:02:39.430> from<00:02:39.700> this<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.390> this<00:02:41.370> I'm<00:02:42.370> going<00:02:42.520> to

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
how we go from this to this I'm going to

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.800 
how we go from this to this I'm going to
tell<00:02:42.790> you<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.090> kicker<00:02:43.330> I'm<00:02:43.480> going<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.660> tell

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
tell you the kicker I'm going to tell

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.330 
tell you the kicker I'm going to tell
you<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.050> end<00:02:44.230> of<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.470> story<00:02:44.770> now<00:02:45.010> so<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:45.220> can

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
you the end of the story now so you can

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.760 
you the end of the story now so you can
follow<00:02:45.580> it<00:02:45.760> through<00:02:45.940> as<00:02:46.060> we<00:02:46.210> talk<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:47.170> reason

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
follow it through as we talk the reason

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.230 
follow it through as we talk the reason
why<00:02:48.040> these<00:02:48.820> two<00:02:49.110> atoms<00:02:50.110> are<00:02:50.260> connected<00:02:50.500> is

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
why these two atoms are connected is

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.930 
why these two atoms are connected is
because<00:02:52.240> they<00:02:52.510> end<00:02:52.780> up<00:02:53.200> getting<00:02:53.950> electrical

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
because they end up getting electrical

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.670 
because they end up getting electrical
charges<00:02:55.420> okay<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.900> atom<00:02:56.230> is<00:02:56.260> going<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.500> end

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
charges okay this atom is going to end

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.590 
charges okay this atom is going to end
up<00:02:56.830> getting<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.250> negative<00:02:57.520> charge<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.240> this

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
up getting a negative charge and this

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.030 
up getting a negative charge and this
atom<00:02:59.080> is<00:02:59.170> going<00:02:59.320> to<00:02:59.380> end<00:02:59.530> up<00:02:59.650> getting<00:02:59.980> a

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
atom is going to end up getting a

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.880 
atom is going to end up getting a
positive<00:03:00.550> charge<00:03:01.050> what<00:03:02.050> two<00:03:02.200> oppositely

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
positive charge what two oppositely

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.220 
positive charge what two oppositely
charged<00:03:03.370> things<00:03:03.700> like<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.150> do<00:03:04.330> they<00:03:04.840> like<00:03:04.870> to

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
charged things like to do they like to

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.470 
charged things like to do they like to
attract<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.860> so<00:03:06.370> because<00:03:06.730> these<00:03:06.910> things<00:03:07.210> get

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
attract and so because these things get

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.690 
attract and so because these things get
different<00:03:07.870> electrical<00:03:08.440> charges<00:03:08.890> they<00:03:09.550> are

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
different electrical charges they are

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.450 
different electrical charges they are
going<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:09.910> be<00:03:10.030> held<00:03:10.300> together<00:03:10.480> by<00:03:11.460> those

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
going to be held together by those

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.270 
going to be held together by those
different<00:03:13.210> charges<00:03:13.990> attracting<00:03:14.770> okay<00:03:15.220> so

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
different charges attracting okay so

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.980 
different charges attracting okay so
let's<00:03:15.640> look<00:03:15.910> at<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.120> steps<00:03:16.480> that<00:03:16.690> we<00:03:16.750> have<00:03:16.870> to

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
let's look at the steps that we have to

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.460 
let's look at the steps that we have to
take<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.350> go<00:03:17.470> from<00:03:17.800> this<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:19.300> this<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:20.110> first

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
take to go from this to this the first

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.740 
take to go from this to this the first
step<00:03:20.830> is<00:03:21.070> pretty<00:03:21.490> much<00:03:21.760> what<00:03:22.240> I<00:03:22.270> got<00:03:22.510> right

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
step is pretty much what I got right

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.870 
step is pretty much what I got right
here<00:03:22.810> we're<00:03:23.680> starting<00:03:24.100> with<00:03:24.220> two<00:03:24.490> separate

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
here we're starting with two separate

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.820 
here we're starting with two separate
atoms<00:03:25.240> that<00:03:25.510> aren't<00:03:25.870> connected<00:03:26.110> we<00:03:26.560> got<00:03:26.710> the

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
atoms that aren't connected we got the

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.590 
atoms that aren't connected we got the
metal<00:03:27.010> out<00:03:27.220> of<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.400> sodium<00:03:27.820> here<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.270> the

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
metal out of the sodium here and the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.070 
metal out of the sodium here and the
nonmetal<00:03:29.200> atom<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.710> chlorine<00:03:30.100> over<00:03:30.580> here<00:03:31.080> now

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
nonmetal atom the chlorine over here now

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.110 
nonmetal atom the chlorine over here now
the<00:03:32.170> first<00:03:32.470> thing<00:03:32.860> that<00:03:32.920> happens<00:03:33.550> on<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.910> road

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
the first thing that happens on the road

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.490 
the first thing that happens on the road
to<00:03:34.360> an<00:03:34.450> ionic<00:03:34.840> bond<00:03:35.080> is<00:03:35.520> that<00:03:36.520> the<00:03:36.700> sodium<00:03:37.300> atom

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
to an ionic bond is that the sodium atom

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.770 
to an ionic bond is that the sodium atom
gives<00:03:38.500> one<00:03:39.130> of<00:03:39.250> its<00:03:39.370> electrons<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.300> the

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
gives one of its electrons to the

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.020 
gives one of its electrons to the
chlorine<00:03:41.230> atom<00:03:41.500> here's<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.220> electron<00:03:42.700> moving

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
chlorine atom here's the electron moving

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.850 
chlorine atom here's the electron moving
between<00:03:43.300> the<00:03:43.660> two<00:03:43.780> of<00:03:43.930> them<00:03:44.050> from<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.440> sodium

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
between the two of them from the sodium

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.570 
between the two of them from the sodium
to<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.430> chlorine<00:03:46.410> now<00:03:47.410> this<00:03:47.740> electron<00:03:48.040> this

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
to the chlorine now this electron this

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.960 
to the chlorine now this electron this
electron<00:03:48.760> moving<00:03:49.570> will<00:03:50.500> change<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.370> charges

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
electron moving will change the charges

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.110 
electron moving will change the charges
of<00:03:52.180> these<00:03:52.720> two<00:03:53.110> atoms<00:03:53.590> okay<00:03:54.160> that's<00:03:54.880> what

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
of these two atoms okay that's what

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.210 
of these two atoms okay that's what
happens<00:03:55.510> in<00:03:55.630> next<00:03:55.990> step<00:03:56.820> sodium<00:03:57.820> gives<00:03:58.720> away

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
happens in next step sodium gives away

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.620 
happens in next step sodium gives away
one<00:04:00.220> of<00:04:00.250> its<00:04:00.490> electrons<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.240> chlorine<00:04:01.450> so

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
one of its electrons to the chlorine so

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.290 
one of its electrons to the chlorine so
it<00:04:01.750> loses<00:04:02.140> one<00:04:02.950> electron<00:04:02.980> it<00:04:03.550> has<00:04:03.700> one<00:04:03.970> fewer

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
it loses one electron it has one fewer

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.660 
it loses one electron it has one fewer
electron<00:04:04.960> and<00:04:05.170> that's<00:04:05.890> going<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:06.190> give<00:04:06.370> it<00:04:06.400> a

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
electron and that's going to give it a

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.670 
electron and that's going to give it a
positive<00:04:07.150> charge<00:04:07.690> because<00:04:08.110> it<00:04:08.200> lost<00:04:08.470> an

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
positive charge because it lost an

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.080 
positive charge because it lost an
electron<00:04:09.150> but<00:04:10.150> chlorine<00:04:10.980> gained<00:04:11.980> one<00:04:12.880> of<00:04:13.000> the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
electron but chlorine gained one of the

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.560 
electron but chlorine gained one of the
electrons<00:04:13.630> from<00:04:13.720> sodium<00:04:14.290> so<00:04:14.890> it's<00:04:15.310> going<00:04:15.940> to

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
electrons from sodium so it's going to

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.570 
electrons from sodium so it's going to
become<00:04:17.040> negative<00:04:18.040> it's<00:04:18.250> going<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.430> get<00:04:18.520> a

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
become negative it's going to get a

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.130 
become negative it's going to get a
negative<00:04:19.030> charge<00:04:19.210> because<00:04:19.450> of<00:04:19.600> that<00:04:19.720> extra

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
negative charge because of that extra

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.270 
negative charge because of that extra
electron<00:04:20.580> so<00:04:21.580> now<00:04:21.900> these<00:04:22.900> two<00:04:22.960> atoms

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
electron so now these two atoms

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.510 
electron so now these two atoms
take<00:04:24.610> on<00:04:24.850> electrical<00:04:25.780> charges<00:04:26.320> and<00:04:26.530> what<00:04:27.430> do

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
take on electrical charges and what do

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.060 
take on electrical charges and what do
we<00:04:27.580> call<00:04:27.690> atoms<00:04:28.690> that<00:04:29.080> have<00:04:29.290> charges

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
we call atoms that have charges

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.830 
we call atoms that have charges
we<00:04:30.610> call<00:04:30.940> them<00:04:31.260> ions<00:04:32.940> this<00:04:33.940> one's<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.300> positive

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
we call them ions this one's a positive

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.440 
we call them ions this one's a positive
ion<00:04:35.020> sodium<00:04:35.860> becomes<00:04:35.950> positive<00:04:36.640> chlorine

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
ion sodium becomes positive chlorine

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.030 
ion sodium becomes positive chlorine
becomes<00:04:37.630> negative<00:04:38.200> now<00:04:38.290> here's<00:04:38.710> where<00:04:38.890> the

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
becomes negative now here's where the

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.650 
becomes negative now here's where the
difference<00:04:39.280> between<00:04:39.370> chlorine<00:04:40.030> and<00:04:40.180> chloride

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
difference between chlorine and chloride

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.790 
difference between chlorine and chloride
comes<00:04:41.610> chlorine<00:04:42.610> is<00:04:42.880> what<00:04:43.660> we<00:04:43.810> call<00:04:44.200> the

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
comes chlorine is what we call the

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.730 
comes chlorine is what we call the
chlorine<00:04:45.370> atom<00:04:45.820> when<00:04:46.210> it's<00:04:46.360> neutral<00:04:46.990> so<00:04:47.500> up

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
chlorine atom when it's neutral so up

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.580 
chlorine atom when it's neutral so up
here<00:04:48.250> this<00:04:48.910> nonmetal<00:04:49.750> atom<00:04:50.020> chlorine<00:04:50.230> just

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
here this nonmetal atom chlorine just

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.450 
here this nonmetal atom chlorine just
hanging<00:04:50.860> out<00:04:50.980> here<00:04:51.190> is<00:04:51.340> chlorine<00:04:51.870> zero<00:04:52.870> charge

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
hanging out here is chlorine zero charge

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.300 
hanging out here is chlorine zero charge
but<00:04:54.460> down<00:04:54.670> here<00:04:54.700> after<00:04:55.360> it's<00:04:56.080> received<00:04:56.620> one<00:04:57.280> of

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
but down here after it's received one of

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.550 
but down here after it's received one of
the<00:04:57.580> electrons<00:04:58.180> from<00:04:58.480> sodium<00:04:58.870> it<00:04:59.110> gets<00:04:59.410> a

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
the electrons from sodium it gets a

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.260 
the electrons from sodium it gets a
negative<00:04:59.860> charge<00:05:00.280> it<00:05:00.520> becomes<00:05:00.790> a<00:05:00.940> negative

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
negative charge it becomes a negative

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.290 
negative charge it becomes a negative
ion<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.260> now<00:05:03.100> we<00:05:03.160> change<00:05:03.610> its<00:05:03.790> name<00:05:04.000> just<00:05:04.210> a

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
ion and now we change its name just a

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.800 
ion and now we change its name just a
little<00:05:04.510> bit

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
little bit

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.430 
little bit
we<00:05:05.170> call<00:05:05.500> it<00:05:05.940> chloride<00:05:06.940> so<00:05:07.870> it's<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.140> same

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
we call it chloride so it's the same

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.410 
we call it chloride so it's the same
atom<00:05:09.010> chlorine<00:05:09.670> and<00:05:09.820> chloride<00:05:10.060> they're<00:05:10.300> the

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
atom chlorine and chloride they're the

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.540 
atom chlorine and chloride they're the
same<00:05:10.630> atom<00:05:11.080> it's<00:05:11.200> just<00:05:11.500> chlorine<00:05:12.100> is<00:05:12.400> the

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
same atom it's just chlorine is the

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.130 
same atom it's just chlorine is the
version<00:05:12.700> of<00:05:12.910> chlorine<00:05:13.360> with<00:05:13.660> a<00:05:13.690> neutral

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
version of chlorine with a neutral

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.770 
version of chlorine with a neutral
charge<00:05:14.410> zero<00:05:14.890> charge<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:15.370> chloride<00:05:16.360> is<00:05:16.720> the

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
charge zero charge and chloride is the

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.810 
charge zero charge and chloride is the
version<00:05:17.080> of<00:05:17.290> chlorine<00:05:17.740> that<00:05:18.100> just<00:05:18.340> has<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:18.490> 1

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
version of chlorine that just has a 1

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.700 
version of chlorine that just has a 1
minus<00:05:19.240> charge<00:05:19.510> and<00:05:19.660> it<00:05:19.720> got<00:05:19.960> that<00:05:20.169> 1<00:05:20.380> minus

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
minus charge and it got that 1 minus

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.100 
minus charge and it got that 1 minus
charge<00:05:20.980> because<00:05:21.550> sodium<00:05:22.000> gave<00:05:22.300> one<00:05:22.690> of<00:05:22.720> its

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
charge because sodium gave one of its

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.040 
charge because sodium gave one of its
electrons<00:05:23.320> to<00:05:23.980> chlorine<00:05:24.750> turning<00:05:25.750> it<00:05:25.840> into

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
electrons to chlorine turning it into

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.159 
electrons to chlorine turning it into
the<00:05:26.320> negative<00:05:26.830> chloride<00:05:27.490> now<00:05:27.940> people<00:05:28.840> often

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
the negative chloride now people often

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.850 
the negative chloride now people often
ask<00:05:29.320> why<00:05:29.680> does<00:05:30.160> sodium<00:05:31.060> give<00:05:31.900> its<00:05:32.169> electron<00:05:32.740> to

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
ask why does sodium give its electron to

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.670 
ask why does sodium give its electron to
chlorine<00:05:33.360> we'll<00:05:34.360> talk<00:05:34.660> about<00:05:34.870> that<00:05:35.290> in<00:05:35.500> the

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
chlorine we'll talk about that in the

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.280 
chlorine we'll talk about that in the
next<00:05:35.890> video<00:05:36.220> it's<00:05:36.640> a<00:05:36.730> great<00:05:37.120> question<00:05:37.660> but

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
next video it's a great question but

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.010 
next video it's a great question but
anyway<00:05:38.740> a<00:05:38.940> transfer<00:05:39.940> of<00:05:40.090> electrons<00:05:40.600> takes

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
anyway a transfer of electrons takes

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.680 
anyway a transfer of electrons takes
place<00:05:41.410> between<00:05:41.800> these<00:05:41.950> atoms<00:05:42.240> giving<00:05:43.240> this

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
place between these atoms giving this

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.300 
place between these atoms giving this
one<00:05:43.870> a<00:05:43.930> positive<00:05:44.380> charge<00:05:44.560> and<00:05:44.830> this<00:05:45.070> one<00:05:45.280> a

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
one a positive charge and this one a

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.370 
one a positive charge and this one a
negative<00:05:45.700> charge<00:05:45.850> and<00:05:46.120> what<00:05:46.750> the<00:05:46.930> opposite

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
negative charge and what the opposite

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.980 
negative charge and what the opposite
charge<00:05:47.620> is<00:05:47.770> like<00:05:47.950> to<00:05:48.100> do<00:05:48.250> they<00:05:49.060> like<00:05:49.090> to<00:05:49.540> stick

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
charge is like to do they like to stick

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.560 
charge is like to do they like to stick
together<00:05:50.590> and<00:05:51.040> so<00:05:51.490> this<00:05:51.729> is<00:05:51.910> what<00:05:52.060> we<00:05:52.210> end<00:05:52.419> up

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
together and so this is what we end up

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.750 
together and so this is what we end up
with<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:53.260> two<00:05:53.560> atoms<00:05:54.040> glued<00:05:54.490> together

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
with the two atoms glued together

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.090 
with the two atoms glued together
because<00:05:55.720> they're<00:05:55.900> opposite<00:05:56.410> charges<00:05:56.800> are

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
because they're opposite charges are

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.490 
because they're opposite charges are
holding<00:05:57.729> them<00:05:57.880> together<00:05:58.090> ok<00:05:58.990> so<00:05:59.229> there<00:05:59.380> are

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
holding them together ok so there are

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.219 
holding them together ok so there are
really<00:05:59.650> three<00:06:00.160> important<00:06:00.669> steps<00:06:01.000> in<00:06:01.240> ionic

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
really three important steps in ionic

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.530 
really three important steps in ionic
bond<00:06:02.470> forming<00:06:03.070> for<00:06:03.580> the<00:06:03.669> example<00:06:04.180> of<00:06:04.300> sodium

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
bond forming for the example of sodium

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.780 
bond forming for the example of sodium
chloride<00:06:04.870> here's<00:06:05.380> what<00:06:05.500> they<00:06:05.590> are<00:06:05.620> the<00:06:06.430> first

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 
chloride here's what they are the first

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.920 
chloride here's what they are the first
step<00:06:07.330> is<00:06:07.570> an<00:06:08.320> electron<00:06:09.660> transfers<00:06:10.660> from

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
step is an electron transfers from

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.409 
step is an electron transfers from
sodium<00:06:11.470> to<00:06:11.560> chlorine<00:06:11.770> sodium<00:06:12.610> gives<00:06:12.970> one<00:06:13.300> of

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
sodium to chlorine sodium gives one of

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.620 
sodium to chlorine sodium gives one of
its<00:06:13.540> electrons<00:06:14.020> to<00:06:14.140> chlorine<00:06:14.700> sodium<00:06:15.700> loses

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
its electrons to chlorine sodium loses

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.040 
its electrons to chlorine sodium loses
an<00:06:17.080> electron<00:06:17.169> so<00:06:18.160> that<00:06:18.340> gives<00:06:18.729> it<00:06:18.940> a<00:06:19.060> positive

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
an electron so that gives it a positive

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.280 
an electron so that gives it a positive
charge<00:06:20.320> this<00:06:20.650> becomes<00:06:21.010> positive<00:06:21.610> and

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
charge this becomes positive and

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.230 
charge this becomes positive and
chlorine<00:06:23.290> because<00:06:23.740> it<00:06:23.860> has<00:06:24.100> gotten<00:06:24.760> an<00:06:25.090> extra

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
chlorine because it has gotten an extra

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.750 
chlorine because it has gotten an extra
electron<00:06:25.479> gets<00:06:25.930> a<00:06:26.110> negative<00:06:26.470> charge<00:06:26.680> and<00:06:27.070> they

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
electron gets a negative charge and they

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.330 
electron gets a negative charge and they
both<00:06:28.090> turn<00:06:28.660> in<00:06:28.930> two<00:06:29.169> ions<00:06:29.620> atoms<00:06:29.919> with<00:06:30.280> a

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
both turn in two ions atoms with a

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.610 
both turn in two ions atoms with a
charge<00:06:30.610> and<00:06:30.820> since<00:06:31.360> chlorine<00:06:31.960> became

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
charge and since chlorine became

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.089 
charge and since chlorine became
negative<00:06:32.830> we<00:06:33.400> call<00:06:34.150> it<00:06:34.300> chloride<00:06:34.900> and<00:06:35.289> then

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:36.099 
negative we call it chloride and then

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:38.350 
negative we call it chloride and then
the<00:06:36.340> last<00:06:36.640> step<00:06:37.030> after<00:06:37.330> the<00:06:37.630> ions

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
the last step after the ions

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.439 
the last step after the ions
is<00:06:38.569> that<00:06:39.259> the<00:06:39.379> oppositely<00:06:40.129> charged<00:06:40.909> atoms<00:06:41.330> the

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
is that the oppositely charged atoms the

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:43.990 
is that the oppositely charged atoms the
oppositely<00:06:41.960> charged<00:06:42.439> atoms<00:06:42.860> stick<00:06:43.789> together

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
oppositely charged atoms stick together

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.770 
oppositely charged atoms stick together
because<00:06:44.930> of<00:06:45.650> their<00:06:46.430> opposite<00:06:47.000> charges<00:06:47.330> so

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
because of their opposite charges so

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.050 
because of their opposite charges so
it's<00:06:47.930> those<00:06:48.080> opposite<00:06:48.710> charges<00:06:49.099> that<00:06:49.610> form

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
it's those opposite charges that form

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.709 
it's those opposite charges that form
that<00:06:50.960> are<00:06:51.199> the<00:06:51.319> glue<00:06:51.849> holding<00:06:52.849> the<00:06:53.270> atoms

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:53.719 
that are the glue holding the atoms

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:56.640 
that are the glue holding the atoms
together<00:06:54.159> okay<00:06:55.159> so<00:06:55.370> this<00:06:55.939> is<00:06:56.120> just<00:06:56.270> the<00:06:56.479> very

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
together okay so this is just the very

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.290 
together okay so this is just the very
basics<00:06:57.650> of<00:06:57.770> how<00:06:57.919> ionic<00:06:58.669> bonds<00:06:58.879> form<00:06:59.150> we

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
basics of how ionic bonds form we

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.570 
basics of how ionic bonds form we
haven't<00:06:59.599> really<00:06:59.689> talked<00:06:59.960> about<00:07:00.080> details<00:07:00.710> why

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580 
haven't really talked about details why

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.879 
haven't really talked about details why
the<00:07:01.639> electrons<00:07:02.449> move<00:07:02.780> and<00:07:03.139> that<00:07:03.560> kind<00:07:03.830> of

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:03.889 
the electrons move and that kind of

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:05.529 
the electrons move and that kind of
thing<00:07:04.069> that's<00:07:04.639> what<00:07:04.849> we're<00:07:04.969> going<00:07:05.090> to<00:07:05.150> do<00:07:05.330> in

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:05.539 
thing that's what we're going to do in

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:06.490 
thing that's what we're going to do in
the<00:07:05.659> next<00:07:05.840> video

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.500 
the next video

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.320 
the next video
so<00:07:06.740> to<00:07:07.189> go<00:07:07.340> a<00:07:07.370> little<00:07:07.580> bit<00:07:07.789> more<00:07:08.000> in-depth

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
so to go a little bit more in-depth

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.390 
so to go a little bit more in-depth
check<00:07:08.990> that<00:07:09.199> out<00:07:09.319> but<00:07:09.530> before<00:07:09.889> you<00:07:10.009> do<00:07:10.219> just

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
check that out but before you do just

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.459 
check that out but before you do just
make<00:07:10.969> sure<00:07:11.180> that<00:07:11.389> you<00:07:11.509> understand<00:07:12.229> these

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:12.469 
make sure that you understand these

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:15.430 
make sure that you understand these
steps<00:07:13.009> these<00:07:13.280> basic<00:07:13.909> steps<00:07:14.240> of<00:07:14.419> how<00:07:14.870> ionic

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 
steps these basic steps of how ionic

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.379 
steps these basic steps of how ionic
bonds<00:07:15.800> form<00:07:16.069> and<00:07:16.250> then<00:07:16.699> once<00:07:17.000> you're<00:07:17.210> good

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:17.389 
bonds form and then once you're good

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:20.919 
bonds form and then once you're good
with<00:07:17.569> this<00:07:17.719> we'll<00:07:18.349> go<00:07:18.500> from<00:07:18.680> there
