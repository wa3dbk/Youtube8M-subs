00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
through the silver sandwich again we

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.520 
through the silver sandwich again we
need<00:00:36.309> to<00:00:36.519> prepare<00:00:36.670> for<00:00:36.879> so<00:00:37.809> now<00:00:38.019> that<00:00:38.050> we're

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
need to prepare for so now that we're

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.840 
need to prepare for so now that we're
looking<00:00:38.769> at<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:38.920> wind<00:00:39.100> tunnel<00:00:39.400> day<00:00:39.519> two<00:00:39.580> and

looking at the wind tunnel day two and
trying<00:00:40.030> to<00:00:40.120> work<00:00:40.239> out<00:00:40.420> the<00:00:40.480> best<00:00:40.660> way<00:00:40.870> to<00:00:40.930> set

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
trying to work out the best way to set

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.470 
trying to work out the best way to set
the<00:00:41.320> car<00:00:41.530> up<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:42.580> new<00:00:42.730> parts<00:00:43.090> that<00:00:43.210> we've<00:00:43.330> got

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
the car up the new parts that we've got

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.329 
the car up the new parts that we've got
this<00:00:43.629> coming<00:00:44.350> through<00:00:44.580> well<00:00:45.580> normally<00:00:45.730> you<00:00:46.269> do

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
this coming through well normally you do

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.560 
this coming through well normally you do
fitness<00:00:48.339> training<00:00:48.730> you<00:00:48.940> know<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:51.010> every<00:00:51.340> day

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
fitness training you know like every day

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.600 
fitness training you know like every day
just<00:00:52.570> shoot<00:00:52.719> to<00:00:53.079> keep<00:00:53.290> feet<00:00:54.129> you<00:00:54.489> know

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
just shoot to keep feet you know

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.060 
just shoot to keep feet you know
yourself<00:00:55.090> from<00:00:55.989> one<00:00:56.200> race<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.649> other<00:00:56.860> one

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
yourself from one race to the other one

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.819 
yourself from one race to the other one
so<00:00:57.370> now<00:00:57.550> we<00:00:57.940> cannot<00:00:58.180> test<00:00:58.450> in<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:59.260> in<00:00:59.530> the<00:00:59.590> race

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
so now we cannot test in the in the race

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.220 
so now we cannot test in the in the race
track<00:01:00.039> so<00:01:00.430> is<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:01.180> way<00:01:01.360> you<00:01:01.420> you<00:01:01.899> prepare

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
track so is the way you you prepare

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.730 
track so is the way you you prepare
yourself<00:01:03.089> training<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:05.130> and<00:01:06.130> also<00:01:06.490> I<00:01:06.660> also

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
yourself training and and also I also

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.609 
yourself training and and also I also
came<00:01:08.740> to<00:01:08.800> to<00:01:09.640> marinello<00:01:10.330> to<00:01:10.690> spend<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.170> few<00:01:11.410> days

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
came to to marinello to spend a few days

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.900 
came to to marinello to spend a few days
i<00:01:11.979> work<00:01:12.580> in<00:01:12.789> the<00:01:12.940> simulator<00:01:13.619> meetings

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
i work in the simulator meetings

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.850 
i work in the simulator meetings
training<00:01:15.910> as<00:01:16.000> well<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:18.430> was<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.830> how<00:01:20.830> I

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
training as well so this was the how I

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.309 
training as well so this was the how I
prepare<00:01:21.759> myself<00:01:22.149> from<00:01:22.599> one<00:01:22.750> ratio<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.200> other

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319 
prepare myself from one ratio the other

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:26.400 
prepare myself from one ratio the other
one<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:24.509> what<00:01:25.509> I<00:01:25.539> mean<00:01:25.750> I<00:01:25.840> think<00:01:25.869> everything

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
one and what I mean I think everything

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.139 
one and what I mean I think everything
is<00:01:26.530> in<00:01:26.679> the<00:01:26.830> is<00:01:27.099> in<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.369> right<00:01:27.520> direction<00:01:27.670> to

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
is in the is in the right direction to

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.490 
is in the is in the right direction to
be<00:01:28.380> under<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.410> same<00:01:30.720> prepare<00:01:31.720> for<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.110> for

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
be under the same prepare for the for

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.649 
be under the same prepare for the for
the<00:01:32.530> racing<00:01:32.890> service

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
the racing service

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.179 
the racing service
um<00:01:35.259> well<00:01:35.740> I<00:01:35.770> think<00:01:35.979> yeah<00:01:36.850> Monaco<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:38.189> Montreal

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
um well I think yeah Monaco and Montreal

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.130 
um well I think yeah Monaco and Montreal
wha<00:01:39.340> you<00:01:39.850> know<00:01:39.909> quite<00:01:40.179> different<00:01:40.749> from<00:01:40.929> normal

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
wha you know quite different from normal

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.120 
wha you know quite different from normal
circuits<00:01:41.710> or<00:01:41.829> C<00:01:41.979> Monaco<00:01:42.399> is<00:01:42.640> is<00:01:43.030> Monaco

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
circuits or C Monaco is is Monaco

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.260 
circuits or C Monaco is is Monaco
Montreal<00:01:45.130> I<00:01:45.219> suppose<00:01:45.429> if<00:01:45.609> anything<00:01:45.969> is<00:01:46.090> more

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
Montreal I suppose if anything is more

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.809 
Montreal I suppose if anything is more
like<00:01:46.450> Bahrain<00:01:47.020> type<00:01:47.409> sakata<00:01:47.920> bias<00:01:48.520> or<00:01:48.759> the

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
like Bahrain type sakata bias or the

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.330 
like Bahrain type sakata bias or the
track<00:01:49.030> is<00:01:49.179> more<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.509> all<00:01:49.600> abstraction<00:01:50.340> you

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
track is more to all abstraction you

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.520 
track is more to all abstraction you
know<00:01:51.429> Silverstone<00:01:52.090> is<00:01:52.359> then<00:01:52.810> moving<00:01:53.049> back<00:01:53.380> to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
know Silverstone is then moving back to

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.199 
know Silverstone is then moving back to
the<00:01:53.619> more<00:01:53.770> high-speed<00:01:54.009> corner<00:01:54.670> circuit<00:01:55.119> you

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
the more high-speed corner circuit you

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:56.849 
the more high-speed corner circuit you
know<00:01:55.270> flowing<00:01:55.840> locks<00:01:56.079> a<00:01:56.170> nice<00:01:56.289> be<00:01:56.530> flowing

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
know flowing locks a nice be flowing

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.039 
know flowing locks a nice be flowing
corners<00:01:57.250> so<00:01:57.849> you<00:01:58.119> know<00:01:58.209> in<00:01:58.479> terms<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:58.959> a

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
corners so you know in terms of a

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.990 
corners so you know in terms of a
circuit<00:01:59.439> that's<00:01:59.619> closer<00:01:59.920> to<00:02:00.069> barcelona<00:02:00.849> i

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
circuit that's closer to barcelona i

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.039 
circuit that's closer to barcelona i
guess<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:01.509> from<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.259> last<00:02:02.409> two<00:02:02.619> races<00:02:04.049> well

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
guess and from the last two races well

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.350 
guess and from the last two races well
right<00:02:05.229> I<00:02:05.500> believe<00:02:06.459> we<00:02:06.579> can<00:02:06.609> have<00:02:06.909> a<00:02:06.939> good<00:02:07.119> car

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
right I believe we can have a good car

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.539 
right I believe we can have a good car
in<00:02:07.479> Silverstone<00:02:08.019> normally<00:02:08.470> we<00:02:09.099> had<00:02:09.280> a<00:02:09.310> good

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
in Silverstone normally we had a good

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.430 
in Silverstone normally we had a good
car<00:02:09.759> in<00:02:10.410> China<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.310> good<00:02:12.489> kind<00:02:12.700> Barcelona

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
car in China that a good kind Barcelona

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.660 
car in China that a good kind Barcelona
Silverstone<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.560> attract<00:02:14.950> more<00:02:15.250> allies<00:02:15.459> in

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
Silverstone is attract more allies in

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.009 
Silverstone is attract more allies in
this<00:02:15.790> direction<00:02:16.530> like<00:02:17.530> old<00:02:18.459> style<00:02:18.970> track<00:02:19.360> high

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
this direction like old style track high

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.600 
this direction like old style track high
speed<00:02:20.319> corners<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.959> think<00:02:23.200> our<00:02:23.920> car<00:02:24.250> can<00:02:24.430> be
