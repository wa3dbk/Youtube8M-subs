okay<00:02:00.100> let's<00:02:00.970> attach<00:02:01.330> camera<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.080> lens<00:02:02.289> but

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
okay let's attach camera to the lens but

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.290 
okay let's attach camera to the lens but
before<00:02:03.369> that<00:02:03.550> one<00:02:04.119> tip<00:02:04.420> for<00:02:04.660> you<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:07.090> make

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
before that one tip for you to make

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.040 
before that one tip for you to make
cleaning<00:02:07.810> more<00:02:08.019> easier<00:02:08.500> milto<00:02:09.340> lens<00:02:09.610> can<00:02:09.910> be

cleaning more easier milto lens can be

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.380 
cleaning more easier milto lens can be
disassembled<00:02:11.190> before<00:02:12.190> using<00:02:12.550> make<00:02:12.790> sure<00:02:13.090> that

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
disassembled before using make sure that

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.590 
disassembled before using make sure that
all<00:02:13.750> parts<00:02:14.260> are<00:02:14.430> joined<00:02:15.430> tightly<00:02:15.850> together

all parts are joined tightly together

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.170 
all parts are joined tightly together
check<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.380> hood<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:18.310> must<00:02:18.610> be<00:02:18.790> attached

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
check the hood it must be attached

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.729 
check the hood it must be attached
tightly<00:02:19.720> as<00:02:19.900> well<00:02:21.209> okay<00:02:22.209> we<00:02:22.810> mounted<00:02:23.260> Lance's

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
tightly as well okay we mounted Lance's

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.580 
tightly as well okay we mounted Lance's
and<00:02:24.190> camera<00:02:24.700> on<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.940> tripod<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.690> now<00:02:26.260> we<00:02:26.320> are

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
and camera on the tripod and now we are

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:35.510 
and camera on the tripod and now we are
ready<00:02:26.769> for<00:02:26.980> shooting<00:02:27.160> let's<00:02:27.940> go
