00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.360
 Exactly this the emulator we rent 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.770

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.450

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.460
 games and are the ones that we want here are 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.340
 almost the same the two games ok good 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.250
 cancel good now since we have 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.850

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.810
 desk 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.670
 in this 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.110
 we will appear an installer the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.440
 I really do not remember if 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.410
 I do not remember if they see a setup I think 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.660
 that is being installed here as they can 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.230
 here something like this does not come out 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.270
 windows pro which is the emulator of the 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.650
 micro of this ok here is a version 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.479
 new available but I'm not going to 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.860
 download for now we will leave something 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.140
 more or less like that or if already updated 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.960
 I do not know if the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.900
 the ok interface we're going to click here to 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.790
 windows pro open and well let's go to 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.520
 desk or where we saved the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.280
 game for example I'm going to open pokemon 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.100
 blogger code 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.650
 Here I hope you do not work so much 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.340

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.140

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.430
 is going to work for us or that we continue to go to 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.600
 others 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.369
 you are going to put the black screen 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.490
 so to solve this situation 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.409
 let's go to other codes and here I already 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.390

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.560
 let's give to have let's give and here 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.080
 we are going to paste this code that is 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.940
 walking depends on the game they go to 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.560

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.160
