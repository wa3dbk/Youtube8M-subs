not really random because they all came
out<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.310> single<00:02:23.610> scale<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:25.170> next<00:02:25.470> thing

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
out of a single scale the next thing

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.839 
out of a single scale the next thing
we're<00:02:25.769> going<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.920> do<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.459> we're<00:02:26.670> going<00:02:26.700> to

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.089 
we're going to do is we're going to
group<00:02:27.180> these<00:02:27.510> notes<00:02:27.870> according<00:02:28.349> to<00:02:28.769> cord

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
group these notes according to cord

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:35.750 
group these notes according to cord
families<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:30.660> she<00:02:30.750> started<00:02:31.410> out<00:02:31.650> with<00:02:32.280> AC<00:02:34.760> and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
families so she started out with AC and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.059 
families so she started out with AC and
that's<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.480> great<00:02:36.810> way<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:37.170> start<00:02:37.590> out<00:02:37.739> because

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
that's a great way to start out because

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.690 
that's a great way to start out because
that<00:02:38.370> right<00:02:38.670> there<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.680> an<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.829> minor<00:02:41.160> chord<00:02:41.280> so

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
that right there is an a minor chord so

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.819 
that right there is an a minor chord so
we're<00:02:42.000> really<00:02:42.209> going<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.540> establish<00:02:43.170> that

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
we're really going to establish that

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.620 
we're really going to establish that
this<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.190> going<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.519> be<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.700> song<00:02:45.060> in<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.599> a

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
this is going to be a song in the a

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.750 
this is going to be a song in the a
minor<00:02:46.140> key<00:02:46.530> with<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:46.920> first<00:02:47.190> chord<00:02:47.489> that'll

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
minor key with that first chord that'll

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.750 
minor key with that first chord that'll
be<00:02:47.880> great<00:02:49.549> ok

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.309 

CF<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:54.150> B<00:02:55.880> that's<00:02:56.880> another<00:02:57.360> good<00:02:57.630> phrase<00:02:57.959> what

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
CF a B that's another good phrase what

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.979 
CF a B that's another good phrase what
chord<00:02:58.799> could<00:02:59.190> we<00:02:59.310> put<00:02:59.640> with<00:02:59.910> GF<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.750> B<00:03:00.810> let's

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
chord could we put with GF a B let's

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.509 
chord could we put with GF a B let's
play<00:03:01.440> around<00:03:01.680> with<00:03:01.920> some<00:03:02.160> different

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
play around with some different

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.319 
play around with some different
possibilities<00:03:03.329> here<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.890> has<00:03:05.190> an<00:03:05.400> F<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.940> an<00:03:06.060> A

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
possibilities here it has an F and an A

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:12.590 
possibilities here it has an F and an A
so<00:03:06.870> we<00:03:07.049> could<00:03:07.260> use<00:03:07.470> an<00:03:07.680> F<00:03:07.860> chord

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.000 

how<00:03:13.600> would<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.810> sound<00:03:14.290> if<00:03:14.530> we<00:03:14.590> start<00:03:14.950> with

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
how would that sound if we start with

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.890 
how would that sound if we start with
aim<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.780> then

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.100 

or<00:03:20.900> we<00:03:21.080> can<00:03:21.290> put<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:21.560> with<00:03:21.680> it<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:22.099> minor<00:03:22.550> G<00:03:23.180> that

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
or we can put it with it a minor G that

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.490 
or we can put it with it a minor G that
D<00:03:24.379> minor<00:03:24.680> has<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:25.550> FME<00:03:26.319> 259<00:03:28.900> let's<00:03:29.900> put<00:03:30.290> both

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
D minor has that FME 259 let's put both

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.350 
D minor has that FME 259 let's put both
of<00:03:30.560> those<00:03:30.860> possibilities<00:03:31.459> this<00:03:31.910> could<00:03:32.120> be<00:03:32.269> an

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
of those possibilities this could be an

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.509 
of those possibilities this could be an
F<00:03:32.569> chord<00:03:32.959> or<00:03:33.290> D<00:03:33.530> minor<00:03:33.800> cool<00:03:35.590> okay<00:03:36.590> next<00:03:37.250> we

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
F chord or D minor cool okay next we

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:44.860 
F chord or D minor cool okay next we
have<00:03:41.830> that<00:03:42.830> F<00:03:43.099> D<00:03:43.430> that<00:03:43.910> could<00:03:44.150> be<00:03:44.299> a<00:03:44.330> D<00:03:44.569> minor

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
have that F D that could be a D minor

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.410 
have that F D that could be a D minor
chord<00:03:45.019> too<00:03:48.340> so<00:03:49.340> let's<00:03:49.519> put<00:03:49.760> that<00:03:49.790> with<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.269> D

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
chord too so let's put that with the D

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.569 
chord too so let's put that with the D
minor<00:03:50.720> chord<00:03:50.900> here<00:03:51.410> let's<00:03:51.590> use<00:03:51.739> this<00:03:51.890> F<00:03:52.130> and

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
minor chord here let's use this F and

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.339 
minor chord here let's use this F and
then<00:03:52.849> D<00:03:53.060> minor<00:03:53.329> and<00:03:53.660> then<00:03:53.780> come<00:03:53.989> back<00:03:54.019> to<00:03:54.319> a

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
then D minor and then come back to a

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.850 
then D minor and then come back to a
okay<00:03:55.250> so<00:03:55.280> let's<00:03:55.579> see<00:03:55.760> how<00:03:55.910> it<00:03:56.120> sounds<00:03:56.680> so<00:03:57.680> we

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
okay so let's see how it sounds so we

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.009 
okay so let's see how it sounds so we
start<00:03:58.220> with<00:03:58.459> a<00:03:58.700> minor<00:04:00.099> and<00:04:01.510> a<00:04:02.510> lot<00:04:02.690> of<00:04:02.720> times

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
start with a minor and a lot of times

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.020 
start with a minor and a lot of times
you<00:04:03.170> can<00:04:03.349> take<00:04:03.560> these<00:04:03.739> old<00:04:03.950> phrases<00:04:04.549> and<00:04:04.730> just

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
you can take these old phrases and just

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.569 
you can take these old phrases and just
repeat<00:04:05.450> them<00:04:05.660> music<00:04:06.079> loves<00:04:06.410> pattern<00:04:07.160> so<00:04:07.370> just

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
repeat them music loves pattern so just

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:15.400 
repeat them music loves pattern so just
pick<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.790> fake<00:04:08.090> phrase<00:04:08.480> repeated

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.569 

rings<00:04:15.590> feet<00:04:16.100> of<00:04:16.430> me

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.680 

the<00:04:20.729> next<00:04:21.120> one

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.460 

and<00:04:26.110> come<00:04:26.380> back<00:04:26.410> to<00:04:26.620> eight<00:04:27.930> so<00:04:28.930> that's<00:04:29.110> a<00:04:29.290> good

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
and come back to eight so that's a good

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
and come back to eight so that's a good
chord<00:04:29.770> progression<00:04:34.620> so<00:04:35.620> that's<00:04:35.830> all<00:04:36.130> you<00:04:36.310> have

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
chord progression so that's all you have

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.870 
chord progression so that's all you have
to<00:04:36.670> do<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:37.600> improvise<00:04:38.110> you<00:04:38.410> pick<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:38.950> scale<00:04:39.460> and

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
to do to improvise you pick a scale and

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.540 
to do to improvise you pick a scale and
you<00:04:40.660> have<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:41.110> do<00:04:41.290> stay<00:04:41.680> in<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:42.280> key

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
you have to do stay in that key

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.330 
you have to do stay in that key
signature<00:04:43.150> and<00:04:43.620> there's<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.710> lot<00:04:44.890> of<00:04:45.040> different

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
signature and there's a lot of different

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.220 
signature and there's a lot of different
scales<00:04:45.610> that<00:04:45.970> you<00:04:46.030> can<00:04:46.270> choose<00:04:46.540> between<00:04:46.750> you

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
scales that you can choose between you

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.640 
scales that you can choose between you
can<00:04:47.410> do<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:47.860> major<00:04:48.520> scale<00:04:49.710> minor<00:04:50.710> scale

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
can do a major scale minor scale

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.990 
can do a major scale minor scale
sometimes<00:04:53.650> you<00:04:53.770> can<00:04:53.950> make<00:04:54.100> up<00:04:54.280> your<00:04:54.310> own<00:04:54.490> scale

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
sometimes you can make up your own scale

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.090 
sometimes you can make up your own scale
so<00:04:55.240> let's<00:04:55.450> say<00:04:55.600> I<00:04:55.630> take<00:04:55.750> this<00:04:56.200> major<00:04:56.500> scale<00:04:56.950> and

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
so let's say I take this major scale and

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.590 
so let's say I take this major scale and
I'm<00:04:57.190> just<00:04:57.340> going<00:04:57.490> to<00:04:57.550> change<00:04:57.790> one<00:04:58.060> node<00:04:58.300> out<00:04:58.480> of

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
I'm just going to change one node out of

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:07.340 
I'm just going to change one node out of
that<00:04:58.690> I'm<00:04:58.780> going<00:04:58.900> to<00:04:58.990> add<00:04:59.140> an<00:04:59.320> f-sharp

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.410 

so<00:05:07.890> that<00:05:08.100> will<00:05:08.250> give<00:05:08.520> just<00:05:08.760> a<00:05:08.910> little<00:05:08.940> bit

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
so that will give just a little bit

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.150 
so that will give just a little bit
different<00:05:10.140> feel<00:05:10.350> than<00:05:10.380> what<00:05:10.830> the<00:05:10.980> typical

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160

you have to do is pick a scale and

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.510 
you have to do is pick a scale and
become<00:05:40.840> really<00:05:41.289> really<00:05:41.590> familiar<00:05:41.919> with<00:05:42.250> that

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
become really really familiar with that

become really really familiar with that
scale<00:05:42.910> and<00:05:43.380> what<00:05:44.380> you<00:05:44.500> start<00:05:44.919> and<00:05:45.250> you<00:05:45.430> end<00:05:45.669> on

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
scale and what you start and you end on

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.040 
scale and what you start and you end on
defines<00:05:47.669> kind<00:05:48.669> of<00:05:48.819> what<00:05:49.060> the<00:05:49.210> whole<00:05:49.419> song<00:05:49.780> is

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
defines kind of what the whole song is

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.980 
defines kind of what the whole song is
going<00:05:50.229> to<00:05:50.289> go<00:05:50.470> around<00:05:50.650> and<00:05:51.419> then<00:05:52.419> you<00:05:52.569> just<00:05:52.780> use

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
going to go around and then you just use

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.920 
going to go around and then you just use
random<00:05:53.380> notes<00:05:53.560> out<00:05:53.740> of<00:05:53.770> that<00:05:54.009> scale<00:05:54.930> so

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
random notes out of that scale so

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.920 
random notes out of that scale so
