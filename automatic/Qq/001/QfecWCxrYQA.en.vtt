00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.950
 first we apply a foam that we 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.830
 will facilitate the hairstyle and increase your 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.030
 duration also protects hair from 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.860
 excessive heat from the dryer 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.299
 we distribute it well with the comb and 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.299
 we use to untangle 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:37.340
 and we will work the hair by zones and 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.530
 tufts for this we do the 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.489
 necessary partitions and we collect the 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.489
 hair with tweezers 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.290
 yes 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.589
 we will start the drying by the zones 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.120
 inferiors and we will finish in the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.430
 higher 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.810
 with a round brush and the dryer 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.790
 hand we can also vary 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.610
 temporarily the original form of 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.650
 hair we take the first lock of the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.600
 Nape with the brush and we work it 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.740
 from the root to the tip 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.860
 applying hot air with the dryer 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.659
 with this marking technique we mark and 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.810
 we combed our hair at the same time 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.310
 We dry it we are gradually taking 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.630
 new strands of the partitions 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.030
 higher 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.799
 always following the same process 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.950
 We will comb the hair on the side 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.950
 straight 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.659
 we now go to the left side and 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.229
 we repeat the same procedure lock 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.229
 by lock 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.640
 once the drying of all the 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.920
 head we will proceed to fix the hairstyle 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.229
 We will touch all the zones happening with 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.979
 Gentle the brush while applying 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.979
 cooler air 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.989
 the end result is a hair 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.250
 bright and natural looking and a 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.250
 hairstyle with movement
