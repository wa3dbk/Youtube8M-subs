00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:12.540
 when dry weather comes i mean 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:16.470
 the asphalt will be dry now it's winter 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.320
 it is snowing but we have winter in the Caucasus 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.640
 little snow soon all the snow come down and the same 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.799
 then there will be a full review with the ride and I'm all 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.439
 tell him how to install it 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.909
 In general, all its characteristics are well 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.140
 let's get started 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.860
 start it means and opened the fuel 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.790
 a tap of fuel ran down the engine like me 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:49.560
 I'll say cold before I started 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.369
 with a new carburetor but it was 8 o'clock 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.229
 backwards 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:58.969
 in the morning when I arrived I went to the post office 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.380
 we put it with dad we put it 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:04.619
 accordingly immediately wound up 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.970
 from the first time he just turned on 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:13.530
 dried up choke here is choking by the way 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:16.770
 like on java 638 on her carburetor here 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.770
 included suck all the first time 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.520
 wound up but now the temperature has dropped 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.370
 about 5 degrees and I don't know how 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.129
 sped start 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.390
 together we will talk here tap 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:36.599
 open suction I turned on 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.540
 kickstarter flipped over 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:45.830
 position stop winding turn on 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:49.650
 ignition and consider how many times happy 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:53.000
 so well I did not even think that he 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.000
 lucky the first time 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.650
 it's too late now I won't be him 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:21.350
 warm up but on a warm engine i 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.590
 when in the morning he started on a warm 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.410
 engine, he easily keeps turning thousand 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.920
 thousands of revolutions of minutes easy he keeps 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.390
 no problem jet I don't know what 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.980
 because I did not understand this carburetor 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.980
 Well, I do not know what's inside 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:47.270
 I came here and this has put you here here 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.780
 Seen should he wound up the first time 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:55.010
 at first as I behold it kickstarter 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:59.500
 turned and everything and not they warmed up before 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:03.459
 this daughter is the bike itself i mean i come 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:06.980
 under the canopy included 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:10.280
 started and everything here he is the first time 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.590
 wound up very well because with 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.609
 there is a video carburetor 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.970
 look, he got a plant with 3 pumped it 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:24.230
 there is it worth a bunch of movies 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:28.130
 90 dollars I do not know how he will show 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:32.320
 when eating but I think everything will be fine and 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:35.360
 this perfection is not worth the money 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.510
 on a motorcycle is a contactless system 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.480
 ignition but no angle shaper 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:47.150
 ignition timing ie without phase 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:50.360
 so the motorcycle is basically normal from 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.640
 what developments there are just what 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.970
 contactless ignition system and this 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:05:00.169
 a carburetor in the cold and it starts up with 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:04.910
 first time it is generally a doctor is a phenomenon 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:08.580
 I did not think that it will be so well full review 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:13.229
 this carburetor will be in the future 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.830
 when the city of Vladikavkaz will stand 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.159
 all the snow 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:21.479
 I hope that it will soon be there already 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:24.949
 there will be a full review with skating and I'm all 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:27.810
