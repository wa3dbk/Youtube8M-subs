00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello to all guys and well found by 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.609
 francesco siciliana a new episode of 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.500
 top of the week with iphoneitalia.com 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.300
 also in this episode we are going to see 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.910
 the best apps on 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.769
 appstore recently released therefore 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.849
 we start immediately and then we go to see 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.619
 also the news that I had 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.900
 announced in the previous episode 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.850
 that if you have not seen you can go 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.840
 however to review on our channel 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.320
 youtube 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.320
 let's start right away 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.250
 the first application I want you 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.560
 present an application destined to 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.030
 all professionals therefore to all 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.550
 those who need to keep 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.680
 track of accounting and 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.750
 invoices quickly is on more 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.280
 therefore multi-platform devices 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.020
 this application is called 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.750
 invoice in the cloud will allow us precisely 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.100
 to manage all invoice payments 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.660
 the installments etc. on the iphone ipad computer 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.700
 etc. so we will have a 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.100
 complete eco system to always have a 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.290
 handy all the data you need a 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.060
 an activity the next game 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.160
 let's see a game for this 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.110
 week has a very nice game I have 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.430
 developed by the cylinder this game there 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.170
 will put in front of a gameplay a 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.150
 vertical scrolling in gameplay 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.340
 endless so the game will not end 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.020
 we will always have the chance to play 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.060
 so between infinite quotes up to 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.560
 that we do not reach the game over 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.670
 so the challenge will be to 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.860
 achieve the best score 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.470
 possible how to play we will have to 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.660
 place a plane with a shield that 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.460
 is activated when we press or the 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.550
 right side the left side of the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.980
 our device is also active by 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.050
 base, however, in three colors in the center therefore 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.300
 basic if we don't touch anything it's purple 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.000
 if we touch right or left instead 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.620
 it will be blue or pink 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.170
 we should move ours 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.960
 device physically to move 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.480
 the interaction of the plane in the game is 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.210
 obviously we will have to go and press the 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.040
 relative button to change color 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.830
 let our plane pass the 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.820
 barrier that we will face 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.890
 let's move on to the next application 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.560
 an application intended for those who 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.440
 they want to find a good compromise 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.060
 to go for a weekend away 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.610
 therefore a very good quality compromise 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.260
 price this application difference of 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.410
 all other applications far more 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.750
 famous with much more tested services than 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.489
 online booking booking there 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.580
 will let you go see a list 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.420
 of very select hotels 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.250
 very 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.960
 the service is precise and attentive 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.880
 says that one in ten hotels comes 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.910
 selected to maintain quality 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.350
 application at high levels 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.600
 so this application will allow us 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.820
 to select the best packages with 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.860
 breakfast or with events included 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.450
 so for the weekend a lot 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.250
 interesting if we have a couple of 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.530
 days off at weekends e 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.850
 we necessarily want to 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.930
 disconnect we have the possibility of 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.520
 go out 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.810
 the application is very well structured 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.280
 really provides us all 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.530
 necessary information including 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.540
 prices and availability on the rooms 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.920
 that we want to book the next one 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.410
 application a lot application 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.150
 interesting that allows us to go to 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.709
 see the notifications they are for 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.750
 present on our iphone directly 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.340
 on our computer 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.740
 the application will allow us precisely 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.240
 how are you also seeing to send us 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.459
 then to send on our own 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.100
 devices or connected devices 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.090
 all we would like from messages to 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.170
 link 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.209
 it will also allow us to 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.709
 synchronize the clipboard to have the 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.400
 copy paste the same on all 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.990
 platforms 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.760
 we pass an application destined to the 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.840
 last music we see today before 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.830
 of the applications you have me 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.840
 recommended you 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.420
 let's see an application of 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.220
 casio that will allow us to create a 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.350
 arrangement starting from a few bars 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.440
 and this application we can insert 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.810
 the godly melody that turns us on the head 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.730
 via keyboard or audio 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.800
 microphone so we could also go to 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.450
 the whistle or hum and 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.400
 the application of the will register the 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.620
 will put on the pentagram and then us 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.750
 we will choose all the options to create 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.489
 an arrangement and will give created a 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.930
 trend including the melody 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.700
 obviously then this application does not 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.620
 allows us to export it in nests or 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.970
 print it directly so we will have to 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.220
 however, have musical knowledge 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.660
 to then go to work again on 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.950
 these projects then to create a 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.549
 real arrangement that can 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.370
 playing in a professional way is 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.470
 obviously also the way to print or 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.240
 however write down a 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.010
 melody we created 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.580
 well we switched to the application of 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.490
 this week 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.259
 you advised we are going to see 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.509
 fantastic application for the 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:38.939
 calendar that will allow us to go to 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:40.889
 enter our our commitments 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:41.849
 natural way then with a language 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.379
 natural 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.870
 we could simply write ad 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:49.169
 example going out Saturday night with friends 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.580
 and the application will understand that it has to put 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.139
 this appointment to go out with 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.759
 friends on Saturday is 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.289
 a very interesting application but 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.810
 it doesn't just stop at this one has a widget 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.810
 really very very interesting with 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.310
 all the days on the list that 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.740
 allows us to see immediately 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.479
 all there is to do anyway 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.310
 very complete allows us to operate 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.409
 very well on calendars 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.539
 decidedly superior to the application 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:15.090
 native apple is still available 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.069
 on various platforms both on iphone sense 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.780
 white is on the mac of the boys with the 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.460
 Today's episode we finished me 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.319
 I said in the previous episode that 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.240
 there would be something new starting from 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:26.699
 this week, yes, let's talk 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.129
 just a novelty that I will propose to 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:31.409
 I will tell you two applications 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:33.629
 that do more or less the same thing two 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.909
 alternatives and you will tell me in the comments 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:37.770
 which you prefer among these is however 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:39.509
 for what reason we go to see 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.340
 also what are the applications 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.379
 best among the various alternatives 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.360
 present for a given operation 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:46.740
 category we start right from the 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.810
 calendar there are so many e 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.879
 obligations for the calendar as for 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.979
 fantastic example I have also calendars 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:55.219
 read all all native application file 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:58.919
 in short, I compare myself 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:06:00.870
 fantastic 2 and kander swipe the riddle 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.669
 tell me which one you use for which 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.349
 reason and maybe for what reason 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.690
 you would like to leave the application 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:07.770
 apple native to pass one of 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.719
 these two applications for management 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.120
 of the reminder calendar because 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:13.289
 remember that they are also integrated 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.360
 reminders within these 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.830
 applications in the next episodes then 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.419
 we will also analyze others 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.139
 applications you continue anyway 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.400
 also to suggest applications for the 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.659
 speech must have for those who are just 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.400
 entered the iphone world 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:27.930
 today we have seen fantastic lbera 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.400
 next week we will see some more 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.379
 interesting application 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.000
