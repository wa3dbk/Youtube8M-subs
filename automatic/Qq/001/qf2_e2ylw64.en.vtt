share with you guys some potential sigh
on<00:00:03.179> earth<00:00:03.389> which<00:00:03.600> are<00:00:03.750> available<00:00:04.080> for<00:00:04.170> testing

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
on earth which are available for testing

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.590 
on earth which are available for testing
currently<00:00:04.920> so<00:00:05.549> as<00:00:05.759> I<00:00:05.850> normally<00:00:05.970> do<00:00:06.240> they're<00:00:06.450> up

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
currently so as I normally do they're up

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.330 
currently so as I normally do they're up
in<00:00:06.720> Notepad<00:00:07.200> somewhere<00:00:07.529> probably<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:08.220> top

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
in Notepad somewhere probably the top

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.799 
in Notepad somewhere probably the top
left-hand<00:00:08.700> side<00:00:08.970> of<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.120> screen<00:00:09.150> currently

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
left-hand side of the screen currently

left-hand side of the screen currently
as<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.650> can<00:00:10.769> see<00:00:10.920> they<00:00:11.010> all<00:00:11.099> have<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.309> do<00:00:11.370> with

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
as you can see they all have to do with

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.669 
as you can see they all have to do with
soul<00:00:11.820> furnace<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.300> W<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.809> shield<00:00:13.170> thing<00:00:13.469> right

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
soul furnace to W the shield thing right

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
soul furnace to W the shield thing right
here<00:00:14.240> so<00:00:15.240> what's<00:00:15.780> happening<00:00:16.199> now<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.699> as

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
here so what's happening now is as

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.000 
here so what's happening now is as
indicated<00:00:18.359> in<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.600> text<00:00:18.960> now<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:19.770> actually

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
indicated in the text now it's actually

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.580 
indicated in the text now it's actually
scales<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:20.910> before<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.689> was<00:00:21.869> ten<00:00:22.109> percent<00:00:22.470> at

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
scales so before it was ten percent at

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.529 
scales so before it was ten percent at
all<00:00:22.769> ranks<00:00:23.189> no<00:00:23.699> matter<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:24.090> know<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.359> doesn't

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
all ranks no matter you know it doesn't

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.910 
all ranks no matter you know it doesn't
matter<00:00:24.689> how<00:00:24.779> many<00:00:24.869> points<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.170> had<00:00:25.289> into<00:00:25.800> it

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
matter how many points you had into it

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.040 
matter how many points you had into it
you<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:26.460> ten<00:00:26.670> percent<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.180> your<00:00:27.330> total<00:00:27.510> HP<00:00:27.930> as

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
you get ten percent of your total HP as

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.150 
you get ten percent of your total HP as
a<00:00:28.080> bonus<00:00:28.320> part<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.769> shield<00:00:28.949> now<00:00:29.070> that

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
a bonus part of the shield now that

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.320 
a bonus part of the shield now that
actually<00:00:29.369> scales<00:00:29.580> based<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:29.970> how<00:00:30.029> many<00:00:30.210> points

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
actually scales based on how many points

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.030 
actually scales based on how many points
going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.750> do<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.900> starts<00:00:31.410> at<00:00:31.500> six<00:00:31.679> percent

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
going to do it starts at six percent

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.770 
going to do it starts at six percent
goes<00:00:32.250> all<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.730> way<00:00:32.880> up<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.000> ten<00:00:33.329> percent

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
goes all the way up to ten percent

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.750 
goes all the way up to ten percent
that's<00:00:34.530> actually<00:00:34.920> fairly<00:00:35.040> significant<00:00:35.670> but

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
that's actually fairly significant but

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.370 
that's actually fairly significant but
I'll<00:00:35.820> get<00:00:35.940> into<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.390> second<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.170> other

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
I'll get into that in a second the other

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.229 
I'll get into that in a second the other
thing<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> whole<00:00:38.489> charge<00:00:38.820> up<00:00:39.000> time

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
thing is that the whole charge up time

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.090 
thing is that the whole charge up time
you<00:00:39.750> know<00:00:39.840> before<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.469> had<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.800> wait<00:00:40.920> at<00:00:41.070> least

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
you know before you had to wait at least

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.740 
you know before you had to wait at least
two<00:00:41.550> seconds<00:00:41.969> where<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.180> could<00:00:42.270> repress<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
two seconds where you could repress the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.479 
two seconds where you could repress the
button<00:00:42.989> cause<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.410> explode<00:00:43.440> now<00:00:44.430> we

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
button cause it to explode now we

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.889 
button cause it to explode now we
actually<00:00:44.640> need<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.000> wait<00:00:45.120> three<00:00:45.390> seconds<00:00:45.780> so

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
actually need to wait three seconds so

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.990 
actually need to wait three seconds so
that's<00:00:46.079> actually<00:00:46.379> at<00:00:47.100> least<00:00:47.370> fifty<00:00:47.760> percent

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
that's actually at least fifty percent

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.670 
that's actually at least fifty percent
of<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.210> time<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.570> total<00:00:48.930> shield<00:00:49.140> duration

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
of the time of the total shield duration

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.799 
of the time of the total shield duration
given<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.670> it's<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.059> six<00:00:51.329> seconds<00:00:51.690> total

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
given that it's a six seconds total

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.389 
given that it's a six seconds total
duration<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> wait<00:00:52.739> three<00:00:52.920> seconds<00:00:53.280> for

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
duration have to wait three seconds for

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.590 
duration have to wait three seconds for
you<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.579> press<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.760> again<00:00:54.000> causing<00:00:54.270> thing<00:00:54.510> to

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
you can press it again causing thing to

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.069 
you can press it again causing thing to
blow<00:00:54.750> up<00:00:56.000> now<00:00:57.000> that's<00:00:57.180> kind<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.600> interesting

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
blow up now that's kind of interesting

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.500 
blow up now that's kind of interesting
it's<00:00:58.410> not<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:59.000> massive<00:01:00.000> although<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.390> know

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
it's not like massive although you know

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.880 
it's not like massive although you know
they're<00:01:00.690> there<00:01:00.930> are<00:01:01.050> instances<00:01:01.440> where<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
they're there are instances where the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.020 
they're there are instances where the
shield's<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.340> get<00:01:02.430> blown<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.910> that

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
shield's going to get blown up in that

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.189 
shield's going to get blown up in that
extra<00:01:03.239> second<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.719> could<00:01:03.899> be<00:01:03.930> very

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
extra second so it could be very

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.990 
extra second so it could be very
important<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.680> those<00:01:04.799> instances<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.850> they

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
important in those instances but they

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.460 
important in those instances but they
actually<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.299> scaling<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:07.020> sort<00:01:07.409> of

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
actually the scaling is sort of

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.929 
actually the scaling is sort of
interesting<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> sense<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.729> did<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
interesting in the sense that I did a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.609 
interesting in the sense that I did a
bit<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.180> math<00:01:09.390> here<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.810> basically<00:01:10.049> assuming

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
bit of math here and basically assuming

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.800 
bit of math here and basically assuming
you<00:01:10.680> have<00:01:10.890> about<00:01:11.400> 700<00:01:11.729> HP<00:01:12.090> at<00:01:12.420> level<00:01:12.659> or<00:01:12.780> at

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
you have about 700 HP at level or at

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.020 
you have about 700 HP at level or at
seven<00:01:13.110> or<00:01:13.200> HP<00:01:13.470> at<00:01:13.530> level<00:01:13.740> two<00:01:13.950> you're<00:01:14.909> actually

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
seven or HP at level two you're actually

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.480 
seven or HP at level two you're actually
getting<00:01:15.210> 28<00:01:15.720> less<00:01:16.619> hit<00:01:16.830> points<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.280> shield

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
getting 28 less hit points on the shield

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.920 
getting 28 less hit points on the shield
so<00:01:17.700> basically<00:01:18.000> level<00:01:18.210> till<00:01:18.330> he<00:01:18.479> had<00:01:18.570> seminar

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
so basically level till he had seminar

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.620 
so basically level till he had seminar
hit<00:01:19.320> points<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:20.130> would<00:01:20.220> be<00:01:20.369> getting<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> 100<00:01:21.509> HP

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
hit points you would be getting a 100 HP

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.240 
hit points you would be getting a 100 HP
shield<00:01:22.110> now<00:01:22.470> you're<00:01:22.680> only<00:01:22.830> actually<00:01:23.130> getting

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
shield now you're only actually getting

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.340 
shield now you're only actually getting
a<00:01:23.340> 72<00:01:23.939> HP<00:01:24.360> shield<00:01:24.630> that's<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.049> know<00:01:25.170> what's

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
a 72 HP shield that's you know what's

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.660 
a 72 HP shield that's you know what's
pretty<00:01:25.979> sizable<00:01:28.009> given<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.310> whole

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
pretty sizable given that the whole

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.520 
pretty sizable given that the whole
extra<00:01:30.030> HP<00:01:30.210> portion<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> shield<00:01:31.380> was

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
extra HP portion of the shield was

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.730 
extra HP portion of the shield was
actually<00:01:32.040> typically<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.729> larger<00:01:33.210> um<00:01:33.740> portion

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
actually typically the larger um portion

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.319 
actually typically the larger um portion
ship<00:01:34.890> because<00:01:35.100> actually<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> base<00:01:36.060> amount

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
ship because actually the base amount

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.950 
ship because actually the base amount
from<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> shield<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.930> not<00:01:37.079> very<00:01:37.320> big<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:39.420> yeah

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
from the shield is not very big so yeah

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.310 
from the shield is not very big so yeah
it's<00:01:40.350> sort<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.710> interesting<00:01:41.009> now<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.320> nerf

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
it's sort of interesting now this nerf

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.990 
it's sort of interesting now this nerf
actually<00:01:43.710> affects<00:01:43.979> people<00:01:44.369> depending<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:44.880> how

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
actually affects people depending on how

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.969 
actually affects people depending on how
you<00:01:45.060> play<00:01:45.390> sian<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:46.380> affect<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.710> more<00:01:46.860> or

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
you play sian can affect you more or

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.649 
you play sian can affect you more or
less<00:01:47.100> for<00:01:47.250> example<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.670> always<00:01:48.090> regardless<00:01:48.509> I

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
less for example I always regardless I

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.899 
less for example I always regardless I
don't<00:01:48.810> always<00:01:49.079> level<00:01:49.350> shield<00:01:49.560> second<00:01:50.070> but<00:01:50.880> I

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
don't always level shield second but I

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.460 
don't always level shield second but I
know<00:01:51.000> there<00:01:51.210> are<00:01:51.240> people<00:01:51.420> who<00:01:51.630> level<00:01:52.170> shield

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
know there are people who level shield

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.170 
know there are people who level shield
last<00:01:52.829> because<00:01:53.399> they<00:01:53.549> want<00:01:53.790> both<00:01:54.259> q<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.290> e<00:01:56.180> max

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
last because they want both q and e max

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.120 
last because they want both q and e max
before<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.689> I've<00:01:58.020> never<00:01:58.229> done<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.920> mean

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
before it I've never done that so I mean

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.499 
before it I've never done that so I mean
it's<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.820> ends<00:02:00.149> up<00:02:00.210> being<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.479> difference

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
it's that ends up being the difference

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.039 
it's that ends up being the difference
of<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.140> second<00:02:01.530> point<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:02.009> w<00:02:02.909> ends<00:02:03.630> up<00:02:03.750> being

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
of the second point in w ends up being

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.150 
of the second point in w ends up being
at<00:02:04.500> level<00:02:04.740> 9<00:02:04.969> whereas<00:02:05.969> if<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.210> level<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.600> third

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
at level 9 whereas if you level it third

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.680 
at level 9 whereas if you level it third
it<00:02:08.160> ends<00:02:08.399> up<00:02:08.459> being<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.640> little<00:02:08.729> 14<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.539> that's

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
it ends up being a little 14 so that's

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.140 
it ends up being a little 14 so that's
five<00:02:09.899> levels<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.619> know

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
five levels you know

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.399 
five levels you know
not<00:02:11.299> actually<00:02:11.599> doing<00:02:11.689> anything<00:02:11.930> with<00:02:12.319> the

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
not actually doing anything with the

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.309 
not actually doing anything with the
shield<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:13.269> always<00:02:14.269> really<00:02:14.659> liked<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.989> ship<00:02:15.170> so

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
shield I always really liked the ship so

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.399 
shield I always really liked the ship so
that's<00:02:15.470> great<00:02:15.739> but<00:02:15.950> incidentally<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:17.390> level<00:02:18.140> Q

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
that's great but incidentally I level Q

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.710 
that's great but incidentally I level Q
first<00:02:19.010> pretty<00:02:19.670> much<00:02:19.790> regardless<00:02:20.540> what<00:02:20.629> I'm

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
first pretty much regardless what I'm

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.330 
first pretty much regardless what I'm
doing<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.079> know<00:02:21.319> there's<00:02:21.590> also<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:21.890> e<00:02:21.920> play

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
doing I know there's also the e play

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.420 
doing I know there's also the e play
style<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.930> it's<00:02:24.620> always<00:02:24.769> kind<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.129> amusing

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
style and it's always kind of amusing

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.949 
style and it's always kind of amusing
people<00:02:25.849> coming<00:02:26.090> into<00:02:26.209> my<00:02:26.329> stream<00:02:26.540> telling<00:02:26.810> you

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
people coming into my stream telling you

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.380 
people coming into my stream telling you
must<00:02:27.260> level<00:02:27.680> e<00:02:27.859> first<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.519> I'm<00:02:28.609> like<00:02:28.760> you<00:02:29.299> have

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
must level e first and I'm like you have

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.300 
must level e first and I'm like you have
no<00:02:29.569> idea<00:02:29.689> you're<00:02:29.900> talking<00:02:30.200> about<00:02:30.379> and<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.159> it's

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
no idea you're talking about and so it's

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.349 
no idea you're talking about and so it's
kind<00:02:31.519> of<00:02:31.549> great<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:31.819> see<00:02:31.939> that<00:02:31.970> actually

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.359 
kind of great to see that actually

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:33.940 
kind of great to see that actually
people<00:02:32.659> are<00:02:32.900> coming<00:02:33.109> around<00:02:33.290> my<00:02:33.500> place<00:02:33.739> now

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
people are coming around my place now

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.890 
people are coming around my place now
and<00:02:34.159> a<00:02:34.250> lot<00:02:34.459> of<00:02:34.519> people<00:02:34.670> are<00:02:35.000> finally<00:02:35.269> also

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
and a lot of people are finally also

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.479 
and a lot of people are finally also
bubbling<00:02:36.290> q<00:02:36.500> first<00:02:36.739> as<00:02:36.920> well<00:02:37.069> not<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.400> I'm

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
bubbling q first as well not that I'm

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.949 
bubbling q first as well not that I'm
saying<00:02:37.640> he<00:02:37.819> is<00:02:37.939> bad<00:02:38.180> like<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.840> was<00:02:38.930> a

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
saying he is bad like that was a

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.569 
saying he is bad like that was a
perfectly<00:02:39.319> valid<00:02:39.379> play<00:02:39.829> style<00:02:40.150> but<00:02:42.579> they're

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
perfectly valid play style but they're

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.330 
perfectly valid play style but they're
nice<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:44.379> not<00:02:45.379> have<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.590> tell<00:02:45.889> people<00:02:46.099> to<00:02:46.159> go

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
nice to not have to tell people to go

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.170 
nice to not have to tell people to go
away<00:02:46.549> basically<00:02:48.430> well<00:02:49.430> actually<00:02:49.670> another

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
away basically well actually another

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.339 
away basically well actually another
point<00:02:50.450> but<00:02:50.599> I<00:02:50.629> should<00:02:50.780> probably<00:02:50.810> make<00:02:51.109> a<00:02:51.139> video

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
point but I should probably make a video

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.140 
point but I should probably make a video
about<00:02:51.500> that<00:02:51.769> were<00:02:51.859> incidentally<00:02:52.280> people<00:02:53.030> who

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
about that were incidentally people who

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.059 
about that were incidentally people who
tell<00:02:53.389> you<00:02:53.510> you<00:02:53.690> must<00:02:54.019> do<00:02:54.319> something<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.859> certain

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
tell you you must do something a certain

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.330 
tell you you must do something a certain
way<00:02:55.750> almost<00:02:56.750> always<00:02:57.200> tend<00:02:58.069> to<00:02:58.220> be

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
way almost always tend to be

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.800 
way almost always tend to be
significantly<00:02:58.609> less<00:02:59.030> experienced<00:02:59.569> the<00:02:59.720> game

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
significantly less experienced the game

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.030 
significantly less experienced the game
I've<00:02:59.930> noticed<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.319> you<00:03:00.560> know<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:00.709> won't<00:03:00.920> ever

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
I've noticed that you know I won't ever

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.410 
I've noticed that you know I won't ever
to<00:03:01.430> hear<00:03:01.639> that<00:03:01.790> when<00:03:01.939> I'm<00:03:01.970> playing<00:03:02.209> a

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
to hear that when I'm playing a

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.789 
to hear that when I'm playing a
low-level<00:03:02.720> account<00:03:03.310> but<00:03:04.310> anyway<00:03:05.799> that's

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
low-level account but anyway that's

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.229 
low-level account but anyway that's
aside<00:03:07.099> in<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.250> point<00:03:07.489> another<00:03:08.060> interesting

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
aside in the point another interesting

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.970 
aside in the point another interesting
thing<00:03:08.480> about<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:09.019> Scion<00:03:09.379> shield<00:03:09.709> is<00:03:09.889> that

you<00:03:32.540> actually<00:03:32.780> have<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.109> blow<00:03:33.260> up<00:03:33.319> the<00:03:33.409> shield

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590

if the large guy hits you and smaller

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.250

than<00:03:37.669> any<00:03:37.849> kind<00:03:38.120> of<00:03:38.180> thing<00:03:38.329> which<00:03:38.810> is<00:03:38.870> a<00:03:39.019> bit

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
than any kind of thing which is a bit

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.659 
than any kind of thing which is a bit
tricky<00:03:39.409> but<00:03:39.739> you<00:03:39.859> know<00:03:39.949> still<00:03:40.010> very<00:03:40.340> doable

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
tricky but you know still very doable

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.159 
tricky but you know still very doable
it's<00:03:40.879> not<00:03:41.060> like<00:03:41.359> the<00:03:41.479> biggest<00:03:41.720> thing<00:03:42.019> in<00:03:42.109> the

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.169 
it's not like the biggest thing in the

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:43.960 
it's not like the biggest thing in the
world<00:03:42.319> but<00:03:42.349> something<00:03:42.680> definitely<00:03:42.799> to<00:03:43.459> keep

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
world but something definitely to keep

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.159 
world but something definitely to keep
in<00:03:44.120> mind<00:03:44.299> especially<00:03:44.419> considering<00:03:44.989> you<00:03:45.049> can

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
in mind especially considering you can

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:46.509 
in mind especially considering you can
charge<00:03:45.379> it<00:03:45.560> up<00:03:45.680> you<00:03:45.859> know<00:03:45.919> before<00:03:46.069> you<00:03:46.280> engage

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
charge it up you know before you engage

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.550 
charge it up you know before you engage
you<00:03:46.849> know<00:03:46.940> before<00:03:47.180> they<00:03:47.299> even<00:03:47.479> spawned<00:03:47.870> or<00:03:48.379> hit

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
you know before they even spawned or hit

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.539 
you know before they even spawned or hit
them<00:03:48.680> with<00:03:48.769> a<00:03:48.829> smite<00:03:49.069> and<00:03:49.220> then<00:03:49.340> they<00:03:49.400> gets

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
them with a smite and then they gets

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.349 
them with a smite and then they gets
done<00:03:49.760> sort<00:03:50.090> of<00:03:50.180> thing<00:03:51.489> now<00:03:52.489> actually<00:03:52.819> I<00:03:53.000> may<00:03:53.299> as

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359

runes then you could plot may be your
shield<00:04:33.290> might<00:04:33.560> survive<00:04:33.860> so<00:04:34.520> that<00:04:34.550> depends

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
shield might survive so that depends

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.360 
shield might survive so that depends
there's<00:04:36.500> also<00:04:36.650> of<00:04:36.770> course<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:37.070> trade-off

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
there's also of course the trade-off

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.990 
there's also of course the trade-off
because<00:04:37.490> if<00:04:37.730> you<00:04:37.790> don't<00:04:37.940> run<00:04:39.160> armor<00:04:40.160> reds<00:04:40.550> or

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
because if you don't run armor reds or

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.960 
because if you don't run armor reds or
armor<00:04:41.350> armor<00:04:42.350> yellows<00:04:42.710> you<00:04:43.460> don't<00:04:43.700> have<00:04:43.850> the

i'm not sure you have to test that

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.850 
i'm not sure you have to test that
yourself<00:04:49.850> but<00:04:50.330> i'm<00:04:50.420> not<00:04:50.510> gonna<00:04:50.630> do<00:04:50.780> that<00:04:50.860> for

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
yourself but i'm not gonna do that for

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.650 
yourself but i'm not gonna do that for
example<00:04:51.980> i<00:04:52.430> just<00:04:52.820> set<00:04:52.940> up<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.150> shield<00:04:53.330> first

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
example i just set up the shield first

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.730 
example i just set up the shield first
and<00:04:53.900> then<00:04:55.090> oops<00:04:56.090> on<00:04:56.390> the<00:04:56.510> right<00:04:56.690> I<00:04:57.140> screwed

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
and then oops on the right I screwed

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.420 
and then oops on the right I screwed
that<00:04:57.770> up<00:04:57.890> but<00:04:58.960> yeah<00:04:59.960> I<00:05:00.200> see<00:05:00.890> that<00:05:00.920> actually<00:05:01.340> was

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
that up but yeah I see that actually was

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.070 
that up but yeah I see that actually was
another<00:05:01.640> thing<00:05:01.880> it's<00:05:02.270> good<00:05:02.540> did<00:05:02.660> I<00:05:02.720> mention

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
another thing it's good did I mention

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.920 
another thing it's good did I mention
this<00:05:03.200> because<00:05:03.260> the<00:05:04.070> whole<00:05:04.420> shield<00:05:05.420> thing<00:05:05.720> I

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
this because the whole shield thing I

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.350 
this because the whole shield thing I
was<00:05:06.440> trying<00:05:06.680> to<00:05:06.740> splode<00:05:07.040> up<00:05:07.220> at<00:05:07.370> two<00:05:07.940> seconds

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
was trying to splode up at two seconds

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.830 
was trying to splode up at two seconds
as<00:05:08.420> opposed<00:05:08.660> to<00:05:08.750> three<00:05:09.020> seconds<00:05:09.970> so<00:05:10.970> that's

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
as opposed to three seconds so that's

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.030 
as opposed to three seconds so that's
definitely<00:05:12.140> a<00:05:12.350> thing<00:05:12.500> you<00:05:12.590> got<00:05:12.710> to<00:05:12.740> keep<00:05:12.890> in

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
definitely a thing you got to keep in

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.110 
definitely a thing you got to keep in
mind<00:05:13.070> as<00:05:13.310> well<00:05:13.520> that<00:05:13.550> actually<00:05:13.880> just

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
mind as well that actually just

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.290 
mind as well that actually just
legitimately<00:05:14.900> screwed<00:05:15.380> me<00:05:15.500> up<00:05:16.120> because<00:05:17.120> I

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
legitimately screwed me up because I

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.730 
legitimately screwed me up because I
thought<00:05:17.450> I<00:05:17.510> could<00:05:17.720> explode<00:05:18.170> it<00:05:18.350> before<00:05:18.650> it

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 
mind that the duration or the the charge

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:06.609 
mind that the duration or the the charge
up<00:06:04.879> time<00:06:05.059> is<00:06:05.240> longer<00:06:05.539> so<00:06:05.839> you<00:06:06.139> don't<00:06:06.379> do<00:06:06.469> what<00:06:06.589> I

00:06:06.609 --> 00:06:06.619 
up time is longer so you don't do what I

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:08.139 
up time is longer so you don't do what I
did<00:06:06.709> and<00:06:07.039> let<00:06:07.159> the<00:06:07.249> cogs<00:06:07.520> hit<00:06:07.699> you<00:06:07.759> an<00:06:07.879> extra

did and let the cogs hit you an extra

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:09.399 
did and let the cogs hit you an extra
time<00:06:08.300> because<00:06:08.360> you<00:06:08.779> thought<00:06:08.959> you<00:06:09.110> could<00:06:09.259> set

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:09.409 
time because you thought you could set

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.559 
time because you thought you could set
the<00:06:09.529> shield<00:06:09.740> off<00:06:09.949> at<00:06:10.189> two<00:06:10.610> seconds<00:06:11.059> doesn't
