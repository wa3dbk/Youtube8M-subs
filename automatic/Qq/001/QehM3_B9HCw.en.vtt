we<00:02:33.430> come<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.879> first<00:02:34.060> camp<00:02:34.359> we<00:02:34.780> were<00:02:34.900> able

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
we come to the first camp we were able

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.220 
we come to the first camp we were able
to<00:02:35.290> ride<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.590> bike<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.129> now<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.760> go<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.150> camp<00:02:37.989> to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
to ride a bike and now to go to camp to

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.929 
to ride a bike and now to go to camp to
what<00:02:39.159> we<00:02:39.280> got<00:02:39.459> there

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
what we got there

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.990 
what we got there
one<00:02:40.540> thousand<00:02:40.930> matter<00:02:41.079> and<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:42.459> think<00:02:42.819> we<00:02:42.909> have

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
one thousand matter and I think we have

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.179 
one thousand matter and I think we have
to<00:02:43.180> carry<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.629> bike<00:02:43.780> most<00:02:44.109> of<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.319> time<00:02:44.500> so<00:02:45.159> I

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
to carry the bike most of the time so I

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.339 
to carry the bike most of the time so I
think<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.519> hardest<00:02:45.790> part<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.359> the<00:02:47.170> trip

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
think the hardest part of the the trip

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.129 
think the hardest part of the the trip
but<00:02:47.620> we<00:02:48.340> start<00:02:48.579> early<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.000> we<00:02:49.629> have<00:02:49.780> all<00:02:49.989> day

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:50.139 
but we start early and we have all day

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.530 
but we start early and we have all day
to<00:02:50.200> make<00:02:50.469> it<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:51.370> was<00:02:51.519> pretty<00:02:51.670> challenging<00:02:52.090> for

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
to make it it was pretty challenging for

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.750 
to make it it was pretty challenging for
us<00:02:52.599> you<00:02:52.840> know<00:02:52.959> it<00:02:53.260> was<00:02:53.530> we<00:02:54.129> were<00:02:54.250> not<00:02:54.400> sure<00:02:54.430> if

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760
