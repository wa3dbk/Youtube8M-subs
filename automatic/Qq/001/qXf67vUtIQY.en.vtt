assignment was to criticize and it was

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.619 
assignment was to criticize and it was
right<00:01:00.570> then<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.109> realized<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.629> they

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
right then that I realized that they

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.109 
right then that I realized that they
weren't<00:01:03.840> teaching<00:01:04.170> us<00:01:04.820> facts<00:01:05.820> and

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
weren't teaching us facts and

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.870 
weren't teaching us facts and
information<00:01:06.439> was<00:01:07.439> teaching<00:01:07.950> me<00:01:08.130> how<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> think

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
information was teaching me how to think

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.090 
information was teaching me how to think
and<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:10.700> turned<00:01:11.700> out<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.909> be<00:01:12.210> extremely

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
and that turned out to be extremely

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.539 
and that turned out to be extremely
important<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.280> many<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.950> situations<00:01:16.950> I

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
important in many of the situations I

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.590

they<00:02:22.360> develop<00:02:22.540> their<00:02:22.870> new<00:02:22.989> engines<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.840> fluid

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
they develop their new engines so fluid

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.229 
they develop their new engines so fluid

through<00:02:33.879> the<00:02:34.030> 60s<00:02:34.480> we<00:02:35.019> had<00:02:35.170> some<00:02:35.379> teaching

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
through the 60s we had some teaching

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
subsequent flights as well it was the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.699 
subsequent flights as well it was the
systems<00:03:48.699> were<00:03:48.879> very<00:03:49.209> heavily<00:03:49.599> loaded<00:03:49.930> they

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.219 
hadn't been this part of the flight had
never<00:03:53.769> been<00:03:54.010> done<00:03:54.250> before<00:03:54.430> these<00:03:55.419> parts<00:03:55.989> of

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:56.229 
never been done before these parts of

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:57.899 
never been done before these parts of

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
and it was a very demanding task so yeah

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.039 
and it was a very demanding task so yeah
it<00:04:04.269> was<00:04:04.479> it<00:04:05.079> was<00:04:05.370> enormously<00:04:06.370> satisfying<00:04:07.060> to

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
it was it was enormously satisfying to

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.170 
it was it was enormously satisfying to
get<00:04:08.829> through<00:04:09.040> that<00:04:09.250> first<00:04:09.489> one<00:04:09.729> and<00:04:09.909> be<00:04:10.060> able

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
get through that first one and be able

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.780 
get through that first one and be able
to<00:04:10.560> successfully<00:04:11.579> make

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
to successfully make

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
have when we got to the vicinity of the

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.930 
have when we got to the vicinity of the
landings<00:04:23.740> I'd<00:04:23.919> have<00:04:24.130> a<00:04:24.310> couple<00:04:24.639> of<00:04:24.729> nights

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
landings I'd have a couple of nights

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.650 
landings I'd have a couple of nights
fuel<00:04:25.270> left<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.740> complete<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.310> landing<00:04:27.699> in<00:04:28.509> our

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
fuel left to complete the landing in our

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.779 
fuel left to complete the landing in our
case<00:04:28.930> because<00:04:29.410> we<00:04:29.830> were<00:04:30.039> going<00:04:30.310> into<00:04:30.460> an<00:04:30.639> area

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
the size of automobiles on it then this

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.240 
the size of automobiles on it then this
wasn't<00:04:49.360> it<00:04:49.449> wasn't<00:04:50.349> a<00:04:50.500> place<00:04:50.650> that<00:04:50.889> I<00:04:50.979> wanted

wasn't it wasn't a place that I wanted
to<00:04:51.460> try<00:04:51.610> and<00:04:51.669> make<00:04:51.820> landing<00:04:52.270> I<00:04:52.479> back<00:04:53.349> right

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
to try and make landing I back right

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.159 
to try and make landing I back right
okay<00:04:54.250> engine<00:04:54.610> stop<00:04:54.639> we<00:04:55.449> copy<00:04:55.690> it<00:04:55.960> down<00:04:55.990> and<00:04:56.410> go

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
okay engine stop we copy it down and go

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.620 
okay engine stop we copy it down and go

and gaudy babes here and ankle I planted

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.760 
and gaudy babes here and ankle I planted
then<00:05:02.590> that<00:05:03.070> it<00:05:03.520> was<00:05:03.550> a<00:05:04.229> certainly<00:05:05.229> a<00:05:05.349> concern

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
then that it was a certainly a concern

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.969

but<00:05:06.660> on<00:05:07.660> the<00:05:08.050> other<00:05:08.139> hand<00:05:08.259> if<00:05:08.620> we<00:05:08.770> were<00:05:08.860> going

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
but on the other hand if we were going

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.740 
but on the other hand if we were going
to<00:05:09.039> make<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.220> landing<00:05:09.580> it<00:05:09.759> had<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:10.060> be<00:05:10.090> a<00:05:10.210> safe

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
to make a landing it had to be a safe

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.790 
to make a landing it had to be a safe
smooth<00:05:11.080> women<00:05:11.500> so<00:05:12.330> we<00:05:13.330> were<00:05:13.710> well<00:05:14.710> prepared
