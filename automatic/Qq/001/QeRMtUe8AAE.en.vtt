today we're going to be adding a
coastline<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.519> sand<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.710> basically<00:00:25.710> going<00:00:25.920> to

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
coastline of sand so basically going to

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.820 
coastline of sand so basically going to
be<00:00:26.189> adding<00:00:26.400> material<00:00:26.880> layers<00:00:27.449> or<00:00:28.050> textures<00:00:28.650> to

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
be adding material layers or textures to

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.209 
be adding material layers or textures to
your<00:00:28.949> map<00:00:29.810> alright<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:31.650> need<00:00:31.800> us<00:00:31.859> off<00:00:32.040> by

your map alright so we need us off by
doing<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.610> going<00:00:32.759> up<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.149> terrain<00:00:33.890> texture<00:00:34.890> and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
doing is going up to terrain texture and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.639 
doing is going up to terrain texture and
I<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.239> did<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.600> Amanda<00:00:37.050> go<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.469> really

from there go to edit surface types you
didn't<00:00:59.670> see<00:00:59.820> sand<00:01:00.090> right<00:01:00.270> there<00:01:00.559> we're<00:01:01.559> going

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770

didn't see sand right there we're going
to<00:01:01.980> go<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.160> add<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.359> see<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.899> comes<00:01:04.170> up<00:01:04.350> as

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
to go to add you can see it comes up as

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.890 
to go to add you can see it comes up as
add<00:01:04.920> surface<00:01:05.369> type<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:06.060> usually<00:01:06.390> one<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.810> you

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
add surface type it's usually one if you

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.539 
add surface type it's usually one if you
never<00:01:07.110> attempted<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.680> before<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.369> can

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
never attempted this before but you can

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.240 
never attempted this before but you can
double<00:01:09.210> click<00:01:09.240> on<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.900> change<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.070> name

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
double click on that and change the name

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.039 
double click on that and change the name
to<00:01:11.280> sand<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.970> suggest<00:01:12.360> naming<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.810> same

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
to sand I suggest naming it the same

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.219 
to sand I suggest naming it the same
thing<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> texture<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.750> mean<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.930> layer

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
thing as the texture I mean as the layer

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.580 
thing as the texture I mean as the layer
and<00:01:16.880> then<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:18.390> need<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.720> go<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> our<00:01:19.140> material

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and then we need to go to our material

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.179 
and then we need to go to our material
editor<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.159> find<00:01:20.520> sand<00:01:21.680> so<00:01:22.680> what<00:01:22.950> we're<00:01:23.070> going

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
editor and find sand so what we're going

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.859 
editor and find sand so what we're going
to<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.729> we're<00:01:23.909> going<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.119> go<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.360> your<00:01:24.509> total

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
to do is we're going to go up your total

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.499 
to do is we're going to go up your total
search<00:01:25.080> bar<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.650> type<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:26.009> sand<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.759> then

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
search bar and type in sand and then

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.520 
search bar and type in sand and then
we're<00:01:27.630> going<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> click<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> magnifying

glass that will filter out all of the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.319 
glass that will filter out all of the
textures<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.320> find<00:01:31.530> us<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.979> let's<00:01:32.880> expand

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
there are a bunch of sand textures but

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.969 
there are a bunch of sand textures but

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
let me just show an example I said make

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.320 
let me just show an example I said make
sure<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.740> say<00:02:07.979> your<00:02:08.129> service<00:02:08.700> type<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.060> sand

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
sure you say your service type to sand

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.930 
sure you say your service type to sand
don't<00:02:09.929> forget<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.410> as<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:11.310> can<00:02:11.430> see<00:02:11.700> our

don't forget that as you can see our

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.530 
don't forget that as you can see our
texture<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.599> still<00:02:12.810> default

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
texture is still default

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.349

dds<00:02:14.640> okay<00:02:15.640> so<00:02:16.629> if<00:02:16.900> we<00:02:17.349> were<00:02:17.709> too<00:02:17.920> good<00:02:18.280> for<00:02:18.579> roll

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
dds okay so if we were too good for roll

a<00:03:03.040> very<00:03:03.370> nice<00:03:03.689> color<00:03:05.310> now<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.370> next<00:03:06.549> way<00:03:06.939> we're

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
a very nice color now the next way we're

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.849 
a very nice color now the next way we're
going<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:07.389> this<00:03:07.599> is<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.900> mud<00:03:08.169> example<00:03:08.680> because

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
going to this is a mud example because

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.390 
going to this is a mud example because
mud<00:03:09.129> is<00:03:09.370> always<00:03:09.730> very<00:03:09.909> difficult<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:11.400> already

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
mud is always very difficult I already

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.179 
mud is always very difficult I already
have<00:03:12.700> everything<00:03:12.819> preset<00:03:13.689> mud<00:03:14.530> with<00:03:15.069> our

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
we're going to get green colored mud

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.259 
we're going to get green colored mud
same<00:03:44.049> thing<00:03:44.260> with<00:03:44.409> the<00:03:44.440> sand<00:03:44.799> right<00:03:45.459> all<00:03:46.150> right

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
get a mud color muds going to be

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.849 
get a mud color muds going to be
something<00:04:04.530> like<00:04:05.530> that<00:04:05.889> I<00:04:06.159> think<00:04:07.859> something

now<00:04:11.440> if<00:04:11.590> we<00:04:11.680> start<00:04:11.950> painting<00:04:12.640> we<00:04:13.300> that's<00:04:14.019> a

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
now if we start painting we that's a

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.539 
now if we start painting we that's a
nice<00:04:14.680> brown<00:04:14.950> color<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:18.160> can<00:04:18.280> start

nice brown color you can start

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.990 
nice brown color you can start
painting<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:19.630> color<00:04:20.139> of<00:04:20.530> mud<00:04:20.949> which<00:04:21.820> you've
