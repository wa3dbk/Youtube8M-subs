00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.319 
hopefully you guys can see the real-time
and<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> lag<00:00:40.649> because<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.789> little<00:00:42.179> bit

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
and the lag because it is a little bit

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.259 
and the lag because it is a little bit
laggy<00:00:42.569> and<00:00:42.870> right<00:00:43.739> now<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.190> see<00:00:44.699> feels<00:00:44.940> kind<00:00:45.210> of

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
laggy and right now I see feels kind of

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.660 
laggy and right now I see feels kind of
like<00:00:45.449> a<00:00:45.539> stop-motion<00:00:45.839> movie<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:47.370> kind<00:00:47.519> of

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
like a stop-motion movie it's kind of

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.059 
like a stop-motion movie it's kind of
amusing<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.179> watch<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.260> really<00:00:49.620> strange

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:50.069 
amusing to watch but it's really strange

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:52.009 
amusing to watch but it's really strange
because<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.429> audio<00:00:50.729> is<00:00:50.879> lagging<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.780> he'll

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
because the audio is lagging so he'll

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.169 
because the audio is lagging so he'll
talk<00:00:52.319> I<00:00:52.559> hear<00:00:52.889> him<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.190> then<00:00:53.309> his<00:00:53.639> face<00:00:53.879> moves

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:54.179 
talk I hear him and then his face moves

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.229 
talk I hear him and then his face moves
so<00:00:54.839> the<00:00:54.870> counterpart<00:00:55.829> or<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.399> evil<00:00:56.940> brother
