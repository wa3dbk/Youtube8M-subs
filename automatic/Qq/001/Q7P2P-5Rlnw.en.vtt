00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.279
 hello dear audience and sincerely 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.410
 Welcome back to the topic of chatter 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.760
 lightning my name is jan gustafsson and 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.279
 I have the responsible task 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.840
 the next opponents not only too 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.820
 defeat so also to explain what 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.419
 I am doing this purpose 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.189
 me hereby in the jazz 24 place where I 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.759
 do not go looking for enemies now 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.980
 will 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.749
 we already have some challenges 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.640
 i think i will be more our friend 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:31.460
 happy to make a mistake 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.860
 For this we have to go here once the board 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.050
 it is over and move me 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.180
 magic continues to look so much on and around men 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.700
 It is very rare to watch TV 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.670
 We hope that happy feet on a train 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.040
 from otherwise denied to Lose 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.280
 must throw ruthlessly 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.760
 happy patzer what are we going to study 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.080
 first his profile picture lgs could 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.080
 of course mean everything 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.369
 I do not know who is here for us 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.560
 rude comments a tip i am 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.280
 It does not like your hands 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.859
 can clearly see 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.380
 unfortunately I have to turn the part happy 

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:14.179
 patzer i had a good feeling though 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.179
 it was not meant to be 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:17.929
 rather than just this video now 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:20.179
 cancel 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.429
 of course, I'll stay with you and snap 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:24.549
 the next opponents are always there for me 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:27.799
 these sessions ready to play 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.799
 Let's see if his train from proven me 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.869
 am very good cheers e4 there is enough 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.399
 of course , defense can take hold 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:39.799
 in my hands as effective as 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.319
 The reporter must be in the hands of Lorenz 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.990
 trend i am not a specialist but i 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.130
 knows one or two things absolute 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.780
 I played again, for example 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.539
 that you do not stop the runners 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.009
 should after h4 sun a quiet 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.289
 create cookies on asia 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.020
 this is the theoretical one turned away 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.869
 after six runners f4 or runner d2 the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.819
 hot trains often talk much earlier 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.340
 not too short days in this way 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.979
 fashion for that time of vaude two runners 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.500
 b4 In any case, it was like that 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.299
 Last time , studied what honestly 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.239
 said to be a few years ago 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.590
 I still think I'm right 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.170
 clear that this was 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.760
 as neat for black thinks 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.349
 she does not do that against schajor, of course 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.340
 only to balance but the full 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.890
 to gain a point 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.200
 which is not easy at world a3 not 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.629
 the main speaker e4 is here in the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.670
 usually tried I suspect almost always 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.799
 will retaliate lady what I 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.209
 stain me and then springer develop 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.190
 you keep on springer after 11 6 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.030
 Let's see what he could spot on 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.739
 four play 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:45.379
 but no he rotates long and I think 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.870
 I'll get the fire on me 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.829
 let and just before your a conflict 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.079
 conjure up 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.209
 that's already played cp i have one 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.959
 few attack points I could over b5 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.079
 think 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.870
 I can think of toma d8 to the 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.530
 construction and defined to take 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.090
 probably because I'm in proven 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.560
 you do not think about anything 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.129
 but just make trains 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.319
 he played springer fi atom hd8 g4 well 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.780
 and consistently played by Herr Schach 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.170
 and as usual I should be slow 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.090
 worry about making my own king 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.549
 I'll try it on cheap tricks 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.540
 rail with springer e5 a double 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.310
 Attack to start 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.090
 rather idiotic moved to that time 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.130
 a little bit about a bit 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.299
 could play better now must 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.340
 I think I'm in chaos here 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:36.170
 crash with springer goes bad 4 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.940
 With it g5 beats but only a little bit 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.560
 optimistic about my chances 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.440
 he could play with it directly or 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.060
 at that time three and after f beats the 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.849
 to incorporate farmers e6 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.540
 but there is still hope for it 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.340
 my thing the farmer f2 hangs and me 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.959
 I do not yet see a direct matte 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.130
 hit first these farmers and then 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.470
 let's see how it goes on 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.090
 the most important component or one 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.419
 the most important in flashing of course is the 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.130
 Clock 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:05.630
 I have two minutes against 129 something 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.269
 small advantage is not yet 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.549
 especially soothing in a minute 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.120
 29 you can do all kinds of harm 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.340
 cause 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.130
 Therefore I try first too 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.169
 material to catch up or a bit 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.389
 No advantage to come in the me 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.220
 These farmers me a club must 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:26.200
 still extremely careful because you 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.200
 king is a bit shaky 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.949
 I try the lady to first time 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.210
 exchange I fear ruler has 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.520
 do not get involved 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.259
 but we look no, he keeps it 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.819
 on the board so that de 7 sees 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.720
 but you have to be tempting 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:44.539
 carries tower f8 chess on the toilet 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.599
 therefore have no reason for the seven 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:51.110
 thomas king 74 creates but first time 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.740
 Keep 37 ball flat and watch what 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.020
 happens 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.759
 probably the next so on the 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.620
 the same trick I've already found 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.900
 again thinking about it d7 just now 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.400
 but first the bay what what 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.960
 always pleasant one is itself 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.800
 I have to think in his place 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.800
 Would a quiet pulled like waterproof 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.039
 made 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:16.039
 Considering King a1 sometime strong 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.539
 homer five also not a bad move and 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.300
 I have one that just does not make 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.460
 so that the six to tour five out of the 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.470
 to go away 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.139
 of course he could now with thomas 7 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.069
 to bother with need what do I do too 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.780
 do not like it 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:31.849
 I play as usual we are bad 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.949
 now that I have provoked it 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.580
 I go back with lady 7 he has no 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:38.479
 I beat five more tournament 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.949
 I am a bit back and forth 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.840
 I got a sound exchange 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.580
 should offer with thoma it would be 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.650
 of course possible way fear that 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.169
 He had quite a lot against players then 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.479
 in the women's final and therefore try 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.330
 first to maintain the tension 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:55.130
 or whatever you could call it 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.250
 to make any moves and thereby 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.169
 to be faster than chess I do 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.930
 Tom Tom pay attention as if I had 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:05.539
 a plan on b2 of course I have in 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.580
 Reality no lady with time 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:09.979
 meet tower I go after 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:14.630
 eight games f6 prepares tom again 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:16.219
 makes before what possibly the b2 ins 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.620
 It could also prevent that from happening 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:22.789
 he therefore made a little chess with tom g2 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.550
 followed by ladies after 87 he plays b 3 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:30.440
 and a 4 logical but the trains one 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:32.000
 king bare something and tom h 2 now 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.600
 I should think slowly 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.490
 how can I progress 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.830
 In this position I have a farmer 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.930
 more and, above all, a very good time 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.030
 So the signs are not bad 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.800
 to me 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.420
 i think tom endgames are right 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.220
 Tempting I play first time goes by 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.690
 front to back to gain space 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:53.370
 playing fast chess on g77 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:56.070
 but now that he no longer cares 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.240
 plays tom c2 his main problem is the 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.840
 time the position is not 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:03.090
 especially good but with 3.1 seconds 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.340
 is it quite difficult? 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.720
 this position tries on the last one 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.870
 push something against the game too 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:13.020
 Organize but only 0.3 seconds 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:16.340
 that will not be enough 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:18.630
 So solid stain ingo call this 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.270
 thanks for the attention and 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:23.280
 maybe until the next video 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:27.440
 You yourself, whoever you are 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.440
 Anonymous spectator unknown to me
