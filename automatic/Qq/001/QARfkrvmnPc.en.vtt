00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.660
 hello to all I'm a blogger 's blog 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.980
 mec fashion.fr in this video I will 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.980
 teach you how to create a dreams catcher 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.340
 to begin I will cover my 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.080
 wooden hoops a ribbon so I'm going 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.150
 still left a small margin for 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.710
 to be able to hang it and I have more than 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.710
 wrap the ribbon all around 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.280
 I cut the excess ribbon 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.810
 made two sides you can leave 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.270
 only one if you want the hooked 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.400
 like that a wall but me I used it 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.020
 to hold auch town hall together 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.830
 now I'm going to weave the web of 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.690
 my catches dreams 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.160
 so it's going to be very, very simple 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.740
 it's always the same gesture 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.740
 repeat we start with a draw 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.210
 blue line manager is the son around 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.710
 my fingers because he'll have to 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.630
 always have that in hand so that's 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.369
 still much easier the gesture 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.409
 will always be the same we go on the 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.770
 hoop we go under and we go 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.770
 in the loop 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.189
 so I paid attention that my 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.630
 spaces be about equal that's 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.460
 still a lot nicer and at the 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.890
 end I made a knot with the little 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.020
 son with whom I had started I 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.020
 start again with a center node 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.480
 while you weave your canvas you 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.840
 can add little pearls while 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.459
 long 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.810
 it's really cute that adds 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.810
 small elements in the canvas 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.270
 and so each time you rewrite a 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.160
 circle to start with one do you 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.160
 do around and you finish by year 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.750
 and to finish what I'm going to do 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.970
 I'm going to add ribbons 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.700
 for an even more ethnic effect and 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.610
 especially colorful we fold them in two 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.849
 loved him down and I'm doing a 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.849
 loop 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.520
 do not hesitate to adjust the length of 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.050
 ribbons do not hesitate also to add 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.670
 why not raffia especially made 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.230
 something that looks like colors 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.790
 of the room in which you are going 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.320
 install your dream catcher 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.240
 I'm going to install it in my room 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.240
 it will serve me to hold my curtains 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.900
