00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.240 

okay<00:00:01.500> here<00:00:01.800> you<00:00:02.010> have<00:00:02.190> the<00:00:02.429> two<00:00:02.850> alternators

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.250 
okay here you have the two alternators

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.700 
okay here you have the two alternators
this<00:00:05.250> is<00:00:05.430> my<00:00:05.580> fourth<00:00:05.940> one<00:00:06.210> this<00:00:07.080> is<00:00:07.259> my<00:00:07.290> first

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
this is my fourth one this is my first

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.589 
this is my fourth one this is my first
one

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 
one

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.080 
one
you<00:00:09.599> see<00:00:09.870> it's<00:00:10.260> pretty<00:00:10.590> much<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.040> same<00:00:11.280> and

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
you see it's pretty much the same and

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.010 
you see it's pretty much the same and
like<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.570> pulley<00:00:12.929> is<00:00:13.790> like<00:00:14.790> almost<00:00:15.179> half<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
like a pulley is like almost half the

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.840 
like a pulley is like almost half the
size<00:00:17.840> that's<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.020> difference<00:00:19.670> but<00:00:20.670> it's

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
size that's the difference but it's

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:30.880 
size that's the difference but it's
pretty<00:00:21.029> much<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.990> same<00:00:22.680> thing<00:00:23.359> on<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> back

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:38.240 

you<00:00:31.890> can<00:00:32.040> see<00:00:34.190> same<00:00:35.270> rectifiers<00:00:37.040> same<00:00:38.040> ole

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
you can see same rectifiers same ole

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:46.340 
you can see same rectifiers same ole
same<00:00:38.280> ole<00:00:38.820> thing<00:00:42.890> same<00:00:43.890> all<00:00:44.180> regular<00:00:45.180> same<00:00:46.079> old

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
same ole thing same all regular same old

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.970 
same ole thing same all regular same old
stuff

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
stuff

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.130 
stuff
I<00:00:47.010> don't<00:00:47.430> see<00:00:47.579> no<00:00:47.760> difference<00:00:47.969> here<00:00:48.420> only<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
I don't see no difference here only the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:58.849 
I don't see no difference here only the
pulley<00:00:51.020> only<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> pretty<00:00:57.680> see<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
pulley only the pretty see the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.969 
pulley only the pretty see the
rectifiers<00:01:01.010> same<00:01:02.010> thing<00:01:03.799> there's<00:01:04.799> no

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
rectifiers same thing there's no

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.679 
rectifiers same thing there's no
difference<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.670> them<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.150> don't<00:01:06.270> know<00:01:06.420> where

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
difference in them I don't know where

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.100 
difference in them I don't know where
we're<00:01:06.840> gonna<00:01:07.020> take<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.580> homonym<00:01:09.090> idioms<00:01:09.510> out<00:01:09.990> of

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
we're gonna take a homonym idioms out of

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.730 
we're gonna take a homonym idioms out of
that<00:01:10.290> thing<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:11.600> don't<00:01:12.600> really<00:01:13.170> know

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:30.030 

Oh

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.070 

pretty<00:01:31.040> much<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.610> same<00:01:31.850> thing<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:32.750> then<00:01:32.930> I'll

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
pretty much the same thing and then I'll

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.620 
pretty much the same thing and then I'll
send<00:01:33.350> it<00:01:33.530> back<00:01:35.500> if<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.770> can<00:01:37.040> be<00:01:37.670> me<00:01:37.970> a<00:01:38.000> custom

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
send it back if it can be me a custom

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:47.340 
send it back if it can be me a custom
one<00:01:39.190> really<00:01:40.810> with<00:01:43.360> those<00:01:44.360> high<00:01:45.200> amperage

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
one really with those high amperage

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.300 
one really with those high amperage
diodes<00:01:49.240> heavy<00:01:50.240> duty<00:01:50.690> values<00:01:51.290> is<00:01:51.860> not<00:01:51.920> gonna

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
diodes heavy duty values is not gonna

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.480 
diodes heavy duty values is not gonna
work<00:01:52.640> for<00:01:53.200> getting<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.530> amperage<00:01:54.979> but<00:01:55.310> they

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
work for getting the amperage but they

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.880 
work for getting the amperage but they
need<00:01:55.700> to
