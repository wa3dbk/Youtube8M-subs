00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:13.009
 Hello everyone in this video I want to tell 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:19.970
 about interchangeability of microcircuits 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:21.510
 flash memories that we use on 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.260
 motherboards 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:31.320
 in laptops in particular in these 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:35.149
 memory chips we have stored bios in 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:40.890
 In general, as a rule, these chips 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:46.410
 interchangeable is important only so that they 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.780
 were of the same type and had the same 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.860
 Memory 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:58.980
 but there are such motherboards 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:02.070
 on which the analog chip does not work 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.330
 and as an example we have here 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:12.869
 such here is the motherboard from 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:18.270
 laptop hp dv5 dash 1040 air board u 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:23.060
 us qt 6 quantum platform and the problem is 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.470
 she just the same is that 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.479
 similar bios chip and that is 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.490
 analog bios chip on this board 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.780
 leads to the fact that we pay 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.900
 cyclically restarted initially with 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.229
 The board was a problem such that the laptop 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.960
 used in car with chinese 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:51.020
 charging and at one moment it just 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:56.100
 I stopped turning on, that is, I dropped out 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:59.270
 Bios native chip not to merge 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:04.680
 ladies just took an analog poured in there 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:07.220
 working firmware working bios soldered and in 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.630
 eventually got cycled perry 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.110
 running 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.190
 fee, that is, we connect the post now 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.710
 we have a card here 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:24.190
 or by completely soldered on the mini and the whole 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:29.350
 connector and see how the board behaves 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:33.370
 with the original memory chip and its 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.910
 analogue means the original 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.310
 the memory here we had mo cronix mx 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:45.370
 25r 8005 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:48.100
 this memory is 1 megabyte and as 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:54.220
 analog will use memory 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:57.340
 winbond 25 kg 80 also for 1 megabyte if 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:04.090
 would it be a cinema be another platform 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:06.540
 Type Kampala from acer laptop and then these 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:14.890
 two memories without problems would work there 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:17.920
 not each rush time is famous for having 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:22.150
 bios firmware and it is desirable to install 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.049
 just such a memory that was such 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.650
 memory type 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.320
 exactly manufacturers type which was 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.630
 installed directly in the factory 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.360
 the manufacturer 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:37.739
 Now we start to ask more precisely 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:42.040
 solder wine bank memory that is 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:44.970
 analog and see how the board behaves 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.970
 with this memory 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.470
 connect post card 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.410
 power up the raft and run 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.930
 we see that we have post code 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.450
 stops at 2nd and board 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.600
 cyclically restarted and so on 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:23.490
 will endlessly turn off with 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:26.419
 power button on the reaction button there 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.280
 turn on the same thing again 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:34.020
 cyclical board reboots 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:38.210
 The picture accordingly does not display well 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:42.240
 now we solder that memory which 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:45.690
 originally stood here remind you that 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.690
 firmware in these chips absolutely 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:54.300
 the same that is, I went to one and the same 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:57.289
 the bios file and the only difference is 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.289
 chip 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:06.830
 so here she is memory which is here 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.830
 It was originally 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.100
 supply power to the board 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.220
 and try to run as we see was the same 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.819
 the code itself 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:45.410
 2nd but passcodes we ran on and 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:45.410
 the board has already given a picture 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:58.680
 turn off turn on our board and now 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:01.220
 There will be a hp and a fee for us 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.220
 starts up 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:18.499
 so here and so sometimes it happens 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:22.869
 on such trifles it would seem, too, sometimes 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:28.059
 need to pay attention as mentioned 

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:31.329
 very often such a disease 

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:35.899
 tax immunity with us 

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:41.659
 motherboards from hp laptop suffer 

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:46.719
 therefore, it is advisable to take during repairs 

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:46.719
 the same memory that was installed 

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:55.179
 I hope the video was interesting and useful 

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:55.179
 Thank you all for your attention.
