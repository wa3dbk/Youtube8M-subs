00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 new people and welcome to give the 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.779
 world we are here on the steelseries 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.309
 stood at gamescom and we have one 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.099
 nice new piece of hardware from 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.020
 steelseries presents this 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.180
 new steelseries siberia elite 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.020
 I need you sometimes beautiful things to the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.350
 explain part 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.100
 at first you look really beautiful in white 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.420
 is his 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.840
 up here we have nice metal 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.059
 headband the proven design for 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.620
 expose it with the head band here 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.149
 above what you already know from v2 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.010
 stay true to what the microphone is 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.989
 of course , extendable but again 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.989
 much thicker and more flexible 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.910
 Now there is no remote control or 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.850
 cable remote more but the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.399
 headset or the microphone can be on 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.340
 and turn it off via this knob 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.649
 here at the side and we'll see 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.750
 up here 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.060
 that I turn the light on and off 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.930
 when activating respectively 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.030
 So we can safely deactivate it 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.549
 that we really are not in 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.900
 teamspeak or skype any 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.380
 say things that we do not want to say 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.600
 what else is there to say about the microphone 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.119
 This microphone can be exchanged 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.350
 who for example for esl 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:28.020
 commentators can get a higher one here 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.009
 connect higher quality microphone 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.290
 that's a great thing 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.020
 on the other side, if we do that 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.360
 retract shortly 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.439
 we find the volume control the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.439
 works the same way 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:49.400
 The light is in 16 8 million 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:51.170
 adjust colors to the headband ultrabook 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.600
 comfortable very very very very very 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.360
 I too soft with my protruding 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.460
 ears and glasses I can do you 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.090
 say that is definitely likely 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.990
 do not hurt that is beautiful 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.300
 it's gonna be a little bit yes here 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.759
 when finally the yes always I know 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.739
 not as it says in German sits 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.180
 ultra good on the head so too with 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.880
 my big ears really none 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.989
 problems 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.760
 then we have a nice one here 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.010
 Ribbon cable that we do not have so much 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.530
 if you have it then someday 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.760
 has to lie somewhere and packed and 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.130
 down here now great new one 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.269
 sound card the 7.1 virtual surround 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.340
 we promise sound for the headset 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.430
 can change the headset to different 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.780
 fashion then for pc for 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.780
 mac and for tablets 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.440
 well that it should have been the first time 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:56.160
 I want to say I think I have everything 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:58.769
 said to the siberia elite yes i would 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.239
 then just go to the next one 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.590
 video to the review, hopefully 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.980
 get my person part 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.010
 put a stop to what's on my skin 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.010
 purely
