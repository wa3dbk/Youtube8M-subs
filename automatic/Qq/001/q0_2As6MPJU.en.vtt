00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.019
 here we are guys with our new one 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.309
 video I haven't been making videos for a while 

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:08.050
 because it was the year for this 

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:09.880
 project that was not very easy 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.250
 give some duct make calculations 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.930
 anyway a bit of evidence 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.119
 to the face of today that I believe to be 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.620
 studied in italy do it or maybe del 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.560
 world because a kind of videos explained 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.750
 very well on this object we have on 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.050
 compressed air piston is the one here 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.640
 that is commanded precisely by a plc e 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.520
 the chips command the m valve that 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.109
 will activate will turn off the air by commanding 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.720
 the internet exit guns this 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:36.160
 project is part of a little bigger than the 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.280
 just talking as well tried to use 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.320
 this one hand pushed robotics 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.149
 but from where it will sound complex when me 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.730
 evaluate your spa expands or 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.850
 systems tightens the piece I must say that 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.160
 it has a good strength banana force then 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.620
 what do you like we have a rod of 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.460
 flat steel that has been drilled with 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.399
 a point of 11.75 with the drill a 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.840
 column is the little one here 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.010
 a graft of the threaded area 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.360
 user on the rod and here we have 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.930
 a life and for the regulation of the end 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.180
 race this instead is the piston that 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.610
 we have this stem like steel and the 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.500
 head which is a small frog that has been from 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.390
 two salting points and then much 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.439
 patience sandpaper is a spring that 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:24.790
 He ran very slow has been adjusted is 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:27.299
 brought to a diameter of 0.6 of 11.6 mm 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.799
 so you have a 15 cents difference 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.780
 very little in one of the ships to too many 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.290
 losses 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.820
 now that I have three holes for fixing 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.159
 of the piston with a seal underneath 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.680
 to avoid losses 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.460
 Now if I can remount sailing so 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.460
 let's try 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.519
 we can check if the school is 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.239
 quite freely I would say right of 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:49.450
 yes now it shows a little how it happens 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.269
 he reassembled as he is now 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.519
 he then reassembled the piston 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.370
 mounted this is our piston 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.690
 chamber up and down the seal the 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.400
 header 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.400
 now I call in the vice 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:09.790
 that's it done now let's connect the air from 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:14.110
 this loot that is weapons comes from 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.760
 compressor we put it up but here at 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.840
 schoolboys really right now I'm a force 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.980
 skin cipe I still believe do the 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.040
 program 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.900
 what this valves of the bad fly 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.700
 when I open we see that it is very much 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.480
 responsive and I must say that still good 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.140
 maybe I'll show you 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.069
 I'm open to pushing it, we're not 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.000
 I have to do a lot of strength 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.440
 not if they didn't seem very strong e 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.579
 also very fast 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.230
 the next step to get it back 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:42.760
 back is between the piston head and 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.859
 the seal put a spring on it 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.380
 it will have to do in harmonic steel that 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:50.079
 when I go on the piston it compresses me 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.670
 when I take off the air, fashion makes me 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.989
 return to the piston position so that 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.120
 the arm is closed me my name is 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.250
 without more framework go there to intervene 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.720
 manually 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.090
 when I finish if I can do the 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.090
 kiss that i think is a project will put a 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.230
 another video with the end of 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.930
 project is the test a test explains 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.609
 you like this project if you have 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.049
 some questions if you want the deal but the 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.209
 drawing as deeper measures than 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.669
 project you tell me I will send it to you 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.489
 always through the copywriter why not 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.460
 I'm the first to invent it 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.260
 nothing like other projects today I don't 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.690
 I know if I had introduced I was doing 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.139
 a bicycle I received the wages 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.410
 federated so now I will have to put 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.599
 rivets to fix the loses on the 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.970
 springs the bicycle in short what 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:43.479
 see but that can close repainted 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.760
 now over and this flying thing is 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.690
 follow it very well I won't show it 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.770
 better in the future when it's over 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.810
 anything 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.560
 for now we'll get it when auction 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.780
 make a capacitor but nothing 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.640
 nothing special about that among us 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.440
 seems to work but is not high 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.270
 capacity and nothing for now we should 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.830
 to be OK 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.010
 when I finish this next project 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.080
 I'll let you know if you want the number 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.560
 write and send you without problems i 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.300
 design the measures with the project 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.500
 maybe I will even be able to tutorial on 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.080
 blows the cyprus program to do the 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.229
 program has misled beautiful at all 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.229
 to the next
