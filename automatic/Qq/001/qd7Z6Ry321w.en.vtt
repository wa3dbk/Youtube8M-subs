experimentation in the past few months
we've<00:02:02.820> made<00:02:03.000> really<00:02:03.210> great<00:02:03.420> progress<00:02:03.770> we've

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
we've made really great progress we've

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.620 
we've made really great progress we've
now<00:02:04.920> gotten<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> star<00:02:05.790> from<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.150> state

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
now gotten it to a star from like state

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.449 
now gotten it to a star from like state
so<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.049> can<00:02:07.170> be<00:02:07.290> formed<00:02:07.619> around<00:02:07.799> any<00:02:08.039> structure

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
so it can be formed around any structure

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.509 
so it can be formed around any structure
and<00:02:08.670> maintains<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.090> thick<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.509> fibrous<00:02:09.869> form

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
and maintains a thick and fibrous form

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.520 
and maintains a thick and fibrous form
we<00:02:11.519> think<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:11.879> project<00:02:12.299> has<00:02:12.599> amazing

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
we think this project has amazing

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.839 
we think this project has amazing
potential<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.220> we'd<00:02:14.310> like<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.549> take<00:02:14.730> it

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
potential and we'd like to take it

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.940 
potential and we'd like to take it
