absolutely 100% Ollie has been bled off

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.519 
absolutely 100% Ollie has been bled off
I've<00:00:17.760> got<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.150> line<00:00:18.660> coming<00:00:18.960> out<00:00:19.140> through<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
I've got a line coming out through the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.050 
I've got a line coming out through the
hole<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.890> tread<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.520> made<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.820> bleed

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
hole in the tread that I made to bleed

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.670 
hole in the tread that I made to bleed
the<00:00:21.210> air<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.600> that's<00:00:22.140> connected<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.590> this

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
the air and that's connected to this

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.420 
the air and that's connected to this
pressure<00:00:22.949> gauge<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:24.150> peaks<00:00:24.480> at<00:00:24.689> 350<00:00:25.320> psi<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.189> I

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
pressure gauge it peaks at 350 psi so I

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.670 
pressure gauge it peaks at 350 psi so I
don't<00:00:27.150> think<00:00:27.330> we'll<00:00:27.420> get<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.630> close<00:00:27.900> but<00:00:28.230> you

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
don't think we'll get that close but you

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.240 
don't think we'll get that close but you
never<00:00:28.800> know

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
never know

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.979

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
oops to step on the camera oh there we

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.370 
oops to step on the camera oh there we
go

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
go

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.580 
go
lost<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.500> gauge<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.810> deed

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.130 

like<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> line<00:01:23.880> had<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> bit<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.390> air<00:01:24.510> in<00:01:24.690> it<00:01:24.750> for

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
like a line had a bit of air in it for

00:01:25.140 --> 00:03:41.440 
like a line had a bit of air in it for
the<00:01:25.200> pressure<00:01:25.440> gauge

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.660 

why<00:03:42.450> outdid<00:03:42.810> go<00:03:42.990> where<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.260> body<00:03:43.470> hole<00:03:43.680> was<00:03:43.920> it

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
why outdid go where the body hole was it

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:55.700 
why outdid go where the body hole was it
was<00:03:44.790> pretty<00:03:44.940> good<00:03:48.920> night<00:03:49.940> 250<00:03:52.280> amazing<00:03:54.710> yeah

was pretty good night 250 amazing yeah
that<00:03:55.860> must<00:03:56.010> have<00:03:56.130> gone<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.310> about<00:03:56.460> 250<00:03:58.910> well<00:03:59.910> I

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
that must have gone to about 250 well I

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.540 
that must have gone to about 250 well I
was<00:04:00.330> not<00:04:00.450> expecting<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:01.440> entire<00:04:01.890> tread

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
was not expecting the entire tread

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.490 
was not expecting the entire tread
assembly<00:04:03.210> to<00:04:03.360> split<00:04:03.660> but<00:04:03.960> that<00:04:04.170> was<00:04:04.290> pretty

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
assembly to split but that was pretty

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.830 
assembly to split but that was pretty
good<00:04:04.740> I<00:04:05.180> was<00:04:06.180> actually<00:04:06.300> expecting<00:04:06.540> the

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
good I was actually expecting the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.550 
good I was actually expecting the
sidewall<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.440> go<00:04:08.720> but<00:04:09.720> now<00:04:09.840> let's<00:04:10.050> split<00:04:10.290> clean

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
sidewall to go but now let's split clean

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.140 
sidewall to go but now let's split clean
through<00:04:10.950> because<00:04:11.280> of<00:04:11.400> where<00:04:11.520> I<00:04:11.550> compromised

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
through because of where I compromised

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.260 
through because of where I compromised
it<00:04:12.390> right<00:04:12.600> about<00:04:12.780> here<00:04:13.490> mind<00:04:14.490> you<00:04:14.670> I<00:04:14.730> tried<00:04:15.060> not

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
it right about here mind you I tried not

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.970 
it right about here mind you I tried not
to<00:04:15.300> break<00:04:15.600> any<00:04:15.840> of<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.019> steel<00:04:16.230> belts<00:04:16.709> but<00:04:16.859> as

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
to break any of the steel belts but as

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.710 
to break any of the steel belts but as
you<00:04:17.100> can<00:04:17.190> see<00:04:17.250> there<00:04:17.609> aren't<00:04:17.760> many<00:04:17.910> offered<00:04:18.359> of

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
you can see there aren't many offered of

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.979 
you can see there aren't many offered of
them<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.230> once<00:04:19.980> you<00:04:20.100> get<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.250> progressive

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
them and once you get a progressive

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.130 
them and once you get a progressive
fracture<00:04:21.989> through<00:04:22.200> it<00:04:22.320> that's<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.620> end<00:04:22.650> of<00:04:22.860> it

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
fracture through it that's the end of it

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.100 
fracture through it that's the end of it
hmm<00:04:25.140> I<00:04:25.380> think<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.460> next<00:04:26.820> one<00:04:26.880> I'm<00:04:27.720> gonna<00:04:27.900> drill

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
hmm I think the next one I'm gonna drill

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.950 
hmm I think the next one I'm gonna drill
and<00:04:28.260> tap<00:04:28.290> a<00:04:28.440> hole<00:04:28.710> in<00:04:28.890> here<00:04:29.750> then<00:04:30.750> I<00:04:30.780> still

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
and tap a hole in here then I still

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.240 
and tap a hole in here then I still
gotta<00:04:31.080> be<00:04:31.110> able<00:04:31.200> to<00:04:31.290> bleed<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.650> area<00:04:31.920> out<00:04:31.980> some

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
gotta be able to bleed the area out some

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.460 
gotta be able to bleed the area out some
here<00:04:32.510> that's<00:04:33.510> a<00:04:33.600> bummer<00:04:35.720> yeah<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:36.960> work<00:04:37.170> out<00:04:37.350> how

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
here that's a bummer yeah I work out how

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.080 
here that's a bummer yeah I work out how
to<00:04:37.500> get<00:04:37.650> all<00:04:37.920> of<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.250> air<00:04:38.370> out<00:04:38.400> again<00:04:38.820> I<00:04:38.910> don't

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
to get all of the air out again I don't

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.490 
to get all of the air out again I don't
want<00:04:39.240> any<00:04:39.360> air<00:04:39.570> in<00:04:39.720> there<00:04:39.960> but<00:04:42.169> yeah<00:04:43.169> I<00:04:43.260> gotta

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
want any air in there but yeah I gotta

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.260 
want any air in there but yeah I gotta
try<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:43.919> bleed<00:04:44.340> it<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.520> hundred<00:04:44.669> percent<00:04:44.790> no

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
try and bleed it a hundred percent no

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.760 
try and bleed it a hundred percent no
there<00:04:45.450> was<00:04:45.570> that's<00:04:45.780> where<00:04:46.020> I<00:04:46.080> made<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.470> hole

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
there was that's where I made the hole

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.400 
there was that's where I made the hole
and<00:04:47.520> you<00:04:47.580> can<00:04:47.700> see<00:04:47.820> that's<00:04:47.910> where<00:04:48.120> the

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
and you can see that's where the

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.330 
and you can see that's where the
fracture<00:04:49.410> progressed<00:04:49.830> from<00:04:51.169> lie<00:04:52.169> up<00:04:52.440> right<00:04:53.220> up

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
fracture progressed from lie up right up

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.540 
fracture progressed from lie up right up
to<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.550> beam<00:04:54.169> it's<00:04:55.169> actually<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:56.340> beads

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
to the beam it's actually the beads

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.320 
to the beam it's actually the beads
actually<00:04:56.730> coming<00:04:57.150> off<00:04:58.730> all<00:04:59.730> the<00:04:59.850> bead<00:05:00.030> wire

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
actually coming off all the bead wire

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.060 
actually coming off all the bead wire
anyway<00:05:00.720> it's<00:05:00.990> not<00:05:01.080> very<00:05:01.290> tight<00:05:01.560> anymore<00:05:01.950> it's

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
anyway it's not very tight anymore it's

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.980 
anyway it's not very tight anymore it's
pretty<00:05:02.340> stretched<00:05:04.280> hmm

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
pretty stretched hmm

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.200 
pretty stretched hmm
but<00:05:06.990> that<00:05:07.260> failure<00:05:07.669> will<00:05:08.669> probably<00:05:09.090> would

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
but that failure will probably would

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.670 
but that failure will probably would
have<00:05:09.300> occurred<00:05:09.540> anyway<00:05:09.960> if<00:05:10.050> this<00:05:10.230> tyre<00:05:10.440> had

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
have occurred anyway if this tyre had

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.950 
have occurred anyway if this tyre had
had<00:05:10.830> a<00:05:10.860> puncture<00:05:11.310> repair<00:05:11.540> but<00:05:12.540> upon

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
had a puncture repair but upon

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.420 
had a puncture repair but upon
inspection<00:05:13.410> I<00:05:13.620> couldn't<00:05:13.860> see<00:05:14.100> any<00:05:14.310> obvious

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
inspection I couldn't see any obvious

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.400 
inspection I couldn't see any obvious
signs<00:05:14.940> of<00:05:15.150> a<00:05:15.240> plug<00:05:15.510> or<00:05:15.660> anything<00:05:15.870> like<00:05:16.110> that<00:05:16.169> so

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
signs of a plug or anything like that so

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.740 
signs of a plug or anything like that so
I'd<00:05:17.370> say<00:05:17.640> this<00:05:17.760> had<00:05:17.940> never<00:05:18.060> had<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.300> puncture

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
I'd say this had never had a puncture

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.240 
I'd say this had never had a puncture
until<00:05:19.050> now<00:05:19.260> and<00:05:19.530> that<00:05:19.590> was<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:19.890> point<00:05:20.130> of

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
until now and that was the point of

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.920 
until now and that was the point of
failure<00:05:20.460> so<00:05:21.440> yeah<00:05:22.490> interesting<00:05:23.840> where's<00:05:24.840> my

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
failure so yeah interesting where's my

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.430 
failure so yeah interesting where's my
pressure<00:05:25.140> gauge<00:05:25.350> line<00:05:28.490> there<00:05:29.490> is<00:05:30.410> like<00:05:31.410> a

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
pressure gauge line there is like a

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.390 
pressure gauge line there is like a
charm<00:05:32.720> there's<00:05:33.720> pink<00:05:34.320> dye<00:05:34.590> coming<00:05:34.950> out<00:05:35.190> of<00:05:35.310> it

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
charm there's pink dye coming out of it

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.230 
charm there's pink dye coming out of it
because<00:05:35.520> that<00:05:35.760> was<00:05:35.850> in<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.530> gauge<00:05:37.530> set<00:05:38.240> it's

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
because that was in the gauge set it's

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.140 
because that was in the gauge set it's
ejected<00:05:39.890> all<00:05:40.890> the<00:05:41.160> oily<00:05:41.490> crap<00:05:41.729> that<00:05:41.940> was<00:05:42.030> in

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
ejected all the oily crap that was in

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.900 
ejected all the oily crap that was in
the<00:05:42.320> capillary<00:05:43.320> lines<00:05:43.590> along<00:05:44.520> with<00:05:44.669> some<00:05:44.820> of

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
the capillary lines along with some of

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.340 
the capillary lines along with some of
the<00:05:45.000> dye<00:05:45.180> that<00:05:45.450> was<00:05:45.570> in<00:05:45.690> the<00:05:45.780> gauges<00:05:46.140> that<00:05:46.229> I'm

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
the dye that was in the gauges that I'm

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.730 
the dye that was in the gauges that I'm
using<00:05:48.020> impressive

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
using impressive

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.320 
using impressive
a<00:05:51.470> chain<00:05:52.470> did<00:05:52.680> its<00:05:52.800> job<00:05:52.889> not<00:05:53.819> but<00:05:53.940> it<00:05:54.030> went<00:05:54.180> very

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
a chain did its job not but it went very

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.900 
a chain did its job not but it went very
far

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
far

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.860 
far
yeah<00:05:57.620> well<00:05:58.620> that's<00:05:59.160> test<00:05:59.490> version<00:06:00.000> 1.0

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
yeah well that's test version 1.0

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.930 
yeah well that's test version 1.0
complete<00:06:01.560> failure<00:06:02.009> of<00:06:02.130> the<00:06:02.250> tread<00:06:02.430> assembly

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
complete failure of the tread assembly

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.129 
complete failure of the tread assembly
due<00:06:03.599> to<00:06:03.840> the<00:06:04.590> puncture<00:06:05.009> but<00:06:05.990> that<00:06:06.990> was<00:06:07.110> a

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
due to the puncture but that was a

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:08.870 
due to the puncture but that was a
pretty<00:06:07.319> high<00:06:07.500> pressure<00:06:07.860> though<00:06:08.069> that<00:06:08.280> was<00:06:08.370> 200

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
pretty high pressure though that was 200

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.210 
pretty high pressure though that was 200
pounds<00:06:09.210> or<00:06:09.300> so<00:06:09.560> I'll<00:06:10.560> have<00:06:10.710> to<00:06:10.830> review<00:06:10.979> the

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
pounds or so I'll have to review the

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.710 
pounds or so I'll have to review the
footage<00:06:11.400> I<00:06:11.639> was<00:06:11.699> standing<00:06:12.120> further<00:06:12.300> back<00:06:12.569> in

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
footage I was standing further back in

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.800 
footage I was standing further back in
the<00:06:12.750> garage<00:06:13.080> doorway<00:06:13.830> and<00:06:14.210> water<00:06:15.210> still<00:06:15.509> shot

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
the garage doorway and water still shot

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.610 
the garage doorway and water still shot
out<00:06:15.960> and<00:06:16.169> hit<00:06:16.289> me<00:06:16.530> and<00:06:16.860> hit<00:06:17.430> the<00:06:18.050> Jaguar<00:06:19.050> engine

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
out and hit me and hit the Jaguar engine

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.210 
out and hit me and hit the Jaguar engine
right<00:06:20.280> over<00:06:20.669> than<00:06:20.849> in<00:06:21.030> the<00:06:21.090> back<00:06:21.240> of<00:06:21.360> the<00:06:21.449> shed

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
right over than in the back of the shed

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.020 
right over than in the back of the shed
it<00:06:23.220> was<00:06:23.340> pretty<00:06:23.490> good

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
it was pretty good

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.270 
it was pretty good
mind<00:06:24.900> you<00:06:25.020> it<00:06:25.110> wasn't<00:06:25.229> fast<00:06:25.770> water<00:06:26.099> I<00:06:26.220> mean

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
mind you it wasn't fast water I mean

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.460 
mind you it wasn't fast water I mean
that<00:06:27.270> would<00:06:27.389> have<00:06:27.509> got<00:06:27.599> knocked<00:06:27.810> over<00:06:28.199> if<00:06:28.319> it

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
that would have got knocked over if it

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.589 
that would have got knocked over if it
was<00:06:28.590> pretty<00:06:28.860> heavy-duty<00:06:29.520> water<00:06:30.030> pressure<00:06:30.330> but

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
was pretty heavy-duty water pressure but

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:34.129 
was pretty heavy-duty water pressure but
there's<00:06:31.560> just<00:06:31.650> a<00:06:31.770> bit<00:06:31.860> of<00:06:31.949> a<00:06:31.979> spray<00:06:33.110> there's<00:06:34.110> a

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
there's just a bit of a spray there's a

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.409 
there's just a bit of a spray there's a
bit<00:06:34.289> out<00:06:34.440> here<00:06:35.120> mmm

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
bit out here mmm

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:41.140 
bit out here mmm
I<00:06:36.919> found<00:06:37.919> a<00:06:37.979> bit<00:06:38.130> up<00:06:38.250> here<00:06:38.280> on<00:06:38.729> the<00:06:38.849> bench

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
I found a bit up here on the bench

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.089 
I found a bit up here on the bench
there's<00:06:42.150> droplets<00:06:42.599> down<00:06:42.840> to<00:06:43.199> the<00:06:43.590> back<00:06:43.740> of<00:06:43.979> the

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:44.099 
there's droplets down to the back of the

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:46.790 
there's droplets down to the back of the
Jag<00:06:44.340> engine<00:06:44.759> I<00:06:45.020> can<00:06:46.020> see<00:06:46.199> water<00:06:46.470> on<00:06:46.590> that

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
Jag engine I can see water on that

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.040 
Jag engine I can see water on that
little<00:06:46.949> vent<00:06:47.250> there<00:06:47.490> so<00:06:48.419> the<00:06:48.659> water<00:06:48.810> does

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
little vent there so the water does

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.809 
little vent there so the water does
travel<00:06:49.440> very<00:06:49.650> far<00:06:49.979> but<00:06:50.220> just<00:06:50.340> like<00:06:50.460> a<00:06:50.490> gurney

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 
travel very far but just like a gurney

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:53.149 
travel very far but just like a gurney
once<00:06:51.120> you<00:06:51.240> get<00:06:51.389> past<00:06:51.900> a<00:06:52.080> certain<00:06:52.289> range<00:06:52.710> it's

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:53.159 
once you get past a certain range it's

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:56.360 
once you get past a certain range it's
completely<00:06:53.699> harmless<00:06:54.770> I<00:06:55.770> know<00:06:56.130> there<00:06:56.280> were

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
completely harmless I know there were

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.760 
completely harmless I know there were
fears<00:06:56.580> from<00:06:56.880> somebody<00:06:57.270> of<00:06:57.419> a<00:06:57.659> knife<00:06:58.110> like<00:06:58.440> jet

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
fears from somebody of a knife like jet

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.110 
fears from somebody of a knife like jet
of<00:06:58.889> water<00:06:58.919> coming<00:06:59.370> out<00:06:59.550> and<00:06:59.669> cutting<00:06:59.969> me<00:07:00.090> in

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
of water coming out and cutting me in

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.240 
of water coming out and cutting me in
half<00:07:00.419> but<00:07:00.810> I'm<00:07:01.409> not<00:07:01.740> running<00:07:02.009> several

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.250 
half but I'm not running several

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.300 
half but I'm not running several
thousand<00:07:02.909> psi<00:07:03.389> into<00:07:03.599> it<00:07:03.860> that<00:07:04.860> was<00:07:05.009> only<00:07:05.159> two

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310
