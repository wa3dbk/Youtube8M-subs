any<00:00:46.110> interest<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.829> I'll<00:00:46.980> go<00:00:47.100> more<00:00:47.309> into

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
any interest in this I'll go more into

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.600 
any interest in this I'll go more into
depth<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.320> but<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:49.350> now<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:50.039> wanted<00:00:50.430> to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
depth in it but for now I just wanted to

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.000 
depth in it but for now I just wanted to
show<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.879> what<00:00:51.210> I've<00:00:51.360> done<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.010> schematic

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
show you what I've done and schematic

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.170 
show you what I've done and schematic
I'm<00:00:53.160> using<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:53.910> here<00:00:54.770> but<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.910> wanted

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
I'm using I have here but I just wanted

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.349 
I'm using I have here but I just wanted
to<00:00:57.300> show<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> few<00:00:57.840> things<00:00:58.289> here<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.129> basically

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
to show a few things here so basically

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.510 
to show a few things here so basically
you<00:01:00.359> got<00:01:00.510> your<00:01:00.719> little<00:01:00.870> dial<00:01:01.170> here<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:02.309> more

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
you got your little dial here the more

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.070 
you got your little dial here the more
amps<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.000> run<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:04.229> hotter<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.850> obviously

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
amps you run the hotter it is obviously

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.510 
amps you run the hotter it is obviously
one<00:01:07.080> fault<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.740> I'm<00:01:07.920> gonna<00:01:08.070> see<00:01:08.250> right

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
one fault with this I'm gonna see right

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.700 
one fault with this I'm gonna see right
now<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.150> got<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> dropout<00:01:09.900> current<00:01:10.380> out<00:01:10.500> of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
now is it's got a dropout current out of

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.039 
now is it's got a dropout current out of
about<00:01:11.070> one<00:01:11.369> amp<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:11.970> below<00:01:12.450> one<00:01:12.659> amp<00:01:12.900> it

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
about one amp so below one amp it

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.710 
about one amp so below one amp it
completely<00:01:13.560> shuts<00:01:13.590> off<00:01:14.070> itself<00:01:14.689> when<00:01:15.689> you

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
completely shuts off itself when you

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.060 
completely shuts off itself when you
turn<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.350> back<00:01:16.380> up<00:01:17.299> it's<00:01:18.299> not<00:01:18.720> gonna<00:01:19.110> fire<00:01:19.740> up

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
turn it back up it's not gonna fire up

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.039 
turn it back up it's not gonna fire up
when<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.670> does<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.090> gonna<00:01:21.210> jump<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.900> like

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
when it does it's gonna jump to like

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.810 
when it does it's gonna jump to like
five<00:01:22.439> amps<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.100> you're<00:01:23.189> gonna<00:01:23.310> want<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.670> turn

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
five amps and you're gonna want to turn

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.109 
five amps and you're gonna want to turn
it<00:01:24.000> down<00:01:24.090> right<00:01:24.150> away<00:01:25.310> as<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.729> see<00:01:26.909> when

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
it down right away as you can see when

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.109 
it down right away as you can see when
I'm<00:01:27.240> slowly<00:01:27.630> bringing<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.140> up<00:01:28.290> here<00:01:28.530> jumps<00:01:29.490> and

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
I'm slowly bringing it up here jumps and

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.219 
I'm slowly bringing it up here jumps and
you're<00:01:30.390> gonna<00:01:30.479> want<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.810> bring<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.049> back<00:01:31.170> down

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
you're gonna want to bring it back down

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.289 
you're gonna want to bring it back down
to<00:01:31.680> where<00:01:31.799> ever<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.070> want<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.310> set<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.640> so

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
to where ever you want to set it so

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.760 
to where ever you want to set it so
that's<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.810> warning<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.380> any<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.560> you

guys that want to make this this is
probably<00:01:38.369> because<00:01:38.820> I'm<00:01:39.000> using<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.540> 16<00:01:40.380> amp

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
probably because I'm using a 16 amp

rated triac if you doubled up a few five

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.389 
rated triac if you doubled up a few five
amp<00:01:44.369> or<00:01:44.610> three<00:01:44.970> amp<00:01:45.119> rated<00:01:45.509> tracks<00:01:46.159> you<00:01:47.159> would

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
amp or three amp rated tracks you would

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.010 
amp or three amp rated tracks you would
have<00:01:47.700> better<00:01:47.939> results<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.659> wanted<00:01:48.869> this

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
have better results but I wanted this

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.929 
have better results but I wanted this
thing<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.409> durable<00:01:49.740> lasts<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.369> long<00:01:50.460> time<00:01:50.759> be

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
thing to be durable lasts a long time be

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.620 
thing to be durable lasts a long time be
able<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.149> run<00:01:51.950> cool<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.670> hot<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:55.640> basically<00:01:56.640> if

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
able to run cool not hot so basically if

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.209 
able to run cool not hot so basically if
you've<00:01:57.899> seen<00:01:58.140> my<00:01:58.290> other<00:01:58.320> videos<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.979> know<00:01:59.100> how

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
you've seen my other videos you know how

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.179 
you've seen my other videos you know how
to<00:01:59.280> make<00:01:59.460> these<00:01:59.640> heating<00:02:00.030> Mantle's<00:02:01.130> so<00:02:02.130> you

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
to make these heating Mantle's so you

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.429 
to make these heating Mantle's so you
build<00:02:02.460> yourself<00:02:02.759> eating<00:02:02.969> metal<00:02:03.439> find

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
build yourself eating metal find

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.069 
build yourself eating metal find
yourself<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.860> box<00:02:05.100> now<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.790> know<00:02:06.060> most<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.020> you

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
yourself a box now I know most of you

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.589 
yourself a box now I know most of you
some<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.920> don't<00:02:08.910> have<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> lot<00:02:09.569> of

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
some of you don't have a lot of

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.290 
some of you don't have a lot of
electrical<00:02:10.080> experience<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.819> can<00:02:12.060> tell<00:02:12.239> you

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
electrical experience but I can tell you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.170 
electrical experience but I can tell you
right<00:02:12.420> now<00:02:12.599> this<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.840> one

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
right now this is one

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.399 
right now this is one
the<00:02:13.329> easiest<00:02:13.930> electrical<00:02:14.709> projects<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:17.200> you

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
the easiest electrical projects that you

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.190 
the easiest electrical projects that you
could<00:02:17.620> do<00:02:17.799> yourself<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:19.090> does<00:02:19.390> deal<00:02:19.750> with<00:02:19.780> line

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
could do yourself it does deal with line

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.410 
could do yourself it does deal with line
voltage<00:02:20.860> those<00:02:21.159> you<00:02:21.400> have<00:02:21.579> to<00:02:21.760> be<00:02:21.909> careful

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
voltage those you have to be careful

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.440 
voltage those you have to be careful
these<00:02:22.959> terminals<00:02:23.590> are<00:02:23.739> live<00:02:23.980> with<00:02:24.340> 120<00:02:25.120> volts

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
these terminals are live with 120 volts

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.699 
these terminals are live with 120 volts
right<00:02:25.659> now<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:26.019> don't<00:02:26.200> want<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.409> touch<00:02:26.530> them

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
right now you don't want to touch them

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.649 
right now you don't want to touch them
you're<00:02:26.950> gonna<00:02:27.040> get<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.280> shock<00:02:27.549> all<00:02:28.329> things

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
you're gonna get a shock all things

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.679 
you're gonna get a shock all things
grounded<00:02:29.200> though<00:02:29.319> for<00:02:29.590> safety<00:02:30.480> it's<00:02:31.480> been

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:31.689 
grounded though for safety it's been

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.530 
grounded though for safety it's been
running<00:02:32.079> about<00:02:32.620> 20<00:02:33.400> minutes<00:02:33.819> now<00:02:34.000> it's<00:02:34.269> just

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
running about 20 minutes now it's just

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.229 
running about 20 minutes now it's just
getting<00:02:34.750> slightly<00:02:35.170> one<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.730> yeah<00:02:39.909> so<00:02:40.150> I'm

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
getting slightly one but yeah so I'm

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.339 
getting slightly one but yeah so I'm
gonna<00:02:40.359> go<00:02:40.540> over<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.750> schematic<00:02:41.290> here<00:02:43.349> don't

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
gonna go over the schematic here don't

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.539 
gonna go over the schematic here don't
panic<00:02:44.409> if<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:45.040> don't<00:02:45.190> know<00:02:45.280> what<00:02:45.400> you're

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
panic if you don't know what you're

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.449 
panic if you don't know what you're
looking<00:02:45.639> at<00:02:45.909> I'm<00:02:46.090> gonna<00:02:46.180> explain<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:47.459> so

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
looking at I'm gonna explain it so

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.830 
looking at I'm gonna explain it so
basically<00:02:48.849> what<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.150> have<00:02:49.299> if<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.629> know

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
basically what you have if you know

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.920 
basically what you have if you know
anything<00:02:50.139> about<00:02:50.970> alternating<00:02:51.970> current<00:02:52.329> which

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
anything about alternating current which

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.860 
anything about alternating current which
if<00:02:53.379> you<00:02:53.680> don't<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:54.310> recommend<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.209> stop<00:02:55.540> right

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
if you don't I recommend you stop right

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.160 
if you don't I recommend you stop right
now<00:02:55.900> because<00:02:57.030> there's<00:02:58.030> probably<00:02:58.569> not<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.900> hope

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
now because there's probably not a hope

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.470 
now because there's probably not a hope
in<00:02:59.349> hell<00:02:59.409> for<00:02:59.829> you<00:02:59.920> no<00:03:00.700> offense<00:03:01.030> but<00:03:01.329> you

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
in hell for you no offense but you

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.559 
in hell for you no offense but you
should<00:03:01.659> start<00:03:02.109> with<00:03:02.349> some<00:03:02.620> smaller

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
should start with some smaller

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.000 
should start with some smaller
electrical<00:03:04.569> projects<00:03:05.049> before<00:03:05.290> going<00:03:05.769> on<00:03:05.980> to

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
electrical projects before going on to

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.589 
electrical projects before going on to
something<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.459> deals<00:03:06.760> with<00:03:06.879> line<00:03:07.150> voltage

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
something that deals with line voltage

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.929 
something that deals with line voltage
this<00:03:07.930> stuff<00:03:08.170> can<00:03:08.409> kill<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.859> you<00:03:09.549> have<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.819> be

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939 
this stuff can kill you you have to be

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.020 
this stuff can kill you you have to be
very<00:03:10.659> careful<00:03:11.079> with<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.760> basically<00:03:12.760> so<00:03:12.909> with

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
very careful with it basically so with

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.300 
very careful with it basically so with
this<00:03:13.180> circuit<00:03:13.599> here<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:14.560> got<00:03:14.739> your<00:03:14.980> black

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
this circuit here you got your black

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.210 
this circuit here you got your black
wire<00:03:15.609> or<00:03:15.849> your<00:03:16.030> line<00:03:16.299> comes<00:03:17.049> in<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:17.739> right<00:03:18.010> away

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
wire or your line comes in it right away

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.129 
wire or your line comes in it right away
it<00:03:18.310> goes<00:03:18.430> through<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.760> 10<00:03:19.000> amp<00:03:19.209> fuse<00:03:19.269> for<00:03:19.750> safety

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
it goes through a 10 amp fuse for safety

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.280 
it goes through a 10 amp fuse for safety
and<00:03:20.949> this<00:03:21.160> one<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.579> fuse<00:03:21.910> is<00:03:22.449> in<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.079> back

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
and this one the fuse is in the back

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.610 
and this one the fuse is in the back
here<00:03:25.889> so<00:03:27.299> basically<00:03:28.299> any<00:03:28.690> schematic<00:03:29.409> is

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
here so basically any schematic is

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.740 
here so basically any schematic is
point-to-point<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.730> just<00:03:30.970> connect<00:03:31.389> the

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
point-to-point you just connect the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.809 
point-to-point you just connect the
pieces<00:03:32.169> point<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.829> point<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.400> point<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.790> point

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
pieces point to point to point to point

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.710 
pieces point to point to point to point
and<00:03:34.269> follow<00:03:35.109> it<00:03:35.349> over<00:03:35.620> with<00:03:35.799> a<00:03:36.690> with<00:03:37.690> a

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
and follow it over with a with a

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.809 
and follow it over with a with a
highlighter<00:03:38.109> to<00:03:38.319> make<00:03:38.470> sure<00:03:38.680> you<00:03:38.889> know<00:03:39.639> what

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
highlighter to make sure you know what

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:40.470 
highlighter to make sure you know what
you've<00:03:39.970> already<00:03:40.150> done

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
you've already done

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.530 
you've already done
and<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:41.049> don't<00:03:41.230> do<00:03:41.379> it<00:03:41.500> twice<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:42.699> you<00:03:43.359> don't

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
and you don't do it twice and you don't

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.509 
and you don't do it twice and you don't
miss<00:03:43.720> anything<00:03:44.109> and<00:03:44.530> then<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:45.129> know<00:03:45.280> you<00:03:45.340> got

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
miss anything and then you know you got

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.879 
miss anything and then you know you got
the<00:03:45.639> whole<00:03:45.760> circuit<00:03:46.090> bulb<00:03:46.319> but<00:03:47.319> anyways<00:03:47.650> so

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
the whole circuit bulb but anyways so

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.680 
the whole circuit bulb but anyways so
you<00:03:48.370> got<00:03:48.489> your<00:03:48.609> black<00:03:48.760> wire<00:03:49.030> comes<00:03:49.269> in<00:03:49.479> goes

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
you got your black wire comes in goes

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.180 
you got your black wire comes in goes
through<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:49.930> fuse<00:03:50.139> goes<00:03:50.379> through<00:03:50.590> switch<00:03:50.889> and

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
through a fuse goes through switch and

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.059 
through a fuse goes through switch and
goes<00:03:51.340> through<00:03:51.699> the<00:03:51.790> amp<00:03:52.090> meter<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:53.620> that's

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
goes through the amp meter so that's

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.770 
goes through the amp meter so that's
basically<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.760> black<00:03:54.940> wire<00:03:55.150> comes<00:03:55.419> in<00:03:55.599> goes

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
basically the black wire comes in goes

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.869 
basically the black wire comes in goes
through<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.109> switch<00:03:56.349> goes<00:03:57.250> through<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.579> fuse

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
through the switch goes through the fuse

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.270 
through the switch goes through the fuse
and<00:03:58.150> then<00:03:58.479> through<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.810> amp<00:03:58.959> meter<00:03:59.159> from<00:04:00.159> the

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
and then through the amp meter from the

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.030 
and then through the amp meter from the
other<00:04:00.489> side<00:04:00.879> of<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.090> amp<00:04:01.269> meter<00:04:01.949> according<00:04:02.949> to

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
other side of the amp meter according to

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.740 
other side of the amp meter according to
this<00:04:03.129> circuit<00:04:03.519> here<00:04:03.699> it<00:04:03.970> goes<00:04:04.150> right<00:04:04.359> to<00:04:04.419> one

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
this circuit here it goes right to one

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.330 
this circuit here it goes right to one
side<00:04:05.049> of<00:04:05.199> the<00:04:05.260> heating<00:04:05.530> mantle<00:04:05.650> so<00:04:06.099> it<00:04:06.190> goes

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
side of the heating mantle so it goes

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.009 
side of the heating mantle so it goes
directly<00:04:06.729> to<00:04:06.940> one<00:04:07.090> of<00:04:07.120> these<00:04:07.299> prongs<00:04:07.720> right

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
directly to one of these prongs right

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:08.990 
directly to one of these prongs right
here

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
here

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.849 
here
from<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.209> saw<00:04:10.840> then<00:04:11.079> it<00:04:11.229> goes<00:04:11.409> through<00:04:11.709> this

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
from the saw then it goes through this

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.219 
from the saw then it goes through this
wire<00:04:12.209> around<00:04:13.209> through<00:04:13.479> the<00:04:13.599> eating<00:04:13.870> mantle

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:14.229 
wire around through the eating mantle

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.279 
wire around through the eating mantle
and<00:04:14.409> then<00:04:14.530> comes<00:04:14.739> back<00:04:14.859> to<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.310> other<00:04:15.459> product

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
and then comes back to the other product

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.569 
and then comes back to the other product
from<00:04:17.289> the<00:04:17.409> other<00:04:17.530> problem<00:04:17.949> forget<00:04:18.459> this

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
from the other problem forget this

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.430 
from the other problem forget this
voltmeter<00:04:19.090> here<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.479> don't<00:04:19.599> need<00:04:19.870> it<00:04:20.079> if<00:04:20.289> you

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
voltmeter here you don't need it if you

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.779 
voltmeter here you don't need it if you
don't<00:04:20.590> want<00:04:20.769> it<00:04:20.889> but<00:04:21.070> from<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.370> other<00:04:21.519> prong

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
don't want it but from the other prong

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.760 
don't want it but from the other prong
it<00:04:22.029> basically<00:04:22.479> goes<00:04:22.750> into<00:04:22.779> a<00:04:23.110> circuit<00:04:23.590> like

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
it basically goes into a circuit like

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.240 
it basically goes into a circuit like
this<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:24.310> you<00:04:24.550> just<00:04:24.580> connect<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.210> points

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
this and you just connect the points

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.700 
this and you just connect the points
really<00:04:26.640> there's<00:04:26.850> only<00:04:27.030> five<00:04:27.900> parts<00:04:28.350> that<00:04:28.590> you

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
really there's only five parts that you

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.360 
really there's only five parts that you
need<00:04:28.740> for<00:04:29.100> this<00:04:29.250> circuit<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:31.710> can<00:04:31.920> do<00:04:32.160> it<00:04:32.250> on<00:04:32.340> a

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
need for this circuit you can do it on a

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.190 
need for this circuit you can do it on a
breadboard<00:04:32.670> if<00:04:33.000> you<00:04:33.090> wanted<00:04:33.390> to<00:04:33.570> I<00:04:33.600> did<00:04:33.960> it<00:04:34.080> on

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
breadboard if you wanted to I did it on

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.890 
breadboard if you wanted to I did it on
a<00:04:34.230> breadboard<00:04:35.150> it's<00:04:36.150> probably<00:04:36.480> easier<00:04:36.840> for

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
a breadboard it's probably easier for

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.020 
a breadboard it's probably easier for
you<00:04:37.230> to<00:04:37.290> do<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:37.830> just<00:04:38.040> point-to-point<00:04:38.670> with

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
you to do it just point-to-point with

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.950 
you to do it just point-to-point with
wiring<00:04:39.680> but<00:04:41.060> basically<00:04:42.060> you<00:04:42.270> got<00:04:42.420> a<00:04:42.450> triac

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
wiring but basically you got a triac

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.380 
wiring but basically you got a triac
which<00:04:43.590> is<00:04:43.860> an<00:04:44.220> alternating<00:04:45.150> current<00:04:45.770> switch

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
which is an alternating current switch

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.610 
which is an alternating current switch
basically<00:04:48.390> I'm<00:04:48.690> not<00:04:48.930> gonna<00:04:49.080> go<00:04:49.230> into<00:04:49.350> depth

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
basically I'm not gonna go into depth

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.300 
basically I'm not gonna go into depth
this<00:04:49.860> is<00:04:49.920> an<00:04:50.250> electrical<00:04:51.560> tutorial<00:04:52.560> this<00:04:52.740> is<00:04:52.800> a

for<00:04:56.490> this<00:04:56.640> thing<00:04:57.170> but<00:04:58.170> anyway<00:04:58.440> so<00:04:58.500> you<00:04:58.650> got<00:04:58.770> a

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
for this thing but anyway so you got a

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.830 
for this thing but anyway so you got a
triac<00:04:59.250> which<00:04:59.490> kind<00:04:59.820> of<00:04:59.880> looks<00:05:00.030> like<00:05:00.120> this<00:05:00.480> and

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
triac which kind of looks like this and

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.830 
triac which kind of looks like this and
you<00:05:01.830> got<00:05:02.010> your<00:05:02.310> pins<00:05:02.640> one<00:05:03.030> two<00:05:03.270> and<00:05:03.480> three<00:05:03.720> if

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
you got your pins one two and three if

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.180 
you got your pins one two and three if

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
off the other side of the Dayak there's

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.000 
off the other side of the Dayak there's
uh<00:05:37.530> this<00:05:38.220> is<00:05:38.430> a<00:05:39.020> 0.1<00:05:40.020> micro<00:05:40.560> farad<00:05:40.979> capacitor

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
uh this is a 0.1 micro farad capacitor

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.010 
uh this is a 0.1 micro farad capacitor
and<00:05:42.229> it<00:05:43.229> goes<00:05:43.440> to<00:05:43.620> the<00:05:43.740> neutral<00:05:44.160> a<00:05:44.510> one<00:05:45.510> of<00:05:45.810> the

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
and it goes to the neutral a one of the

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.310 
and it goes to the neutral a one of the
triac<00:05:46.410> goes<00:05:46.740> to<00:05:46.919> neutral<00:05:47.400> a<00:05:47.580> two<00:05:48.240> of<00:05:48.810> the<00:05:48.960> triac

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
triac goes to neutral a two of the triac

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.000 
triac goes to neutral a two of the triac
goes<00:05:49.620> to<00:05:49.860> line<00:05:50.100> and<00:05:51.229> that's<00:05:52.229> pretty<00:05:52.710> much<00:05:52.830> it

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
goes to line and that's pretty much it

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.670 
goes to line and that's pretty much it
it's<00:05:53.370> it's<00:05:53.850> really<00:05:54.390> straightforward<00:05:54.690> like<00:05:55.560> I

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
it's it's really straightforward like I

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.409 
it's it's really straightforward like I
said<00:05:55.890> this<00:05:56.070> is<00:05:56.250> one<00:05:56.430> of<00:05:56.460> the<00:05:56.610> easiest<00:05:56.940> circuits

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
said this is one of the easiest circuits

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.340 
said this is one of the easiest circuits
you<00:05:57.540> can<00:05:57.720> do<00:05:58.040> like<00:05:59.040> I<00:05:59.190> said<00:05:59.960> forget<00:06:00.960> this<00:06:01.110> off

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
you can do like I said forget this off

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.170 
you can do like I said forget this off
you<00:06:01.500> don't<00:06:01.680> need<00:06:01.860> these<00:06:02.040> parts<00:06:02.400> here<00:06:02.640> this<00:06:03.030> is

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
you don't need these parts here this is

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.510 
you don't need these parts here this is
optional<00:06:03.780> if<00:06:03.990> you<00:06:04.080> want<00:06:04.380> to<00:06:04.500> run<00:06:04.710> this<00:06:04.919> if<00:06:05.400> you

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
optional if you want to run this if you

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.210 
optional if you want to run this if you
want<00:06:05.700> to<00:06:05.760> use<00:06:05.850> this<00:06:06.030> to<00:06:06.210> run<00:06:06.390> an<00:06:06.540> AC<00:06:06.840> motor<00:06:07.220> like

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
want to use this to run an AC motor like

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.620 
want to use this to run an AC motor like
with<00:06:08.400> a<00:06:08.430> brushed<00:06:09.150> AC<00:06:09.419> motor<00:06:11.360> you<00:06:12.360> would<00:06:12.510> have

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
with a brushed AC motor you would have

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.810 
with a brushed AC motor you would have
to<00:06:12.750> add<00:06:12.870> this<00:06:13.169> so<00:06:13.650> it<00:06:13.740> would<00:06:13.830> be<00:06:13.979> another<00:06:14.220> 100

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
to add this so it would be another 100

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.150 
to add this so it would be another 100
ohm<00:06:14.970> resistor<00:06:15.510> 5<00:06:15.930> watt<00:06:16.200> rated<00:06:16.650> and<00:06:16.830> another

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
ohm resistor 5 watt rated and another

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.969 
ohm resistor 5 watt rated and another
0.1<00:06:17.910> like<00:06:18.120> a<00:06:18.150> farad<00:06:18.510> capacitor<00:06:19.080> and<00:06:19.260> that

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
0.1 like a farad capacitor and that

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.770 
0.1 like a farad capacitor and that
would<00:06:20.310> make<00:06:20.460> this<00:06:20.729> circuit<00:06:21.120> work<00:06:21.270> for<00:06:21.540> a<00:06:21.570> motor

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
would make this circuit work for a motor

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.930 
would make this circuit work for a motor
if<00:06:22.110> you<00:06:22.800> tried<00:06:23.040> to<00:06:23.160> run<00:06:23.370> it<00:06:23.520> with<00:06:23.640> a<00:06:23.700> motor

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
if you tried to run it with a motor

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.480 
if you tried to run it with a motor
right<00:06:24.210> now<00:06:24.410> back<00:06:25.410> feed<00:06:25.740> would<00:06:25.950> come<00:06:26.220> and<00:06:26.370> it

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
right now back feed would come and it

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.280 
right now back feed would come and it
would<00:06:26.520> blow<00:06:26.820> up<00:06:26.910> the<00:06:27.000> triac<00:06:27.360> every<00:06:27.660> time<00:06:27.840> so

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
would blow up the triac every time so

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.080 
would blow up the triac every time so
you'd<00:06:28.410> have<00:06:28.440> to<00:06:28.620> put<00:06:28.919> this<00:06:29.070> in<00:06:29.310> or<00:06:29.550> it<00:06:29.760> will<00:06:29.940> not

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
you'd have to put this in or it will not

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.610 
you'd have to put this in or it will not
run<00:06:30.270> a<00:06:30.300> motor<00:06:30.570> that's<00:06:30.930> why<00:06:31.020> I<00:06:31.050> say<00:06:31.260> this<00:06:31.410> is<00:06:31.470> a

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
run a motor that's why I say this is a

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.950 
run a motor that's why I say this is a
heating<00:06:32.010> mantle<00:06:32.040> controller<00:06:32.760> if<00:06:33.570> you<00:06:33.720> want

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
heating mantle controller if you want

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.800 
heating mantle controller if you want
there<00:06:34.410> it<00:06:34.560> is

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
there it is

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.120 
there it is
but<00:06:36.810> you<00:06:36.960> don't<00:06:37.140> need<00:06:37.349> that<00:06:37.560> if<00:06:37.800> you're<00:06:37.979> only

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
but you don't need that if you're only

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.050 
but you don't need that if you're only
going<00:06:38.310> to<00:06:38.370> be<00:06:38.430> using<00:06:38.789> it<00:06:38.880> there

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
going to be using it there

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.470 
going to be using it there
run<00:06:39.180> these<00:06:39.330> Mantle's<00:06:41.030> make<00:06:42.030> sure<00:06:42.180> you<00:06:42.270> use<00:06:42.450> a

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
run these Mantle's make sure you use a

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.550 
run these Mantle's make sure you use a
fuse<00:06:42.870> always<00:06:43.680> use<00:06:44.040> the<00:06:44.220> fuse<00:06:44.490> a<00:06:45.180> fast<00:06:45.810> blow<00:06:46.169> 10

amp<00:06:46.740> max<00:06:47.040> in<00:06:47.310> this<00:06:47.460> in<00:06:47.850> this<00:06:48.330> case<00:06:48.600> your<00:06:48.870> anyway

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.230 
amp max in this in this case your anyway

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.680 
amp max in this in this case your anyway
because<00:06:49.470> everything's<00:06:49.980> rated<00:06:50.370> to<00:06:50.550> 15<00:06:51.270> amps<00:06:51.600> or

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690 
because everything's rated to 15 amps or

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.330 
because everything's rated to 15 amps or
so<00:06:52.430> 10<00:06:53.430> amps<00:06:53.730> is<00:06:53.960> plenty<00:06:54.960> 10<00:06:55.620> amps<00:06:55.919> if<00:06:56.040> I<00:06:56.130> ran

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
so 10 amps is plenty 10 amps if I ran

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.440 
so 10 amps is plenty 10 amps if I ran
through<00:06:56.580> this<00:06:56.730> thing<00:06:56.940> would<00:06:57.090> blow<00:06:57.240> this

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.450 
through this thing would blow this

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.180 
through this thing would blow this

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 
see them boiling water they're at two

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.490 
see them boiling water they're at two
lamps<00:07:02.010> it'll<00:07:02.550> boil<00:07:02.760> water<00:07:03.000> at<00:07:03.360> 1<00:07:03.570> amp<00:07:03.750> easily

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 
lamps it'll boil water at 1 amp easily

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.170 
lamps it'll boil water at 1 amp easily
this<00:07:04.919> is<00:07:05.130> pushing<00:07:05.760> it<00:07:06.030> for<00:07:06.540> a<00:07:06.780> speed<00:07:07.430> but<00:07:08.430> 10

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
this is pushing it for a speed but 10

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.510 
this is pushing it for a speed but 10
amps<00:07:09.540> is<00:07:09.690> more<00:07:09.900> than<00:07:10.080> enough<00:07:10.230> you<00:07:11.220> don't<00:07:11.310> need

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 
amps is more than enough you don't need

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:18.020 
amps is more than enough you don't need

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.030 
more than that like guarantee so anyway

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.210 
more than that like guarantee so anyway
I<00:07:18.240> just<00:07:18.780> thought<00:07:19.020> you<00:07:19.290> would<00:07:19.500> like<00:07:19.919> to<00:07:20.070> see
