00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.730
 have a nice day everyone easy article in 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.660
 which we will talk 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:22.700
 mean 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:27.080
 letters letters on the machine 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.939
 automatic transmission many 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.379
 call them modes well that is 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:38.080
 let's talk about the side or mode that is 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:41.900
 understand how they themselves are the regime and of course and 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:45.170
 so the article is easy so I will not stick 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.080
 let's go straight to my car now 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.510
 instituted 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:57.879
 she stands on pvp 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:59.000
 parking here too parking means 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.070
 parking 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.489
 well, or as many may call 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.560
 parking brake 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.490
 of course it's not exactly a parking brake 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.680
 it's like his imitation but exactly 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.680
 with this arrangement 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.950
 machine in this mode, the machine is nowhere 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.270
 will not see that is even if you are on a hill 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:31.630
 put it will stand second mode 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.630
 as you can see me r 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.069
 help lights up p 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.630
 This so-called reverse if 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.200
 in English this is reverse well this is back 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.390
 transfer of movement back think to all 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:02:01.660
 understandably 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:07.630
 then the panels are again duplicated 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:10.690
 letter n neutral transmission can 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.380
 let our brakes go nowhere county then 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:20.790
 there is a neutral gear than 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:23.410
 it differs from n parking parking it 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.740
 how to tell you that is 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.220
 parking from kinda well parking 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.730
 brake 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.060
 but n is the usual neutral that is 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.520
 if you leave on a neutral hill on a hill 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:50.940
 then you have a car ride and parking 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:52.860
 don't go next city 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.130
 this drive 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:00.489
 there is absolutely no hard drive this movement 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.530
 forward that is, the car is regular 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.890
 moves forward in series 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.239
 switching speeds from lower to higher 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.060
 if you stop then 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.550
 Respectively speed and fall until 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.600
 first gear from starts to get under way 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:21.150
 that is, the speed starts to grow and 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.150
 last mode m 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:34.720
 or manual manual means manual manual 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:38.270
 switch mode rub fire M1 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:42.310
 this is also a move forward but drive 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.940
 different in that with this 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.780
 movement 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.290
 m is an imitation of a mechanical box 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.180
 gears 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.120
 that is, the speed you will need 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.560
 manually switch as it is trite 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.739
 did not sound on the machine there is a mode 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.580
 I manually switch speeds 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:09.080
 happens through this 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.940
 pros and cons that is, plus it rises 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:17.169
 speeds 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:18.410
 minus speeds go down clear on 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.900
 parking lot 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.600
 this car is worth removing soon 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.850
 switch but if you switch then 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:37.780
 there is a plus sign m2 m3 m4 m5 m6 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:43.280
 if you lower the course m2 and m3 m2m 1 6 1 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:46.280
 these are my letters 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:55.120
 that is, n parking p reverse 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:05:01.729
 Annie 3d drive there are also more letters 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:06.710
 like lb 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:14.440
 there it would be basically the same thing 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:16.880
 this low low gear el happens 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:21.890
 l1 l2 l3 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:26.210
 i.e. reduced 2 gears and thirds then 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:30.480
 there is an il-2 machine will switch up 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:33.630
 3 speeds 2 to 2 liters just 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.440
 Lel 1 is the first gear 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:40.530
 downshift 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.930
 mostly it's on front wheel drive 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:47.250
 SUVs on Japanese cars also 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:50.450
 very common that is when this 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:53.420
 transfer the car will move 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:58.800
 very slowly and smoothly 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:06:01.200
 also there is a mode with better conditional mode 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:06.600
 sport divider will spin up 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:09.090
 high revs have w or screw mode 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.220
 at night a snowflake can signify it 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.850
 winter mode the car is being touched with 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:18.600
 second gear 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:21.780
 there is an overdrive rest mode or straight food 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.930
 r-drive overdrive is like an urban 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.970
 the mode that includes the maximum 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:30.810
 the transfer that you have a machine for 4 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:34.020
 transfer it 4 does not include if at 6 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:38.070
 the sixth does not include but these efforts here 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.660
 he distributes between these three 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.150
 gears that is a bit like 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:46.730
 rebuilt machine about airbrushing 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:51.600
 I will write a separate article necessary 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:55.350
 what else mode can be mode e or 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:58.680
 eco is an economical mode unlike 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.030
 sports this mode will save 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:05.430
 fuel that is the car will 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:07.680
 switch smoothly not much will 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.560
 accelerate your car even if you 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:16.800
 will push the gas pedal here is such a 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:19.150
 as if the mode is probably all like that 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.680
 here is a light article today 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:27.000
 Today show about modes but automatons 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:31.540
 often know what the letters already mean 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.780
 Tomato and it's all read our of the 

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.780
 block
