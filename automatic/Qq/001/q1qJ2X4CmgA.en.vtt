because<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:22.830> got<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.100> whole<00:00:23.519> bunch<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.910> them

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
because it's got a whole bunch of them

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.120 
because it's got a whole bunch of them
and<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.750> tried<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.199> find<00:00:25.470> one<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.830> hasn't<00:00:25.859> been

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
and I tried to find one that hasn't been

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.290 
and I tried to find one that hasn't been
used<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.519> don't<00:00:26.760> think<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.060> has<00:00:27.119> been

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
used and I don't think this has been

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.000 
used and I don't think this has been
used<00:00:27.689> but<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.050> said<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.320> would<00:00:28.470> cut<00:00:28.650> down<00:00:28.800> on<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
used but I said I would cut down on the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.279 
used but I said I would cut down on the
announcements<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.119> will<00:00:30.420> do<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.080> and

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
announcements so I will do just that and

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.930 
announcements so I will do just that and
it<00:00:31.380> looks<00:00:31.529> like<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.980> market<00:00:32.340> is<00:00:32.460> choosing<00:00:32.820> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
it looks like the market is choosing to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.840 
it looks like the market is choosing to
go<00:00:33.020> 9<00:00:34.020> Overlord<00:00:34.500> i'm<00:00:34.739> guessing<00:00:35.460> yeah<00:00:35.579> 9

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
go 9 Overlord i'm guessing yeah 9

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.970 
go 9 Overlord i'm guessing yeah 9
Overlord<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.450> still<00:00:36.960> don't<00:00:37.140> see<00:00:37.230> no<00:00:37.770> any

Overlord I still don't see no any

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.459 
Overlord I still don't see no any
concrete<00:00:38.520> evidence<00:00:38.640> as<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.270> whether<00:00:39.930> or<00:00:40.079> not<00:00:40.140> 9

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
concrete evidence as to whether or not 9

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.110 
concrete evidence as to whether or not 9
Overlord<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:41.010> better<00:00:41.190> 10<00:00:41.489> overload<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.940> better

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
Overlord is better 10 overload is better

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.490 
Overlord is better 10 overload is better
or<00:00:42.590> 10<00:00:43.590> Overlord<00:00:43.950> extractor<00:00:44.670> or<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.690> tan<00:00:46.260> drone

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
or 10 Overlord extractor or a tan drone

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.680 
or 10 Overlord extractor or a tan drone
extractor<00:00:47.660> 11<00:00:48.660> drone<00:00:48.840> or<00:00:49.460> 10<00:00:50.460> drone<00:00:51.090> Overlord

extractor 11 drone or 10 drone Overlord

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.500 
extractor 11 drone or 10 drone Overlord
drone<00:00:52.440> extractor<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.070> better<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.730> who<00:00:54.300> knows

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
drone extractor is better so who knows

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.869 
drone extractor is better so who knows
they're<00:00:54.840> probably<00:00:55.079> all<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.100> similar<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.640> it

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
they're probably all so similar that it

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.069 
they're probably all so similar that it
doesn't<00:00:57.210> matter<00:00:57.420> too<00:00:57.780> much<00:00:57.890> but<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.920> guess

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
doesn't matter too much but I guess

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.869 
doesn't matter too much but I guess
whatever<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.379> prefer<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.739> suppose<00:01:02.309> someone

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
whatever you prefer I suppose someone

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.189 
whatever you prefer I suppose someone
needs<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.239> some<00:01:03.420> testing<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.049> like

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
needs to do some testing on that like

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.620 
needs to do some testing on that like
crunch<00:01:04.589> some<00:01:04.799> numbers<00:01:04.860> or<00:01:05.430> something<00:01:05.640> so

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
crunch some numbers or something so

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.780 
crunch some numbers or something so
pretty<00:01:07.200> standard<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:07.799> far<00:01:08.040> from<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> Naga<00:01:08.520> up

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
to 14 foods and see if he puts down a

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.910 
to 14 foods and see if he puts down a
pool<00:01:10.950> or<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.189> fast<00:01:12.000> expansion<00:01:12.510> first<00:01:12.920> meanwhile

Jim po is getting his racks at 12
sending<00:01:17.280> out<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> scout<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:18.030> well<00:01:19.340> this<00:01:20.340> match

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
sending out a scout as well this match

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.280 
sending out a scout as well this match
was<00:01:20.700> actually<00:01:21.000> played<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.630> craft<00:01:22.020> Cup

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
was actually played in a craft Cup

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.050 
was actually played in a craft Cup
tournament<00:01:22.830> game<00:01:23.009> I'm<00:01:23.340> guessing<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.909> was

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
tournament game I'm guessing it was

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.390 
tournament game I'm guessing it was
probably<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.750> semi<00:01:25.020> finals<00:01:25.920> or<00:01:26.040> finals

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
probably like semi finals or finals

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.679 
probably like semi finals or finals
because<00:01:26.580> these<00:01:26.820> are<00:01:26.970> two<00:01:27.119> very<00:01:27.150> strong

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
because these are two very strong

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.260 
because these are two very strong

minerals looks like he's going to forego
the<00:01:54.040> gas<00:01:54.220> in<00:01:54.550> favor<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.180> getting<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.780> quick

the gas in favor of getting a quick
second<00:01:56.590> hatchery<00:01:56.950> so<00:01:57.100> we'll<00:01:57.280> see<00:01:57.400> he<00:01:57.580> is

it I think because to Reaper shots and
one<00:03:42.340> SUV<00:03:42.730> hit<00:03:43.000> will<00:03:43.180> kill<00:03:43.360> a<00:03:43.390> Joan<00:03:43.660> so<00:03:43.870> he<00:03:43.959> can

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
one SUV hit will kill a Joan so he can

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.300

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
dhamaka put down another pool right now

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.439 
dhamaka put down another pool right now
just<00:04:38.590> in<00:04:38.830> case<00:04:39.130> he<00:04:39.160> does<00:04:39.639> lose<00:04:39.880> this<00:04:40.120> spawning

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.900 
just in case he does lose this spawning
pool<00:04:40.690> so<00:04:40.840> this<00:04:40.990> is<00:04:41.110> very<00:04:41.800> intense<00:04:42.190> play<00:04:42.490> early
