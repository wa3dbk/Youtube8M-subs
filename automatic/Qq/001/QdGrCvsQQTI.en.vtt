just<00:02:27.860> going<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.070> be<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.250> temporary<00:02:28.670> program

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
just going to be a temporary program

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.650 
just going to be a temporary program
that<00:02:29.600> I<00:02:29.630> record<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.670> until<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.730> can<00:02:32.030> figure<00:02:32.450> out

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
that I record the until I can figure out

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.990 
that I record the until I can figure out
how<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:32.959> record<00:02:33.380> high<00:02:33.890> high<00:02:34.280> quality<00:02:34.730> so

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
how to record high high quality so

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.150 
how to record high high quality so
they'll<00:02:35.360> probably<00:02:35.600> like<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.140> two<00:02:36.620> more<00:02:36.769> videos

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
they'll probably like to two more videos

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.240 
they'll probably like to two more videos
that<00:02:37.970> are<00:02:38.060> kind<00:02:38.269> of<00:02:38.390> laggy<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.989> then<00:02:39.230> uh<00:02:39.260> I'll

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
that are kind of laggy and then uh I'll

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.460 
that are kind of laggy and then uh I'll
have<00:02:40.550> something<00:02:41.180> figured<00:02:41.330> out<00:02:41.570> by<00:02:41.750> then<00:02:41.959> okay

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
have something figured out by then okay

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.960 
have something figured out by then okay
so<00:02:42.530> wall<00:02:42.950> breaker<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.519> I<00:02:43.610> broke<00:02:43.850> the

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
so wall breaker is I broke the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.030 
so wall breaker is I broke the
compartments<00:02:44.780> then<00:02:44.959> I'll<00:02:45.110> put<00:02:45.350> down<00:02:45.380> my<00:02:45.530> bones

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
compartments then I'll put down my bones

cheese got blown up by a giant

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.550 
cheese got blown up by a giant
like<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.340> combination<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.540> three<00:02:52.780> bonds<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.260> an

but<00:03:12.280> not<00:03:12.460> too<00:03:12.730> much<00:03:13.230> instead<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.410> lure<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.860> CC

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
but not too much instead you lure the CC

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.990 
but not too much instead you lure the CC
at<00:03:17.530> least<00:03:17.740> this<00:03:17.860> is<00:03:17.980> how<00:03:18.130> i<00:03:18.190> do<00:03:18.340> it<00:03:18.580> i<00:03:18.700> lure<00:03:18.880> the

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
at least this is how i do it i lure the

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.520 
at least this is how i do it i lure the
CC<00:03:19.480> instead<00:03:19.960> and<00:03:23.640> bring<00:03:24.660> less<00:03:25.660> which<00:03:26.140> is<00:03:26.350> which

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
CC instead and bring less which is which

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.170 
CC instead and bring less which is which
is<00:03:26.680> actually<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:27.190> opposite<00:03:27.580> of<00:03:27.700> what<00:03:28.060> I've

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
is actually the opposite of what I've

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.440 
is actually the opposite of what I've
heard<00:03:28.630> from<00:03:29.280> top<00:03:30.280> players<00:03:30.610> they<00:03:30.940> bring<00:03:31.180> more

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
heard from top players they bring more

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.180 
heard from top players they bring more
witches<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:32.110> less<00:03:32.260> Wizards<00:03:32.710> but<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:32.950> actually

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
witches and less Wizards but I actually

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.910 
witches and less Wizards but I actually
bring<00:03:33.670> less<00:03:34.210> which<00:03:34.660> is<00:03:34.930> I<00:03:35.140> think<00:03:35.230> just<00:03:35.680> one

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
bring less which is I think just one

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.870 
bring less which is I think just one
less<00:03:36.130> which<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:38.620> three<00:03:38.860> more<00:03:39.070> wizards<00:03:39.690> so

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
less which and so three more wizards so

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.380 
less which and so three more wizards so
that's<00:03:42.880> how<00:03:43.030> I<00:03:43.060> do<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:44.880> that<00:03:45.880> was<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.000> simple

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
that's how I do that that was a simple

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.970 
that's how I do that that was a simple
bow<00:03:46.510> we<00:03:46.690> rate<00:03:47.050> but<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.350> purpose<00:03:47.680> of<00:03:47.800> go

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
bow we rate but the purpose of go

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.150 
bow we rate but the purpose of go
wee-wee<00:03:48.400> if<00:03:48.630> you<00:03:49.630> saw<00:03:49.840> but<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.710> play<00:03:50.890> it<00:03:50.980> again

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
wee-wee if you saw but to play it again

real quick out four times at this time I

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.270 
real quick out four times at this time I
attack<00:03:55.540> from<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.840> top<00:03:56.080> I<00:03:56.290> spread<00:03:56.709> my<00:03:56.890> golems

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
attack from the top I spread my golems

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.729 
attack from the top I spread my golems
out<00:03:57.489> that<00:03:57.970> is<00:03:58.360> key<00:03:58.750> you<00:03:59.140> want<00:03:59.350> because<00:03:59.530> you

shooting it all of the different bones
you<00:04:04.900> don't<00:04:05.080> want<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.560> bunch<00:04:05.830> of<00:04:06.040> up<00:04:06.220> call<00:04:06.550> it

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
you don't want a bunch of up call it

one golem is going to take most of the

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.600 
one golem is going to take most of the
heat<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.200> it's<00:04:14.739> going<00:04:14.950> to<00:04:15.040> go<00:04:15.160> down<00:04:15.190> quickly

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
heat and it's going to go down quickly

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.180 
heat and it's going to go down quickly
so<00:04:15.910> you<00:04:16.000> want<00:04:16.150> to<00:04:16.209> spread<00:04:16.419> them<00:04:16.570> out<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:17.190> then

so you want to spread them out and then

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.970 
so you want to spread them out and then
your<00:04:18.489> Wizards

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
your Wizards

see<00:04:20.120> they<00:04:21.120> cleared<00:04:21.810> like<00:04:22.320> almost<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.830> entire

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
see they cleared like almost the entire

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.180 
see they cleared like almost the entire
top<00:04:23.400> half<00:04:23.730> of<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:23.910> base<00:04:24.210> so<00:04:25.050> that<00:04:25.080> my<00:04:25.800> heroes

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
top half of the base so that my heroes

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.890 
top half of the base so that my heroes
could<00:04:26.430> go<00:04:26.580> straight<00:04:26.940> in<00:04:27.090> towards<00:04:27.480> the<00:04:27.660> middle

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
could go straight in towards the middle

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.040 
could go straight in towards the middle
and<00:04:28.140> get<00:04:29.040> that<00:04:29.220> town<00:04:29.580> hall<00:04:29.820> for<00:04:30.060> me<00:04:30.210> so<00:04:30.960> the
