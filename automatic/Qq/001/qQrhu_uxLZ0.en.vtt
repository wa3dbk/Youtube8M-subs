forward right there we're eliminating

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.050 
forward right there we're eliminating
that<00:01:57.899> our<00:01:58.409> weak<00:01:58.649> side<00:01:58.890> defenseman<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.759> moving

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
that our weak side defenseman is moving

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.490 
that our weak side defenseman is moving
up<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.299> ice<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.600> if<00:02:00.719> they<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:00.960> another<00:02:01.229> four

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
up the ice so if they have another four

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.929 
up the ice so if they have another four
here<00:02:01.710> which<00:02:01.920> traditionally<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.549> hockey<00:02:02.820> they

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
here which traditionally in hockey they

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.600 
here which traditionally in hockey they
do<00:02:03.119> his<00:02:03.780> job<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.619> take<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.070> option<00:02:05.490> away

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
do his job is to take that option away

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.459 
do his job is to take that option away
and<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.030> should<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.390> him<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.689> red<00:02:06.869> he's<00:02:07.320> gonna

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
and I should have him in red he's gonna

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.229 
and I should have him in red he's gonna
take<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.740> option<00:02:08.310> away<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.700> our<00:02:09.119> other

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
take that option away and our other

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.300 
take that option away and our other
defenseman<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:09.989> going<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.259> move<00:02:10.349> up<00:02:10.530> inside

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
defenseman is going to move up inside

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.890 
defenseman is going to move up inside
the<00:02:11.459> dot<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.879> position<00:02:12.300> himself<00:02:12.629> right<00:02:12.870> here

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
the dot and position himself right here

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.670 
the dot and position himself right here
so

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
so

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.740 
so
where<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.250> L<00:02:14.430> comes<00:02:14.849> in<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.239> actually<00:02:15.359> it's

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
where the L comes in and actually it's

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.500 
where the L comes in and actually it's
an<00:02:15.840> upside<00:02:16.200> down<00:02:16.439> upside<00:02:16.739> down<00:02:17.400> L<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.849> you<00:02:18.329> go

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
an upside down upside down L is you go

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.750 
an upside down upside down L is you go
here<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.109> we<00:02:19.560> go<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:20.219> and<00:02:20.400> we're<00:02:20.579> taking

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
here and we go here and we're taking

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.640 
here and we go here and we're taking
those<00:02:21.060> options<00:02:21.599> wait<00:02:21.750> if<00:02:21.989> they<00:02:22.140> come<00:02:22.349> up<00:02:22.500> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
those options wait if they come up the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.830 
those options wait if they come up the
wall<00:02:22.859> we're<00:02:23.519> taking<00:02:23.849> that<00:02:23.969> away<00:02:24.090> if<00:02:24.390> they<00:02:24.510> go<00:02:24.659> D

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
wall we're taking that away if they go D

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.929 
wall we're taking that away if they go D
to<00:02:24.989> D<00:02:25.140> we're<00:02:25.349> taking<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.769> away<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.430> they<00:02:26.670> rim

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
to D we're taking that away if they rim

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.849 
to D we're taking that away if they rim
the<00:02:27.120> puck<00:02:27.359> we're<00:02:27.810> taking<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.379> away<00:02:28.530> so

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
the puck we're taking that away so

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.129 
the puck we're taking that away so
ultimately<00:02:29.670> what<00:02:30.060> we're<00:02:30.209> trying<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.599> do<00:02:30.719> if<00:02:30.930> we

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:31.139 
ultimately what we're trying to do if we

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:32.839 
ultimately what we're trying to do if we
do<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.319> good<00:02:31.560> job<00:02:31.620> playing<00:02:32.159> without<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.639> puck

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
do a good job playing without the puck

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.240 
do a good job playing without the puck
we<00:02:33.450> end<00:02:33.689> up<00:02:33.810> having<00:02:33.959> more<00:02:34.319> time<00:02:34.650> with<00:02:34.889> the<00:02:35.040> puck

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
we end up having more time with the puck

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.179 
we end up having more time with the puck
so<00:02:35.519> once<00:02:36.030> again<00:02:36.209> it's<00:02:36.719> an<00:02:36.900> upside<00:02:37.230> down<00:02:37.260> L<00:02:37.709> but

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
so once again it's an upside down L but

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.619 
so once again it's an upside down L but
though<00:02:38.310> it's<00:02:38.430> what<00:02:38.609> we're<00:02:38.760> trying<00:02:38.969> to<00:02:39.120> do<00:02:39.269> when

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
though it's what we're trying to do when

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.650 
though it's what we're trying to do when
we<00:02:39.719> use<00:02:39.750> our<00:02:40.049> L<00:02:40.200> for<00:02:40.439> check
