00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
want to turn that down and start letting

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.180 
want to turn that down and start letting
the<00:02:33.480> simmer<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.080> then<00:02:34.140> it'll<00:02:34.890> start<00:02:34.920> to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
the simmer and then it'll start to

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.060 
the simmer and then it'll start to
thicken<00:02:35.519> as<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:36.239> goes<00:02:36.540> along<00:02:36.690> anyway<00:02:37.590> we'll

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
thicken as it goes along anyway we'll

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.340
