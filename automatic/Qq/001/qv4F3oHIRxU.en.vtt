in the eyelids become prone to

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.420 
in the eyelids become prone to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
glands start working improperly it can

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.210 
glands start working improperly it can
resolve<00:01:44.619> in<00:01:44.860> one<00:01:45.100> style<00:01:45.430> or<00:01:45.810> recurring<00:01:46.810> size

resolve in one style or recurring size

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.620 
resolve in one style or recurring size
so<00:01:48.220> how<00:01:48.369> does<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.610> medicine<00:01:49.030> work<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.360> get<00:01:49.479> rid

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
so how does a medicine work to get rid

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.050 
so how does a medicine work to get rid
