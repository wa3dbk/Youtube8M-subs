00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
overall opinion so basically I know I

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.780 
overall opinion so basically I know I
ordered<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.220> hair<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.550> February<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.360> or

ordered this hair in February and or

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.100 
ordered this hair in February and or
actually<00:00:53.790> I<00:00:54.059> ordered<00:00:54.239> at<00:00:54.450> the<00:00:54.480> end<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.930> June

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
actually I ordered at the end of June

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.540 
actually I ordered at the end of June
where<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.590> got<00:00:55.710> here<00:00:55.950> in<00:00:56.010> February

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
where and it got here in February

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.070 
where and it got here in February
um<00:00:56.960> it<00:00:57.960> took<00:00:58.290> a<00:00:58.500> while<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.430> the<00:01:00.330> hair<00:01:00.360> to<00:01:00.809> come

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
um it took a while for the hair to come

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.229 
um it took a while for the hair to come
I<00:01:01.290> think<00:01:01.589> the<00:01:01.830> reasoning<00:01:02.519> for<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.940> just

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
I think the reasoning for that is just

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.210 
I think the reasoning for that is just
because<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.870> weather<00:01:04.019> or<00:01:04.379> where<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.589> live<00:01:04.949> how

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
because the weather or where I live how

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.200 
because the weather or where I live how
it's<00:01:05.430> been<00:01:05.640> sucky

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
it's been sucky

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.840 
it's been sucky
I<00:01:06.470> live<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.590> journey<00:01:07.830> took<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.160> while<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.490> get<00:01:08.790> to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
I live in journey took a while to get to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.610 
I live in journey took a while to get to
me<00:01:09.210> personally<00:01:09.690> because<00:01:09.840> our<00:01:10.170> weather<00:01:10.410> was

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
me personally because our weather was

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.800 
me personally because our weather was
bad<00:01:10.800> and<00:01:11.190> I<00:01:11.310> know<00:01:11.370> it<00:01:11.580> takes<00:01:11.790> seven<00:01:12.120> to<00:01:12.150> seven

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
bad and I know it takes seven to seven

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.810 
bad and I know it takes seven to seven
to<00:01:12.900> ten<00:01:13.080> business<00:01:13.409> days<00:01:13.440> for<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.340> hand<00:01:14.550> ship

do<00:01:40.410> I<00:01:40.500> think<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.830> hair<00:01:41.010> is<00:01:41.040> worth<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.910> I

do I think the hair is worth it do I

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.320 
do I think the hair is worth it do I
think<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.360> lasts<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.440> let's<00:01:43.980> go<00:01:44.180> so<00:01:45.180> basically

here<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.869> mean<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.679> just<00:02:10.890> think<00:02:11.039> that's<00:02:11.190> because

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
here I mean I just think that's because

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.369 
here I mean I just think that's because
you<00:02:11.819> know<00:02:11.970> all<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.390> friction<00:02:12.660> between<00:02:13.080> your

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
you know all the friction between your

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.509 
you know all the friction between your
neck<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.890> hand<00:02:14.099> so<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:16.040> tangling<00:02:17.040> aspect

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
neck and the hand so the tangling aspect

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.220 
neck and the hand so the tangling aspect
of<00:02:17.700> this<00:02:17.849> hair<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.180> don't<00:02:18.480> think<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:18.870> tangles

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
of this hair I don't think it tangles

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.949 
of this hair I don't think it tangles
that<00:02:19.260> bad<00:02:19.590> as<00:02:20.489> for<00:02:20.760> shedding<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.480> me<00:02:21.629> that's<00:02:21.810> a

that bad as for shedding to me that's a

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.530 
that bad as for shedding to me that's a

and I plan on selling my West but I

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.030 
and I plan on selling my West but I
didn't<00:03:02.700> um<00:03:03.270> so<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.750> hair<00:03:03.930> is<00:03:04.140> like<00:03:04.320> super

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
didn't um so the hair is like super

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.130 
didn't um so the hair is like super
luxurious<00:03:05.790> like<00:03:06.090> it's<00:03:06.300> like<00:03:06.510> some<00:03:06.870> really

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
luxurious like it's like some really

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.800 
luxurious like it's like some really
really<00:03:07.230> soft<00:03:07.620> except<00:03:08.550> for<00:03:08.760> when<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:09.090> got<00:03:09.330> them<00:03:09.600> I

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
really soft except for when I got them I

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.390 
really soft except for when I got them I
thought<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.260> ends<00:03:10.500> were<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.680> little<00:03:10.860> bit<00:03:11.040> dry

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
thought the ends were a little bit dry

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.490 
thought the ends were a little bit dry
they<00:03:11.640> weren't<00:03:11.880> brutal<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.630> they<00:03:13.140> weren't

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
they weren't brutal and they weren't

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.170 
they weren't brutal and they weren't
like<00:03:13.650> super<00:03:14.100> raggedy<00:03:14.489> but<00:03:14.670> I<00:03:14.700> thought<00:03:15.000> they

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
like super raggedy but I thought they

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.490 
like super raggedy but I thought they
could<00:03:15.239> have<00:03:15.450> been<00:03:15.630> better<00:03:15.690> but<00:03:16.400> um<00:03:17.400> yeah<00:03:18.500> so

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
could have been better but um yeah so

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.380 
could have been better but um yeah so
the<00:03:19.680> hair<00:03:19.860> holds<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.280> curl<00:03:20.459> really<00:03:20.880> well<00:03:21.090> I

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
the hair holds a curl really well I

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.479 
the hair holds a curl really well I
actually<00:03:22.019> don't<00:03:22.410> like<00:03:22.530> wearing<00:03:23.040> like<00:03:23.070> tight

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
actually don't like wearing like tight

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:23.930 
actually don't like wearing like tight
curls

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
curls

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.240 
curls
I<00:03:24.030> like<00:03:24.239> loose<00:03:24.540> curls<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.590> think<00:03:26.100> these

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
I like loose curls and I think these

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.490 
I like loose curls and I think these
curls<00:03:26.700> look<00:03:26.850> really<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:27.360> you<00:03:27.780> know<00:03:27.930> nice<00:03:28.170> and

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
curls look really like you know nice and

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.270 
curls look really like you know nice and
soft<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:29.040> pretty<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:30.410> live<00:03:31.410> well<00:03:31.800> with<00:03:32.100> my

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
soft and pretty I live well with my

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.270 
soft and pretty I live well with my
natural<00:03:32.519> hair<00:03:32.970> I<00:03:33.630> think<00:03:34.530> I've<00:03:34.769> said<00:03:34.950> this<00:03:35.010> in

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
natural hair I think I've said this in

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.770 
natural hair I think I've said this in
the<00:03:35.310> other<00:03:35.459> video<00:03:35.670> but<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:36.030> did<00:03:36.180> not<00:03:36.300> have<00:03:36.570> like

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
the other video but it did not have like

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.540 
the other video but it did not have like
a<00:03:36.810> weird<00:03:37.080> smell<00:03:37.410> when<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:37.739> ordered<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.190> it

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
a weird smell when I ordered it it

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.050 
a weird smell when I ordered it it
wasn't<00:03:39.180> like<00:03:39.769> brown<00:03:40.769> when<00:03:41.130> I<00:03:41.160> washed<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:41.820> it

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
wasn't like brown when I washed it so it

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.870 
wasn't like brown when I washed it so it
is<00:03:42.239> Virginie<00:03:42.930> era<00:03:43.080> I<00:03:43.350> just<00:03:43.920> think<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.489> the

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
is Virginie era I just think that the

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.490 
is Virginie era I just think that the
hair<00:03:45.090> sheds<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.540> lot<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:45.930> that's<00:03:46.049> pretty<00:03:46.380> much

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
hair sheds a lot so that's pretty much

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.530 
hair sheds a lot so that's pretty much
my<00:03:46.709> overview<00:03:48.410> what<00:03:49.410> else<00:03:49.560> about<00:03:49.739> this<00:03:49.920> hair

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
my overview what else about this hair

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.780 
my overview what else about this hair
another<00:03:51.590> reason<00:03:52.590> why<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.040> think<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.549> hair

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
another reason why I think this hair

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.539 
another reason why I think this hair
shed<00:03:54.030> so<00:03:54.269> much<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:54.600> mean<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:54.810> think<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:56.010> didn't

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549

mean I think it was a miscommunication
because<00:04:41.430> I<00:04:41.669> thought<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:42.060> hair<00:04:42.240> was<00:04:42.419> with<00:04:42.630> ups

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
because I thought the hair was with ups

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.100 
because I thought the hair was with ups
but<00:04:43.919> it<00:04:44.010> was<00:04:44.130> actually<00:04:44.340> US<00:04:45.180> Postal<00:04:45.720> Service

I left the inches down here below but if

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.190 
I left the inches down here below but if
you<00:04:55.570> guys<00:04:55.750> didn't<00:04:56.380> read<00:04:56.590> this<00:04:56.800> this<00:04:57.070> is<00:04:58.200> just

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
you guys didn't read this this is just

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.220 
you guys didn't read this this is just
so<00:04:59.920> this<00:05:00.190> is<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.940> Brazilian<00:05:01.540> ear<00:05:01.810> I<00:05:01.870> think<00:05:02.110> the

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
so this is the Brazilian ear I think the

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.320 
so this is the Brazilian ear I think the
only<00:05:02.410> sell<00:05:02.680> Brazilian<00:05:03.100> and<00:05:03.340> this<00:05:03.730> is<00:05:03.880> inches

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
only sell Brazilian and this is inches

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:14.520 
only sell Brazilian and this is inches
26<00:05:05.050> 28<00:05:05.670> 28<00:05:08.730> so<00:05:09.730> I<00:05:11.790> think<00:05:12.790> that's<00:05:13.090> my<00:05:13.240> problem<00:05:13.530> I

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
26 28 28 so I think that's my problem I

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.350 
26 28 28 so I think that's my problem I
didn't<00:05:15.250> take<00:05:15.370> care<00:05:15.610> of<00:05:15.670> it<00:05:15.790> as<00:05:15.910> much<00:05:16.090> as<00:05:16.240> I

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
didn't take care of it as much as I

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.120 
didn't take care of it as much as I
could<00:05:16.420> have<00:05:16.780> that's<00:05:17.080> probably<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:17.650> reason<00:05:17.830> I

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
could have that's probably the reason I

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.490 
could have that's probably the reason I
experienced<00:05:18.700> shedding<00:05:19.090> like<00:05:19.600> when<00:05:19.780> I<00:05:19.810> have<00:05:20.230> my
