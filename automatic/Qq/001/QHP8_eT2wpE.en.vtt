00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.130 

so<00:03:46.790> I<00:03:46.820> decided<00:03:47.300> to<00:03:47.420> change<00:03:47.600> things<00:03:47.900> around<00:03:48.020> a

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
so I decided to change things around a

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.600 
so I decided to change things around a
bit<00:03:48.170> in<00:03:48.320> the<00:03:48.380> bottom<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:48.770> I've<00:03:48.860> got<00:03:49.010> a<00:03:49.250> nesting

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
bit in the bottom and I've got a nesting

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.000 
bit in the bottom and I've got a nesting
box<00:03:49.670> in<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.060> Baptist<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:51.350> I<00:03:51.620> think<00:03:51.800> it<00:03:51.920> would

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
box in the Baptist and I think it would

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.370 
box in the Baptist and I think it would
look<00:03:52.070> too<00:03:52.250> cluttered<00:03:52.490> in<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.820> top<00:03:53.030> but<00:03:53.930> yeah
