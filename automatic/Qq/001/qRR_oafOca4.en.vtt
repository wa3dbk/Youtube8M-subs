 the edge of the volume up key drive and 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:22.940
 Now comes to appear with the installation after 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.300

 very quickly now we will see how it goes 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:54.970
 the process of optimizing the application for this 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.970
 firmware and after that we already 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:02.110
 now after 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:06.910
 firmware we put out so here 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:11.350
 update completed we go 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:15.180
 and here as we see, and there are changes 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:20.140
 only fixed security 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:23.080
 sending messages to the cloud and how we 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.710
 We know and recently was with a small 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.640
 scandal 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:33.100
 how high they send information 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.250
 about the device some information and 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.280
 I exchange with servers and they are very 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.410
 quickly picked up from the topic and fixed 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.490
 that's the only way here in this firmware 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.490
 this is a problem
