let's<00:01:00.989> start<00:01:01.289> with<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> comparison<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:02.129> size

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
let's start with the comparison for size

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.420 
let's start with the comparison for size
he's<00:01:03.180> towering<00:01:03.690> over<00:01:04.019> spider-man<00:01:04.559> he's<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.189> lot

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
he's towering over spider-man he's a lot

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.149 
he's towering over spider-man he's a lot
bigger<00:01:05.670> than<00:01:05.760> spider-man<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:07.110> that's<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
bigger than spider-man so that's the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.219 
bigger than spider-man so that's the

actually<00:05:31.729> bought<00:05:32.120> some<00:05:32.150> spider-man<00:05:32.780> webs<00:05:32.960> off

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
actually bought some spider-man webs off

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.469 
actually bought some spider-man webs off
of<00:05:33.319> them<00:05:33.469> but<00:05:33.979> then<00:05:34.069> I<00:05:34.130> modified<00:05:34.669> the<00:05:34.789> web<00:05:34.969> to<00:05:35.270> I

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
of them but then I modified the web to I

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.480 
of them but then I modified the web to I
actually<00:05:35.900> what<00:05:36.020> I<00:05:36.050> did<00:05:36.229> is<00:05:36.319> I<00:05:36.409> took<00:05:36.770> this<00:05:37.219> was

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
actually what I did is I took this was

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.059 
actually what I did is I took this was
white<00:05:37.880> and<00:05:38.060> gray<00:05:38.270> web<00:05:39.229> originally<00:05:39.740> and<00:05:39.949> what<00:05:40.039> I

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:40.069 
white and gray web originally and what I

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:41.950 
white and gray web originally and what I
did<00:05:40.280> is<00:05:40.370> I<00:05:40.460> dry<00:05:40.789> brushed<00:05:41.090> purple<00:05:41.509> over<00:05:41.750> top<00:05:41.930> of

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
did is I dry brushed purple over top of

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.620 
did is I dry brushed purple over top of
it<00:05:42.289> so<00:05:42.830> you<00:05:42.889> can<00:05:43.039> see<00:05:43.310> that<00:05:43.729> the<00:05:44.029> web<00:05:44.210> actually

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
it so you can see that the web actually

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.779 
it so you can see that the web actually
has<00:05:44.779> different<00:05:45.680> random<00:05:45.800> tendrils<00:05:46.430> and<00:05:46.550> loops

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789 
has different random tendrils and loops

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:48.610 
has different random tendrils and loops
and<00:05:47.060> stuff<00:05:47.120> that<00:05:47.300> kind<00:05:47.840> of<00:05:47.990> flowed<00:05:48.199> over<00:05:48.440> top

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
and stuff that kind of flowed over top

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.499 
and stuff that kind of flowed over top
of<00:05:48.650> it<00:05:48.919> so<00:05:49.520> I<00:05:49.550> think<00:05:49.669> the<00:05:49.880> purple<00:05:50.300> and<00:05:50.419> the

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:50.509 
of it so I think the purple and the

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:53.439 
of it so I think the purple and the
black<00:05:50.949> that<00:05:51.949> I<00:05:52.009> painted<00:05:52.400> over<00:05:52.699> top<00:05:52.909> of<00:05:52.940> it<00:05:53.210> make

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
black that I painted over top of it make

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.450 
black that I painted over top of it make
it<00:05:53.569> look<00:05:53.810> more<00:05:54.050> like<00:05:54.289> a<00:05:54.500> venom<00:05:54.889> web<00:05:55.069> where<00:05:55.340> it's

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
it look more like a venom web where it's

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.519 
it look more like a venom web where it's
more<00:05:55.669> alive<00:05:56.000> plus<00:05:56.779> I<00:05:56.900> wanted<00:05:57.110> to<00:05:57.199> go<00:05:57.319> a<00:05:57.349> little

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:57.529 
more alive plus I wanted to go a little

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:59.529 
more alive plus I wanted to go a little
bit<00:05:57.680> darker<00:05:57.889> for<00:05:58.279> venom<00:05:58.550> and<00:05:58.759> what<00:05:59.180> this<00:05:59.300> does

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
bit darker for venom and what this does

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.240 
bit darker for venom and what this does
is<00:05:59.719> kind<00:05:59.960> of<00:06:00.050> cool<00:06:00.199> it<00:06:00.469> it<00:06:00.770> fits

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
is kind of cool it it fits

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.219 
is kind of cool it it fits
since<00:06:01.580> its<00:06:01.759> venom<00:06:02.090> it's<00:06:02.539> hard<00:06:02.750> to<00:06:02.840> fit<00:06:02.990> over

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229 
since its venom it's hard to fit over

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.839 
since its venom it's hard to fit over
his<00:06:03.319> hand<00:06:03.650> but<00:06:04.159> this<00:06:04.310> thing<00:06:04.520> will<00:06:04.819> actually

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
his hand but this thing will actually

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.080 
his hand but this thing will actually
fit<00:06:05.770> over<00:06:06.770> top<00:06:06.800> of<00:06:06.979> any<00:06:07.279> of<00:06:07.400> his<00:06:07.490> fingers<00:06:07.880> and

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
fit over top of any of his fingers and

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.670 
fit over top of any of his fingers and
since<00:06:08.360> venom<00:06:08.630> kick<00:06:08.779> controls<00:06:09.169> symbiote

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
since venom kick controls symbiote

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.010 
since venom kick controls symbiote
strands<00:06:10.009> and<00:06:10.219> everything<00:06:10.610> you<00:06:11.599> can<00:06:11.719> make<00:06:11.870> this

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
strands and everything you can make this

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.260 
strands and everything you can make this
thing<00:06:12.199> fit<00:06:12.710> over<00:06:13.069> there<00:06:13.219> and<00:06:13.460> do<00:06:13.639> any<00:06:13.849> kind<00:06:14.210> of

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
thing fit over there and do any kind of

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.580 
thing fit over there and do any kind of
loop-de-loop<00:06:15.699> type<00:06:16.699> thing<00:06:16.969> and<00:06:17.590> it's

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
loop-de-loop type thing and it's

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.070 
loop-de-loop type thing and it's
completely<00:06:19.099> bendable<00:06:19.669> poseable<00:06:20.210> and<00:06:20.569> what's

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
completely bendable poseable and what's

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.700 
completely bendable poseable and what's
pretty<00:06:21.229> cool

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
pretty cool

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.439 
pretty cool
so<00:06:22.219> you<00:06:22.310> can<00:06:22.430> pose<00:06:22.610> it<00:06:22.729> as<00:06:22.819> a<00:06:22.880> web<00:06:23.090> or<00:06:23.120> you<00:06:23.300> could

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449 
so you can pose it as a web or you could

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.330 
so you can pose it as a web or you could
pose<00:06:23.659> it<00:06:23.810> as<00:06:23.930> like<00:06:24.199> a<00:06:24.409> something<00:06:25.039> that<00:06:25.130> venom

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
pose it as like a something that venom

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.700 
pose it as like a something that venom
is<00:06:25.430> controlling<00:06:25.880> as<00:06:25.969> part<00:06:26.180> of<00:06:26.240> a<00:06:26.330> suit<00:06:26.590> and<00:06:27.590> it

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
is controlling as part of a suit and it

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.140 
is controlling as part of a suit and it
just<00:06:27.860> kind<00:06:28.009> of<00:06:28.039> attaches<00:06:28.490> to<00:06:28.610> his<00:06:28.729> hand<00:06:28.940> any

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
just kind of attaches to his hand any

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.290 
just kind of attaches to his hand any
which<00:06:29.360> way<00:06:29.389> you<00:06:29.630> want<00:06:30.050> to<00:06:30.139> pose<00:06:30.979> it<00:06:31.190> so<00:06:31.460> if

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
which way you want to pose it so if

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.700 
which way you want to pose it so if
you're<00:06:32.449> trying<00:06:32.599> to<00:06:32.719> get<00:06:32.810> any<00:06:32.990> spaghetti<00:06:33.409> webs

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
you're trying to get any spaghetti webs

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.159 
you're trying to get any spaghetti webs
and<00:06:34.009> you<00:06:34.190> want<00:06:34.460> your<00:06:34.930> spider-man<00:06:35.930> or<00:06:36.080> your

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
and you want your spider-man or your

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.399 
and you want your spider-man or your
venom<00:06:36.440> to<00:06:36.849> to<00:06:37.849> have<00:06:38.000> those<00:06:38.210> go<00:06:38.839> to<00:06:38.899> check<00:06:39.259> out

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:39.409 
venom to to have those go to check out

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:40.780 
venom to to have those go to check out
spaghetti<00:06:39.800> webs<00:06:40.039> it's<00:06:40.430> on

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
spaghetti webs it's on

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.450 
spaghetti webs it's on
Facebook<00:06:41.180> it's<00:06:41.390> also<00:06:41.540> a<00:06:41.690> YouTube<00:06:42.170> channel<00:06:42.460> you

Facebook it's also a YouTube channel you

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.980 
Facebook it's also a YouTube channel you
could<00:06:43.580> probably<00:06:43.700> find<00:06:43.970> that<00:06:44.210> as<00:06:44.390> part<00:06:44.690> of<00:06:44.750> one

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
could probably find that as part of one

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.310 
could probably find that as part of one
of<00:06:45.020> the<00:06:45.170> subscribers<00:06:45.740> that<00:06:46.730> I<00:06:46.970> have<00:06:47.270> on<00:06:47.570> my<00:06:47.870> my

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
channel I actually subscribe to that to

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.160 
channel I actually subscribe to that to
see<00:06:50.060> if<00:06:50.090> new<00:06:50.300> products<00:06:50.720> I<00:06:50.810> think<00:06:50.840> there's<00:06:51.110> a

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.170 
see if new products I think there's a

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.680 
see if new products I think there's a
couple<00:06:51.290> new<00:06:51.470> products<00:06:51.950> coming<00:06:52.160> out<00:06:52.340> soon<00:06:52.690> from

couple new products coming out soon from

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.140 
couple new products coming out soon from
them<00:06:53.900> so<00:06:54.740> I<00:06:55.010> definitely<00:06:55.280> recommend<00:06:55.490> them<00:06:55.970> I

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
them so I definitely recommend them I

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.640 
them so I definitely recommend them I
like<00:06:56.420> going<00:06:56.690> there<00:06:56.810> instead<00:06:57.200> of<00:06:57.290> making<00:06:57.560> my

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
like going there instead of making my

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.770 
like going there instead of making my
own<00:06:57.680> it's<00:06:58.160> not<00:06:58.310> my<00:06:58.430> expertise<00:06:58.970> and<00:06:59.150> I<00:06:59.240> don't<00:06:59.660> do

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
own it's not my expertise and I don't do

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.960 
own it's not my expertise and I don't do
nearly<00:07:00.200> good<00:07:00.470> enough<00:07:00.530> jobs<00:07:00.950> to<00:07:01.280> make<00:07:01.730> them<00:07:01.910> on

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:01.970 
nearly good enough jobs to make them on

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.400 
nearly good enough jobs to make them on
my<00:07:02.150> own<00:07:02.180> so<00:07:02.540> I'd<00:07:02.660> rather<00:07:02.750> I'd<00:07:03.200> rather

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.410 
my own so I'd rather I'd rather

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.110 
my own so I'd rather I'd rather
outsource<00:07:03.890> that<00:07:04.130> and<00:07:04.310> buy<00:07:04.430> those<00:07:04.640> for<00:07:04.970> the

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 
outsource that and buy those for the
