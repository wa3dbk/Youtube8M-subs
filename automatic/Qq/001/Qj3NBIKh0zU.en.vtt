00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.480 
soon exactly the most dangerous aspect
of<00:03:23.580> any<00:03:23.730> test<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.560> surprises<00:03:25.590> we<00:03:26.070> don't<00:03:26.250> want

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
and they don't have the inclination at

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.980 
and they don't have the inclination at
this<00:06:08.190> point<00:06:08.520> because<00:06:09.300> they're<00:06:09.570> geared

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
this point because they're geared

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.210
