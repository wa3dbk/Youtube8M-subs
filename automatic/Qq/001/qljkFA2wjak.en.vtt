 after a few years the humidity 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.980
 accumulate and the inside of the windows 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.980
 without purpose why 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.080
 the part of a choice also that 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.830
 work the more that is more set to 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.500
 test 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.450
 it's thermal thermos and exposed to 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.400
 sun then is exposed to cold foot 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.290
 reacted to these factors there your land 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.780
 move little between the two cities it can 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.410
 go up to 180 degrees at that moment 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.020
 the thermos is expanding and at 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.110
 cold at night they go on the contrary 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.059
 retract at that moment he creates himself 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.800
 microcracks over the enrolled in 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.780
 middle of the microcracks in 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.780
 the stock market fuster 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.940
 these microcracks the rest but that 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.130
 not seem for years they are going 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.620
 to be the pound continue to have this 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.140

 are the interlayer of the cylisme the cilice 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.050
 was there to capture the moisture 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.120
 then by years his share is planned 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.760
 until silence surrounds 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.260
 the interlayer and bursting with moisture when

 for the environment since it allows 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.280

 pressure that pulls moisture in 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.590
 Persian two holes one hole up to 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.610
 left then in beautiful right side 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.860

 microfilm that will come 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.150
 regulate the pressure of a thermos 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.890
 then over the weeks 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.110
 depending on sun exposure they 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.840
 go dry and during the summer 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.670
 even under the percale air in the part

 it will become as powerful as a 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.100
 term to nine 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.810
 this column was presented to you by 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.120
