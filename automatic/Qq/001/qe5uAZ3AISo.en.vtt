00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999 
fabric and here are the settings that

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:42.129 
fabric and here are the settings that
you'll<00:01:39.329> need<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:40.020> second<00:01:40.499> one<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.280> overcast

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:42.139 
you'll need the second one is overcast
