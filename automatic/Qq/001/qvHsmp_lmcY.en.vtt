nice<00:01:45.720> animal<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:48.030> course<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.480> only

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
nice animal and of course it you only

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.570 
nice animal and of course it you only
get<00:01:48.810> into<00:01:49.050> it<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:50.040> her<00:01:50.130> hair<00:01:51.230> for<00:01:52.230> the<00:01:52.320> four

get into it to her hair for the four
same<00:01:53.580> shit<00:01:55.160> stops<00:01:56.160> it<00:01:58.160> so<00:01:59.160> that's<00:01:59.340> part<00:01:59.700> 5<00:02:00.030> I

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
same shit stops it so that's part 5 I

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.250 
same shit stops it so that's part 5 I
think<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.020> easiest<00:02:01.230> part<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.070> do<00:02:03.260> other

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
think the easiest part you can do other

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
think the easiest part you can do other
than<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.650> stretches<00:02:04.980> of<00:02:05.100> course<00:02:06.230> like

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
than the stretches of course like
