question<00:01:04.000> for<00:01:04.239> today<00:01:06.869> let's<00:01:07.869> take<00:01:08.050> a<00:01:08.080> look<00:01:08.320> at

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
question for today let's take a look at

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.080 
question for today let's take a look at
the<00:01:08.530> reference<00:01:08.920> photo<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:09.460> I'll<00:01:09.610> give<00:01:09.820> you<00:01:09.940> my

the reference photo and I'll give you my

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.870 
the reference photo and I'll give you my
first<00:01:10.300> tip<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.710> first<00:01:12.010> thing<00:01:12.220> you<00:01:12.369> can<00:01:12.520> do<00:01:12.700> is

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
first tip the first thing you can do is

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.810 
first tip the first thing you can do is
identify<00:01:13.470> where<00:01:14.470> is<00:01:14.650> the<00:01:14.770> light<00:01:14.979> coming<00:01:15.490> from

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
identify where is the light coming from

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.070 
identify where is the light coming from
and<00:01:16.330> how<00:01:17.140> does<00:01:17.200> it<00:01:17.500> affect<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:18.100> object<00:01:18.820> we<00:01:19.780> see

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
and how does it affect the object we see

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.410 
and how does it affect the object we see
that<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.500> light<00:01:20.680> is<00:01:20.830> coming<00:01:21.040> from<00:01:21.310> above<00:01:21.490> and

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
that the light is coming from above and

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.780 
that the light is coming from above and
sort<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:22.869> at<00:01:23.020> an<00:01:23.140> angle<00:01:23.259> you<00:01:24.250> can<00:01:24.430> see<00:01:24.610> the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
sort of at an angle you can see the

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.550 
sort of at an angle you can see the
angle<00:01:24.940> because<00:01:25.780> of<00:01:25.899> the<00:01:26.020> angle<00:01:26.350> of<00:01:26.410> the

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
angle because of the angle of the

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.450 
angle because of the angle of the
shadows<00:01:27.009> and<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:28.330> can<00:01:28.479> also<00:01:28.660> see<00:01:29.020> that<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
shadows and you can also see that the

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.590 
shadows and you can also see that the
whole<00:01:30.670> face<00:01:31.090> is<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.979> showered<00:01:32.979> in<00:01:33.100> light<00:01:33.390> 3/4<00:01:34.390> of

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
whole face is a showered in light 3/4 of

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:46.460 
whole face is a showered in light 3/4 of
the<00:01:34.720> face<00:01:34.960> bits

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.230 

now<00:01:47.470> let's<00:01:47.770> take<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:47.950> look<00:01:48.220> at<00:01:48.430> the<00:01:48.760> sketch<00:01:49.090> I

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
now let's take a look at the sketch I

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
now let's take a look at the sketch I
prepared<00:01:49.660> before<00:01:50.050> I<00:01:50.080> did<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.440> painting<00:01:50.710> you

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
prepared before I did the painting you

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.120 
prepared before I did the painting you
notice<00:01:53.260> that<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:55.750> top<00:01:56.110> of<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.500> primary<00:01:56.950> light

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
notice that on top of the primary light

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.499 
notice that on top of the primary light
source<00:01:57.460> is<00:01:57.790> also<00:01:58.060> a<00:01:58.420> secondary<00:01:59.170> light<00:01:59.500> source

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
source is also a secondary light source

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.730 
source is also a secondary light source
secondary<00:02:01.509> light<00:02:01.720> source<00:02:02.020> could<00:02:02.259> be<00:02:02.320> anything

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
secondary light source could be anything

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.060 
secondary light source could be anything
from<00:02:04.020> reflected<00:02:05.020> light<00:02:05.229> off<00:02:05.440> of<00:02:05.530> something

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
from reflected light off of something

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.490 
from reflected light off of something
light<00:02:06.280> in<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.490> background<00:02:06.700> maybe<00:02:07.300> a<00:02:07.450> flash<00:02:07.869> or

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
light in the background maybe a flash or

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.260 
light in the background maybe a flash or
just<00:02:09.009> a<00:02:09.130> light<00:02:09.310> on<00:02:09.520> somewhere<00:02:09.910> else

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
just a light on somewhere else

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:18.150 
just a light on somewhere else
a<00:02:15.780> secondary<00:02:16.780> light<00:02:17.080> source<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.590> really<00:02:17.920> help

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
a secondary light source to really help

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:29.309 
a secondary light source to really help
round<00:02:18.430> out<00:02:18.700> an<00:02:18.940> object

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.470 

we're<00:02:29.920> concerned<00:02:30.310> with<00:02:30.519> two<00:02:30.730> different<00:02:31.150> kinds

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
we're concerned with two different kinds

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.720 
we're concerned with two different kinds
of<00:02:31.540> life<00:02:32.700> glassy<00:02:33.700> or<00:02:34.329> diffuse<00:02:35.010> now<00:02:36.010> glossy

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
of life glassy or diffuse now glossy

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.209 
of life glassy or diffuse now glossy
light<00:02:36.909> reflects<00:02:37.480> directly<00:02:37.799> back<00:02:38.799> to<00:02:38.829> your<00:02:39.189> eye

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:39.219 
light reflects directly back to your eye

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.000 
light reflects directly back to your eye
and<00:02:39.790> it's<00:02:40.450> like<00:02:40.689> a<00:02:40.719> real<00:02:41.049> hard<00:02:41.349> kind<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.799> life

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
and it's like a real hard kind of life

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.940 
and it's like a real hard kind of life
the<00:02:42.849> fuse<00:02:43.180> light<00:02:43.480> kind<00:02:44.170> of<00:02:44.319> shoots<00:02:44.560> off<00:02:44.769> in

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
the fuse light kind of shoots off in

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.170 
the fuse light kind of shoots off in
every<00:02:45.129> single<00:02:45.609> direction<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.870> it's<00:02:47.019> soft

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
every single direction and it's soft

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.210 
every single direction and it's soft
it's<00:02:49.180> easy<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.629> identify<00:02:49.750> like<00:02:50.650> something<00:02:51.099> is

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
it's easy to identify like something is

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.960 
it's easy to identify like something is
wet<00:02:51.489> it's<00:02:51.670> automatically<00:02:52.299> lost<00:02:52.629> and

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
wet it's automatically lost and

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.089 
wet it's automatically lost and
something<00:02:54.970> say<00:02:55.209> like<00:02:55.239> wood<00:02:55.959> so<00:02:56.590> automatically

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
something say like wood so automatically

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.410 
something say like wood so automatically
diffuse<00:02:57.870> it's<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.959> really<00:02:59.260> matte<00:02:59.469> surface<00:03:00.420> so

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
diffuse it's a really matte surface so

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.849 
diffuse it's a really matte surface so
when<00:03:01.599> you're<00:03:01.750> looking<00:03:02.049> at<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.319> skin<00:03:02.620> and

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
when you're looking at the skin and

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.970 
when you're looking at the skin and
seeing<00:03:03.159> how<00:03:03.310> light<00:03:03.639> reflects<00:03:04.299> off<00:03:04.540> it<00:03:04.980> you

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
seeing how light reflects off it you

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.440 
seeing how light reflects off it you
know<00:03:06.129> if<00:03:06.250> they're<00:03:06.459> like<00:03:06.609> sweating<00:03:07.150> or

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
know if they're like sweating or

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.699 
know if they're like sweating or
something<00:03:07.780> like<00:03:07.900> that<00:03:07.959> you<00:03:08.260> gotta<00:03:08.409> get<00:03:08.530> some

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
something like that you gotta get some

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.569 
something like that you gotta get some
glossy<00:03:08.889> light<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:11.129> like<00:03:12.129> when<00:03:12.430> you're

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
glossy light and like when you're

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.819 
glossy light and like when you're
painting<00:03:12.970> objects<00:03:13.689> like<00:03:13.900> clothes<00:03:14.290> they

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
painting objects like clothes they

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.550 
painting objects like clothes they
usually<00:03:15.069> diffused<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.959> know<00:03:17.079> the<00:03:17.200> highlights

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
usually diffused you know the highlights

you<00:03:23.019> look<00:03:23.169> at<00:03:23.319> the<00:03:23.409> final<00:03:23.769> painting<00:03:23.980> that<00:03:24.159> I

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
you look at the final painting that I

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.210 
you look at the final painting that I
made<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:25.239> shapes<00:03:25.569> are<00:03:26.139> usually<00:03:26.620> very<00:03:26.919> hard

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
made the shapes are usually very hard

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.460 
made the shapes are usually very hard
and<00:03:27.489> not<00:03:27.639> very<00:03:27.879> soft<00:03:28.329> well<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:28.959> really<00:03:29.079> depends

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
and not very soft well it really depends

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.009 
and not very soft well it really depends
on<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.739> fabric<00:03:30.189> it's<00:03:31.180> something<00:03:31.599> to<00:03:31.689> keep<00:03:31.840> in

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
on the fabric it's something to keep in

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:42.910 
on the fabric it's something to keep in
mind

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.320 

things<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.220> aren't<00:03:44.370> alight<00:03:44.700> are<00:03:44.970> usually

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
things that aren't alight are usually

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.840 
things that aren't alight are usually
well<00:03:45.540> defined<00:03:46.100> while<00:03:47.100> things<00:03:47.370> in<00:03:47.490> the<00:03:47.580> shadow

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
well defined while things in the shadow

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.100 
well defined while things in the shadow
hard<00:03:48.420> as<00:03:48.600> much<00:03:49.160> like<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.730> eyes<00:03:51.420> would<00:03:51.780> be<00:03:51.900> more

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
hard as much like the eyes would be more

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:05.630 
hard as much like the eyes would be more
defined<00:03:52.470> than<00:03:52.890> say<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.400> ears

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.220 

let's<00:04:06.210> take<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:06.420> look<00:04:06.630> at<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.870> couple<00:04:07.050> of

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
let's take a look at a couple of

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.590 
let's take a look at a couple of
drawings<00:04:07.740> for<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.010> purpose<00:04:08.430> of<00:04:08.640> compare<00:04:09.420> and

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
drawings for the purpose of compare and

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.160 
drawings for the purpose of compare and
contrast<00:04:10.280> look<00:04:11.280> at<00:04:11.430> how<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:11.610> contrast<00:04:12.390> seems

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
contrast look at how the contrast seems

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.990 
contrast look at how the contrast seems
to<00:04:13.410> make<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.710> thing<00:04:13.980> just<00:04:14.220> jump<00:04:14.640> right<00:04:14.850> off

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
to make the thing just jump right off

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000 
to make the thing just jump right off
the<00:04:15.300> page<00:04:15.480> at<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:15.840> something<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:16.859> have<00:04:16.950> to

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
the page at you something you have to

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.430 
the page at you something you have to
keep<00:04:17.250> in<00:04:17.430> mind<00:04:17.640> when<00:04:18.000> you're<00:04:18.180> you're<00:04:18.989> painting

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
keep in mind when you're you're painting

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.530 
keep in mind when you're you're painting
it's<00:04:20.100> easy<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.549> see<00:04:20.790> with<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.030> drawing<00:04:21.359> that's

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
it's easy to see with the drawing that's

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.600 
it's easy to see with the drawing that's
why<00:04:21.690> we<00:04:21.810> have<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.019> drawing<00:04:22.410> out<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:23.370> how<00:04:23.550> the

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
why we have the drawing out and how the

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.510 
why we have the drawing out and how the
soft<00:04:24.060> gradation<00:04:24.870> tones<00:04:25.380> kind<00:04:25.860> of<00:04:26.010> gives<00:04:26.340> the

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
soft gradation tones kind of gives the

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.410 
soft gradation tones kind of gives the
thing<00:04:26.760> formed<00:04:27.650> in<00:04:28.650> this<00:04:28.860> second<00:04:29.340> drawing<00:04:29.640> it

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
thing formed in this second drawing it

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.450 
thing formed in this second drawing it
doesn't<00:04:30.600> come<00:04:31.050> out<00:04:31.290> at<00:04:31.620> you<00:04:31.800> as<00:04:31.920> much<00:04:32.160> as<00:04:32.340> the

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
doesn't come out at you as much as the

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.520 
doesn't come out at you as much as the
first<00:04:32.900> because<00:04:33.900> there<00:04:34.140> isn't<00:04:34.290> as<00:04:34.500> much

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
first because there isn't as much

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:44.600 
first because there isn't as much
contrast<00:04:42.800> even<00:04:43.800> though<00:04:44.010> we're<00:04:44.250> dealing<00:04:44.430> with

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.200 
contrast even though we're dealing with
color<00:04:45.000> it's<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.450> same<00:04:45.690> kind<00:04:46.050> of<00:04:46.110> idea<00:04:46.910> if<00:04:47.910> the

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
color it's the same kind of idea if the

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.270 
color it's the same kind of idea if the
picture<00:04:48.630> that<00:04:48.840> you're<00:04:49.050> painting<00:04:49.500> from<00:04:49.890> has<00:04:50.250> a
