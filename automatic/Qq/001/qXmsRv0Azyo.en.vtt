really<00:03:26.480> burning<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.720> little<00:03:27.900> bit<00:03:28.230> but<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:28.620> sort

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
really burning a little bit but it sort

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.320 
really burning a little bit but it sort
of<00:03:28.890> smolders<00:03:29.550> and<00:03:29.730> then<00:03:29.819> it's<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.090> stuff

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
of smolders and then it's the stuff

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.890 
of smolders and then it's the stuff
round<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.720> outside<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:31.470> burns<00:03:32.480> its<00:03:33.480> kind<00:03:33.780> of

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
round the outside that burns its kind of

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:45.610 
round the outside that burns its kind of
stuff<00:03:34.140> burns<00:03:34.410> very<00:03:34.770> quickly

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.729 

hmm

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
hmm

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.510 
hmm
so<00:03:46.950> quite<00:03:47.430> fire<00:03:47.760> brief<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.239> think<00:03:49.520> was

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
so quite fire brief I think was

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.310 
so quite fire brief I think was
intending<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.150> burn<00:03:51.450> this<00:03:51.630> whole<00:03:51.810> Bale<00:03:52.020> and<00:03:52.260> we

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
intending to burn this whole Bale and we

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.580 
intending to burn this whole Bale and we
have<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.590> hose<00:03:52.770> and<00:03:53.070> things<00:03:53.280> on<00:03:53.489> standby<00:03:53.940> said

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
have the hose and things on standby said

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.310 
have the hose and things on standby said
so<00:03:55.590> they'll<00:03:55.770> be<00:03:55.920> disappointing<00:03:56.550> in<00:03:56.640> some<00:03:56.880> ways

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
so they'll be disappointing in some ways

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.650 
so they'll be disappointing in some ways
there<00:03:58.320> we<00:03:58.530> go<00:03:58.760> okay<00:03:59.760> so<00:03:59.820> we<00:04:00.060> how<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.209> think<00:04:00.480> over

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
there we go okay so we how to think over

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:25.120 
there we go okay so we how to think over
lunch

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.130 

the<00:04:25.490> new<00:04:25.700> attempt<00:04:26.060> of<00:04:26.210> testing<00:04:26.990> to

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
the new attempt of testing to

00:04:27.140 --> 00:06:16.010 
the new attempt of testing to
destruction

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.440 

soon<00:06:17.020> after<00:06:17.350> that<00:06:17.410> we<00:06:17.800> ran<00:06:18.070> out<00:06:18.250> of<00:06:18.280> time<00:06:18.610> it

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
soon after that we ran out of time it

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.320 
soon after that we ran out of time it
all<00:06:19.690> took<00:06:19.960> a<00:06:20.020> lot<00:06:20.320> longer<00:06:20.350> than<00:06:20.740> expected

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
all took a lot longer than expected

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.940 
all took a lot longer than expected
mainly<00:06:22.330> the<00:06:22.630> Bayeux<00:06:22.810> stayed<00:06:23.200> intact<00:06:23.410> which

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
mainly the Bayeux stayed intact which

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.010 
mainly the Bayeux stayed intact which
was<00:06:24.160> kind<00:06:24.400> of<00:06:24.490> good<00:06:24.700> even<00:06:25.540> when<00:06:25.690> the<00:06:25.840> bail

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
was kind of good even when the bail

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.810 
was kind of good even when the bail
strings<00:06:26.500> burnt<00:06:26.980> through<00:06:27.280> about<00:06:27.550> halfway

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
strings burnt through about halfway

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.240 
strings burnt through about halfway
through<00:06:28.060> this<00:06:28.630> it<00:06:29.470> still<00:06:29.770> held<00:06:30.040> together

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
through this it still held together

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.850 
through this it still held together
quite<00:06:30.790> well<00:06:31.030> the<00:06:31.390> plaster<00:06:32.260> on<00:06:32.320> the<00:06:32.380> outside

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
quite well the plaster on the outside

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.040 
quite well the plaster on the outside
really<00:06:33.190> kept<00:06:33.520> the<00:06:33.640> structure<00:06:34.180> together<00:06:34.540> so

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
really kept the structure together so

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.930 
really kept the structure together so
yeah<00:06:35.320> even<00:06:35.560> though<00:06:35.830> this<00:06:36.010> was<00:06:36.250> nothing<00:06:36.520> like<00:06:36.910> a

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
yeah even though this was nothing like a

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.920 
yeah even though this was nothing like a
scientific<00:06:37.750> test<00:06:38.020> this<00:06:38.920> door<00:06:39.190> so<00:06:39.370> shows<00:06:39.930> straw
