00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
okay let's start off with the wirings so

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.300 
okay let's start off with the wirings so
the<00:01:29.020> first<00:01:29.230> thing<00:01:29.380> I<00:01:29.470> did<00:01:29.590> was<00:01:29.740> remove<00:01:30.130> the

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
the first thing I did was remove the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:02:29.430 
the first thing I did was remove the
bumper

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.770 

okay<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:31.130> best<00:02:31.370> spot<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:31.880> I've<00:02:31.970> found<00:02:32.210> to

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
okay so the best spot that I've found to

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.320 
okay so the best spot that I've found to
hook<00:02:33.110> up<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:34.070> power<00:02:34.250> cable<00:02:34.910> which<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.060> this

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
hook up the power cable which is this

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.030 
hook up the power cable which is this
one<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.780> right<00:02:35.990> here<00:02:36.020> -<00:02:36.380> this<00:02:36.500> 10<00:02:36.710> millimeter

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
one is right here - this 10 millimeter

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.120 
one is right here - this 10 millimeter
bolt<00:02:38.080> goes<00:02:39.080> up<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.440> your<00:02:39.560> positive<00:02:39.950> battery

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
bolt goes up to your positive battery

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:52.480 
bolt goes up to your positive battery
terminal

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.770 

take<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.910> weight<00:02:53.090> on<00:02:53.300> there

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.600 

now<00:02:59.170> it<00:02:59.350> gives<00:02:59.500> it<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.770> nice<00:02:59.950> little<00:03:00.160> stuffy

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
now it gives it a nice little stuffy

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.280 
now it gives it a nice little stuffy
wood

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
wood

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.460 
wood
it<00:03:01.709> was<00:03:01.829> kind<00:03:02.069> of

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
it was kind of

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.390 
it was kind of
over<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:03.920> one<00:03:04.130> that

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.240 

too<00:03:09.060> busy

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
too busy

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.280 
too busy
but

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
but

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.110 
but
just<00:03:12.860> try<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.040> hide<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.310> below

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.270 

and<00:03:17.480> then<00:03:17.599> to<00:03:17.750> hook<00:03:17.870> up<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.170> relay<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.650> found

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
and then to hook up the relay it found

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.949 
and then to hook up the relay it found
this<00:03:19.400> 10<00:03:19.580> millimeter<00:03:19.970> bolt<00:03:20.150> right<00:03:20.330> behind<00:03:20.750> the

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
this 10 millimeter bolt right behind the

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.740 
this 10 millimeter bolt right behind the
fuse<00:03:21.200> box<00:03:21.410> looks<00:03:22.010> like<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.190> nice<00:03:22.459> spot<00:03:22.489> to<00:03:23.150> put

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
fuse box looks like a nice spot to put

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.830 
fuse box looks like a nice spot to put
the<00:03:23.900> relay<00:03:24.730> next<00:03:25.730> all<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.030> fuses<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:26.569> stuff

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
the relay next all the fuses and stuff

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:35.559 
the relay next all the fuses and stuff
can<00:03:27.590> I<00:03:27.650> just<00:03:27.920> make<00:03:28.069> sense<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.519> little<00:03:28.730> bit<00:03:34.569> goes

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
can I just make sense a little bit goes

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.229 
can I just make sense a little bit goes
wrong<00:03:35.810> it's<00:03:36.410> accessible<00:03:36.830> you<00:03:37.670> can<00:03:37.819> get<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.150> the

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
wrong it's accessible you can get to the

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:57.180 
wrong it's accessible you can get to the
fuse<00:03:54.280> that's<00:03:55.280> what's<00:03:55.519> up<00:03:55.700> we<00:03:56.329> now<00:03:56.450> have<00:03:56.690> power

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
fuse that's what's up we now have power

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.589 
fuse that's what's up we now have power
to<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.220> fog<00:03:58.519> lights<00:03:58.790> this<00:03:58.970> is<00:03:59.030> where<00:03:59.329> this<00:03:59.540> is

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
to the fog lights this is where this is

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.869 
to the fog lights this is where this is
going<00:03:59.780> to<00:03:59.840> be<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.019> main<00:04:00.230> power<00:04:00.610> but<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:01.700> pub

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
going to be the main power but the pub

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.640 
going to be the main power but the pub
lights<00:04:02.090> are<00:04:02.209> going<00:04:02.299> to<00:04:02.390> get<00:04:02.540> an<00:04:03.049> eye<00:04:03.260> on<00:04:03.379> it<00:04:03.530> you

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
lights are going to get an eye on it you

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.110 
lights are going to get an eye on it you
have<00:04:03.829> your<00:04:04.519> wiring<00:04:05.140> where<00:04:06.140> you<00:04:06.230> want<00:04:06.410> to<00:04:06.739> want

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
have your wiring where you want to want

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.400 
have your wiring where you want to want
one<00:04:08.120> of<00:04:08.150> them<00:04:08.329> over<00:04:08.510> here<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:09.049> another<00:04:09.290> one

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
one of them over here and another one

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:21.400 
one of them over here and another one
over<00:04:09.709> there

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:42.000 

you

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.590 

okay<00:04:43.010> right<00:04:43.250> down<00:04:43.430> on<00:04:43.580> here<00:04:43.910> if<00:04:44.210> you<00:04:44.300> follow

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
okay right down on here if you follow

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.510 
okay right down on here if you follow
the<00:04:44.870> main<00:04:45.050> darkness<00:04:45.770> to<00:04:45.950> go<00:04:46.070> through<00:04:46.400> the

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
the main darkness to go through the

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.200 
the main darkness to go through the
firewall<00:04:46.990> there<00:04:47.990> is<00:04:48.200> actually<00:04:48.950> like<00:04:49.820> a<00:04:49.850> little

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
firewall there is actually like a little

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.510 
firewall there is actually like a little
cylinder<00:04:50.690> that<00:04:51.140> comes<00:04:51.320> out<00:04:51.620> of<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:51.980> ceiling

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
cylinder that comes out of the ceiling

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.350 
cylinder that comes out of the ceiling
for<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.150> wine<00:04:53.390> harness<00:04:53.810> at<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.680> rubber<00:04:54.860> piece

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
for the wine harness at the rubber piece

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.440 
for the wine harness at the rubber piece
was<00:04:56.360> cut<00:04:56.780> off<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:57.380> tip<00:04:57.650> with<00:05:01.300> definitely<00:05:02.300> to

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
was cut off the tip with definitely to

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.030 
was cut off the tip with definitely to
get<00:05:02.540> in<00:05:02.690> there<00:05:02.870> much<00:05:03.680> less<00:05:03.950> to<00:05:04.220> see<00:05:05.200> off<00:05:06.200> you

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
get in there much less to see off you

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.730 
get in there much less to see off you
can<00:05:07.220> run<00:05:07.370> this<00:05:07.700> wire<00:05:08.140> is<00:05:09.140> basically<00:05:09.500> this

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
can run this wire is basically this

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.370 
can run this wire is basically this
yellow<00:05:09.920> one<00:05:10.210> run<00:05:11.210> it<00:05:11.360> through<00:05:11.510> there<00:05:11.780> so<00:05:12.320> it

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
yellow one run it through there so it

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.900 
yellow one run it through there so it
goes<00:05:12.500> through<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:12.890> firewall<00:05:13.340> and<00:05:13.550> then<00:05:13.820> you

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
goes through the firewall and then you

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.520 
goes through the firewall and then you
pick<00:05:14.090> you<00:05:14.270> catch<00:05:14.480> it<00:05:14.630> over<00:05:14.720> there<00:05:15.020> it's<00:05:15.440> a

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
pick you catch it over there it's a

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.470 
pick you catch it over there it's a
little<00:05:15.740> bit<00:05:15.830> difficult<00:05:16.010> to<00:05:16.310> see<00:05:16.580> in<00:05:16.700> there<00:05:16.880> but

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
little bit difficult to see in there but

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.030 
little bit difficult to see in there but
you<00:05:17.570> guys<00:05:17.720> once<00:05:18.230> you<00:05:18.350> guys<00:05:18.500> are<00:05:18.650> there<00:05:18.770> that

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
you guys once you guys are there that

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.440 
you guys once you guys are there that
this<00:05:19.190> step<00:05:19.370> you'll<00:05:19.520> be<00:05:19.640> able<00:05:19.790> to<00:05:19.850> see<00:05:20.000> what<00:05:20.390> I

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
this step you'll be able to see what I

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.650 
this step you'll be able to see what I
mean

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
mean

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.020 
mean
okay<00:05:21.320> so<00:05:21.380> I<00:05:21.530> went<00:05:21.710> ahead<00:05:21.770> and<00:05:21.950> remove<00:05:22.850> the

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
okay so I went ahead and remove the

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.340 
okay so I went ahead and remove the
panel<00:05:24.040> basically<00:05:25.040> one<00:05:25.820> Phillips<00:05:26.450> one<00:05:27.140> bolt

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
panel basically one Phillips one bolt

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.100 
panel basically one Phillips one bolt
there<00:05:27.970> one<00:05:28.970> screw<00:05:29.180> there<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:29.480> one<00:05:29.570> screw<00:05:29.810> here

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
there one screw there and one screw here
