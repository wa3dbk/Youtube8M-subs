00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
center they can sort of communicate as

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.530 
center they can sort of communicate as
you<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.110> see<00:00:34.290> there's<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.559> rook<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.190> d1<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.850> rook

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
you can see there's a rook on d1 a rook

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.270 
you can see there's a rook on d1 a rook
on<00:00:36.660> h1<00:00:37.050> there<00:00:37.260> are<00:00:37.350> no<00:00:37.440> pieces<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.920> between

on h1 there are no pieces in between

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.280 
on h1 there are no pieces in between
those<00:00:38.460> rooks<00:00:38.730> we<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.540> say<00:00:39.719> basically<00:00:40.140> that

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
those rooks we can say basically that

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.500 
those rooks we can say basically that
the<00:00:40.710> opening<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.129> over<00:00:41.460> for<00:00:41.670> white<00:00:41.820> black

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
d8 square so that these two rooks can

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.830 
d8 square so that these two rooks can
sort<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.100> communicate<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.420> opening<00:00:48.719> will<00:00:48.809> be

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
sort of communicate the opening will be

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.959

then<00:00:49.230> over<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.680> black<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.579> middle<00:00:50.789> game

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969

to attack the others King whenever there

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
is an attack on the wing in chess we are

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.179 
is an attack on the wing in chess we are
taught<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.720> counter-attack<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> center

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
taught to counter-attack in the center

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.640 
taught to counter-attack in the center
in<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:24.119> case<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:24.810> white<00:01:24.990> attacks<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.530> this

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
in this case when white attacks on this

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.960 
in this case when white attacks on this
wing<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.009> will<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.220> difficult<00:01:26.640> for<00:01:26.670> black<00:01:26.880> to

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
wing it will be difficult for black to

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.679 
wing it will be difficult for black to
counter-attack

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
counter-attack

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.870 
counter-attack
in<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.350> center<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.340> black<00:01:29.610> must

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
in the center so black must

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.429 
in the center so black must
counter-attack<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.780> opposite<00:01:31.200> wing

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
counter-attack on the opposite wing

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.069 
counter-attack on the opposite wing
white<00:01:32.340> will<00:01:32.520> attack<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:32.970> King<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.450> black

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
white will attack this King and black

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.020 
white will attack this King and black
will<00:01:34.530> somehow<00:01:34.890> try<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.189> get<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.790> King

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
will somehow try to get to this King

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.210 
will somehow try to get to this King
let's<00:01:36.990> see<00:01:37.110> how<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.320> might<00:01:37.439> work<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.070> White's

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
let's see how that might work so White's

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.880 
let's see how that might work so White's
turn<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.549> move<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:38.880> position<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.890> white

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
turn to move in this position if white

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.130 
turn to move in this position if white
moves<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.250> Bishop<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:42.509> h6

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
moves the Bishop to h6

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.080 
moves the Bishop to h6
the<00:01:43.740> plan<00:01:43.979> for<00:01:44.250> white<00:01:44.399> would<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.939> maybe

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the plan for white would be to maybe

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.090 
the plan for white would be to maybe
remove<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.960> defender<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.649> King<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
remove this defender of the King and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.130 
remove this defender of the King and
push<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.970> pawns<00:01:48.180> forward<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.750> try<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.960> open

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
push the pawns forward to try to open

this<00:02:14.849> Queen<00:02:15.120> obviously<00:02:15.480> needs<00:02:15.660> help<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.990> can't

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
this Queen obviously needs help I can't

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.650 
this Queen obviously needs help I can't
checkmate<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.620> king<00:02:16.800> by<00:02:16.920> itself<00:02:17.459> so<00:02:18.390> black

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
checkmate the king by itself so black

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.160 
checkmate the king by itself so black
needs<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.500> counter-attack<00:02:19.860> on<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.670> wing<00:02:20.910> in

needs to counter-attack on this wing in
this<00:02:22.170> case<00:02:22.410> it's<00:02:22.650> well<00:02:22.800> known<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.220> best

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
this case it's well known that the best

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.199 
this case it's well known that the best
move<00:02:23.580> for<00:02:23.610> black<00:02:23.849> is<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:25.380> capture<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.890> Knight

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
move for black is to capture this Knight

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.900 
move for black is to capture this Knight
to<00:02:27.209> sacrifice<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:28.140> rook<00:02:28.349> which<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.550> more

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
to sacrifice the rook which is more

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.830 
to sacrifice the rook which is more
powerful<00:02:30.209> than<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.540> knight<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:33.120> breach<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
powerful than the knight to breach the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.390 
powerful than the knight to breach the
black<00:02:34.080> pawns<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.739> white<00:02:34.890> pawn<00:02:35.100> structure

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
black pawns the white pawn structure

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.550 
black pawns the white pawn structure
around<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:36.030> King<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.440> other

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
around this King and so that the other

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.070 
around this King and so that the other
pieces<00:02:37.830> can<00:02:38.130> stream<00:02:38.430> in<00:02:38.630> so<00:02:39.630> now<00:02:39.750> it's<00:02:39.900> blacks

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
pieces can stream in so now it's blacks

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.790 
pieces can stream in so now it's blacks
turn<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.380> move<00:02:40.790> then<00:02:41.790> black<00:02:42.120> moves<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.510> Queen

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
turn to move then black moves the Queen

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.309 
turn to move then black moves the Queen
to<00:02:43.800> a5<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:45.180> other<00:02:45.330> good<00:02:45.510> move<00:02:45.690> for<00:02:45.930> black<00:02:45.989> is

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
to a5 the other good move for black is

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.320 
to a5 the other good move for black is
the<00:02:46.800> Queen<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.100> c7<00:02:47.430> which<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.819> attacking<00:02:48.120> the

the Queen to c7 which is attacking the
pawn<00:02:48.480> on<00:02:48.680> c3<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.340> now<00:02:51.769> let's<00:02:52.769> suppose<00:02:52.920> white

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
pawn on c3 and now let's suppose white

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.539 
pawn on c3 and now let's suppose white
tries<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.819> defend<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.239> pawn<00:02:55.130> maybe<00:02:56.130> with<00:02:56.430> the

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
tries to defend this pawn maybe with the

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.240 
tries to defend this pawn maybe with the
King<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.940> King<00:02:57.150> might<00:02:57.330> go<00:02:57.510> up<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.010> square

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
King the King might go up to the square

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.240 
King the King might go up to the square
to<00:02:59.310> defend<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.790> pawn<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.890> black<00:03:01.890> will<00:03:02.100> now

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
to defend the pawn and black will now

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.479 
to defend the pawn and black will now
bring<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.880> rook<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.989> c8<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.590> now<00:03:05.160> we<00:03:05.220> have<00:03:05.459> a

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
bring the rook to c8 and now we have a

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.570 
bring the rook to c8 and now we have a
Queen<00:03:05.819> and<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.269> rook<00:03:06.420> attacking<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.019> pawn<00:03:07.230> on

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
Queen and the rook attacking the pawn on

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.270 
Queen and the rook attacking the pawn on
c3<00:03:08.959> this<00:03:09.959> pawn<00:03:10.200> needs<00:03:10.410> protection<00:03:10.739> we<00:03:11.040> can't

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
c3 this pawn needs protection we can't

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.979 
c3 this pawn needs protection we can't
place<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.610> rook<00:03:11.790> on<00:03:11.940> d3<00:03:12.360> because<00:03:12.540> this<00:03:12.780> Knight

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
place the rook on d3 because this Knight

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.289 
place the rook on d3 because this Knight
will<00:03:13.110> capture<00:03:13.319> it<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:14.220> maybe<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.640> Queen<00:03:14.910> will

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
will capture it so maybe the Queen will

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.660 
will capture it so maybe the Queen will
hustle<00:03:15.930> back<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.799> try<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.040> defend<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:17.489> pawn

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
hustle back to try to defend this pawn

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.050 
hustle back to try to defend this pawn
and<00:03:17.970> now<00:03:18.780> all<00:03:18.930> of<00:03:19.049> a<00:03:19.140> sudden<00:03:19.170> it's<00:03:19.650> white<00:03:20.579> who

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
and now all of a sudden it's white who

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.000 
and now all of a sudden it's white who
must<00:03:21.269> defend<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.690> King<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.079> the<00:03:22.530> black<00:03:22.739> king

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
must defend the King and the black king

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.500 
must defend the King and the black king
is<00:03:23.160> safe<00:03:23.370> for<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.640> moment<00:03:23.970> it's<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.150> perfect

example of how to how to counter-attack
in<00:03:26.370> chess<00:03:27.380> let's<00:03:28.380> see<00:03:28.530> how<00:03:28.590> this

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
in chess let's see how this

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.319 
in chess let's see how this
counterattack<00:03:29.280> might<00:03:29.459> continue<00:03:29.790> if<00:03:30.090> white

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
counterattack might continue if white

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.349 
counterattack might continue if white
does<00:03:30.870> not<00:03:31.049> defend<00:03:31.350> perfectly<00:03:32.060> let's<00:03:33.060> suppose

does not defend perfectly let's suppose
the<00:03:33.840> Queen<00:03:34.109> moves<00:03:35.630> to<00:03:36.630> b6<00:03:37.070> setting<00:03:38.070> a<00:03:38.280> really

neat little trap and if white is unaware
for<00:03:41.820> example<00:03:42.359> and<00:03:42.570> starts<00:03:42.900> attacking<00:03:43.140> the

the<00:04:20.310> object<00:04:20.639> lesson<00:04:20.970> here<00:04:21.180> is<00:04:21.329> when<00:04:21.630> you're

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
the object lesson here is when you're

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.120 
the object lesson here is when you're
under<00:04:22.109> pressure<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.560> you're<00:04:22.650> being<00:04:22.830> attacked

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
under pressure and you're being attacked

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.520 
under pressure and you're being attacked
look<00:04:23.909> for<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.180> way<00:04:24.360> to<00:04:24.390> counter-attack<00:04:24.990> if<00:04:25.440> you

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
look for a way to counter-attack if you

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.220 
look for a way to counter-attack if you
cannot<00:04:25.740> do<00:04:25.919> it<00:04:25.950> in<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.280> center

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
cannot do it in the center

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.690 
cannot do it in the center
then<00:04:27.470> you<00:04:27.620> try<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.800> do<00:04:27.980> it<00:04:28.070> on<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.280> other<00:04:28.430> wing

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
then you try to do it on the other wing

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.510 
then you try to do it on the other wing
so<00:04:29.270> that<00:04:29.480> your<00:04:30.380> opponent's<00:04:30.830> attacking<00:04:31.220> pieces

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
so that your opponent's attacking pieces

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.630 
so that your opponent's attacking pieces
have<00:04:31.640> to<00:04:31.760> come<00:04:31.910> back<00:04:32.090> to<00:04:32.300> defend
