00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
neglecting to actually look further than

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.009 
neglecting to actually look further than
my<00:00:10.650> nose<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:11.610> can<00:00:11.639> actually<00:00:12.330> change<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
my nose you can actually change the

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.919 
my nose you can actually change the
weapons<00:00:13.769> on<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:14.219> mob<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:15.240> can't<00:00:15.480> change<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:15.839> on

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
weapons on a mob you can't change it on

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.310 
weapons on a mob you can't change it on
a<00:00:15.960> player<00:00:16.850> because<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.990> never<00:00:19.109> know

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
a player because it is you never know

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.570 
a player because it is you never know
which<00:00:19.470> hand<00:00:19.710> they're<00:00:19.920> actually<00:00:20.220> holding<00:00:20.460> it

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
which hand they're actually holding it

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.320 
which hand they're actually holding it
in<00:00:20.670> but<00:00:21.210> on<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.539> mob<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.350> slot<00:00:22.830> dot<00:00:23.580> weapon

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
in but on a mob it is slot dot weapon

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.599 
in but on a mob it is slot dot weapon
okay<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.170> weapon<00:00:25.590> slot<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.250> this

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
okay so it's the weapon slot so this

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.460 
okay so it's the weapon slot so this
opens<00:00:26.939> up<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.210> whole<00:00:27.449> new<00:00:27.689> range<00:00:28.199> of

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
opens up a whole new range of

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.890 
opens up a whole new range of
possibilities<00:00:28.529> for<00:00:29.160> custom<00:00:29.789> mobs<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.720> as<00:00:30.810> you

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
possibilities for custom mobs so as you

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.359 
possibilities for custom mobs so as you
can<00:00:31.019> see<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.439> skeleton<00:00:31.890> over<00:00:31.949> here<00:00:32.189> because

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.250 
can see the skeleton over here because
I'm<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.669> certain<00:00:33.329> distance<00:00:33.750> away<00:00:33.899> from<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
I'm and certain distance away from the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.540 
I'm and certain distance away from the
skeleton<00:00:35.570> it<00:00:36.570> actually<00:00:37.170> has<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.559> ranged<00:00:38.460> weapon

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the moment I go closer you'll see it

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.860 
the moment I go closer you'll see it
actually<00:00:41.460> changes<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> melee<00:00:42.329> weapon<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870

off this was actually a suggestion on my

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.420 
off this was actually a suggestion on my
last<00:01:11.850> video<00:01:12.090> by<00:01:12.360> Lord<00:01:12.720> Irani<00:01:13.200> he<00:01:13.500> said<00:01:13.710> wait<00:01:14.070> so

last video by Lord Irani he said wait so
could<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.850> make<00:01:15.090> skeletons<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.840> pull<00:01:16.080> out

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
could you make skeletons that pull out

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.960 
could you make skeletons that pull out
swords<00:01:16.590> when<00:01:16.710> there<00:01:16.890> are<00:01:17.070> close<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
bows when there are far so I hope that

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.780

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
what it means

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.289 
what it means
where's<00:01:25.290> my<00:01:25.439> rage<00:01:25.560> done<00:01:25.710> here<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.009> okay<00:01:26.850> now

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
where's my rage done here it is okay now

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.020 
where's my rage done here it is okay now
you<00:01:28.020> only<00:01:28.259> really<00:01:28.590> need<00:01:28.710> these<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.640> come<00:01:29.909> on

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
you only really need these to come on

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.219 
you only really need these to come on
blocks<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.450> these<00:01:30.570> two<00:01:30.750> come<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.020> blocks

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
blocks so these two come on blocks

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.469 
blocks so these two come on blocks
actually<00:01:31.439> does<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.250> action<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:33.240> what<00:01:33.450> I

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
actually does the action but what I

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.630 
actually does the action but what I
found<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.740> run<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> fast

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
found is that if you run it on a fast

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.730 
found is that if you run it on a fast
clock<00:01:35.939> look<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.390> I'm<00:01:36.600> running<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.350> clock

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
clock look like I'm running this clock

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.120 
clock look like I'm running this clock
runs<00:01:37.979> at<00:01:38.100> about<00:01:38.159> 20<00:01:38.700> ticks<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.030> second<00:01:39.680> you<00:01:40.680> swap

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
runs at about 20 ticks a second you swap

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.130 
runs at about 20 ticks a second you swap
the<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.820> bow<00:01:42.119> around<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.110> often<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:44.430> um<00:01:45.140> it

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the the bow around so often that um it

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.590 
the the bow around so often that um it
can't<00:01:46.560> actually<00:01:46.799> shoot<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.610> skeleton<00:01:48.180> cannot

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
can't actually shoot the skeleton cannot

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.350 
can't actually shoot the skeleton cannot
shoot<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:50.280> change<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.700> bow<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.090> often

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
shoot if I you change the bow so often

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.910 
shoot if I you change the bow so often
so<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.479> need<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.930> slow<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.409> down<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:52.799> you

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
so you need to slow it down so if you

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.399 
so you need to slow it down so if you
can<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.490> can<00:01:53.610> run<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> clock<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:55.290> is

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
can if you can run a clock and that is

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.200 
can if you can run a clock and that is
roughly<00:01:55.770> about<00:01:55.890> three<00:01:56.340> seconds<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:56.850> three

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
roughly about three seconds so three

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.300 
roughly about three seconds so three
seconds<00:01:57.570> clock<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.439> would<00:01:58.619> be<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> best<00:01:59.070> now

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
seconds clock that would be the best now

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.700 
seconds clock that would be the best now
because<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.119> want<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.540> keep<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.780> all<00:02:00.930> neat<00:02:01.500> and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
because I want to keep it all neat and

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.130 
because I want to keep it all neat and
all<00:02:01.860> one<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.549> one<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.299> actually<00:02:03.509> created<00:02:03.930> a

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
all one in one I actually created a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.289 
all one in one I actually created a
timer<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> side<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.189> counts<00:02:05.729> down<00:02:05.909> three

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
timer on the side that counts down three

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.029 
timer on the side that counts down three
seconds<00:02:06.869> okay<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.009> a

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
seconds okay so this is a

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.150 
seconds okay so this is a
straightforward<00:02:08.849> scoreboard<00:02:09.780> dummy<00:02:10.160> call

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
straightforward scoreboard dummy call

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.240 
straightforward scoreboard dummy call
time<00:02:11.370> or<00:02:11.580> time<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:11.970> damn<00:02:12.420> scrubber

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
time or time a damn scrubber

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.670 
time or time a damn scrubber
objective<00:02:13.700> called<00:02:13.880> a<00:02:14.030> method<00:02:14.270> is<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:15.110> dummy<00:02:15.380> and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
objective called a method is a dummy and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.490 
objective called a method is a dummy and
what<00:02:16.400> I'm<00:02:16.490> doing<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:16.910> I'm<00:02:17.060> setting<00:02:17.450> or<00:02:17.990> adding

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
what I'm doing is I'm setting or adding

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.790 
what I'm doing is I'm setting or adding
one<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.280> time<00:02:19.460> school<00:02:19.820> for<00:02:20.000> all<00:02:20.150> players

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
one to the time school for all players

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.520 
one to the time school for all players
okay<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.040> then<00:02:22.490> when<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.670> get<00:02:22.820> to<00:02:23.000> thirty<00:02:23.960> sixty

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
okay and then when I get to thirty sixty

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.920 
okay and then when I get to thirty sixty
so<00:02:24.800> when<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.640> score<00:02:25.940> gets<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.450> sixty<00:02:26.900> I

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
so when the the score gets to sixty I

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.560 
so when the the score gets to sixty I
then<00:02:27.230> remove<00:02:27.650> reset<00:02:28.490> everybody's<00:02:29.150> timer

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
then remove reset everybody's timer

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.199 
then remove reset everybody's timer
that's<00:02:30.170> got<00:02:30.470> 60<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:31.100> zero<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:31.880> that<00:02:32.000> just

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
that's got 60 to zero so that just

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.290 
that's got 60 to zero so that just
constantly<00:02:32.390> ticks<00:02:33.140> for<00:02:33.500> three<00:02:33.770> seconds<00:02:34.300> okay

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
constantly ticks for three seconds okay

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.190 
constantly ticks for three seconds okay
so<00:02:35.360> that's<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.750> clock<00:02:36.050> now<00:02:36.740> first<00:02:37.040> off<00:02:38.200> when

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
so that's the clock now first off when

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.260 
so that's the clock now first off when
I'm<00:02:39.410> in<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.940> world

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
I'm in the world

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.770 
I'm in the world
okay<00:02:41.780> I'm<00:02:41.959> constantly<00:02:42.500> executing<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.340> command

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
okay I'm constantly executing a command

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.600 
okay I'm constantly executing a command
at<00:02:44.780> all<00:02:45.020> players<00:02:45.440> that<00:02:45.890> is<00:02:45.920> going<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.489> be

at all players that is going to be

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.080 
at all players that is going to be

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
this command I'm going to be replacing

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.039 
this command I'm going to be replacing

is within a fifty block radius I could

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.240 
is within a fifty block radius I could
actually<00:03:37.820> probably<00:03:38.090> drop<00:03:38.299> this<00:03:38.450> down<00:03:38.630> to<00:03:39.250> like

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
actually probably drop this down to like

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.160 
actually probably drop this down to like
ten<00:03:41.980> within<00:03:42.980> ten<00:03:43.220> block<00:03:43.430> radius<00:03:43.780> that<00:03:44.780> is<00:03:45.730> no

weapon with bow okay and as I said
before<00:03:56.600> the<00:03:56.870> reason<00:03:56.989> I've<00:03:57.350> got<00:03:57.709> this<00:03:58.040> bit<00:03:58.670> of<00:03:58.760> a

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
before the reason I've got this bit of a

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.640 
before the reason I've got this bit of a
delay<00:03:59.180> before<00:03:59.420> I<00:03:59.600> replace<00:03:59.930> it's<00:04:00.140> because<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.440> if

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
delay before I replace it's because I if

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.009 
delay before I replace it's because I if
I<00:04:00.769> could<00:04:00.950> replace<00:04:01.220> this<00:04:01.519> bow<00:04:01.820> once<00:04:02.239> every<00:04:02.690> tick

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
I could replace this bow once every tick
