00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello to all and welcome 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.490
 in this video a bit special in 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.309
 which I will show you how 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.050
 change your keyboard to English keyboard 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.240
 you'll see it's very easy to 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.190
 understand there right now I'm going to you 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.770
 show the trick on windows 7 but 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.119
 this trick also works very well on 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.680
 windows 8 there will be just a small 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.600
 change at the moment and I believe she 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.340
 also works on windows xp 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.500
 so first of all what do you have to 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.539
 to know is that on the taskbar 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.529
 you must have a small button at the bottom 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.989
 with writing en above the justice he a 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.460
 little square button if you do not have no 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.809
 do not worry in the following vacuum 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.300
 and the video I will explain 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.219
 how to change your keyboard anyway 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.780
 without having this button 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.040
 if you click on this button you 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.289
 can see that you have several 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.239
 keyboards in it first the keyboard 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.309
 French and then the English keyboard 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.360
 it actually corresponds button keyboard 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.670
 which are installed on your computer 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.260
 just click on the keyboard 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.860
 English for example if I want to go into 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.440
 english keyboard 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.140
 and there you see what tells me knows 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.350
 who wrote this is there for example if 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.640
 I try to write azerty with the keyboard 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.560
 english know writing qwerty as a 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.689
 intense american keyboard 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.900
 finally international andré to be able 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.020
 pass in French even manip on click 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.420
 left on the bar of the little bubble 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.710
 the momentum bar and then click 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.860
 on French and there we go back in 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.570
 French and we can again 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.840
 reuse local and in French this 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.520
 to know is that if in the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.710
 case where in the bubble there would not be 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.329
 indicated the English keyboard what you 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.840
 can do you can right click 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.329
 on the little bubble of the bar bar 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.119
 languages ​​and then click 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.520
 parameters the parameters go wrong but 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.049
 no on this window there which actually 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.030
 allows you to set all 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.990
 keyboards that you can have in 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.970
 all possible languages 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.170
 so if for example I delete secret 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.380
 but if for example I added the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.689
 proclaim long and I'm added afterwards 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.219
 I will select trevisers who will 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.310
 so fits there english usa 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.090
 keyboard united states international and I 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.680
 then click iraq 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.689
 here is the keyboard is now 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.330
 select and then if for example 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.430
 I want to put it 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.560
 by default on my computer it's up to 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.050
 say that coordinator will turn on the 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.790
 English keyboard will be on by default 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.890
 it will be the first keyboard ie 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.290
 that first thing you will type this 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.820
 will be on alcohol and English just 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.830
 to put it at the top of the list 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.690
 simply clicking on monthey if 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.580
 on the contrary we want to go down this 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.290
 this keyboard in the list simply 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.240
 well on December and the indre again 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.890
 we will have the French credit in water 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.580
 so this will be the case the French by 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.450
 default we then apply and we do ok 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.490
 the advantage that with his techniques 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.020
 is that suddenly you have you can 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.000
 choose your keyboard as you want 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.080
 you can put back even several if 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.910
 you want for example I want to show 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.910
 at the settings you can put by 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.330
 example a German keyboard that's up 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.440
 German hockey keyboard and so has you 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.090
 can have multiple keyboards with 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.520
 multiple languages ​​if you need them 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.670
 there is also something very 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.930
 important to know how to use in windows 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.260
 7 it works for others too 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.360
 versions 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.860
 it's a very useful shortcut for 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.510
 change the keyboard to avoid going 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.290
 click in the bubble and at the 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:16.970
 select a shortcut that is 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.470
 capital letter left + alt left you go 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.810
 see him doing these two keys in 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.570
 same time hop your keyboard will change 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.910
 I will show you here I would have phase 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.269
 there i am in italy france is so 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.269
 if I write QWERTY wrote it warned there 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.550
 if I do the combination up act stop 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.739
 and I have bad so I have left upper case 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.970
 at left 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.070
 I go back to English keyboard so if 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.959
 I write with the azerty it marks me qwerty 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.890
 and if I redo the combination according to the 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.590
 number of times I did the 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.720
 combination was a hair and well 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.370
 change in size and that's it wrote to me 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.640
 a brother you did not know it was 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.019
 quartz in germany up and then 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.160
 handle multiple combinations and I 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.840
 come back to the French keyboard 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.810
 it is precisely at this moment that we 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.120
 see that the order of keyboards specify 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.760
 here with going up going down is important 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.350
 for example before to access from 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.360
 french keyboard with German keyboards 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.010
 I had to do the combination twice 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.019
 if now I go up the tailor 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.760
 German above the English keyboard and 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.400
 that I apply I have more than to do a 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.650
 only once the combination up and I pass 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.970
 directly to the government I redo 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.799
 a second time to go to the credit 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.080
 English and then I arrive 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.389
 French keyboard so here and if you 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.710
 need to remove a keyboard and 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.250
 you just have to select the ones won 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.780
 kiel on deleted here that's it's the 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.479
 simple solution in case you have 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.940
 the bubble if you do not have the bubble 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.500
 with writing fr in you do not have to 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.389
 worry you can access the 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.069
 menu with all the keyboards very 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.960
 easily if they talk about the panel 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:46.940
 configuration to access the panel of 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.979
 configuration so in windows 7 it's 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.870
 the start menu and then panel 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.190
 configuration in windows 8 you have to 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.139
 go in all the apps at 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.520
 Tile interface level 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.539
 the subway interface I believe she 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.889
 was called me I see it's 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.840
 always the interface of the alta face 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.490
 tulle anyway I think it's 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.229
 all these applications it's a circle 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.270
 with an arrow that pointing to the 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.759
 down and I think it's to the right 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.139
 of all the apps you have not 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.449
 configuration etc etc 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.280
 and I believe that for separate windows xp 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.289
 also brief in your panel of 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.710
 configuration you will find a button 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.180
 tabs a button rather that contains 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.430
 who's called sees the region and languages 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.800
 click on this button and it will take you 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.240
 so for all who sets the region 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.250
 and there at your computer 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.259
 then click on the keyboard tab 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.539
 languages ​​and then on modify the 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.889
 keyboards so here is suddenly you re 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:35.240
 land on the same window you 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.979
 can again added keyboards in 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.110
 delete them back in order etc 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.750
 etc. know that you also have some 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.880
 particular features that are 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.460
 times recorded keyboards by 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.819
 default default input languages 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.440
 which are features already done 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:53.629
 and see the hand on this this tutorial is 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.610
 finished I hope you could 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:57.190
 understand all that I have not been too much 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.020
 too complicated in building 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.090
 I hope you enjoyed it
