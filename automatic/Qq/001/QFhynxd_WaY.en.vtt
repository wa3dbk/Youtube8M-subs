even a higher amount of resources basis
so<00:00:15.299> yeah<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.630> mean<00:00:15.750> it's<00:00:15.929> up<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.529> design

of course I know there are people who
have<00:00:18.810> attacked<00:00:19.260> basis<00:00:20.130> with<00:00:20.310> over<00:00:20.670> two

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
have attacked basis with over two

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.630 
have attacked basis with over two
million<00:00:21.300> resources<00:00:22.080> by<00:00:22.230> stats<00:00:22.590> not<00:00:23.100> easy<00:00:23.400> to

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
million resources by stats not easy to

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.340 
million resources by stats not easy to
find<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:24.000> fact<00:00:24.269> I've<00:00:24.390> never<00:00:24.570> ever<00:00:24.810> found<00:00:25.170> a

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
find in fact I've never ever found a

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.859 
find in fact I've never ever found a
base<00:00:25.590> with<00:00:25.830> above<00:00:26.250> two<00:00:26.970> million<00:00:27.359> resources

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
base with above two million resources

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.599 
base with above two million resources
but<00:00:28.050> later<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.439> guys<00:00:28.619> can<00:00:28.830> see<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> found<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
but later you guys can see I found a

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.120 
but later you guys can see I found a
base<00:00:29.849> with<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.269> very<00:00:30.840> insane<00:00:31.410> amount<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.920> loot

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
base with a very insane amount of loot

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.530 
base with a very insane amount of loot
so<00:00:32.520> let's<00:00:32.700> go<00:00:32.820> ahead<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.059> check<00:00:33.180> out<00:00:33.420> this

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
so let's go ahead and check out this

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.090 
so let's go ahead and check out this
particular<00:00:33.840> attack<00:00:34.230> itself<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.920> that

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
particular attack itself this at that

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.500 
particular attack itself this at that
it's<00:00:35.190> gonna<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.430> very<00:00:35.460> easy<00:00:35.910> because<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
it's gonna be very easy because the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.959 
it's gonna be very easy because the
storages<00:00:37.140> they<00:00:37.680> are<00:00:37.739> very<00:00:37.950> few<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:38.460> also<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
storages they are very few but also the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.400 
storages they are very few but also the
collectors<00:00:39.420> they're<00:00:39.570> very<00:00:39.780> few<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.140> just

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
collectors they're very few so just

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.560 
collectors they're very few so just
focusing<00:00:40.860> on<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.040> collectors<00:00:41.550> first<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.059> I'm

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
focusing on a collectors first and I'm

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.330 
focusing on a collectors first and I'm
just<00:00:42.960> gonna<00:00:43.110> take<00:00:43.350> other<00:00:43.500> collectors<00:00:43.890> alone

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
just gonna take other collectors alone

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.950 
just gonna take other collectors alone

I<00:01:30.299> was<00:01:30.479> forming<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.380> actually<00:01:31.770> get<00:01:32.220> resources

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
I was forming to actually get resources

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.580 
I was forming to actually get resources
to<00:01:32.880> donate<00:01:33.150> troops<00:01:33.420> basically<00:01:34.170> I'm<00:01:34.259> able<00:01:34.439> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
to donate troops basically I'm able to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.800 
to donate troops basically I'm able to
find<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:34.979> come<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.460> st.<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.970> mob<00:01:36.180> loot<00:01:36.420> bases

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
find this come in st. a mob loot bases

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.929 
find this come in st. a mob loot bases
and<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.200> particular<00:01:37.500> base<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.040> wasn't<00:01:38.280> able

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
and this particular base I wasn't able

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.200 
and this particular base I wasn't able
to<00:01:39.270> take<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.710> 1.3<00:01:40.710> million<00:01:41.119> resources<00:01:42.119> from

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
to take like 1.3 million resources from

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.569 
to take like 1.3 million resources from
the<00:01:42.299> base<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.740> next<00:01:43.890> one<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.280> particular

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
the base so the next one this particular

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.670 
the base so the next one this particular
base<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.119> not<00:01:45.420> too<00:01:45.570> i<00:01:45.600> lowed<00:01:46.020> by<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.500> want<00:01:46.619> to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
base is not too i lowed by just want to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.840 
base is not too i lowed by just want to
show<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.890> guys<00:01:46.950> something<00:01:47.340> really

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
show you guys something really

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.819 
show you guys something really
interesting<00:01:48.180> by<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.899> same<00:01:49.229> time<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.590> give<00:01:49.740> you

interesting by the same time to give you
guys<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> short<00:01:50.520> little<00:01:50.700> brick<00:01:51.180> because<00:01:51.780> that

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
guys a short little brick because that

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.749 
guys a short little brick because that
amount<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.680> resources<00:01:53.159> charge<00:01:53.460> from<00:01:53.579> their

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
amount of resources charge from their

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.550 
amount of resources charge from their
first<00:01:54.000> rate<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.299> totally<00:01:54.810> insane<00:01:54.990> totally

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
first rate is totally insane totally

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.950 
first rate is totally insane totally
mind-boggling<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.520> get<00:01:57.000> 1.3<00:01:57.659> million

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
mind-boggling to get 1.3 million

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.679 
mind-boggling to get 1.3 million
resources<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.219> particular<00:01:59.520> rate<00:02:00.509> is

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
resources so this particular rate is

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.139 
resources so this particular rate is
going<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> mass<00:02:01.680> child<00:02:02.189> with<00:02:02.640> healers

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
going to be a mass child with healers

to get the first stop so then that he
does<00:02:16.740> that<00:02:17.040> just<00:02:17.250> gonna<00:02:17.400> continue<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.850> heat<00:02:18.150> at

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
does that just gonna continue to heat at

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.030 
does that just gonna continue to heat at
giants<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.780> Giants<00:02:19.200> just<00:02:19.290> going<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.560> go<00:02:19.710> into

giants the Giants just going to go into

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.520 
giants the Giants just going to go into
the<00:02:20.370> base<00:02:20.520> with<00:02:20.700> hair<00:02:20.970> through<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.600> base<00:02:21.810> so

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
the base with hair through the base so

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.750 
the base with hair through the base so
you're<00:02:22.650> having<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.920> giant<00:02:23.190> star<00:02:23.340> very<00:02:23.520> strong

you're having a giant star very strong

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.670 
you're having a giant star very strong
especially<00:02:24.030> for<00:02:24.630> those<00:02:24.780> level<00:02:25.140> 7<00:02:25.470> Giants

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
especially for those level 7 Giants

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.200 
especially for those level 7 Giants
they're<00:02:25.920> able<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.220> take<00:02:26.340> all<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.550> defense's

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
they're able to take all the defense's

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.150 
they're able to take all the defense's
very<00:02:27.510> quickly<00:02:27.810> for<00:02:28.440> those<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:28.830> who<00:02:28.950> do<00:02:29.040> not

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
very quickly for those of you who do not

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.360 
very quickly for those of you who do not
know<00:02:29.220> actually<00:02:30.060> if<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:30.750> are<00:02:30.840> taking<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
know actually if you are taking the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.590 
know actually if you are taking the
consideration<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.400> if<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.730> have<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.390> same

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
consideration that if you have the same

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.200 
consideration that if you have the same
number<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.960> housing<00:02:34.440> spaces<00:02:34.860> as<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.220> golem<00:02:35.640> say

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
number of housing spaces as a golem say

number of housing spaces as a golem say
six<00:02:36.690> Chinese<00:02:37.110> equals<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.650> one<00:02:37.890> golem<00:02:38.370> because

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
six Chinese equals to one golem because

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.810 
six Chinese equals to one golem because
our<00:02:39.180> wine<00:02:39.420> giant<00:02:39.870> actually<00:02:40.230> has<00:02:40.740> five<00:02:41.400> housing

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
our wine giant actually has five housing

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.580 
our wine giant actually has five housing
spacers<00:02:42.240> whereas<00:02:42.540> one<00:02:42.810> coulomb<00:02:43.230> take<00:02:43.410> some

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
spacers whereas one coulomb take some

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.800 
spacers whereas one coulomb take some
thirty<00:02:43.860> housing<00:02:44.550> spaces<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.420> damage<00:02:45.780> from

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
thirty housing spaces the damage from

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.020 
thirty housing spaces the damage from
those<00:02:46.170> six<00:02:46.500> Giants<00:02:46.920> they<00:02:47.010> actually<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.370> do<00:02:47.760> more

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
those six Giants they actually I do more

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.090 
those six Giants they actually I do more
damage<00:02:48.270> as<00:02:48.570> compared<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.110> Golem<00:02:49.980> itself

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
damage as compared to the Golem itself

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.610 
damage as compared to the Golem itself
but<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:51.150> heat<00:02:51.570> points<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:52.020> course<00:02:52.230> is<00:02:52.380> lower

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
but the heat points of course is lower

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.470 
but the heat points of course is lower
because<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:53.070> once<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.550> golem<00:02:53.940> splits<00:02:54.239> up<00:02:54.390> into

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
because I once the golem splits up into

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.510

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
a giant and also we have to take into

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.440 
a giant and also we have to take into
consideration<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:02.160> giant<00:03:02.580> they<00:03:02.940> get

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
consideration that the giant they get

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.150 
consideration that the giant they get
more<00:03:03.690> damage<00:03:04.110> being<00:03:04.350> doubted<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.830> them<00:03:05.010> if

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
more damage being doubted to them if

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.010 
more damage being doubted to them if
they're<00:03:05.370> against<00:03:05.910> wizard<00:03:06.239> towers<00:03:06.570> or<00:03:06.780> motor

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
they're against wizard towers or motor

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.800 
they're against wizard towers or motor
and<00:03:07.470> also<00:03:07.920> giant<00:03:08.280> bombs<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.239> golem<00:03:09.690> will

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
and also giant bombs so a golem will

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.750 
and also giant bombs so a golem will
actually<00:03:10.170> be<00:03:10.410> able<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.709> survive<00:03:11.160> much<00:03:11.459> better

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
actually be able to survive much better

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.180 
actually be able to survive much better
against<00:03:12.209> splash<00:03:12.540> damage<00:03:13.020> dealing<00:03:13.470> defenses

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
against splash damage dealing defenses

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.850 
against splash damage dealing defenses
but<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.850> damage<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:15.390> up<00:03:15.840> from<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.110> golem<00:03:16.739> is

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
but the damage that up from a golem is

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.280 
but the damage that up from a golem is
definitely<00:03:17.250> lower<00:03:17.400> than<00:03:17.730> Giants<00:03:18.269> so<00:03:18.930> of

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
definitely lower than Giants so of

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.539 
definitely lower than Giants so of
course<00:03:19.350> using<00:03:19.860> Giants<00:03:20.160> they<00:03:20.280> are<00:03:20.340> very<00:03:20.489> good

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
course using Giants they are very good

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.039 
course using Giants they are very good
they<00:03:20.820> are<00:03:20.880> able<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.150> take<00:03:21.269> out<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.540> defense's

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
they are able to take out the defense's

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.080 
they are able to take out the defense's
much<00:03:22.260> quicker<00:03:22.590> than<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.430> golems<00:03:23.790> but<00:03:23.970> it

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
much quicker than the golems but it

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.090 
much quicker than the golems but it
really<00:03:24.269> depends<00:03:24.660> on<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:25.140> base<00:03:25.530> itself<00:03:25.890> that

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
really depends on the base itself that

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.070 
really depends on the base itself that
layer<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.580> also<00:03:26.940> what<00:03:27.150> kind<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.450> spells<00:03:27.870> your

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
layer and also what kind of spells your

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.150 
layer and also what kind of spells your
bring<00:03:28.320> I<00:03:28.410> mean<00:03:28.560> if<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.709> are<00:03:28.799> going<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:29.010> bring

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
bring I mean if you are going to bring

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.370 
bring I mean if you are going to bring
like<00:03:29.340> Hugh<00:03:29.580> spells<00:03:29.970> with<00:03:30.540> Giants<00:03:31.230> they're

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
like Hugh spells with Giants they're

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.630 
like Hugh spells with Giants they're
really<00:03:31.590> good<00:03:31.739> but<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.190> course<00:03:32.400> they<00:03:32.489> were

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
really good but of course they were

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.729 
really good but of course they were
against<00:03:33.060> infinite<00:03:33.450> hours<00:03:33.750> they<00:03:33.900> into<00:03:34.440> good

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
against infinite hours they into good

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.789 
against infinite hours they into good
because<00:03:35.010> infinite<00:03:35.459> how<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.640> stop<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.269> healing

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
because infinite how to stop the healing

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.470 
because infinite how to stop the healing
process<00:03:37.799> from<00:03:38.130> happening<00:03:38.519> but<00:03:39.150> if<00:03:39.360> you're

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
process from happening but if you're

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.870 
process from happening but if you're
going<00:03:39.570> to<00:03:39.630> use<00:03:39.720> healing<00:03:39.989> spell<00:03:40.410> say<00:03:40.680> on<00:03:40.890> golems

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
going to use healing spell say on golems

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.820 
going to use healing spell say on golems
is<00:03:42.060> not<00:03:42.299> too<00:03:42.660> affected<00:03:43.380> because<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.769> are

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
is not too affected because you are

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.979 
is not too affected because you are
essentially<00:03:44.310> just<00:03:44.640> healing<00:03:44.970> one<00:03:45.180> troop<00:03:45.450> by

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
essentially just healing one troop by

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.930 
essentially just healing one troop by
viewed<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.350> huge<00:03:46.620> six<00:03:46.920> troops<00:03:47.280> instead<00:03:47.760> you're

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
viewed a huge six troops instead you're

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.610 
viewed a huge six troops instead you're
healing<00:03:48.209> more<00:03:48.480> hit<00:03:48.750> points<00:03:48.780> as<00:03:49.140> compared<00:03:49.590> to

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
healing more hit points as compared to

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.949 
healing more hit points as compared to
healing<00:03:50.040> only<00:03:50.310> one<00:03:50.549> troop<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:51.540> yeah<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:51.840> really

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
healing only one troop so yeah it really

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.420 
healing only one troop so yeah it really
depends<00:03:52.440> on<00:03:52.530> what<00:03:52.709> kind<00:03:52.739> of<00:03:52.980> spells<00:03:53.280> you're

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
depends on what kind of spells you're

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.710 
depends on what kind of spells you're
bringing<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:53.910> work<00:03:54.030> on<00:03:54.239> layouts<00:03:54.570> you're

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
bringing and work on layouts you're

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.660 
bringing and work on layouts you're
attacking<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:55.320> certainly<00:03:55.769> what<00:03:56.310> kind<00:03:56.610> of

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
attacking and certainly what kind of

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.970 
attacking and certainly what kind of
troops<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.330> are<00:03:57.420> also<00:03:57.600> bringing<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.590> go<00:03:58.769> ahead

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
troops you are also bringing to go ahead

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.460 
troops you are also bringing to go ahead
to<00:03:59.100> attack<00:03:59.400> so<00:04:00.030> now<00:04:00.420> just<00:04:00.600> left<00:04:00.870> with<00:04:01.049> my<00:04:01.200> queen

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
to attack so now just left with my queen

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.979 
to attack so now just left with my queen
gonna<00:04:01.739> go<00:04:01.890> ahead<00:04:02.160> to<00:04:02.340> let<00:04:03.030> my<00:04:03.209> giant<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.780> play

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
gonna go ahead to let my giant to play

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.810 
gonna go ahead to let my giant to play
out<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.200> cannon<00:04:04.980> on<00:04:05.100> top<00:04:05.340> left<00:04:05.549> and<00:04:05.640> then

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
out the cannon on top left and then

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.120 
out the cannon on top left and then
eventually<00:04:05.970> they<00:04:06.660> were<00:04:06.810> actually<00:04:06.989> be<00:04:07.890> able<00:04:07.980> to

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
eventually they were actually be able to

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.039 
eventually they were actually be able to
take<00:04:08.340> out<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.670> resources<00:04:09.000> because<00:04:09.570> once<00:04:09.810> all

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
take out the resources because once all

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.199 
take out the resources because once all
the<00:04:10.170> defense's<00:04:10.650> goes<00:04:10.890> down<00:04:11.280> they<00:04:11.820> will<00:04:12.000> start

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
the defense's goes down they will start

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.449 
the defense's goes down they will start
to<00:04:12.269> attack<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.840> nearest<00:04:13.260> building<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:14.250> them

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
to attack the nearest building to them

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.810 
to attack the nearest building to them
so<00:04:14.970> yeah<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.299> dark<00:04:15.600> elixir

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
so yeah the dark elixir

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.030 
so yeah the dark elixir
drew<00:04:17.210> is<00:04:17.360> gonna<00:04:17.540> get<00:04:17.660> taken<00:04:17.870> down<00:04:18.050> by<00:04:18.410> my<00:04:18.620> giant

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
drew is gonna get taken down by my giant

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.710 
drew is gonna get taken down by my giant
so<00:04:19.190> yeah<00:04:19.340> I<00:04:19.370> mean<00:04:19.550> it's<00:04:19.610> not<00:04:20.000> easy<00:04:20.270> to<00:04:20.540> use

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
so yeah I mean it's not easy to use

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.680 
so yeah I mean it's not easy to use
Giants<00:04:21.230> to<00:04:21.320> actually<00:04:21.590> take<00:04:21.860> down<00:04:22.690> collectors

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
Giants to actually take down collectors

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.530 
Giants to actually take down collectors
especially<00:04:24.170> when<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:25.010> do<00:04:25.730> have<00:04:26.000> other<00:04:26.210> troops

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
especially when you do have other troops

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.420 
especially when you do have other troops
to<00:04:26.660> try<00:04:26.840> to<00:04:26.900> take<00:04:27.080> them<00:04:27.200> out<00:04:27.380> by<00:04:27.860> this<00:04:27.920> case<00:04:28.280> I

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
to try to take them out by this case I

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.100 
to try to take them out by this case I
was<00:04:28.580> able<00:04:28.700> to<00:04:28.850> use<00:04:29.000> my<00:04:29.030> giant<00:04:29.600> take<00:04:29.780> out<00:04:29.930> the

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
was able to use my giant take out the

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.320 
was able to use my giant take out the
dialects<00:04:30.560> drew<00:04:30.860> getting<00:04:31.220> both<00:04:31.490> of<00:04:31.640> the<00:04:31.880> Daleks

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
dialects drew getting both of the Daleks

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.540 
dialects drew getting both of the Daleks
reduce<00:04:32.900> that<00:04:33.080> was<00:04:33.230> left<00:04:33.470> and<00:04:33.680> almost<00:04:34.160> getting

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
reduce that was left and almost getting

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.400 
reduce that was left and almost getting
five<00:04:34.940> thousand<00:04:35.510> died<00:04:35.660> except<00:04:36.080> from<00:04:36.230> this

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
five thousand died except from this

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.920 
five thousand died except from this
particular<00:04:36.620> rate<00:04:37.040> itself<00:04:37.430> so<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.450> time<00:04:38.900> I

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
particular rate itself so the time I

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.590 
particular rate itself so the time I
wasn't<00:04:39.230> enough<00:04:40.010> for<00:04:40.070> me<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:40.790> actually<00:04:41.150> steal

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
wasn't enough for me to actually steal

our drills the HD behind a layer wall so
my<00:05:22.910> competence<00:05:23.390> won't<00:05:23.630> be<00:05:23.720> able<00:05:23.840> to<00:05:23.930> take<00:05:24.110> them

bit<00:05:50.180> of<00:05:50.240> the<00:05:50.450> go<00:05:50.600> so<00:05:50.840> that<00:05:50.870> i<00:05:51.050> could<00:05:51.110> actually

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
bit of the go so that i could actually

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.620
