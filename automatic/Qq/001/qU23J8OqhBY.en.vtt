00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
so first let's take a look at app BIOS

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.120 
so first let's take a look at app BIOS
because<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.320> want<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.530> show<00:01:31.650> people<00:01:31.680> how<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:31.979> do

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
see here it says duo UEFI BIOS on the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.920 
see here it says duo UEFI BIOS on the
b75<00:01:40.380> series<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:42.240> real<00:01:42.360> there

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
b75 series and that is for real there

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.620 
b75 series and that is for real there
are<00:01:43.049> two<00:01:43.259> actual<00:01:43.680> BIOS<00:01:44.070> chips<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.329> board

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630

here<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.430> hit<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.790> pyo's<00:02:43.300> hit<00:02:44.170> yes<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.730> it

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
here so I hit a pyo's hit yes and so it

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.310

program<00:03:29.709> said<00:03:29.950> it<00:03:30.040> would<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:31.540> it's<00:03:31.660> going

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
program said it would and so it's going

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.319 
program said it would and so it's going
fine<00:03:32.019> writing<00:03:32.530> 64<00:03:33.310> percent<00:03:33.730> everything<00:03:34.209> is

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
fine writing 64 percent everything is

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.479 
fine writing 64 percent everything is
going<00:03:34.510> well<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:37.150> it's<00:03:37.299> going<00:03:37.480> 68<00:03:38.380> percent<00:03:38.799> the

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
going well so it's going 68 percent the

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.610 
going well so it's going 68 percent the
writing<00:03:39.790> isn't<00:03:39.940> consistent<00:03:40.450> it<00:03:40.870> goes<00:03:41.230> slower

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
writing isn't consistent it goes slower

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.930 
writing isn't consistent it goes slower
towards<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.130> end<00:03:42.250> a<00:03:42.340> little<00:03:42.430> bit<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:42.850> then

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
towards the end a little bit and then

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.670 
towards the end a little bit and then
speeds<00:03:43.269> up<00:03:43.420> in<00:03:43.540> certain<00:03:43.780> sections<00:03:43.959> I'm

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
speeds up in certain sections I'm

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.960 
speeds up in certain sections I'm
guessing<00:03:44.950> that<00:03:45.040> how<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.310> works<00:03:45.549> but

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
guessing that how it works but

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.759 
guessing that how it works but
everything<00:03:46.540> is<00:03:46.630> working<00:03:46.810> well<00:03:47.079> I<00:03:47.290> do<00:03:47.560> have

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
everything is working well I do have

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.740 
everything is working well I do have
some<00:03:47.980> mouse<00:03:48.130> control<00:03:48.489> here<00:03:48.670> but<00:03:49.630> you

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
some mouse control here but you

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.120 
some mouse control here but you
definitely<00:03:49.900> don't<00:03:50.140> want<00:03:50.320> to<00:03:50.350> end<00:03:50.500> out<00:03:50.650> BIOS

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
definitely don't want to end out BIOS

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.500 
definitely don't want to end out BIOS
you<00:03:51.370> don't<00:03:51.489> want<00:03:51.609> to<00:03:51.670> shut<00:03:51.820> down<00:03:51.850> system<00:03:52.299> so

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
you don't want to shut down system so

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.580 
you don't want to shut down system so
actually<00:03:52.840> I<00:03:52.870> think<00:03:52.930> it<00:03:53.049> would<00:03:53.140> be<00:03:53.230> better<00:03:53.410> if

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
actually I think it would be better if

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.670 
actually I think it would be better if
the<00:03:53.680> mouse<00:03:53.829> just<00:03:54.040> froze<00:03:54.570> but<00:03:55.570> instead<00:03:56.500> is<00:03:56.650> just

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
the mouse just froze but instead is just

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.920 
the mouse just froze but instead is just
intermittently<00:03:57.420> freezing<00:03:58.420> back<00:03:58.540> and<00:03:58.720> forth

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
intermittently freezing back and forth

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.380 
intermittently freezing back and forth
while<00:03:59.140> it<00:03:59.230> writes<00:03:59.440> and<00:03:59.709> reads<00:03:59.799> to<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.070> BIOS<00:04:00.390> so

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
while it writes and reads to the BIOS so

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.460 
while it writes and reads to the BIOS so
it's<00:04:01.510> erasing<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.049> writing<00:04:02.290> at<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.410> same

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
it's erasing and writing at the same

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.120 
it's erasing and writing at the same
time<00:04:03.239> usually<00:04:04.239> when<00:04:04.600> you<00:04:04.690> do<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:04.859> betta

I am IBEW dasa das flash of the bios
it'll<00:04:09.519> write<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:10.030> then<00:04:10.420> go<00:04:11.079> to<00:04:11.140> erase<00:04:11.530> and

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
it'll write and then go to erase and

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.319 
it'll write and then go to erase and
then<00:04:11.890> write<00:04:12.130> but<00:04:12.459> here<00:04:12.640> with<00:04:12.760> that<00:04:12.910> files<00:04:13.120> it

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
then write but here with that files it

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.110 
then write but here with that files it
does<00:04:13.510> write<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:14.049> erase<00:04:14.290> at<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.500> same<00:04:14.709> time<00:04:15.120> I

does write and erase at the same time I

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.880 
does write and erase at the same time I
guess<00:04:16.479> to<00:04:16.600> speed<00:04:16.870> things<00:04:17.019> up<00:04:17.320> alright

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
guess to speed things up alright

Changez<00:04:25.920> so<00:04:26.130> I<00:04:26.190> say<00:04:26.400> we<00:04:26.550> start<00:04:26.580> now<00:04:27.500> so<00:04:28.500> my

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
Changez so I say we start now so my

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.520 
Changez so I say we start now so my
system<00:04:28.830> is<00:04:28.950> restarting<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:30.230> then<00:04:31.230> we<00:04:31.350> should

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
system is restarting and then we should

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.460 
system is restarting and then we should
go<00:04:31.620> into<00:04:31.920> the<00:04:32.010> BIOS<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.400> see<00:04:32.580> how<00:04:32.670> it<00:04:32.760> worked

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.510 

all<00:04:37.470> right<00:04:37.530> so<00:04:37.770> my<00:04:37.860> system<00:04:38.130> shut<00:04:38.310> down

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
all right so my system shut down

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.700 
all right so my system shut down
now<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.270> should<00:04:39.480> try<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.810> start<00:04:40.080> up<00:04:40.200> again<00:04:40.320> and

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
now it should try to start up again and

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.620 
now it should try to start up again and
then<00:04:41.010> shut<00:04:41.280> down<00:04:41.310> and<00:04:41.700> then<00:04:41.790> not<00:04:41.970> start<00:04:42.300> up<00:04:42.389> and

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
then shut down and then not start up and

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.060 
then shut down and then not start up and
then<00:04:42.780> shut<00:04:42.990> down<00:04:43.020> again<00:04:43.230> and<00:04:43.500> then<00:04:43.620> start<00:04:43.950> up

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
then shut down again and then start up

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.550 
then shut down again and then start up
that's<00:04:44.400> what<00:04:44.580> it<00:04:44.639> does<00:04:44.760> after<00:04:44.940> these<00:04:45.240> a/c<00:04:46.020> 77

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
that's what it does after these a/c 77

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.530 
that's what it does after these a/c 77
BIOS<00:04:46.830> changes<00:04:47.370> yeah<00:04:48.060> there<00:04:48.270> we<00:04:48.360> go

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
BIOS changes yeah there we go

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.570

to<00:05:26.010> always<00:05:26.160> load<00:05:26.460> optimized<00:05:26.850> defaults<00:05:27.330> as

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
to always load optimized defaults as

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.350 
to always load optimized defaults as
that's<00:05:27.660> very<00:05:27.930> important<00:05:28.970> and<00:05:29.970> make<00:05:30.090> sure<00:05:30.240> the

that's very important and make sure the

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.490 
that's very important and make sure the
system<00:05:30.600> is<00:05:30.660> doing<00:05:30.900> everything<00:05:31.080> right<00:05:31.229> and

I've<00:05:34.830> two<00:05:35.729> SATA<00:05:36.120> drives<00:05:36.450> here<00:05:37.250> actually<00:05:38.750> yeah

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
I've two SATA drives here actually yeah

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.180 
I've two SATA drives here actually yeah
I<00:05:39.780> just<00:05:40.110> don't<00:05:40.229> want<00:05:40.380> to<00:05:40.440> stay<00:05:40.680> a<00:05:40.710> drive<00:05:40.950> and

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
I just don't want to stay a drive and

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.830 
I just don't want to stay a drive and
then<00:05:41.280> also<00:05:41.400> have<00:05:41.580> a<00:05:41.810> drive<00:05:42.810> on<00:05:43.140> my<00:05:44.630> cd-rom<00:05:45.630> or

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
then also have a drive on my cd-rom or

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.570 
then also have a drive on my cd-rom or
dvd-rom<00:05:46.260> and<00:05:46.650> then<00:05:46.740> I<00:05:46.770> have<00:05:46.919> a<00:05:46.950> Photosmart

dvd-rom and then I have a Photosmart

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.610 
dvd-rom and then I have a Photosmart
printer<00:05:47.640> and<00:05:48.180> so<00:05:48.960> I'm<00:05:49.050> just<00:05:49.200> going<00:05:49.350> to<00:05:49.380> say

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
printer and so I'm just going to say

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.710 
printer and so I'm just going to say
yeah<00:05:50.580> that's<00:05:50.700> my<00:05:50.880> first<00:05:51.030> boot<00:05:51.330> it<00:05:51.510> already

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
yeah that's my first boot it already

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.659 
yeah that's my first boot it already
caught<00:05:51.900> that<00:05:52.110> as<00:05:52.229> the<00:05:52.320> first<00:05:52.530> boot<00:05:52.740> it<00:05:53.220> catches

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
caught that as the first boot it catches

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.010 
caught that as the first boot it catches
this<00:05:53.760> as<00:05:53.970> the<00:05:54.090> boot<00:05:54.240> because<00:05:54.570> it<00:05:54.630> has<00:05:54.750> a<00:05:54.780> boot

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
this as the boot because it has a boot

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.960 
this as the boot because it has a boot
section<00:05:55.470> sector<00:05:56.100> in<00:05:56.190> it<00:05:56.310> and<00:05:56.430> the<00:05:56.490> boss<00:05:56.610> knows

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
section sector in it and the boss knows

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.480 
section sector in it and the boss knows
that<00:05:57.210> so<00:05:57.930> if<00:05:58.020> you<00:05:58.140> plug<00:05:58.470> in<00:05:58.650> two<00:05:58.800> drives<00:05:59.070> with

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
that so if you plug in two drives with

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.060 
that so if you plug in two drives with
both<00:05:59.789> boot<00:06:00.090> drives<00:06:00.390> it'll<00:06:01.229> default<00:06:01.500> to<00:06:01.830> one<00:06:01.979> of

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
both boot drives it'll default to one of

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.350 
both boot drives it'll default to one of
them<00:06:02.190> is<00:06:02.340> boot<00:06:02.550> and<00:06:02.789> the<00:06:02.880> other<00:06:03.000> one<00:06:03.120> won't

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
them is boot and the other one won't

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.230 
them is boot and the other one won't
boot<00:06:03.620> so<00:06:04.620> it'll<00:06:04.979> catch<00:06:05.190> that<00:06:05.400> SATA<00:06:06.210> mode

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
boot so it'll catch that SATA mode

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.450 
boot so it'll catch that SATA mode

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:05.640 
experiences where the system crashes but

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.800 
experiences where the system crashes but
with<00:07:05.790> this<00:07:05.910> system<00:07:06.060> you<00:07:06.270> really<00:07:06.450> don't<00:07:06.720> have

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
with this system you really don't have

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.240 
with this system you really don't have
to<00:07:06.900> worry<00:07:07.080> about<00:07:07.170> it<00:07:07.410> all<00:07:07.830> right<00:07:07.920> now<00:07:08.010> we're
