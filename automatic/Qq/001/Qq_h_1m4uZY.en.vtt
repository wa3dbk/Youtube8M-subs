00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
everybody says how can you signal out

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.999 
everybody says how can you signal out
one<00:00:02.909> thing<00:00:03.240> foods<00:00:03.689> complicated<00:00:04.560> foods<00:00:04.799> a

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
whole bunch of different things all at

whole bunch of different things all at
once<00:00:06.720> they<00:00:07.200> all<00:00:07.350> play<00:00:07.620> into<00:00:07.890> play<00:00:08.330> all<00:00:09.330> true

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
other than this one the problem is that

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.990 
other than this one the problem is that
sugar<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.969> completely<00:00:15.800> non-essential<00:00:17.000> before

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
if you went completely fructose free you

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.160 
if you went completely fructose free you
would<00:00:35.520> do<00:00:35.670> very<00:00:35.880> well<00:00:36.030> thank<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.870> you'd

be much healthier to boot now I

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.170 
be much healthier to boot now I
understand<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.680> fructose<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.520> pleasure<00:00:41.850> I

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
understand that fructose is pleasure I

not even against dessert once a week the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.439 
not even against dessert once a week the
problem<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.250> America<00:00:53.699> has<00:00:53.910> taken<00:00:54.149> to

dessert once a meal all real food is

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.000 
dessert once a meal all real food is
inherently<00:00:59.550> good<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.210> don't<00:01:01.079> have<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> problem

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
inherently good I don't have a problem

inherently good I don't have a problem
with<00:01:02.690> meat<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.960> don't<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> problem<00:01:04.680> with

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
with meat I don't have a problem with

milk I don't have a problem with

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.450 
milk I don't have a problem with
carbohydrates<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.220> various<00:01:08.850> sorts<00:01:10.340> what<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.369> do

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
carbohydrates of various sorts what I do

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.280 
carbohydrates of various sorts what I do
have<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> problem<00:01:11.939> with<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.390> food<00:01:12.600> processing

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
have a problem with is food processing

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.780 
have a problem with is food processing
because<00:01:14.280> food<00:01:14.640> processing<00:01:15.240> means<00:01:15.570> two<00:01:16.170> things

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
because food processing means two things

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.289 
because food processing means two things
put<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.970> sugar<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.590> take<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.770> fiber<00:01:20.009> out<00:01:20.299> put

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
put the sugar and take the fiber out put

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.570 
put the sugar and take the fiber out put
the<00:01:21.420> sugar<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.689> for<00:01:22.350> palatability<00:01:22.799> take<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
the sugar in for palatability take the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.300 
the sugar in for palatability take the
fiber<00:01:23.790> out<00:01:24.060> for<00:01:24.659> shelf-life<00:01:25.310> ultimately

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
fiber out for shelf-life ultimately

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.289 
fiber out for shelf-life ultimately
these<00:01:27.180> are<00:01:27.360> both<00:01:28.670> procedures<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.060> food

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
these are both procedures that the food

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.810 
these are both procedures that the food
industry<00:01:30.720> has<00:01:30.750> put<00:01:31.110> into<00:01:31.320> place<00:01:31.439> for<00:01:31.860> its<00:01:32.579> own

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
industry has put into place for its own

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.679 
industry has put into place for its own
purposes<00:01:33.509> not<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:34.619> ours<00:01:34.950> now<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.299> could<00:01:36.509> say

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
purposes not for ours now you could say

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.569 
purposes not for ours now you could say
it<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.049> for<00:01:37.200> our<00:01:37.259> purposes<00:01:37.829> because<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.369> makes

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
it is for our purposes because it makes

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.969 
it is for our purposes because it makes
food<00:01:38.820> cheap<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.420> would<00:01:39.990> say<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.950> that

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
food cheap I would say to you that that

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.760 
food cheap I would say to you that that
actually<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.880> problem<00:01:42.450> because<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.530> three

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
actually is a problem because the three

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.679 
actually is a problem because the three
countries<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.450> lowest

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
countries that have the lowest

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.899 
countries that have the lowest
percentage<00:01:46.380> EDP<00:01:46.890> spent<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.340> food

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
percentage EDP spent on food

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.120 
percentage EDP spent on food
are<00:01:47.999> the<00:01:48.299> three<00:01:48.509> most<00:01:48.719> obese<00:01:49.140> countries<00:01:49.950> in

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
are the three most obese countries in

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.239 
are the three most obese countries in
the<00:01:50.219> world<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:51.390> making<00:01:51.990> food<00:01:52.200> cheap<00:01:52.469> is<00:01:53.100> not

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.249 
the world so making food cheap is not

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:54.789 
the world so making food cheap is not
the<00:01:54.179> answer

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
the answer

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.959 
the answer
making<00:01:55.799> food<00:01:55.979> healthy<00:01:56.630> is<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.929> answer<00:01:58.969> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
making food healthy is the answer the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.480 
making food healthy is the answer the
industry<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.359> making<00:02:00.479> money<00:02:00.780> hand<00:02:00.990> over<00:02:01.109> fist

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
industry is making money hand over fist

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.249 
industry is making money hand over fist
this<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.670> their<00:02:02.850> juggernaut<00:02:03.359> they've<00:02:04.020> never

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
this is their juggernaut they've never

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.590 
this is their juggernaut they've never
made<00:02:04.469> money<00:02:04.709> like<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:05.069> before<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.670> they

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
made money like this before and they

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.900 
made money like this before and they
don't<00:02:06.780> want<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.109> end<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:08.369> they're<00:02:08.670> going<00:02:08.819> to

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
don't want it to end so they're going to
