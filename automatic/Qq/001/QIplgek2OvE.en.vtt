it's the game a beautiful skies time to
cruise<00:00:12.089> around<00:00:12.209> with<00:00:12.419> the<00:00:12.480> top<00:00:12.660> down<00:00:14.419> it's

cruise around with the top down it's

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.400 
cruise around with the top down it's
simple<00:00:16.310> my<00:00:17.310> other<00:00:17.460> video<00:00:17.789> I've<00:00:18.060> outlined<00:00:18.450> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
simple my other video I've outlined the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.700 
simple my other video I've outlined the
four<00:00:19.619> mechanisms<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.340> hold<00:00:20.519> down<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.760> top

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:42.500 

clockwise

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.870 

kinda<00:00:43.510> like<00:00:43.600> a<00:00:43.630> ratchet<00:00:44.140> you<00:00:44.320> pull<00:00:44.950> down<00:00:44.980> bring

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
kinda like a ratchet you pull down bring

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.870 
kinda like a ratchet you pull down bring
it<00:00:45.910> over<00:00:46.300> or<00:00:46.450> pulsar<00:00:46.870> go<00:00:47.590> up<00:00:47.830> pull<00:00:48.310> down<00:00:48.340> bring

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
it over or pulsar go up pull down bring

00:00:48.880 --> 00:01:00.240 
it over or pulsar go up pull down bring
it<00:00:48.940> back<00:00:53.910> no<00:00:54.910> missed<00:00:55.210> out<00:00:58.110> off<00:00:59.110> this<00:01:00.040> is<00:01:00.220> the

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
it back no missed out off this is the

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:39.270 
it back no missed out off this is the
whole<00:01:00.430> piece

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:55.480 

push-up<00:01:41.260> the<00:01:42.260> top<00:01:42.500> is<00:01:42.680> actually<00:01:53.200> set<00:01:54.200> our<00:01:55.190> tops

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
push-up the top is actually set our tops

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:08.859 
push-up the top is actually set our tops
off

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.149 

so<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.049> time<00:02:10.229> being<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.649> how<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.920> store

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:11.159 
so the time being this is how I store

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.729 
so the time being this is how I store
the<00:02:11.340> top<00:02:11.519> the<00:02:12.450> process<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:12.989> getting<00:02:13.079> a<00:02:13.319> cradle

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
the top the process of getting a cradle

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.339 
the top the process of getting a cradle
for<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.189> as<00:02:14.730> well<00:02:15.030> as<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.180> cover<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:16.110> gonna<00:02:16.230> be

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
for it as well as a cover it's gonna be

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.699 
for it as well as a cover it's gonna be
stored<00:02:16.709> during<00:02:16.829> the<00:02:16.980> summer<00:02:18.560> right<00:02:19.560> now<00:02:19.680> I

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
stored during the summer right now I

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.289 
stored during the summer right now I
have<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:19.920> stored<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.400> way<00:02:20.579> just<00:02:20.849> because<00:02:20.970> I

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
have it stored this way just because I

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.670 
have it stored this way just because I
needed<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.599> have<00:02:21.780> elevated<00:02:22.349> off<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.560> ground

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
needed to have elevated off the ground

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.610 
needed to have elevated off the ground
so<00:02:23.310> one<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:24.420> molding<00:02:24.870> doesn't<00:02:25.110> get<00:02:25.230> press<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
so one the molding doesn't get press the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.319 
so one the molding doesn't get press the
ground<00:02:25.829> against<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.370> ground<00:02:26.549> I'd<00:02:27.000> be<00:02:27.150> really

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
ground against the ground I'd be really

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.750 
ground against the ground I'd be really
bad<00:02:27.629> considering<00:02:28.379> just<00:02:29.129> throw<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.489> all<00:02:29.549> out<00:02:29.610> of

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
bad considering just throw it all out of

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.500 
bad considering just throw it all out of
whack<00:02:30.230> -<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:32.040> these<00:02:32.340> pins<00:02:32.700> don't<00:02:32.909> get<00:02:33.120> damaged

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
whack - so these pins don't get damaged

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.740 
whack - so these pins don't get damaged
these<00:02:33.720> are<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.959> pins<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:35.790> saw<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.629> the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
these are the pins you saw in the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.830 
these are the pins you saw in the
previous<00:02:36.930> clip<00:02:37.349> of<00:02:37.670> they<00:02:38.670> get<00:02:38.849> ratcheted<00:02:39.689> down

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
previous clip of they get ratcheted down

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.930 
previous clip of they get ratcheted down
with<00:02:40.049> those<00:02:40.200> little<00:02:40.440> pins<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.400> they<00:02:41.700> need<00:02:41.879> to

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
with those little pins so they need to

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.220 
with those little pins so they need to
make<00:02:42.120> sure<00:02:42.150> they<00:02:42.359> don't<00:02:42.480> bend<00:02:42.810> against<00:02:43.140> the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
make sure they don't bend against the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.860 
make sure they don't bend against the
fiberglass<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:44.040> they're<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.690> there<00:02:45.690> pretty

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
fiberglass that they're in there pretty

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.240 
fiberglass that they're in there pretty
snug<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.530> they're<00:02:46.650> really<00:02:46.920> not<00:02:47.040> going

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
snug so they're really not going

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.720 
snug so they're really not going
anywhere

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
anywhere

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.399 
anywhere
but<00:02:48.090> other<00:02:48.480> than<00:02:48.599> that<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.959> just<00:02:49.079> don't<00:02:49.230> need

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
but other than that you just don't need

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.970 
but other than that you just don't need
to<00:02:49.500> be<00:02:49.560> careful<00:02:51.409> today<00:02:52.409> I'm<00:02:52.500> going<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.680> go<00:02:52.829> over

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
to be careful today I'm going to go over

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.569 
to be careful today I'm going to go over
the<00:02:53.099> top<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:55.049> Hayes<00:02:55.319> marks<00:02:55.769> definitely<00:02:56.430> needs

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
the top the Hayes marks definitely needs

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.559 
the top the Hayes marks definitely needs
to<00:02:56.670> be<00:02:56.730> buffed<00:02:57.150> out<00:02:57.299> over<00:02:59.180> close-up<00:03:00.180> view<00:03:00.359> the

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
to be buffed out over close-up view the

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:13.790 
to be buffed out over close-up view the
defroster<00:03:01.139> grid

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.760 

the<00:03:14.800> top<00:03:15.010> really<00:03:15.220> doesn't<00:03:15.670> weigh<00:03:15.730> that<00:03:15.760> much

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
the top really doesn't weigh that much

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.950 
the top really doesn't weigh that much
one<00:03:17.770> hand<00:03:20.880> now<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:21.940> top<00:03:22.180> is<00:03:22.210> big<00:03:22.570> enough<00:03:22.810> to

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
one hand now the top is big enough to

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.690 
one hand now the top is big enough to
where<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:23.230> barely<00:03:23.470> fits<00:03:23.920> between<00:03:24.100> a<00:03:24.400> standard
