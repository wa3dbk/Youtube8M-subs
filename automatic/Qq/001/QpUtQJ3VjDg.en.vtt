00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.540
 hi all, swami words and especially 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.310
 Michael 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.360
 today I will not stop 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.039
 some particular kind of technique 

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.229
 but rather symbiosis on them 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:12.559
 today we will soon be 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.559
 change bar 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.630
 sounds maybe a little 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.929
 confused 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:23.199
 but actually it makes life a lot easier 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.199
 when playing in high-speed passages 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.710
 system to make life easier for those 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.879
 Whom change bar 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:33.500
 and very well developed 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.920
 for those who only have this bar just 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.690
 I just don't want to be a post 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.320
 play something quickly and easily and naturally 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.280
 for example in this question who submissive 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.280
 share however 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.680
 how could bring showered flight 4 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.390
 now it played a little different 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.940
 as you may have noticed the movements of the arm have become 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.910
 more economical they simply became smaller 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.539
 Now I will explain to you why this happened 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.489
 st the first three boards are played change 

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:16.489
 stroke 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.040
 the fourth to win back with the flu 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.520
 but that situation is just a plot 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.230
 colorful street 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.010
 main business 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.010
 rubles on the floor 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.470
 told about this vieru 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.100
 and when we do 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.970
 eg 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.570
 come back again 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.080
 with at the same time the mediator itself with 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.220

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.900

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.340
 give up 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.699
 actually here 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.909
 the same can be done the other way around 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:46.159
 start from beats up 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.159
 and the Perm region 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.429
 the court handed down just for later 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:57.489
