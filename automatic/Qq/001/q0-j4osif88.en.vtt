00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
if I'm just going to go in the fridge

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.640 
if I'm just going to go in the fridge
and<00:02:30.790> grab<00:02:31.090> something<00:02:31.660> that<00:02:32.320> also<00:02:32.410> means

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
and grab something that also means

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.770 
and grab something that also means
actually<00:02:32.950> go<00:02:33.010> get<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.250> camera<00:02:33.490> and<00:02:33.910> so<00:02:34.420> I'm

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
actually go get the camera and so I'm

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.470 
actually go get the camera and so I'm
less<00:02:35.500> likely<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:36.040> just<00:02:36.190> like<00:02:36.490> go<00:02:36.970> eat

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
less likely to just like go eat

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.330
