 No. I think I just have to give up the product . 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:49.940
 I do not think it's done. 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.940
 Give me a long time to give up this dream 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.200
 U 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:01.070
 My family is not feeling well now . 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:04.820
 There's a lot of cello music. 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:09.909
 I am not studying what I want to do now. 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.909
 It is hard to catch almost all of the scholars who submitted it. 5 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:19.640
 I still have a cello at home. I'm just going to sell it now . 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:30.409
 When I was a kid, I saw mas rice, which I came to perform in kindergarten. 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:34.670
 I thought, so now I 'm still playing magic club and working hard. 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.350
 If you look at the seeds and experiences of Mr. Lee, 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.700
 You live. 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:45.409
 By the way, my friends are wondering what they're doing. 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.560
 If you listen to your friends , 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:55.959
 Now focus on studying before 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.959
 I still want to be black when I do not get my grades. 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.420
 Become an explorer when you're young. Then praise your arm. Sure. 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.509
 My father's age 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.869
 I told you seriously that you wanted to be an explorer 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.720
 I tried to get drunk. 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.920

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.080
 Since the day of the Caribbean , I have been so desperate everyday that I would like to try hard 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.310
 I told you I wanted to live. 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.280
 Then I leave the house and head. 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.770
 I think it's true that my father is right. 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.000
 U 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.240
 Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.240

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:16.239
 Army Now I see some lines. 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.590
 Still, when my mom looks at my daughter's shoulder, 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:23.290
 I want to 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:25.299
 But it is the life of our daughter and give the time or place of a mother to our daughter. 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:32.709
 It's not possible. 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:35.560
