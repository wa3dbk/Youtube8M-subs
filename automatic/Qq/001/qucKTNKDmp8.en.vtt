 how are youtube here in a new 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.270
 video that is going to be about the 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.240
 first version of minecraft pocket 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.730
 edition this is going to be a small review 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.260
 of the first version of minecraft to see 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.260
 we enter minecraft 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.039
 it was like minecraft you gave it start 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:33.630
 then here created by a world what 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.630
 you want for example here create new 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.989
 because he saved me 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.640
 because in my game to that there are things that 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.880
 they were not in this version yet 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.440
 that everything would run 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.440
 then we are staying 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.410
 start 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.860
 well apparently minecraft is very 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.730
 unstable 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:22.560
 here is is then 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:25.520
 we give him that he has had god 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.520
 but they did not 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.549
 I wish I did not finish it 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.480
 I said firing 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.760
 I do not think I use it for him I think I did not give him 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.760
 all right 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.520

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.390

 okay 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.730

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.450

 they want to play together do not leave it here 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.190
 in the comments what they want 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.690
 and I with good taste is the first 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.690
 Minecraft version 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.489
 there was already 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.489
 to 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.830
 and a school 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.340
 I see what happens is that I'm playing with 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.090
 xperia controls our 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.090
 control period 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.670
 options 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.670
 there is 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.840
 I think these are all these children 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.560
 it's weird michael I have to admit it 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.230
 it's weird 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.030
 to see here is but I do not understand why 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.209
 I can not move, I think I was just 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.720
 for the tests for the controls and 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.359
 xperia yes I think if I came back to see 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.910
 If I'm in control and well, I'm not 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.530
 I can move as you can see if I'm 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.739
 playing is not an action the image by 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.739
 what 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.419
 and there you see as the water moves is 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.660
 they reach to see bones I am touching the 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.660
 screen 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.030
 and touching and is the lava 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.490
 sky 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.900
 it may not seem like I have the controls 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.900
 now 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.240
 here it is 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:56.610
 it is only clear 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.580
 Well, this was a good one, this one 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.449
 it's the first minecraft that came out on 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.130
 first milestone that was when it came out and only 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:08.350
 you could play at the controls with 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.470
 experience could be control 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.560
 and then nothing this would be all this follows 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.740
 liking do not forget to give like sharing 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:21.390
 comment their saying what they want x and 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.660
 well or can change 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.660
 and 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:31.170
 how is that god too ok ok 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.580

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:43.620
 of object but you can move the sight 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:46.169
 good and this would be all 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.569

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:52.699
