00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.780 
anyway
but<00:02:42.440> we're<00:02:43.069> gonna<00:02:43.190> have<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.400> rice<00:02:43.640> pilaf<00:02:45.790> that

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
but we're gonna have the rice pilaf that

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.330 
but we're gonna have the rice pilaf that
is<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.060> best<00:02:47.269> I<00:02:47.599> look<00:02:48.290> at<00:02:48.410> that<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:48.680> mean<00:02:48.890> that

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
is the best I look at that I mean that

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.570 
is the best I look at that I mean that
is<00:02:49.970> like<00:02:50.000> an<00:02:50.209> art<00:02:50.420> project<00:02:51.340> it's<00:02:52.340> not<00:02:52.519> that

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
is like an art project it's not that

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.570 
is like an art project it's not that
good<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.450> I<00:02:53.480> guess<00:02:53.629> this<00:02:53.900> is<00:02:54.110> how<00:02:54.349> how<00:02:54.950> not<00:02:55.340> to

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
good so I guess this is how how not to

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.489 
good so I guess this is how how not to
cook<00:02:55.819> this<00:02:56.090> recipe<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:57.319> can<00:02:58.129> even<00:02:58.250> see
