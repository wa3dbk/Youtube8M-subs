00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.090
 download a map 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.700
 but without sum in traffic play it myself 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.800
 this case I will teach them to put the map 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.920

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:22.990

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.619

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.140

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.870
 to make it more interesting they left them 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.720
 the pass of the texture pack 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:21.060
 to make it more interesting and look 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.060
 cooler and which will be a trailer 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.130
 so they were listening a little bit 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.610
 I have already 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:47.990
 I do not know, do not try 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:50.620

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.620
 desk 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.470

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.679
 extract here 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:12.280
 and this is the map that favored 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.610
 good version for the start team 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.760

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.600
 to accept the pressure up to point 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.710
 minecraft are 16 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.710
 in their worlds 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.739
 the world moves east 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.770
 why 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:42.390
 and they already have their but this is a world 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:47.090

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.090

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:56.540

 if they were click 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:25.390

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.390
