00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.120
 second day of league the grenade as 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.249
 rival and the Real Madrid coach are looking for 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.470
 that your team improves and pulls out three new 

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:11.750
 points before a difficult set that already 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.320
 they have studied but we have good 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.020
 trust first to play better because 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.170
 it's true that we have not played very 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.170
 all right 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.000
 we have gained with more difficulty the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.040
 next game we are going to 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.040
 to try to play better 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:37.089
 we know what 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.089
 Granada is a good team 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.790
 last year won against real we have 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.570
 to be taken care of by this party the 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.329
 first away from home 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:54.460
 we need three points the team I think 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:58.809
 that is well concentrated to play 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.940
 good match we have seen grenade play 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.940
 the match the first game played very 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.430
 well it's a fast team that has good 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.950
 defensive offensive organization I think that 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.220
 It will be a difficult match for us 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.860
 plus 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.160
 We have the confidence to pass a good 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.020
 match to try to win in the eleven 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.210
 several doubts the casualties in the center of the 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.050
 field will make ancelotti have to 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:29.340
 pull alternatives and now it's fine 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:32.290
 next week I started to train dry 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.220
 with the stress equipment will make them 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.740
 I do not think it will be available for the 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:43.140
 match against bilbao ma surely 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.140
 will be available when it starts 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.479
 the league after the matches 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.270
 we have a problem with international 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.359
 what would 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.359
 We can solve with received 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.150
 in another way as a disc 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.220
 near madrid and that explains all the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.039
 decisions you have to make when 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.299
 there are doubts about who to line up try 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.450
 I hate trying to make decisions 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:18.019
 for the team because the team wins 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.019
 for the club 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.709
 Above all it is important to understand 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.540
 that you are not going to play diego will not drown 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.569
 iger is going to drown the goalkeeper of real 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.150
 madrid I think this is the thing 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.879
 important is not going to drown that here is not going 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.579
 to choke benzema is going to drown a 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:42.030
 real Madrid player can be that the 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:45.360
 coach trainer missing in a 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.100
 decision more as I said try to 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.180
 drink 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.180
 all decisions 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.850
 for the team it's for the club that swims 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.050
 plus 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:04.270
 I have played madrid many times 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.070
 easy to play here the opponent is very 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.400
 difficult because the environment is very 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.400
 hot 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.300
 and I think for us for all 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.960
 woman the players is very important the 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.370
 lack 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.730
 of the fans by 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.090
 santiago bernabéu is our house 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:29.879
 our house we have to be 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:33.120
 be comfortable I am sure that the 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:36.390
 next game will be an environment that 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.890
 supports the team also did not understand the 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.590
 words pronounced by tata martino 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:46.110
 about a team that is not his 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:50.120
 I think it was a words that I have not 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.120
 understood because I think that 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.040
 It's not long that Tata is here 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:59.349
 martino and still do not understand how 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.260
 European football works football 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.800
 European is like that also understands us 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.700
 how your own club works because 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.830
 Barcelona 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.540
 has bought very important players 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.780
 paying paying money I do not know how many 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.780
 no no 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.180
 I do not want 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:29.820
 talk about this I think it was a words 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:33.000
 a little strange because of this position 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.760
 of özil analyzed by his match technician 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.010
 before against bilbao the party that we have 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.740
 played friendly 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:44.070
 defensively started a job 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.129
 defensive on the right later with the 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:51.110
 ball needs 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.110
 play in midfield this is 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:05:00.970
 the work what 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:00.970
 the team needs to stop for özil 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:08.759
 it feels good does not have does not have any 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.800
 problem and the versatility of Christian 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.810
 and the mobility of benzema are two of the 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.750
 qualities that ancelotti underlines of its 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.390
 team 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.500
 I think that as I said many times 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:26.180
 ronaldo can play a little and a little 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:28.460
 in the band you can play in the center 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.910
 this does not change anything for karim I have 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:37.900
 I think I have a good combination of 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:41.500
 game the two have no problem 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:47.020
 to play because also karim is a 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:52.020
 player who wants to move that does not have 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.020
 a fixed position of the field
