00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:09.150
 today I 'm dying hello to everyone 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.150
 welcome to another video of that mouth 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.840
 or what I bring are my favorites of 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.450
 this month of May and the truth is 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.550
 there are so many things to 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.259
 call for hair and I have two 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.180
 things for hair 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.580
 the first is this shampoo that is the 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.090
 frizz and santi and john treatment 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.710
 frieda and it's the pump is not a very field 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.980
 very organic natural the truth is that 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.930
 it has enough silicones but what 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.500
 good that it has is that I can 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.120
 use as a shampoo and also if you 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.190
 I let it work for a while 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.049
 conditioner that is me in soap 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.239
 normal hair first last I clarify 

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:49.040
 second pass and I do not clarify list to the 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.650
 instantly I let the foam that has 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.430
 so let's stay minutillo course 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.519
 two minutes and I notice that it helps a lot 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.320
 by not beating but it does not curl and then 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.879
 that also of a function as it is so 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.350
 strong because it also works a bit 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.390
 as conditioner the next 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.950
 product is from l'oréal and it is a serum 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.899
 to control 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.899
 the smooth hair to leave it then 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.520
 softer and I bought basically 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:17.390
 for the same reason why I like this 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.829
 product because it leaves the hair very soft 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.250
 I notice that it does leave a finish 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:24.500
 professional or it was not noticed that I know how 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.979
 is good of the l'oréal range 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.520
 the professionnel and the one of the range list 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.049
 control and the strength that it has is one and 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.759
 good is a being used and control 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.149
 intensive this can not be found 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.229
 normally in drugstores or in 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.789
 perfumeries in general but in stores 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.679
 a little more specialized in hairdressing 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.780
 I am for example I bought this in 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.899
 perfumery is fine that yes it has 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.390
 things more dedicated to the professional I 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.340
 I saw it and the l'oréal products for 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.200
 I've already tried other hair from the range 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.930
 professional and had liked going 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.390
 looking for a serum and this one 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.310
 and very well afterwards I was going back to 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.460
 use these powders a lot to see 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.759
 minerals the originals and I put them in 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.350
 my favorites of 2012 because they are the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.860
 powders that are great but lately 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.800
 they are using loose powders or powders 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.540
 compact non- mineral for all this of 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.970
 that reflect the light that they leave behind 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.200
 finished juicy and such and I used then 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.150
 Congosto finishing bases and no 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.880
 I was looking for some for those who also 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.640
 had the same style finish but 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.450
 something more dull that will sit a little 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.580
 No, but lately I've been to 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.860
 exams and so I did not start 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.930
 put me base and powder but that 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.480
 directly I put these because they are 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.940
 of a pretty good culture put me 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.940
 corrector and it's over and it's already 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.940
 great leaving out precious and as 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.580
 that I have fallen in love with these 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.910
 poles and how good they are 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.260
 cool I have three blushes I start 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.530
 why I'm wearing today that is the 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.350
 pitching part of your face and it's this color 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.430
 is that you have leopard print and 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.430
 do not 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.049
 or leopard or leopard basically 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.849
 because he is using this too 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.159
 lately for the same reason why not 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.900
 I started to control myself 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.540
 pronounced and rouge with special 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.069
 frizz and I was already because they have a lot 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.689
 more run but also has a little bit of 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.700
 orange with which I do not use it 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:26.250
 only of outline but that even 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.829
 maybe a line longer than what 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.040
 there was only with rouge but 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.139
 well a modernized effect as very 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.370
 pretty and I like to ride then this 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:40.800
 what's the 007 so so so so so 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.280
 that is mission impossible 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.210
 how is the James Bond song is this 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.640
 orange a little reddish what is 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.280
 God or Ares grows where you take it out on 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.690
 other favorite videos 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.670
 I think this is the first month and I 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.530
 like a lot I want to try more 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.480
 colors of the brand because the duration 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.330
 in the cheeks is a pass 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.730
 it's perfectly comparable 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:11.450
 to the duration of the colors of nash a 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.069
 very good pigmentation but maybe the 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.100
 difference with those that would be of greater 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.630
 band is the way to blur that 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.209
 it costs a little more but if 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.769
 you use a suitable brush there will be no 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.260
 any problems or if you do so 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.110
 little by little, either 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.270
 there will be no more great great great and 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.550
 finally this of the bank is the cad 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.800
 anábal and this I also gave it to him 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.290
 mother for her birthday because it's a 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.360
 blusher that is the bomber h bomb this 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.680
 quite quite the purple tone is a 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.200
 pink 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.390
 very bruised that I do not think 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.800
 more than throwing to the bracket pulls even more 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:52.230
 the more brownish I do not like the more grayish it removes 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.460
 and it's a blush it's not total matte leaves 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.770
 a little satin finish on the 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.810
 skin but not glitter but very 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.150
 healthy and very beautiful and it is also hard 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.040
 put everything you want or whatever 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.990
 that you want and really that the color is 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.060
 beautiful and this color I think it is 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.090
 as well in light skins as in 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.250
 dark shops that in all the majority 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.440
 of tonalities will be very very well 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.450
 so I really think it's from the 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.730
 three if all three this is the color that 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.340
 I liked the most during the month and 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.730
 last three little things of lips the first 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.760
 the one that costs me is the apocalypse 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.530
 of mascara and these are lipsticks 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.900
 that now they have removed almost all the 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:36.370
 marks and this is in the tone 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.370
 apocalyptic apocalypse 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:44.150
 apocalypse the 303 and well it is this 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:48.400
 pink as from here once it dries 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.400
 it sticks and transfers a little bit 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:54.250
 normal but the intensity of the color 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:57.370
 remains the same or is not not 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.740
 but to be pink 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.139
 I believe that it adheres in such a way to 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.210
 lip that stays like this forever 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:07.360
 after this maybelline lipstick 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:10.180
 which is the super 14 lipstick hours and 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.560
 this is in the tone of youtube stay with 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.490
 I coral 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.320
 43 and this is this coral so it's a 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.870
 coral tone that was all coral is a 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.820
 pink thing is a choral thing for not this 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.060
 It is that it is a coral tone 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:28.960
 and it is this color here the consistency 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.220
 of this lipstick is very good to me 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.470
 I really like the finish that he leaves because 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.900
 it seems that it is the color of your lips be 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:38.340
 it does not seem that you wear lipsticks that 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:41.620
 take a product on top is what you 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.449
 synchronizes also adheres to make 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.629
 lip that 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:49.569
 the finish is really great 

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:52.180
 terrific great and the color is super 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:54.789
 pimp hard put also life and 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.320
 average so cool great great 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:59.630
 great great great 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:04.710
 and finally this network gloss what is 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:09.560
 in the tone newt ballast luster 04 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:12.270
 and this is a newt tone like that 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.030
 it is this brown he cited from here 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:17.790
 and it has just pigmentation so that 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:20.070
 is neither more finished very 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.990
 pigmented too much neither do I 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.240
 They are enthusiastic but they have pigmentation 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.000
 just to be colored to the lip 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.520
 but neither is it a superville finish 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.449
 pasteloso and well this brown that 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:35.979
 have a little 

00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:38.199
 to a peach rose to peach and I 

00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:39.520
 I really like this day to day 

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:41.529
 It's great because these are also 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.379
 They last for a long time 

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:47.589
 I would say that four banks 

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:50.499
 easily last we go in the those that's 

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:51.939
 a lot so very good and those are already 

00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:52.719
 are all the products that I wanted 

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:54.759
 teach this month 

00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:58.199
 I hope you liked it and that we 

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:58.199
 we see in the next video bye bye
