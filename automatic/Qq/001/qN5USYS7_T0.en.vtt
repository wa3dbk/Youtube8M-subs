 opa 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.619
 rodrigo poletto that I liked to see 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.109
 this point with and author also of the best 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.960
 I will lose weight once and I want to talk 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.930
 with you today is the question that much 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.750
 People make a point of me because I gain weight. 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.609
 back after the diet is over is the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.410
 old accordion effect actually who 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.500
 never suffered is also his son at the time 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.050
 I tell you is now you have gained weight 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.120
 back after the diet ends such 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.469
 which is what unfortunately is what 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.550
 happens with the majority of people who 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.559
 end up following a diet 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.140
 this is because the body tends to 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.379
 stabilize at a weight so if you're 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.710
 is at that weight some time and tends to 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.629
 to return to the same weight, but it is 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.329
 tac diet is something that is not natural 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.390
 It's something that's really temporary. 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.710
 it is usually restricted is receptive to you 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.559
 end up doing things you would not do 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.170
 a normal life a normal routine 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.270
 all that is abnormal for body the body 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.580
 is no fool finally messed intelligent 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.950
 he realizes the type of change in e 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.380
 so he can he comes back to 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.860
 balance homeostasis 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.290
 weight when the diet ends. 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.180
 and traditional diets that you see 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.310
 there are already all kinds of such nobody 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.650
 Can you take a diet of this life? 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.600
 whole is why I both say that 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.540
 diet is a failed concept that already 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.850
 wrong at the beginning right then I always say 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.740
 a correct food lifestyle that 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.640
 you need to build the one you 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.619
 lose weight naturally to achieve the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.990
 ideal weight or weight that is natural for you 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.540
 It is better only when debt with 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.340
 and that this is an act 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.070
 for the entire life and how it is possible 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.530
 only by creating habits that are 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.960
 that a sense is made that does not 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.570
 receptive are not controversial 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.430
 it is full of bullshit the silly rules 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.409
 who knows what does not work so 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.509
 Direct does not work what I really 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.360
 I suggest you focus on building 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.459
 correct food that will get you 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.210
 will help touched to get back on weight 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.430
 ideal 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.320
 see the weight that is natural to you what 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.750
 a lot of people often make people 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.350
 they often speak the person entered 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.740
 on a diet and ends up either ne or food way 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.570
 which ends up making it difficult for our body 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.850
 works in the way it works and live 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.410
 with the ideal weight the low weight that is 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.710
 natural way for people where our health 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.260
 it's okay, okay, all the weight will come back if 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.940
 you lose weight with the radical diet one 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.160
 diet that is not natural to you 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.930
 weight will understand how to return 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.090
 effect and there is no repair for 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.070
 this unless you put it in the head 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.080
 that construction in a food style 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.600
 correct with the whole life is something 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.630
