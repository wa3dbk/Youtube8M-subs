00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:09.540
 laptop tube disassembly so the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.240
 funny carousel here 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.070
 provides uniform button presses 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:22.730
 and not jamming these carousels 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:27.900
 in this laptop is my laptop cases 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:31.650
 in a sharply there in the moment, 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.590
 this notebook stripes 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.050
 you doggie say carousel is with 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.640
 back side 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.309
 front side carousel latch 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.180
 there are ears that can be broken 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:50.390
 trying to take from this side with that 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.770
 parties do not always not always succeed 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.629
 pick up 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.809
 Now I will try to do it best 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.899
 jump from here 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.149
 that is, I shove the very top 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:09.689
 under the button I try to shove there 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:15.570
 needle is not surprising option 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.460
 the other i'm in the middle sticking a tick 2 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.439
 can be raised higher so she 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.189
 slipped that is there is emptiness 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.680
 in the middle 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.080
 that is, literally just rezinochka under 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.159
 this emptiness 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.270
 push and pushing this void needle i 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.820
 move it 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.710
 from myself neat to neat 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.930
 characteristic click them there two must 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.700
 be they both get one at a time later 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.149
 button on a bit she pulls 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.780
 removed in this case, such here 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.570
 Labuda happened 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.580
 here it is a merry-go-round like here with the light 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:00.530
 interesting on camera peresveta some 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:04.320
 given carousel the removal of the carousel itself 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:11.250
 right here I fake his bold wai name 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:16.260
 leg it inside by pulling out here 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:20.959
 the main thing is not to overdo it so what else 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.959
 I feel for sure I will do it before I try 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.860
 neatly unhurried 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.019
 so you can still try it like this 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.700
 very well there it is taken out 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:41.069
 then sausage of all freedom 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.110
 superfluous like any other well and crumbs 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.130
 which for which you actually 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.180
 will have to disassemble what happens 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:54.090
 back installation happens a bit 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:03:01.200
 understandably in the reverse order but then 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:05.850
 there is a normal position normal 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:11.820
 position and and that was i open 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:13.650
 carousel so then I will remove and then 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.100
 Here is the first part I put 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.290
 because here too there is a hook 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:25.560
 I put the hook here, he so jump out easily 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:30.030
 well maybe just the second part I already 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.180
 the second half of the carousel I hook it 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.060
 here these latches she puts on much 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.250
 easier than removing then installing 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.880
 buttons a button like this 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.740
 the design goes like cameras upside down 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.290
 button is such a button design 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.580
 back on the far side of us on the go 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.830
 there is a latch 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:55.000
 which last must 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.760
 dress from closer to us under the button 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.560
 is hooks 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.280
 such are the corners that can be broken 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.200
 as you can see 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.920
 the laptop has already experienced a lot and here already 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:10.240
 hook a little while prices that is 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.790
 dress we turn over a button like this 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.010
 here we raise 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.989
 striped slightly fix striped 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:22.270
 again why and with the sled call the bark 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:25.990
 sister more I just hit the button on top 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.980
 I press down the middle part slightly and catch 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:33.030
 here it is a hook dropped just moving myself 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.560
 removing the daw and pushing the back 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.410
 all she clicked with those data 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.940
 hooks 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.750
 installation is finished and so very quickly 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.630
 can be disassembled with spaces and side 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.820
 buttons there is much more complicated but 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.750
 the principle is about the same that is 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.750
 for example, c 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:08.180
 there is already sleight of hand and nothing more 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:09.460
 experience experience experience is very helpful if 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.580
 carousel 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:16.639
 smoke mesh nothing is broken then she 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:20.750
 will dress well be removed and 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:23.419
 work if you get the baby here 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.780
 under the merry-go-round little crummy she 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:30.110
 you will ruin your whole life while you are from there 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:34.270
 do not shake out to shake out need 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.270
 Good luck to remove a button
