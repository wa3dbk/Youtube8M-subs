00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.390 
of what it looks like if you can see
first<00:02:21.629> bolt<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:22.019> right<00:02:22.230> above<00:02:22.469> here<00:02:22.829> second

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
first bolt is right above here second

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.699 
first bolt is right above here second
bolts<00:02:23.609> over<00:02:23.849> here<00:02:24.150> all<00:02:25.109> right<00:02:25.230> once<00:02:25.469> you<00:02:25.590> get

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
bolts over here all right once you get

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.319 
bolts over here all right once you get
those<00:02:25.859> out<00:02:26.099> they<00:02:26.670> look<00:02:26.819> like<00:02:26.909> this

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
those out they look like this

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.539 
those out they look like this
fair<00:02:27.780> warning<00:02:28.079> the<00:02:28.530> one<00:02:28.709> furthest<00:02:29.189> that<00:02:29.400> way

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
fair warning the one furthest that way

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.809 
fair warning the one furthest that way
is<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.819> hard<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.659> reach<00:02:30.719> but<00:02:31.620> if<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.489> work<00:02:32.639> at<00:02:32.790> it

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
is a hard to reach but if you work at it

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.399 
is a hard to reach but if you work at it
you<00:02:32.939> will<00:02:33.299> eventually<00:02:33.480> get<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.900> out<00:02:34.019> now<00:02:34.170> this

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
you will eventually get it out now this

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.740 
you will eventually get it out now this
should<00:02:35.099> be<00:02:35.219> loose<00:02:35.489> save<00:02:36.030> for<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:36.510> locking

should be loose save for the locking

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.330 
should be loose save for the locking
cylinder<00:02:37.079> and<00:02:37.500> I'll<00:02:37.829> show<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.040> how<00:02:38.129> to<00:02:38.159> get

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
cylinder and I'll show you how to get

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.789 
cylinder and I'll show you how to get
that<00:02:38.489> out<00:02:38.629> but<00:02:39.629> you<00:02:39.719> basically<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.349> pop<00:02:40.620> it

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
that out but you basically just pop it

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.059 
that out but you basically just pop it
out<00:02:40.919> and<00:02:42.379> there's<00:02:43.379> a<00:02:43.469> there's<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.889> weather

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
out and there's a there's a weather

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.990 
out and there's a there's a weather
coating<00:02:45.469> around<00:02:46.469> the<00:02:46.829> outside<00:02:47.219> that<00:02:47.250> can<00:02:47.790> just

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
coating around the outside that can just

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.690 
coating around the outside that can just
come<00:02:48.150> off<00:02:48.299> once<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.079> get<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.290> free<00:02:49.519> so<00:02:50.519> once

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
come off once you get it free so once

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.800 
come off once you get it free so once
you<00:02:50.790> get<00:02:50.909> it<00:02:51.000> popped<00:02:51.209> out<00:02:51.359> you<00:02:51.510> kind<00:02:51.629> of<00:02:51.659> want

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
you get it popped out you kind of want

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.599 
you get it popped out you kind of want
to<00:02:51.840> bring<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.079> bottom<00:02:52.260> out<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:53.189> it'll<00:02:53.459> drop

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
to bring the bottom out and it'll drop

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.149 
to bring the bottom out and it'll drop
down<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.629> cut<00:02:55.169> it<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.290> kind<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.560> angle<00:02:56.069> it

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
down and you cut it you kind of angle it

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.809 
down and you cut it you kind of angle it
this<00:02:56.340> way<00:02:56.699> and<00:02:57.000> I'll<00:02:57.389> pull<00:02:58.079> down<00:02:58.609> angle<00:02:59.609> it

this way and I'll pull down angle it

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.149 
this way and I'll pull down angle it
this<00:03:00.030> way<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.419> then<00:03:00.540> angle<00:03:00.840> back<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:02.040> it

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
this way and then angle back and it

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.059 
this way and then angle back and it
should<00:03:02.280> come<00:03:02.400> out<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:03.469> may<00:03:04.469> need<00:03:04.650> two<00:03:04.769> hands<00:03:04.980> for

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
should come out I may need two hands for

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.459 
should come out I may need two hands for
that<00:03:05.400> all<00:03:06.180> right<00:03:06.239> once<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.629> get<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.959> out<00:03:07.079> of

that all right once you get it out of

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.250 
that all right once you get it out of
place<00:03:07.969> first<00:03:08.969> thing<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.150> can<00:03:09.299> do<00:03:09.389> is<00:03:09.629> detach

way<00:03:33.569> but<00:03:34.379> then<00:03:34.470> I'll<00:03:34.650> see<00:03:34.949> this<00:03:35.069> locking<00:03:35.430> pin

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
way but then I'll see this locking pin

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:36.949 
way but then I'll see this locking pin
right<00:03:35.729> here<00:03:35.790> it's<00:03:36.150> kind<00:03:36.209> of<00:03:36.299> hard<00:03:36.479> to<00:03:36.509> see

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
right here it's kind of hard to see

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.640 
right here it's kind of hard to see
touch<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.739> this<00:03:37.829> way<00:03:38.040> oh<00:03:39.169> it<00:03:40.169> just<00:03:40.439> it<00:03:40.620> just

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
touch it this way oh it just it just

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.399 
touch it this way oh it just it just
goes<00:03:40.889> around<00:03:41.189> you<00:03:41.699> um<00:03:41.959> basically<00:03:42.959> kind<00:03:43.319> of

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
goes around you um basically kind of

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.319 
goes around you um basically kind of
have<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.620> bend<00:03:43.829> it<00:03:43.949> it's<00:03:44.069> a<00:03:44.159> strong<00:03:44.430> metal<00:03:44.759> but

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
have to bend it it's a strong metal but

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.149 
have to bend it it's a strong metal but
you<00:03:45.419> bend<00:03:45.599> it<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.930> um<00:03:46.109> it<00:03:46.739> pops<00:03:46.919> out<00:03:47.069> and

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
you bend it and um it pops out and

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.729 
you bend it and um it pops out and
that'll<00:03:47.370> let<00:03:47.519> this<00:03:47.669> slide<00:03:47.970> out<00:03:48.349> okay<00:03:49.349> so<00:03:49.379> it's

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
that'll let this slide out okay so it's

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.199 
that'll let this slide out okay so it's
come<00:03:49.949> out<00:03:49.979> my<00:03:50.280> hand<00:03:50.519> there<00:03:50.669> and<00:03:50.819> that<00:03:50.909> should

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
come out my hand there and that should

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.550 
come out my hand there and that should
just<00:03:51.540> come<00:03:52.290> right<00:03:52.680> off<00:03:54.379> shouldn't<00:03:55.379> you<00:03:55.439> two

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
just come right off shouldn't you two

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.420 
just come right off shouldn't you two
hands<00:03:55.769> port<00:03:55.979> but<00:03:56.099> I<00:03:56.129> guess<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.370> do

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
hands port but I guess I do

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.850 
hands port but I guess I do
so<00:03:58.060> there<00:03:58.329> you<00:03:58.360> go<00:03:58.930> handles<00:03:59.650> off<00:04:00.540> listen<00:04:01.860> so

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
so there you go handles off listen so

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.890 
so there you go handles off listen so
that's<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.069> old<00:04:03.220> one<00:04:03.310> that's<00:04:03.430> rusted<00:04:03.849> on<00:04:03.970> and

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
that's the old one that's rusted on and

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.780 
that's the old one that's rusted on and
you'll<00:04:05.110> see<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.349> other<00:04:05.470> piece<00:04:05.680> I'll<00:04:06.340> see<00:04:06.549> this

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.940 

this<00:04:09.790> arm<00:04:10.060> right<00:04:10.239> here<00:04:10.659> should<00:04:11.379> be<00:04:11.500> a<00:04:11.530> second

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
this arm right here should be a second

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.179 
this arm right here should be a second
one<00:04:12.329> right<00:04:13.329> here<00:04:14.049> but<00:04:14.349> it's<00:04:14.500> you<00:04:14.709> can<00:04:14.859> see<00:04:14.890> it's

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:15.189 
one right here but it's you can see it's

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.080 
one right here but it's you can see it's
it's<00:04:15.790> broken<00:04:16.060> off<00:04:16.329> on<00:04:16.630> it<00:04:17.289> that's<00:04:17.590> what<00:04:17.769> pushes

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
it's broken off on it that's what pushes

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.310 
it's broken off on it that's what pushes
this<00:04:19.090> down<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.509> opens<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.870> door

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
this down and opens the door

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.400 
this down and opens the door
this<00:04:20.979> uh<00:04:21.009> this<00:04:21.400> black<00:04:21.820> weather<00:04:22.750> coating

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
this uh this black weather coating

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.529 
this uh this black weather coating
around<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.460> outside<00:04:24.759> can<00:04:24.940> can<00:04:25.240> just<00:04:25.389> pop

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
around the outside can can just pop

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.870 
around the outside can can just pop
right<00:04:25.750> off<00:04:25.810> it<00:04:26.110> doesn't<00:04:26.229> matter<00:04:26.440> um<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:27.160> now

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
right off it doesn't matter um and now

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.310 
right off it doesn't matter um and now
there's<00:04:28.360> one<00:04:28.419> on<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.690> new<00:04:28.810> one<00:04:28.960> so<00:04:29.110> I'll<00:04:29.169> just

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
there's one on the new one so I'll just

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.860 
there's one on the new one so I'll just
use<00:04:29.440> that<00:04:29.470> so<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:30.550> just<00:04:30.580> take<00:04:30.850> your<00:04:31.449> new<00:04:31.660> piece

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
use that so you just take your new piece

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.969 
use that so you just take your new piece
and<00:04:31.900> take<00:04:32.199> the<00:04:32.320> locking<00:04:32.650> pin<00:04:32.830> out<00:04:32.949> and

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
and take the locking pin out and

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.520 
and take the locking pin out and
basically<00:04:33.310> just<00:04:33.610> reverse<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.090> steps<00:04:34.300> um<00:04:34.600> then

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
basically just reverse the steps um then

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.250 
basically just reverse the steps um then
you<00:04:35.650> detach<00:04:35.919> on<00:04:36.250> that<00:04:37.180> that<00:04:37.449> clip<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:38.110> red

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
you detach on that that clip the red

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.790 
you detach on that that clip the red
clip<00:04:38.530> -<00:04:38.740> uh<00:04:38.820> -<00:04:39.820> this<00:04:39.940> right<00:04:40.120> here<00:04:40.470> that's<00:04:41.470> and

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
clip - uh - this right here that's and

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.350 
clip - uh - this right here that's and
then<00:04:42.580> you<00:04:42.639> can<00:04:42.760> start<00:04:42.940> putting<00:04:43.150> your<00:04:43.210> door

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
then you can start putting your door

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.939 
then you can start putting your door
back<00:04:43.539> together<00:04:43.660> I've<00:04:44.139> got<00:04:44.289> my<00:04:44.410> lock<00:04:44.590> cylinder

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
back together I've got my lock cylinder

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.830 
back together I've got my lock cylinder
place<00:04:45.160> with<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.400> locking<00:04:45.610> pin<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.240> I'm<00:04:46.690> just

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
place with the locking pin and I'm just

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.469 
place with the locking pin and I'm just
going<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:46.990> attach<00:04:47.169> this<00:04:47.289> right<00:04:47.350> there<00:04:47.710> it<00:04:47.830> is

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
going to attach this right there it is

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.750 
going to attach this right there it is
should<00:04:49.479> just<00:04:49.630> go<00:04:49.750> right<00:04:49.960> back<00:04:50.020> in<00:04:50.520> alright<00:04:51.520> and

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
should just go right back in alright and

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.900 
should just go right back in alright and
already<00:04:52.120> I<00:04:52.389> see<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:53.620> door<00:04:54.010> won't<00:04:54.190> open<00:04:54.340> here

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
already I see the door won't open here

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.120 
already I see the door won't open here
but<00:04:55.419> I<00:04:55.449> even<00:04:56.050> though<00:04:56.110> it's<00:04:56.259> not<00:04:56.349> bolted<00:04:56.590> in<00:04:56.889> a

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
but I even though it's not bolted in a

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.320 
but I even though it's not bolted in a
handle<00:04:57.940> will<00:04:58.060> still<00:04:58.270> open<00:04:58.599> the<00:04:58.930> door<00:05:00.330> okay

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
handle will still open the door okay

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.670 
handle will still open the door okay
your<00:05:01.479> next<00:05:01.630> step<00:05:01.900> is<00:05:01.930> to<00:05:02.080> put<00:05:02.229> the<00:05:02.349> bolts<00:05:02.620> back

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
your next step is to put the bolts back

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.150 
your next step is to put the bolts back
on<00:05:02.830> and<00:05:03.280> I'll<00:05:03.669> actually<00:05:04.479> right<00:05:04.840> here<00:05:04.949> we<00:05:05.949> pop

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
on and I'll actually right here we pop

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.029 
on and I'll actually right here we pop
this<00:05:06.310> little<00:05:06.610> rubber<00:05:06.760> piece<00:05:06.880> out<00:05:07.360> all<00:05:08.039> because

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
this little rubber piece out all because

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.800 
this little rubber piece out all because
then<00:05:09.250> you<00:05:09.340> can<00:05:09.490> see<00:05:09.820> that<00:05:09.849> bolt<00:05:10.389> that's<00:05:10.599> tough

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
then you can see that bolt that's tough

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.100 
then you can see that bolt that's tough
to<00:05:10.930> get<00:05:11.080> to<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:12.580> put<00:05:12.760> back<00:05:12.940> in<00:05:13.180> that<00:05:13.810> it<00:05:14.050> was

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
to get to to put back in that it was

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.770 
to get to to put back in that it was
really<00:05:14.289> really<00:05:15.070> it<00:05:15.250> was<00:05:15.340> a<00:05:15.370> struggle<00:05:15.780> then

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
really really it was a struggle then

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.420 
really really it was a struggle then
your<00:05:17.199> next<00:05:17.320> step<00:05:17.530> is<00:05:17.650> just<00:05:17.680> putting<00:05:18.190> the<00:05:18.250> door

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
your next step is just putting the door

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.159 
your next step is just putting the door
panel<00:05:18.699> back<00:05:18.820> on<00:05:18.970> and<00:05:19.240> you're<00:05:19.720> good<00:05:19.870> to<00:05:19.990> go

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
panel back on and you're good to go

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.379 
panel back on and you're good to go
so<00:05:20.889> you<00:05:21.099> just<00:05:21.280> take<00:05:21.430> out<00:05:21.580> your<00:05:21.639> door<00:05:21.940> door

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
so you just take out your door door
