00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.529
 hello to all and welcome to 01net tv 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.690
 like every morning it will be released on the 11th 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.500
 April and we are all in the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.150
 starting blocks 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.940
 it will be the flagship flagship 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.890
 the samsung galaxy s 5 franÃ§ois and one 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.190
 talked a lot about it last night galaxy 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.020
 s 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.029
 in this great live talk during 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.490
 more than half an hour we debated with 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.830
 01net.com journalists and of course 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.660
 the specificities of this phone very 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.740
 waited and we were interested in one 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.449
 particularities that is very 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.610
 important in a smartphone it's 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.290
 the camera and yes since samsung 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.920
 we promise mountains and wonders with this 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.050
 s 5 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.610
 so let's see this in detail with 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.610
 stÃ©phanie molinier and bruno cormier 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.700
 so the photo is an important thing 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.560
 still in smartphones and there 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.730
 they made some efforts at home 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.290
 Samsung 16 megapixel sensor 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.430
 So we win is not higher 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.280
 because i think sony 1 20 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.620
 billion development it seems most 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.160
 fast of the market he is developing 11 03 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.530
 seconds 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.060
 so that will be left when a frame and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.670
 take out your phone you already have the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.260
 focus the city and brownies 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.640
 so that you will do us the tests that he 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.160
 must in due time 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.450
 and then to this system it's very much 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.340
 fashion but it's true that it's nice 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.009
 allows to make a photo by blurring 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.630
 the background 1 for Santa Claus 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.040
 they call that selectv replenished there 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.290
 we show you some features 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.460
 photo we could film at the mobile world 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.320
 congress because we knew we had 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.930
 the chance to manipulate this galaxy 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.790
 and 5 with a version not sure if it's 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.250
 the final version of the software 1 on 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.270
 do not know if it really will be all 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.009
 these features that will be found 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.690
 no doubt a noise so of course you 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.570
 it's two months three months from the 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.149
 official release of the noted smartphone 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.440
 definitively pretty good and then she 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.890
 possibility of even putting 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.240
 point after stroke on some stuff a 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.970
 little bit like the way it's called 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.319
 do you see what I mean 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.850
 this little strange camera 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.740
 which looks like a cube 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.619
 ah yes photo and after you can too much 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.090
 worked very very hard then 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.399
 attack apparently there are things that 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.060
 look like that too but what's this 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.970
 we have others 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.490
 good so the camera on the device 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.230
 photo there is the hdr mode also the for 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.150
 me the big progress actually with 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.830
 the focus in 03 seconds that is going to be very 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.599
 practice and I run but the big 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.510
 progress is the hdr model that is to say 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.069
 a hdr mode in fact that that is 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.269
 absolutely transparent for 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.860
 the user it was necessary 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.780
 understand that before when we wanted 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.280
 take a picture hdr he had to take 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.250
 the picture and stretch an ear 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.849
 seconds it's milling there now it's 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.430
 instantaneous 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.040
 and it's actually it's the sensor 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.849
 himself who does hdr mode so without 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.379
 without having to do photo editing a 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.730
 posteriori and so it works 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.069
 actually so much in real time that it 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.629
 also works in video very well 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.400
 since we will be able to make videos in 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.590
 full control I dare say we will be able 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.420
 make videos lends itself to his vision of 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.150
 hdfc it allows to limit the phenomena 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.379
 of overexposure under exposure there you 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.040
 can take earlier face the 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.389
 almost sun is having details 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.220
 despite all the disadvantages 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:11.549
 unions and the disadvantages is that 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.680
 the photo is necessarily artificial for 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.609
 the purists of the photo the purists 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.459
 tests jr that said me I think that 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.379
 rather nice to look at even like 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.940
 these outbreaks at second bottom 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.310
 downside is that it over saturates a 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.870
 little colors sometimes but me 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.209
 now with a smartphone I 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.970
 annoys me more I use the hdr mode in 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.129
 permanence or so here I am I have a 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.650
 ice3 so it's going to roll then I'd like 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:44.599
 railroad worker cormier who comes to talk to us 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:47.940
 the martyr try it's snobbery 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:50.730
 Julian who are asking us that the s5 is 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.739
 equipped mode 120 frames per second at 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.599
 the other exploit the slow motion that has 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.079
 by the way on the iphone goes well in 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.900
 question 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.439
 it is true that 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:07.939
 it was in fall that launched this mode 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:11.689
 in hd the idle in Algeria and the z2 the 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:12.739
 2 the new z2 a lot more is this one 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:14.060
 question about the catenary that he is 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.310
 left what was my case of qualifying it 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.100
 shortfall 5 movies as 4K 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.750
 the new falls as sony as the 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.940
 this is the new trend of the first 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.460
 smartphones that filmed in case 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.860
 that we had in the test lab we have to 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.289
 know that the smartphone films in four 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.020
 case but at that point it turns off the 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:39.410
 digital stabilization so you will have 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.770
 an image in 4k mixed cheese or 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.020
 dessert 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.199
 it will be necessary to know if the s5 arrives at 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.300
 filming in which case keeping without his 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.010
 digital stabilization since for a 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.120
 movie humor is something drinking 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.349
 you must have a 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.340
 stabilization you think she 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:53.720
 do not want to be important I think 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.389
 on the z2 precisely they have 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.180
 particularly cured stabilization 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.460
 even if it is only digital we could 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.380
 to test four cases in 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.150
 conditions a little bit difficult a 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.430
 a priori it seems to work to see 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.180
 during our tests 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.080
 you think they will take 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.789
 the advanced compared to the competition 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.080
 with particularly its functions 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.070
 photo where they will just get to 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.090
 level because it is true that the 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.510
 great things that are done at home 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:21.470
 nokia 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:23.529
 at htc etc for example for example my 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.509
 flip-flops iphone 5 is healthy to take 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:28.419
 a reference in terms of photo quality 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:29.769
 and video the iphone 5 aces already has when 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.289
 even a lot of the features 

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:35.459
 announced by the galaxy s 5 he did not 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:38.289
 the meaning you were talking about earlier then 

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:40.779
 for example the quality of the fake ass 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:43.059
 focus speed of the focus of the 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:45.429
 iphone 5 ha it is also excellent and 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:47.819
 very fast must know that as it 

00:05:45.429 --> 00:05:51.279
 very quickly triggers an iphone 5s 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:54.789
 the hdr mode is not instantaneous this 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:56.469
 said he is very fast so it's moulin 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:56.829
 but very few 25 and a little bit more 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:58.989
 quick 

00:05:56.829 --> 00:06:02.489
 malbec es5 and instant is here 

00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:02.489
 it was five will be really instant
