00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
connect so we're connecting the function

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.859 
connect so we're connecting the function
to<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.409> event<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.090> it's<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> give<00:01:54.600> us<00:01:54.630> a

end and give stats we make a new

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.070 
end and give stats we make a new
variable<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:15.340> it's<00:02:16.340> called<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.060> it's<00:02:17.600> of<00:02:17.930> the

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
variable and it's called and it's of the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.580 
variable and it's called and it's of the
type<00:02:18.290> int<00:02:18.530> value<00:02:18.860> so<00:02:19.490> it's<00:02:19.819> now<00:02:20.420> an<00:02:20.780> actual<00:02:21.440> int

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
type int value so it's now an actual int

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.470 
type int value so it's now an actual int
value<00:02:21.920> because<00:02:22.100> we<00:02:22.220> used<00:02:22.400> instance<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:23.240> new

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
value because we used instance that new

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.050 
value because we used instance that new
aunt<00:02:23.810> Val<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:24.290> thence<00:02:25.130> that's<00:02:25.520> that<00:02:25.820> name

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
aunt Val you thence that's that name

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.300 
aunt Val you thence that's that name
equals<00:02:26.450> leader<00:02:26.720> sets<00:02:27.050> okay<00:02:27.560> I'll<00:02:27.830> explain<00:02:28.160> why

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
equals leader sets okay I'll explain why

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.240 
equals leader sets okay I'll explain why
we<00:02:28.490> have<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.850> name<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.360> in<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:29.660> minute

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
we have to name it that in a minute

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.040 
we have to name it that in a minute

that's that pairing equals player now
I'll<00:02:54.350> going<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.560> show<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.769> with<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:55.070> script

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
I'll going to show you with that script

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.650 
I'll going to show you with that script
actually<00:02:55.580> ends<00:02:56.239> up<00:02:56.330> doing<00:02:58.810> all<00:02:59.810> right<00:03:00.100> firstly

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
actually ends up doing all right firstly

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.770 
actually ends up doing all right firstly
it<00:03:02.660> puts<00:03:03.470> leader<00:03:04.310> stats<00:03:04.700> into<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.300> player<00:03:05.540> and

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
it puts leader stats into the player and

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.350 
it puts leader stats into the player and
then<00:03:06.739> it<00:03:06.830> puts<00:03:07.010> points<00:03:07.430> into<00:03:07.730> leadership<00:03:08.000> well

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
then it puts points into leadership well

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.000 
then it puts points into leadership well
actually<00:03:08.510> points<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:09.110> spin<00:03:09.350> delete<00:03:09.650> your<00:03:09.769> sets

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
actually points to spin delete your sets

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.740 
actually points to spin delete your sets
and<00:03:10.160> leader<00:03:10.430> sets<00:03:10.700> is<00:03:10.940> then<00:03:11.239> put<00:03:11.450> into<00:03:11.480> the

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
and leader sets is then put into the

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.009 
and leader sets is then put into the
player<00:03:11.959> okay<00:03:12.769> salir<00:03:13.700> stats<00:03:14.030> is<00:03:14.269> an<00:03:14.420> int<00:03:14.630> value

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
player okay salir stats is an int value

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.620 
player okay salir stats is an int value
and<00:03:15.200> it's<00:03:15.470> namely<00:03:15.920> your<00:03:16.040> sets<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:16.450> now<00:03:17.450> I'll

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
and it's namely your sets and now I'll

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.449 
and it's namely your sets and now I'll
explain<00:03:17.900> how<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:18.140> sentence<00:03:18.500> of<00:03:18.620> our<00:03:19.040> row<00:03:19.220> box

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
explain how the sentence of our row box

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.190 
explain how the sentence of our row box
works<00:03:19.670> with<00:03:19.910> its<00:03:20.090> leader<00:03:20.329> board<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.989> goes

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
works with its leader board it goes

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.130 
works with its leader board it goes
through<00:03:21.410> every<00:03:21.560> player<00:03:21.980> in<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.340> players

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
through every player in the players

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.479 
through every player in the players
looks<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:24.350> see<00:03:24.500> if<00:03:24.530> they<00:03:24.709> have<00:03:24.799> a<00:03:24.829> leader<00:03:25.100> steps

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
looks to see if they have a leader steps

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.400 
looks to see if they have a leader steps
if<00:03:25.850> so<00:03:26.209> it's<00:03:26.239> going<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:26.690> look<00:03:26.750> inside<00:03:27.110> the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
if so it's going to look inside the

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.720 
if so it's going to look inside the
leader<00:03:27.650> sets<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:28.130> has<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.459> be<00:03:28.549> named<00:03:28.700> later

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
leader sets and has to be named later

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.850 
leader sets and has to be named later
sets<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.450> it's<00:03:29.930> going<00:03:30.079> to<00:03:30.170> find<00:03:30.350> every<00:03:30.680> nth

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
sets and it's going to find every nth

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.180 
sets and it's going to find every nth
value<00:03:31.250> it's<00:03:31.850> going<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.120> take<00:03:32.209> it<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.630> name<00:03:33.190> it's

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
value it's going to take it to name it's

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.830 
value it's going to take it to name it's
going<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.459> put<00:03:34.610> up<00:03:34.700> here<00:03:34.910> if<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.180> doesn't

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
going to put up here if it doesn't

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.940 
going to put up here if it doesn't
already<00:03:35.989> have<00:03:36.110> something<00:03:36.530> of<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.709> same<00:03:36.890> name

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
already have something of the same name

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.770 
already have something of the same name
and<00:03:37.340> then<00:03:38.239> in<00:03:38.690> their<00:03:39.940> row<00:03:40.940> there<00:03:41.329> it's<00:03:41.540> going

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
and then in their row there it's going

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.830 
and then in their row there it's going
to<00:03:41.870> put<00:03:42.019> this<00:03:42.680> whatever<00:03:43.430> value<00:03:43.850> it<00:03:43.880> is<00:03:44.060> under

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
to put this whatever value it is under

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.970 
to put this whatever value it is under
that<00:03:45.110> column<00:03:45.650> for<00:03:45.860> that<00:03:45.980> name<00:03:46.519> okay<00:03:48.640> so<00:03:50.980> not

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
that column for that name okay so not

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.830 
that column for that name okay so not
much<00:03:52.160> else<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.519> explain<00:03:52.850> by<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.239> leaderboard

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
much else to explain by the leaderboard

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.340 
much else to explain by the leaderboard
cuz<00:03:54.049> sort<00:03:54.440> of<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:54.560> simple<00:03:54.950> concept<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:55.640> hope

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
cuz sort of a simple concept I hope

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.280 
cuz sort of a simple concept I hope
complete<00:03:57.350> some<00:03:57.620> blowing<00:03:57.799> up<00:03:57.980> for<00:03:58.160> you<00:03:58.220> guys
