00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hi, how are you? I'm going to talk about mothers today. 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.730
 the age- related facial 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.160
 and on the back of the hands 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.710
 I'm going to speak specifically in this day 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.310
 hands stains the hands they are 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.640
 caused by non- sun exposure in this 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.060
 without care are also caused by 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.400
 by the use of chemical products 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.539
 cleaning and also some fruit 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.830
 citrus fruit 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.170
 So what can we do to 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.870
 avoid these stains in the case is to use 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.360
 sunscreen products always filter 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.300
 solar and moisturizing also opt for 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.300
 that contains a sunscreen is to avoid 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.059
 a little bit already the spots to make the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.340
 housework not to put your hand 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.670
 directly on the chemicals of 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.340
 cleaning is advised to wear gloves 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.640
 I know that not all make myself not 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.920
 do it but it's firefighters going down jair 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.460
 getting the glove used because the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.830
 own dishwasher detergent water 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.220
 sanitary to wash clothes and it all 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:14.580
 harms and helps form the mothers they 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:18.720
 and also the citrus fruits is very good 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.570
 wash well by hand and the fruits themselves 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.340
 but after a fruit soap opera it is 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.090
 important to wash your hands thoroughly 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.259
 But then the stains will do what ? 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.329
 huh 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.490
 then for those who already have Azores mothers 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.770
 young blackberries for longer than they already have 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.409
 the stains on your hands what are you going to do 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.570
 avoiding the appearance of 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.930
 more stain with these same care 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.770
 sunscreen glove and wash the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.619
 hands 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.720
 secondly, look for a 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.290
 dermatologist than the most 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.540
 indicated for some treatment to take 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.040
 stains it is possible to lighten the stains 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.320
 is possible but nothing without a 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.640
 follow-up of a doctor from a 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.000
 dermatologist 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:12.500
 there is a treatment with 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.120
 the acid is laser and peeling that I go 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.000
 put an image for you to see well 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.250
 the difference of before and after 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.720
 so it's possible yes it's clearing 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.209
 these spots are but the 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.000
 careful not to have the spots not to 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.160
 appear more and also depending on the 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.390
 spots if you talk but do not tell me 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.540
 bothers you 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.340
 no, I do not want to take away but have to take care 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.100
 Why these stains? 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.100
 they can report cancer 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.590
 and it is better to care for and prevent than 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.530
 to remedy 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.709
 Okay - the fashion kiss and until the next 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.709
 week
