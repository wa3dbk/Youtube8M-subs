00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.570
 today seems gastronomy and to 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.900
 famous rites 5-star hotel in 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.789
 two star chef's company 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.840
 hello and head of Lorraine yes very happy 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.520
 in any case we are in 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.570
 Ritz kitchens that's wonderful 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.000
 mythical place 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.650
 open 7 of August 7 to the day then 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.490
 how long has the ritz been 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:37.090
 while they were void 1198 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:41.980
 she recognized in full that stories 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:45.160
 that history we will realize 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.820
 a recipe a cockroach from the ritz the 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.670
 flat signature that is part of 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.890
 kitchens for m 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.629
 day to St. John of Spring so 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.769
 it is a doubt saulnières banks 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.129
 sharon with radio is French 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.659
 charles ix and the embellished delay and a 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.670
 g8 and actually stable 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.990
 so here I already cut the nuts of 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.479
 Saint Jacques and a quiet life and 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.860
 agree in that way so we will 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.810
 add small ones that I was going to 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.130
 did that throw to do it like that 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.320
 mortars have done very well 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.780
 so I 'll add a little bit of 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.270
 green apples that you have as mayor I 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.979
 go the brownish cover jega I you 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.530
 had it of course and I keep to the skin 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.670
 it gives color and what is good 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.520
 that the granny apple is that it gives 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.670
 a nice good sense acidity but in the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.670
 tartar 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.490
 so the analysis we get on the fish 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.050
 so that's where it's the starting well and 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.900
 well where a line bar by two 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.900
 lines that were in that v coupe 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.030
 still siege the shares of 140 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.479
 150 g so it's really safe 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.409
 the author of the net by pressing the steam 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.990
 how long does it take 10 minutes so 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.539
 it has to be very 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.420
 important a bar whether it's me the 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:07.399
 and next if you want the voice hold it's 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.789
 the echoes we received at the 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.220
 married when blond hair has them 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.920
 listened and there we had a little with 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.569
 the same yoke and here what you see is 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.630
 small radios like that with a 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.220
 ravioli dough 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.170
 when the house head but we can also 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.540
 ask in confidence no I put a little 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.130
 the Charolais cheese so at the level 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.870
 charles ex companion the meat 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.550
 Charolais a bundle of watercress that I 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.880
 white and halo to snap Anglo 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.670
 salty drip away for her 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.950
 be the race well I mix them with a 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.390
 little olive oil and it gives our 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.520
 universe is healthy I want to add in 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.520
 so I still do not have you 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.530
 want a contest is actually 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.780
 it's a texture then vs so here 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.200
 so that's going to do what's it going to do a 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.240
 very green sauce that will have the goat 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.180
 feel more the bubbling of 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:04.410
 shells and we'll have one more time 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.780
 this super side is pleasant in the mouth 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.370
 and that's still 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.600
 that's still it so a little 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.730
 advice that you really have to do it 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.910
 first two before I stand here is 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.709
 because it's more the next 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.690
 can he go he will become a little bit more 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.980
 sorry its color well there must that 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.040
 the color turns green 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.750
 this is the little advice of the chef it's 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.540
 a little bit of little secret work 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.739
 worry of economy so there it is always 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.569
 the same thing in fact we always start 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.160
 on the same basis except that I added 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.640
 a little jelly of teeth that I have 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.190
 so it's like a game youth 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.510
 left agar agar 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.950
 So this is what allows to pose as 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.630
 done with lagardère which is good 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.750
 it's still the same heat his are 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.090
 not here it is natural gelatin via 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.390
 tunisia so there you do not see in 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.230
 la France 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.239
 we will add on it and you want you can 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.160
 do it too 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.790
 in contrast orange is that in melee like 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.790
 the last 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.010
 yesterday 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.880
 with juice or not to consult the see 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.560
 that it remains a little forgotten 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.650
 sometimes that return it 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.690
 why not 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.340
 this is like charente hoop 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.260
 yes once and then 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.699
 without this makes the bus air the excess of 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.919
 so that's what we had prepared 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:34.310
 just now the etr with the saint 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:36.800
 Jacques with the addition add up from 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.389
 the green zone very well annexes and a 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.860
 little olive oil and samu that did not 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.470
 no sense there are already but the 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.389
 peppers in general seafood 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.050
 already you do not add a scene 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.050
 exactly 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.840
 Great 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.279
 then no you see 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.300
 next to it a little 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:57.129
 I have few spikes of black but a 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.689
 little bit behind but here we go mika 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:03.189
 is it caviar d'aquitaine 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:05.319
 good literary sologne his through 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:07.180
 of sologne it was of course the 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:09.249
 tailor you will tell me it's pretty 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.310
 but at the same time it's okay 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:14.560
 enhance the iodized taste the ravioli with 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.969
 huts it's not fair to say we 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.930
 puts tattoos keyboard and small 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:22.389
 spikes in ten red 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.360
 I 'm going to put that makes it give a little 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:28.680
 too much when a little bitterness 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.680
 you have to write is nice 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.070
 why do not live red 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.470
 because it's the color mission d 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.770
 the taste is different no it is beautiful 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.020
 jewel 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.850
 well now you go straight 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.150
 following the swordfish the restaurant must 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.770
 go gastronomic ring and michel

00:05:53.450 --> 00:06:00.500
 beautiful terrace the meaning is not very 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.870
 well then let's discover this famous bar

 so see that one interstates whoever 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.670
 the verse and so that's why I 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.520
