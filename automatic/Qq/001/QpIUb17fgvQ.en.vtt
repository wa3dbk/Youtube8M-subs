00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.690
 Hello friends today we will see 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.080
 the subject of calibrating a battery in 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:28.080
 this case is going to be a laptop 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.430
 very well what do we mean by the 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.009
 battery calibration 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.620
 good is to recharge it at the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.650
 maximum and restart the meter so that 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.080
 indicate the correct charge level very 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.870
 ok our meter in this case here 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.100
 we have it many times it happens that when 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.680
 we have connected to the current 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.380
 Electric brand 100% 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.110
 once disconnected from this 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.670
 suddenly has a bass where 80% a 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.100
 90% up to 70% energy 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.890
 very well why this is what the 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.710
 battery is not calibrated and does not perform 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.970
 your charge correctly and this meter does not 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.100
 marks the exact value of the battery 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.580
 very well what can be done in these 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.800
 cases is something simple 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.490
 we are doing it by steps the first 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.510
 step would be to have our team loading 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.060
 to 100% 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.280
 once 100% arrived we are going to 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.280
 disconnect the equipment from the current and 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.610
 we are going to go here we click where 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.190
 is the stack more energy options 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.580
 and we are going to create a new energy plan 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.580
 OK 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.970
 well we will leave it in balanced 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.960
 and we are going to put 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.960
 gauge 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.570
 we give the following 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.070
 very good here is where important comes 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.850
 to all these 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:03.820
 with all of these selection we are going to 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.570
 leave never ok all in never 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.970
 well what will happen if we leave all 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.020
 these in never what proceeds is to that 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.209
 our battery is completely based 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.760
 then when emptying completely it 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.010
 reset the charge meter 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.189
 since you restart the meter the 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.830
 charge will mark the battery that has 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:30.040
 actually 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.970
 the load the actual percentage of our 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.310
 we are going to create a battery 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.490
 very good as you can see our new 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.340
 creative plan is here 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:45.420
 and the system puts it by default very 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.390
 well once this is done we close 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.020
 we have nothing else to do we continue 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.520
 using the equipment as commonly and 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.910
 we wait for it to download 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.160
 completely 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.860
 it does not matter that we can not the team 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.580
 let it go off just because it does not 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.240
 has a battery 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.330
 once this happens we are going to put 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.390
 load our equipment again without 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.880
 interruptions until you mark load 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.580
 complete depending on you as you 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.860
 mark a little that I know 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.920
 very well once it is already loaded 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.819
 we will completely start again 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.579
 our team 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.670
 and the last step would be to leave again 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.120
 here 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.530
 the energy options and select 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.380
 any of us 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.940
 we prefer or the one that gives us the most 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.350
 agree 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.650
 ok and that would be all 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:49.210
 to calibrate a laptop battery 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.230
 I hope it will be helpful and 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.230
 this is all
