00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hi nice that you look at a new one 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.750
 video my channel bono today i have 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.700
 an unboxing video for you and that is 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.030
 a long time ago since I had that 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.679
 done 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.269
 last time I did that as 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.960
 I think with all American 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.150
 candy and stuff 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.980
 partly therefore not exactly but in you 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.580
 case is very general i am already doing it 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.289
 almost never 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.910
 I think a boxer likes me anyway 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.150
 because I usually do things before 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.900
 buy my computer or something or leana bit 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.250
 Such things 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.320
 so then i don't like it so much 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.779
 a boxing but we saw today 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.640

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.500
 I wasn't sure if this was the right one 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.140

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.750

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.059
 pouch with leopard print and yes in it 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.140
 everything is called the website so that does this 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.359
 ik.nl 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.449

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.670

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.110

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.000
 it is and that this is it that on joker 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.670

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.860
 your neck and a heel here is with 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.110

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.930
 I'll put it on after this is it your 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.490
 The choker floor was like a student 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.530
 is not coming back all the way here 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.049

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.729
 I really like it and I like it very much 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.549
 find chives 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.079
 very nice if you have eyes in it 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.670
 Do you really have to doze first 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.740
 getting used to something so tight about it 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.350
 your neck is the one that they are very tight and 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.970
 sometimes nice but little thing 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.619
 After a while I am accustomed 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.479
 so much humor and used to it 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.049
 don't really wear it often, I only have a few 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.840
 children 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.970
 dockers worn but this fits very well 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.220
 so it is not too tight that is 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.110
 great then I have a normal tattoos 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.770
 Joker and it is normal that you also have some 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.100
 I mean that 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.229
 so that's a black went you had there 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.399
 just say so this chair 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.740
 heart 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.090
 and yes it is very nice and he feels it 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.700
 a bit the same name as this one 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.690
 think because it is not so tight and that 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.190
 I like it very much 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.959
 I had faith that goes on and on 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.480
 that is also the intention so you can handle them 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.280
 your head to do lose a headband 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.950
 ask late so you can do it too 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.930
 days exploring it didn't go pretty but so 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.430
 can if you do like it then 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.250
 again the last product i find this 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.170
 really really cool is a chain it is 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.180
 not so no choker but it is 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.030
 a necklace with purple stitches 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.500
 and I think this is really super beautiful 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.239

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.989
