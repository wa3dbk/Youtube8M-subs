 Berlin 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.949
 Munich is little wonder 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.309
 actually that's it 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.950
 Of these are also welcome to be but continue to apply to the ICE 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.589

 they have to prove that Sam Flynn's biggest piece has been found 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.850
 the chance for the stress test as in Norway stood 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.040
 1 1 here's how it's shortened 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.830
 he said 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:41.969
 how firm 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.390
 HGS 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.390
 but he also does not expect such declarations of love 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.260
 yes, I'm afraid 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.450
 Gentiles hhk 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.810
 you have you have 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.930
 What's that ask me with Masdar's quarters 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.730
 who do not choose to go 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.630
 informed about the procedure 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.000
 we hope that he was already that regularly before the

 Millennium accused of first places where they naturally hatch 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.500
 sand 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.270
 Oh, so it does not give up 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.590
 The End 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.340
 which is probably called Resino 14 counters 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.600
 1 sentence 1 no 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.159
 Oh, like 37-year-old Oliver Pocher and Kerner, and that's mine 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.729
 Problems in the market are the health minister imagine that 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.100
 should clear out at a sacral 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.700
 all published so far 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.030
 every year 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.960
 Now, as I assumed, I would definitely not want to wait 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.909
 in the yard and the culture stood 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.099
 the whole area the same way of Annetta Bundi Spencer

 possibly even the US model completely overcrowded 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.140
 much more expensive i still hope that there are more and more older people and 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.360
 children 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.910
 as you get older I have to see and hear it's meantime 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.990
 has been safe sometimes

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.280
 youth 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.280

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.649
 Now the two Larry's are supposed to be small 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:25.649
 the Nigerians have to stand out 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:26.720
 the culprit could
