 I think I will not say 20 the president of Venezuela was elected 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.559
 democratically but it did not behave like a 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.559
 like a satrap like a tropical tyrant world 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:18.929
 as a dictator 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.179
 picturesque 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.710

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.570

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.450
 as president 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.050
 integra ask how long ago that this one does not stay silent if 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.090

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.090

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.000
 and the second question that does that for how long and that have them 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.230
 technically a 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.390
 an ape monkey 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.090

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.830
 nothing 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.740
 because they are ministers are all 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.640
 because they took him 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.320

 cries to the iss 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.600
 not what it is 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.030

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.210
 there are no living conditions 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.690
 and because that's how he stayed like this 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.340
