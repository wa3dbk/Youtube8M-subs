thinnest smartphone it also weighs just
a<00:02:05.850> hundred<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.300> twelve<00:02:06.540> grams<00:02:06.900> that's<00:02:07.590> 20%

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
a hundred and twelve grams that's 20%

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.729 
a hundred and twelve grams that's 20%
lighter<00:02:08.730> one-fifth<00:02:09.630> lighter<00:02:10.019> than<00:02:10.619> the

the previous product it is really easy
to<00:02:31.709> make<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.890> new<00:02:32.070> product<00:02:32.280> that's<00:02:32.550> bigger

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
to make a new product that's bigger

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.790 
to make a new product that's bigger
everyone<00:02:33.630> does<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:34.050> that's<00:02:34.440> not<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
everyone does that that's not the

everyone does that that's not the
challenge<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.610> challenge<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.269> make<00:02:36.390> it

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
challenge the challenge is to make it

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.830 
challenge the challenge is to make it
better

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
better

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.830 
better
and<00:02:37.290> smaller<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:39.120> let's<00:02:39.300> start<00:02:39.570> with<00:02:39.720> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
and smaller so let's start with the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.380 
and smaller so let's start with the
product<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:41.250> starts<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.760> course<00:02:41.790> with<00:02:42.209> the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
product it starts of course with the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.250
