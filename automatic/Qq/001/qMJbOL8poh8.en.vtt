00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
know if you if this is a make-or-break

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.590 
know if you if this is a make-or-break
kind<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.280> thing<00:01:26.549> if<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.880> really<00:01:27.210> wanted<00:01:27.479> this

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
kind of thing if you really wanted this

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.240 
kind of thing if you really wanted this
if<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.930> really<00:01:28.259> don't<00:01:28.470> want<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.890> for<00:01:29.100> some

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
if you really don't want this for some

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.060 
if you really don't want this for some
reason<00:01:29.280> for<00:01:30.180> me<00:01:30.299> it's<00:01:31.170> not<00:01:31.409> really<00:01:31.680> make<00:01:31.890> or

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
reason for me it's not really make or

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.640 
reason for me it's not really make or
break<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.090> great<00:01:33.240> addition<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.049> I

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
break but it's a great addition and I

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.399 
break but it's a great addition and I
will<00:01:34.920> play<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.030> female<00:01:36.329> division<00:01:36.600> it's
