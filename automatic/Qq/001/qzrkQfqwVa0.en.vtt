00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:01.920 
degree centigrade for just 10 to 15
minutes<00:03:00.519> or<00:03:00.639> you<00:03:00.819> know<00:03:00.939> even<00:03:01.090> less<00:03:01.510> than<00:03:01.719> that

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
I made a nice small shape so it won't

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.649 
I made a nice small shape so it won't

going to bake it at 180 degree
centigrade<00:03:09.639> for<00:03:09.819> just<00:03:10.359> 10<00:03:10.599> minutes<00:03:10.780> till<00:03:11.199> you

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
centigrade for just 10 minutes till you

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.039 
centigrade for just 10 minutes till you
see<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.590> nice<00:03:11.889> color<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:13.060> since<00:03:13.299> our<00:03:13.449> base<00:03:13.840> is

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
see a nice color so since our base is

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.959 
see a nice color so since our base is
getting<00:03:14.199> baked<00:03:14.650> so<00:03:15.159> meanwhile<00:03:15.609> we<00:03:15.849> are<00:03:15.879> going
