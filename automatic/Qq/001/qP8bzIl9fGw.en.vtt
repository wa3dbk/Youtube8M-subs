00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
right inside here this side is going to

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.780 
right inside here this side is going to

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
is going to be the shower so we can't

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.040 
is going to be the shower so we can't
really<00:03:28.370> do<00:03:28.550> anything<00:03:28.790> else<00:03:29.030> this<00:03:29.390> trip<00:03:29.690> until

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
really do anything else this trip until

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.080 
really do anything else this trip until
we<00:03:30.140> get<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.440> plumbing<00:03:30.740> hooked<00:03:31.070> up<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:31.520> then<00:03:31.970> we

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
we get the plumbing hooked up so then we

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.140 
we get the plumbing hooked up so then we
can<00:03:32.240> finish<00:03:32.420> out<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.900> framing<00:03:33.610> so<00:03:34.610> this<00:03:34.880> is

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
can finish out the framing so this is

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.700 
can finish out the framing so this is
the<00:03:35.360> interior<00:03:35.900> walls<00:03:36.170> we're<00:03:36.440> going<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.620> be
