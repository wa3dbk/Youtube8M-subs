00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.790
 speak my name is cinema king are nutritionists 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.840
 this is the second video of our series on food 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.959
 in the previous video we learned with a technique of our bad habits of 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:15.539
 life 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.189
 may be damaging our health 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.449
 now we will learn what it is to have a healthy diet. 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.949
 achieve everything our body needs to perform its 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.669
 so balanced form 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:28.630
 well 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.279
 so that our body performs these functions including those of which 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.900
 we volunteer in thesis as breathing warning made to manage and 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:37.850
 detoxify 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.879
 among others 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.240
 it needs different types of nutrients 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.620
 nutrients are elements found in the foods responsible for providing 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.620
 what our body needs to perform its vital functions 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.180
 the best known are the protein carbohydrates fats vitamins and salts 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.500
 minerals 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.870
 in this video we will start the nutrients being the first of them the carbohydrate 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.560
 carbohydrates are nutrients that contain their agricultural composition and 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.410
 the main source of energy in our body 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.990
 Let's get better. 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.500
 for the car to go from one place to another not just have peneus botou 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.650
 direction 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.330
 it needs fuel it manages and energy to work 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.310
 in the same way and with our body 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.650
 he needs fuel to run 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.700
 in the agricultural case c 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.120
 we need glucose to think walking sleep breathing 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.580
 simply for everything 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.310
 there are basically two types of carbohydrates in simple and complex carbohydrates 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.030
 What makes a carbohydrate simple or complex is the size of its structure 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.140
 molecular 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.670
 simple carbohydrates can contain up to 12 molecules of sugar 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.220
 both simple carbohydrates and complexes have the function of providing 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.600
 immediate and backup power 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.560
 however, that simple carbohydrates because they have a molecule of size 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.450
 reduced 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.570
 the version is medicine is made faster 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.560
 this makes the main function of this carbohydrate is the supply 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.099
 immediate energy 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.680
 we can find them in the fruits in bee honey in the corn class 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.350
 in dairy products within its perimeter without several examples being 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.480
 and cereal extract such as fermented alcoholic beverages 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:29.389
 is very hot and should be consumed with care because they have 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:30.779
 people are to be the life 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:33.929
 can raise blood glucose levels abruptly 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:36.540
 a phenomenon known as glycemia 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.069
 which can be very dangerous for diabetics and athletes 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.339
 the danger of hyperglycaemia can be minimized by using carbohydrate with 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:46.260
 another complex carbohydrate 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.830
 You said you did not bring some fat like dairy products. 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.999
 already the complex carbohydrates I paço in several molecules of its sugar 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:56.029
 structure 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:59.049
 also has the function of supplying energy in your body 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.249
 however depending on the type of complex carbohydrate 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:04.859
 it may have other functions 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.549
 some of these carbohydrates are not absorbed by our intestines 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.820
 are the famous fibers that can access it once in São Lourenço 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.279
 complex carbohydrates of the jeri type are also 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:19.870
 mission lives in the gut 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.989
 but despite having a 'large molecule' it basically consists of 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.209
 sugar 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.629
 the starch is one of these carbohydrates 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.140
 can be found in countries like potato 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.410
 and attached in the third I own child unit 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.309
 complex carbohydrates of the type 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:37.340
 besides managing this 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.439
 has insoluble fibers that our body can not solve 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:46.459
 by this function they are important for increasing faecal fecal and transit 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.300
 intestinal 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.799
 relieving the symptoms of constipation 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.119
 now watch out 

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:55.669
 how it is insoluble because water management can worsen constipation by 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.319
 these happy faces 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.649
 we can find this type of carbohydrate and vegetable leaves 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:05.719
 thales segments as example the line asha bark of fruits and vegetables 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.470
 We expect whole ones that have not gone through and tuning 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.689
 complex carbohydrates of the partially digested type 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.680
 as the name already says 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.090
 over time substances do not tell them to our bodies 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.370
 are the water soluble fibers 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.150
 which are also known as me and optical 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.630
 this serve as food for bacteria to our intestinal microbiota 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.870
 which has the function of a defense barrier in the intestine 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.590
 the soluble fiber is a functional food required sensations of 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.860
 many functions for a next opportunity 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.309
 this carbohydrate 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:43.990
 can be found in fruits like banana apple 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.950
 it's wrong Mars Oba 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.479
 in boxing like garlic and onion 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:49.409
 I'm going more 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:54.050
 lucila gente I remember us as an example beans and interior and also in the 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.099
 oat bran barley and which would be 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:00.550
 the fiber intake in general shows the relation with the decrease 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.690
 levels of fat and blood glucose 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.820
 besides the decrease of the appetite 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.820
 being beneficial for diabetic and hypertensive obese individuals 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:13.739
 the daily recommendation of fibers is 20 to 30 grams per day 

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:18.120
 being thus blocks of grams of soluble type fibers 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.190
 this amount is equivalent to approximately 400 grams of fruit and 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.800
 vegetables per day 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.070
 to reach this amount it is necessary to have a rich diet 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:27.490
 in fruits 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.190
 fruits 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.190
 losers whole grains and legumes 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:35.649
 The big problem is that some complex carbohydrates have 

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:37.889
 refinement until you get to our table 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.889
 these pereiro great part of their beneficial functions because the refinement 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.479
 fiber eliminations 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.370
 vitamins and minerals 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.070
 the main sources of complex carbohydrates that have passed through 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.490
 this process were rice and wheat 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.490
 and serve as an ingredient of various foods such as pasta 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.479
 cereal breads crackers biscuits morning cereals and pasta in general 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.650
 loss of daughters causes the carbohydrate to be resolved as soon as possible. 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.960
 rapidly increasing the risk of an adolescent went beyond loss of value 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.349
 nutritional 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:13.419
 therefore it is important to replace the refined products in our 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.629
 whole foods 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:20.089
 the carbohydrate itself is not solely responsible for weight gain 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:23.800
 but their excess intake mainly 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.340
 simple and refined 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.630
 being related to fat accumulation and various weight gain 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.930
 diseases like diabetes this requires the end of the month 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.240
 your intake should be balanced according to the calories ingested on the day 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.720
 And remember 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.420
 when the crisis the list is the only professional able to balance the 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.420
 according to individual needs 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.860
 we can conclude that carbohydrates are important not only for the 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.899
 maintenance of health but for survival 

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:55.490
 there are still some myths about you 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.469
 but the truth is that this fear that the nutrient causes some risk 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:02.469
 is based only on inadequate eating habits 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:07.740
 prepared to live longer and healthier this is your place 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.440
 sas nutrition 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.259
 until the next meeting 

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:12.389
 he is aggressive 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:13.900
 our website is on the air

 exception was for the fourth central tournament
