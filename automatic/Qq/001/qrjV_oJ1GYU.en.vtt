00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello, welcome to the channel, friends. 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.819
 wheelchairs 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.000
 My name is dani jansen 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.250
 pedagogy specialist in psychopedagogy 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.740
 in today's video we will continue 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.320
 in the series my home adapted 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.140
 If you are a chauffeur, you like to cook and 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.840
 want an accessible and adapted kitchen 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.240
 for his need then he found the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.090
 video with the right tips the problem 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.910
 adapt a kitchen and we can leave 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.030
 the open spaces below the sink and 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.820
 stove cabinets at an accessible height 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.540
 otherwise we will not have access to 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.790
 products 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.950
 thus risking more risks when it comes to 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.340
 to have our meals 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.739
 the standard of an adapted truck is 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.469
 play in the first place we should think 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.160
 in the stove arrangement it must be 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.020
 low enough that the wheelchair 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.289
 can see over the pots and not 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.510
 may have a furnace or be poured 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.649
 below for the wheelchair to enter 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.710
 your chair 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.110
 nowadays it is quite easy to set up an escape 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.140
 so you use a bank 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.299
 preferably of stone and assemble the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.880
 cooktop on top of it 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.600
 there are models for less than 400 reais in 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.840
 Marketplace 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.330
 it's worth researching from the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.090
 The sink can also be mounted on the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.310
 same bench and also can not have the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.950
 more down to the chair 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.409
 wheels can enter and with that you 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.670
 to wash and dry the dishes with 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.070
 tranquility 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.439
 the bench is extremely important in 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.110
 kitchen adapted it must have height 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.060
 sure that the wheelchair 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.869
 all necessary activities in the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.979
 kitchen 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:51.000
 nbr 9050 states that it must have 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.829
 height between 80 and 85 centimeters but 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.960
 practice is to be granted by the 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.090
 wheelchair that will use the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.420
 wheelchair has its height 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.060
 cabinets reach maximum standard for 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.310
 who is sitting is of a method 35 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.770
 It is important to note this 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.569
 installation of cabinets 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.390
 It's very important to be careful too. 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.099
 on the door handles 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.860
 they must always be in the 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.870
 bottom of the doors 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.200
 we can count on some adaptations 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.200
 which they consider optional 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.890
 such as sensor-sensitive illumination 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.330
 automatic dishwasher trash movement 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.370
 among others 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.040
