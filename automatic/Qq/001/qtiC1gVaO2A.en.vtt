 on the rollers from you welcomes you and in 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.940
 In this video, I will show you how to handle everything. 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.980
 living in near 4 in seconds but so you 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.160
 reached a level of mastery like that 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.780
 me for a start knock him shoot and so 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.100
 everyone probably knows that a shot 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.170
 produced by moving in space 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.670
 options adjacent to the right hand 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.680
 index finger by sharp 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.869
 downward movement 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.550
 land and the subsequent click and this 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.769
 finger on the device under 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.359
 hand called the mouse who own 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.890
 the queue activates clicks after 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.050
 index finger interactions with 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.480
 the left part is called the left key 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.079
 mouse and now I will show it to you 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.579
 practice, I know that the forces in 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.770
 automatic rifles 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.989
 and in order to kill you need to quickly 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.770
 you already know it so much like me 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.899

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.920
 here someone runs away now gonna get me 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.879
 it's still not possible to run closer to 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.210
 aim and 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.760
 and her eyes are accidentally closed is not considered 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.560
 and now I 'll show you how to storm 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.450
 control points and this is done by 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.110
 move your fighter to the point 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.259
 shown on the map to and you are not moved 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.909
 Well, it wanted everything is fine and yet strength 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.080
 sniper rifles now i am you 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.200

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.700
 alter competitors who none 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.000
 get in the way and figured out how to get on that roof 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.000
 said goodbye there landing the bewitching we clean 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.430
 maximum of 2 seconds I'm a pro and me 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.340
 probably already afraid and so oops scary 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.649
 why did the helicopter happen so I 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.909
 it seems there did the right thing 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.700
 so it can not fly away 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.220
 I understood how to shoot and generally snipers 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.600
 almost always fall well I heard in 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.420
 in general, I will show you how it is 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.969
 everything is done very simple here we saw 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.439
 the enemy for an hour around the corner he detained 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.780
 did not have time to understand what happened 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:09.780
 when I aim at him 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:12.150

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.910
 rifles to start need to aim 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.850

 smoke those snipers hours too 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.430
 good position on the next roof one 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.100

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:05.040

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.940

 He had disappeared and that's where the enemy 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.209
