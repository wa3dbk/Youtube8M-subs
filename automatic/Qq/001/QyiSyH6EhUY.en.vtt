00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:10.080
 and then gang beauty does come to you 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.389
 and today I have a very short video here 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.809
 but really cool it is to talk about the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.820
 ubisoft's new ad is this how 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.980
 citizen is seeing this new ad is 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.230
 a new assassin's creed 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.890
 that's it's it called assassin's creed 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.539
 ii unit and we already have a quizer of it's 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.310
 released by the software itself click 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.160
 in the video description for anyone 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.570
 take a look is who will take a look 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.370
 the caps back here I speak 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.660
 various information that has no reason I 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.120
 talk when he passes when and how 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.610
 It will be and I think it's interesting, you know. 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.350
 information but anyway while I 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.660
 speaking if you understand some images already 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.820
 were released but as announced 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.420
 very recently the game has few 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.940
 images of the game itself ok but at last it is 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.980
 that our children short and a link that 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.280
 if you pass in france 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.989
 It is known that they will have a part in Paris, but 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.670
 it is not known if they will have other cities 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.960
 involved is probably not five 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.670
 months as the other known fans 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.020
 major regions by which we 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.220
 we can travel 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.729
 in the case of df to include these 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.700
 reviews 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.439
 I believe pt is the main story 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.990
 the country and in some other cities 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.970
 we can travel and finally have 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.189
 partner stories story's there 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.900
 Now that we know, I'll tell 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.070
 for you when it happens that the part 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.979
 more interesting 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.130
 the game takes place in the 18th century and for those who 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.740
 do not know in the 18th century in france occurred 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.500
 the French revolution, I know that you 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.030
 They must have heard it right this name and to 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.060
 who does not know how to send a small one where 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.700
 Good story, very very simple story 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.280
 about the French revolution that was 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.119
 when the aristocracy monarchy is not 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.390
 church 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.159
 mainly from France that reigned 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.560
 let's just say we had more power there 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.780
 began to fall goes into decay and 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.280
 those principles that had to 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.810
 world must have heard that it is 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.230
 freedom equality and fraternity and 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.260
 started taking 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.710
 the most important in france 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:13.130
 In other words, it's going to be a very nice period. 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.170
 to revive in the shoes of a murderer and 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.150
 play during the actions done 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.890
 logically I know that there are several 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.110
 historical distortions than those of its 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.000
 players to fit the bones 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.100
 in the French revolution but I think 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.360
 It will be very cool to be able to live this 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.150
 period is one of my periods 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.420
 favorite historical and my I'm very 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.490
 About this game, it's unfortunately we're alone. 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.040
 we have this information so far on 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.920
 This game is not going to happen in the 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.910
 France in the 18th century during the 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.260
 French 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.900
 we know it's going to be released too 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.010
 for playstation 4 xbox one and the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.150
 computer 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.820
 It's but we do not know yet when 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.070
 for example if you liked this video 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.690
 Do not forget to give yourself a favorite game. 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.120
 also likes to forget to sign up for 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.920
 because I like this way from 1998 I go 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.120
 bring you with joÃ£o trailer 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.010
 I'll bring suit to power. 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.500
 comment and do an analysis like I already did 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.120
 in other training sessions, but it was only one 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.610
 pending for those who like to share 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.400
 To be able to know that there is a new one. 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.020
 game is being developed a game that 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.560
 that's what he's going to call himself when he 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.510
 pass 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.880
 and for those who want to start 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.709
 study is whether this good 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.660
 Very cool, I recommend that you like 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.640

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.410
 your wiki page why it's worth 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.880
 worth a good one is a historical fact was 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.550
 a very cool part of the story 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.920
 French revolution and it is very 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.959
 to be studied there are those who love that 's it people 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.489
 Brazil has seen plenty who likes 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.230
 some that the favorite jewelry as I have already asked for 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.989
 enroll in the channel and also in teaching 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.310
 on twitter and go beyond facebook 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.590
 links to these two places with the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.690
 video description is because there I always 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.280
 Can I get new information if I can? 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.410
 something happens in the 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.880
 type not to advertise a trailer I can 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.040
 there the coach before making the video 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.600

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.130
 updates hockenheim and also so 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.380
 videos in places that are good 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.020
 to know why youtube does not always send 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.090
 For you, my videos are so short. 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.400

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.370
