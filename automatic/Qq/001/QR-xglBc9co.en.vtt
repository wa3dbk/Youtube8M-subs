00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.160 
this is from America's oldest brewery

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
that's why it's here not because of the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.170 
that's why it's here not because of the
quality<00:00:59.290> of<00:00:59.680> the<00:00:59.739> beer<00:01:00.070> but<00:01:00.309> we<00:01:00.519> call<00:01:00.699> this<00:01:00.940> the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
quality of the beer but we call this the

oldest<00:01:01.659> brewery<00:01:01.899> and<00:01:02.199> I<00:01:02.469> figured<00:01:03.219> we'd<00:01:03.370> pay

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
oldest brewery and I figured we'd pay

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.999 
oldest brewery and I figured we'd pay
homage<00:01:04.239> to<00:01:04.269> that<00:01:04.420> I've<00:01:05.259> had<00:01:05.560> several<00:01:05.890> other

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
homage to that I've had several other

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.670 
homage to that I've had several other
different<00:01:06.430> beers<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:07.259> I'm<00:01:08.259> kind<00:01:08.500> of<00:01:08.560> a<00:01:08.619> little

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
different beers and I'm kind of a little

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.190 
different beers and I'm kind of a little
partial<00:01:08.979> to<00:01:09.220> this<00:01:09.430> one<00:01:09.700> I<00:01:10.090> have<00:01:10.450> had<00:01:10.720> this<00:01:10.960> beer

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
before so and to be honest with you it's

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.680 
before so and to be honest with you it's
not<00:01:14.440> an<00:01:14.590> outstanding<00:01:15.070> beer<00:01:15.670> but<00:01:15.909> it<00:01:16.270> was<00:01:16.659> a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
not an outstanding beer but it was a

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.139 
not an outstanding beer but it was a
decent<00:01:17.380> representation<00:01:18.310> of<00:01:18.399> what<00:01:18.520> it<00:01:18.640> is<00:01:18.670> and

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
decent representation of what it is and

decent representation of what it is and
it's<00:01:19.869> close<00:01:20.200> to<00:01:20.229> being<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.740> Mac<00:01:20.950> or<00:01:21.159> lager<00:01:21.399> as

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610

far<00:01:21.850> as<00:01:21.940> I'm<00:01:22.090> concerned<00:01:22.509> but<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:24.670> is<00:01:24.759> a

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
far as I'm concerned but this is a

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.730 
far as I'm concerned but this is a
decent<00:01:24.970> beer<00:01:25.300> from<00:01:25.539> what<00:01:25.750> what<00:01:26.229> I<00:01:26.319> remember<00:01:26.649> it

beer with with your meal this will

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.610 
beer with with your meal this will
probably<00:02:25.330> fit<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.690> bill<00:02:25.870> if<00:02:25.900> you've<00:02:26.260> not<00:02:26.410> had

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
probably fit the bill if you've not had

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.140 
probably fit the bill if you've not had
it<00:02:26.800> this<00:02:26.890> would<00:02:27.069> be<00:02:27.160> a<00:02:27.190> good<00:02:27.370> transition<00:02:27.550> beer

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
it this would be a good transition beer

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.000 
it this would be a good transition beer
to<00:02:28.300> get<00:02:28.420> over<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:28.900> get<00:02:28.989> a<00:02:29.050> darker<00:02:29.470> style<00:02:29.739> beer

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
to get over and get a darker style beer

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.280 
to get over and get a darker style beer
so<00:02:30.459> it's<00:02:31.000> not<00:02:31.120> recommended<00:02:31.660> for<00:02:31.720> extended

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
so it's not recommended for extended

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.259 
so it's not recommended for extended
celery<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:32.920> let's<00:02:33.129> not<00:02:33.310> cellar<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.819> any<00:02:33.970> longer

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
celery so let's not cellar it any longer

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.309 
celery so let's not cellar it any longer
and<00:02:34.720> get<00:02:35.319> it<00:02:35.440> into<00:02:35.590> glass<00:02:36.750> just<00:02:37.750> got<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.019> scree

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
and get it into glass just got a scree

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.710 
and get it into glass just got a scree
top<00:02:38.590> on<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.099> so<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.760> bottle<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.090> useless<00:02:40.540> to
