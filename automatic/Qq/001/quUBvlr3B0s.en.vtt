00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
know that the triggers feel kind of

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.099 
know that the triggers feel kind of
cheap<00:00:23.180> now<00:00:24.180> that's<00:00:24.420> not<00:00:24.600> really<00:00:24.720> what<00:00:25.019> I'm

mind whenever you're prying away at it

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.359 
mind whenever you're prying away at it
that<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.640> damage<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.299> controller<00:01:49.369> but

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
that it can damage the controller but

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.609 
that it can damage the controller but
once<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.759> pop<00:01:50.970> those<00:01:51.180> three<00:01:51.420> loose<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:52.380> back

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
once you pop those three loose the back

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.850 
once you pop those three loose the back
should<00:01:52.890> slide<00:01:53.220> off<00:01:53.369> nice<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.090> easy

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
should slide off nice and easy

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.709 
should slide off nice and easy
this<00:01:55.860> will<00:01:56.130> reveal<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.820> trigger<00:01:57.479> mechanism

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
this will reveal the trigger mechanism

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.310 
this will reveal the trigger mechanism
on<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.500> back<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.189> can<00:01:59.399> see<00:01:59.579> here<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.810> that

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
on the back as you can see here and that

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.980 
on the back as you can see here and that
is<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.920> culprit<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:03.090> nasty<00:02:03.540> squeaking

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
is the culprit of the nasty squeaking

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.419 
is the culprit of the nasty squeaking
sound<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:06.200> we're<00:02:07.200> gonna<00:02:07.320> take<00:02:07.590> some<00:02:07.619> petroleum

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
sound so we're gonna take some petroleum

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.869 
sound so we're gonna take some petroleum
jelly<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.569> toothpick<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.730> you're<00:02:11.730> just

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
jelly and a toothpick and you're just

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.229 
jelly and a toothpick and you're just
gonna<00:02:12.000> want<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.920> try<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.010> jam<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.730> petroleum

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
gonna want to try to jam the petroleum

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.530 
gonna want to try to jam the petroleum
jelly<00:02:15.270> down<00:02:16.260> into<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.550> groove<00:02:17.970> like<00:02:18.209> you<00:02:18.360> see

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
jelly down into that groove like you see

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.680 
jelly down into that groove like you see
me<00:02:18.569> doing<00:02:18.720> there<00:02:19.610> really<00:02:20.610> just<00:02:20.790> want<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.030> kind

me doing there really just want to kind
of<00:02:21.720> fill<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.110> whole<00:02:22.260> groove<00:02:22.530> or<00:02:22.739> just<00:02:22.950> do<00:02:23.069> it

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160

of fill the whole groove or just do it
until<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.520> stops<00:02:23.730> squeaking<00:02:24.200> if<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.319> doesn't

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
until it stops squeaking if it doesn't

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.320 
until it stops squeaking if it doesn't
stop<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:26.190> suggest<00:02:26.910> using<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.300> q-tip<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:29.330> just

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
stop I suggest using that q-tip and just

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.030 
stop I suggest using that q-tip and just
kind<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.319> globbing<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.040> all<00:02:32.250> over<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.239> mean<00:02:33.540> I

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
kind of globbing it all over you mean I

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.940 
kind of globbing it all over you mean I
ended<00:02:35.040> up<00:02:35.129> using<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.640> ton<00:02:35.940> of<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.709> so<00:02:37.709> it's<00:02:37.830> very

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
ended up using a ton of it so it's very

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.570 
ended up using a ton of it so it's very
greasy<00:02:39.260> but

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
greasy but

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.250 
greasy but
I<00:02:41.610> mean<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:42.090> just<00:02:42.120> keep<00:02:42.450> glob<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.140> on

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
I mean you just keep glob it and on

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:50.000 
I mean you just keep glob it and on
until<00:02:44.030> eventually<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.860> will<00:02:46.860> stop<00:02:47.430> stinky<00:02:49.010> no

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
until eventually it will stop stinky no

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.520 
until eventually it will stop stinky no
something<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:51.540> sweet<00:02:51.840> silence<00:02:52.320> of

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
something that the sweet silence of

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.220 
something that the sweet silence of
trigger<00:02:53.400> buttons<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.570> do<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.110> other

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
trigger buttons so do that to the other

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.190 
trigger buttons so do that to the other
side<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.940> then<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.090> should<00:02:57.150> be<00:02:57.510> done<00:02:57.780> both

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
side and then you should be done both

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.660 
side and then you should be done both
triggers<00:02:59.010> should<00:02:59.370> be<00:02:59.640> smooth<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.510> silent<00:03:01.670> so

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
triggers should be smooth and silent so

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.110 
triggers should be smooth and silent so
that's<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.210> for<00:03:03.420> this<00:03:03.570> video<00:03:04.820> if<00:03:05.820> you<00:03:05.940> have<00:03:06.090> any
