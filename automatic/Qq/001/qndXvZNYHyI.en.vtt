restaurants<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.699> very<00:00:41.910> opposite<00:00:42.360> one<00:00:42.629> to

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
restaurants and the very opposite one to

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.990 
restaurants and the very opposite one to
the<00:00:42.840> other<00:00:42.960> one<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.890> Toledo<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.610> local<00:00:44.879> bistro

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the other one is a Toledo a local bistro

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.140 
the other one is a Toledo a local bistro
and<00:00:45.440> I<00:00:46.440> will<00:00:46.830> explain<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.430> second<00:00:47.760> quickly

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
and I will explain in a second quickly

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.910 
and I will explain in a second quickly
why<00:00:48.330> and<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.840> second<00:00:49.080> one<00:00:49.199> will<00:00:49.379> be<00:00:49.410> ill<00:00:49.710> Bui

where you eat basically around the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.040 
where you eat basically around the
kitchen<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:27.300> have<00:01:27.330> contact<00:01:27.780> with<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050

kitchen and you have contact with the
cooks<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.760> in<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.420> show<00:01:30.570> in

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
cooks and so on and and in the show in

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.160 
cooks and so on and and in the show in
Paris<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.260> we<00:01:31.590> went<00:01:31.740> there<00:01:32.010> and<00:01:32.450> I<00:01:33.450> think<00:01:33.780> this

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
Paris we we went there and I think this

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.530 
Paris we we went there and I think this
is<00:01:34.320> really<00:01:34.710> something<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:36.360> should

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
is really something that you you should

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.470 
is really something that you you should
try<00:01:36.840> at<00:01:37.710> least<00:01:37.740> once<00:01:38.190> because<00:01:38.760> you<00:01:39.000> have

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
try at least once because you have

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.320 
try at least once because you have
amazing<00:01:40.110> food<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.580> at<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.670> same<00:01:41.790> time<00:01:42.060> this

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
amazing food and at the same time this

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.060 
amazing food and at the same time this
kind<00:01:42.510> of<00:01:42.690> close<00:01:43.110> relationship<00:01:43.800> with<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
kind of close relationship with the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.490 
kind of close relationship with the
kitchen<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:45.390> creates<00:01:46.080> a<00:01:46.200> certain

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
kitchen and it creates a certain

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.800 
kitchen and it creates a certain
experience<00:01:46.830> and<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:48.030> eat<00:01:48.240> because<00:01:48.570> when<00:01:48.780> I
