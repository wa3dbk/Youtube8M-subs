00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello dear viewer in this video we 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.980
 tell you what to do if 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.260
 monitor backlight inverter by order or 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.630
 other reasons can not be restored 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.410
 as an example was used 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.529
 monitor with a 243 already the monitor is completely 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.380
 OK except inverter shorter 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.320
 saying the monitor turns on but no 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.380
 backlight image on display can 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.660
 see if the highlight matrix was 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.420
 tasked with restoring the monitor 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.890
 since the monitor inverter 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.530
 no recovery was decided 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.219
 replace the meter with two inverter modules from 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.950
 laptop 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.530
 why it was decided to replace the inverter 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.930
 inverted laptop because at hand 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.890
 there was a box of unnecessary working inverters 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.170
 from laptops 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.780
 power for inverters is taken from 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.789
 power inverter on video 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.850
 red wire is plus power 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.640
 and black is a minus for white about water 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.829
 There is a signal to turn on the inverter 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.409
 do without a turn-on signal 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.129
 but then the backlight will always be 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.439
 included 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.049
 when the monitor is connected to the network 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.659
 dimming backlight in our 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.750
 the solution does not provide for decoupling 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.180
 inverter connector you see on video 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.380
 the connector consists of four pins two 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.560
 extreme contact 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.950
 this power is 2 medium this is a signal 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.560
 on and brightness signal contacts 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.869
 luminance I turn on for parallel and to 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.340
 white wire soldered to it 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.100
 power contacts need to be identified on 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.409
 each inverter separately both inverters 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.689
 connected in parallel to one of 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.650
 inverters connected one bottom lamp 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.549
 from another 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.200
 the top will now demonstrate the work 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.780
 Pay attention to the fact that the matrix 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.000
 the monitor is not connected there are two 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.159
 the monitor will not turn on the image 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.159
 the screen will be filled with white 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.990
 including the monitor, the white screen lights up 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.340
 everything works now you can collect 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.800
 monitor 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.349
 now you see the finished work 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.690
 further will be a demonstration of work 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.959
 as well as checking the brightness adjustment and 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.000
 Contrast immediately note that the task of 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.910
 the restoration of the monitor was decided with 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.470
 success as we say goodbye to you until 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.470
 see you soon in new videos
