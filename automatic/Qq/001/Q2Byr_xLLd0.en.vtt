gonna try to skip the first one or two

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.630 
gonna try to skip the first one or two
threads<00:02:05.899> and<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.170> want<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.409> go<00:02:07.560> with<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
threads with the what direction that

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.160 
threads with the what direction that
we're<00:02:10.830> gonna<00:02:10.920> turn<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:12.030> way<00:02:12.209> as<00:02:12.930> we

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
we're gonna turn this in that way as we

we're gonna turn this in that way as we
turn<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.560> in<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:14.010> tightens<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.760> FF<00:02:15.590> so<00:02:16.590> when

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
turn it in it tightens it FF so when

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.170 
turn it in it tightens it FF so when
there's<00:02:16.980> three<00:02:17.160> turns<00:02:17.959> four<00:02:18.959> turns<00:02:20.030> break<00:02:21.030> it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
there's three turns four turns break it

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.039 
there's three turns four turns break it
up<00:02:21.360> over<00:02:21.660> ready<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:23.000> like<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.180> kind<00:02:24.569> of<00:02:24.630> keep<00:02:24.840> it

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
up over ready I like to kind of keep it
