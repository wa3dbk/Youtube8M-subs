00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.980
 Talking about the club is showing here how 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.210
 do not fit the timing belt 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.790
 our type 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.650
 in the case here 1.6 and n is 94 as 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.330
 put her on the tram 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.460
 So are you going to observe the following 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.859
 mottaki open because I'm changing the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.109
 head gasket shall be observed in the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.390
 crankshaft where it has a 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.390
 registered 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.120
 here it is, you can see it cool 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:49.050
 then the right crankshaft then you go 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:50.340
 come here on the wheel the on the wheel the wheel off 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.329
 of the place 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.020
 You're going to take this plastic protection. 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.780
 here it stays in the wheel box in two 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.550
 They have this one that does not need to take this 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.729
 that the company because in my 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.110
 if only three screws got there 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:13.439
 Here you will see the pulley of the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.759
 crankshaft and napoli have this mark here 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:22.020
 O approach here this trait that 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:25.530
 has to be aligned with this 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.560
 trait Achilles zero degree and it is here 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.680
 on the motor housing 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.570
 so if a line is this 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.740
 in this line this cut with that line 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.560
 15.0 grade in the house 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.390
 this right here on the crankshaft aligned 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.689
 now you will see 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.930
 another point to make sure you are going 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.540
 here now on top of the one box 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.520
 a window here 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.680
 and in this window 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:05.290
 has three numbers 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:11.900
 I do not know if I can see if I can get here. 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:17.450
 not that it gives these three numbers here 05 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.520
 and 10 05 and 10 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.080
 it here or you could see so much 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.370
 Grace then you have to clean up to here 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.640
 Can you get here? 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.920
 then in this case you will align in this 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.800
 brings here from zero grade 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.160
 you will align the trace that was in the 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.480
 engine flywheel can not see 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.900
 cool 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.810
 He is here, who is here in the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.700
 engine flywheel you can not see 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.590
 but there is a cut here 3rd engine flywheel 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.740
 week that cut 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.710
 with this zero-grade line aligned here 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.330
 It's the same thing as talking on the crankshaft. 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.000
 It's not easy for you to go there on the crankshaft. 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.620
 there in after only stay that is 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.620
 maintaining zero degree 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.000
 hit the steering wheel cutting cut 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.400
 zero degree housing 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.190
 the engine is already at the point where you the 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.500
 next step is to put the 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.270
 police the head at the 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.850
 Just as I'm being a head here. 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.800
 I took it out for grinding, I did not 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.290
 I can show you now but I 'll show you later. 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.989
 napoli head up here will have 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.790
 a court also police will align 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:28.760
 with a dot a ball that has in the 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:31.730
 plastic box here galinhada zero degree 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.550
 in zero grade white life in box 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.110
 march here put cassia and the point 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.450
 here in the head the fan here now 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:42.110
 to show you 're already on point it's just 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.700
 put to run in the clear order ne 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.380
 the first place there running 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.180
 crankshaft service is old or swap 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.090
 crankshaft and you come here 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.690
 police assisted motor here places 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.400
 on here 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.709
 then I came up here napoli from 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.050
 head donated here at the moment and 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.750
 last will press aquino thought 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:08.260
 to run is to put the tension here 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.260
 hold on and a hug came out
