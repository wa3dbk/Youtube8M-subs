out<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.500> punches<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.820> know<00:03:13.940> stuff<00:03:14.150> like<00:03:14.270> that

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
out and punches you know stuff like that

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.110 
out and punches you know stuff like that
missiles<00:03:15.590> from<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:15.890> chest<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:17.000> know

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
missiles from the chest you know

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.030 
missiles from the chest you know
lightning<00:03:17.510> bolt<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:17.870> is<00:03:17.959> that<00:03:18.380> type<00:03:18.620> of<00:03:18.650> stuff

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
lightning bolt I is that type of stuff

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.890 
lightning bolt I is that type of stuff
so<00:03:19.520> they<00:03:19.670> were<00:03:19.730> all<00:03:19.940> from<00:03:20.180> his<00:03:20.330> body<00:03:20.600> so<00:03:20.870> he

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
so they were all from his body so he

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.360 
so they were all from his body so he
didn't<00:03:21.140> really<00:03:21.260> carry<00:03:21.620> like<00:03:21.830> a<00:03:21.860> sword<00:03:22.220> or

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
didn't really carry like a sword or

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.310 
didn't really carry like a sword or
anything<00:03:24.430> so<00:03:25.430> I<00:03:25.790> believe<00:03:26.420> there<00:03:26.959> was<00:03:27.140> an

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
anything so I believe there was an

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.000 
anything so I believe there was an
episode<00:03:27.970> where<00:03:28.970> his<00:03:29.300> arm<00:03:29.600> for<00:03:30.320> both<00:03:30.680> arms

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
episode where his arm for both arms

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.100 
episode where his arm for both arms
actually<00:03:31.370> came<00:03:31.610> off<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.180> he<00:03:32.510> had<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.840> fight

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
actually came off and he had to fight

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.800 
actually came off and he had to fight
monster<00:03:33.890> like<00:03:34.070> that<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:34.640> it<00:03:35.180> was<00:03:35.330> kind<00:03:35.570> of<00:03:35.630> cool

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
monster like that so it was kind of cool

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.630 
monster like that so it was kind of cool
that<00:03:36.080> they<00:03:36.260> made<00:03:36.830> it<00:03:36.980> like<00:03:37.160> that<00:03:37.340> I<00:03:37.400> don't<00:03:37.519> know

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
that they made it like that I don't know

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.580 
that they made it like that I don't know
if<00:03:37.790> they<00:03:37.910> did<00:03:38.120> that<00:03:38.150> on<00:03:38.360> purpose<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:39.140> actually

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
if they did that on purpose to actually

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.150 
if they did that on purpose to actually
you<00:03:40.250> know

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160
