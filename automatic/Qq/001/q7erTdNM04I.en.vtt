00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.289
 hi everyone i am regretting 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.629
 challenge to step shareholders ago 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:16.660
 regularly informal as you can 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.939
 see we are in a paris starbucks 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.320
 we went to paris by value a 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.320
 this then Nazism 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.599
 and iphone 6 next and today we will do one 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.230
 double new singh and it all started 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.230
 to become 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.960
 here we are, I don't even have them 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:42.400
 tools then I go directly to 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.400
 craft tool if I can 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.410
 we defend as usual to open the 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.900
 pack and I apologize for the noise 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.180
 in the background but I tried to tell 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.120
 all the customers to keep quiet but that 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.010
 they absolutely listened to me box 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.920
 very particular because if you are hungry that 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.160
 they don't have the color drawing but they have 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.020
 only the shape and this serves to 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.710
 highlight the fact that there is glass 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.710
 curved what we will see in detail between 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.710
 very few 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.650
 I will try not to do like the boy 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.870
 Australian who opened the box 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.770
 too hastily throwing the 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.770
 telephone on the ground 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.960
 here we are 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.290
 and sweetness 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.119
 and here you can have the first let's say a 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.760
 approach not the first image of the 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.130
 new iphone of course the model that 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.590
 I chose is the black one that it actually is 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.810
 black only on the front and gray 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.110
 sidereal throughout the board and throughout 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.170
 the back was really one 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.210
 battle buy it e 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.970
 because in the bags they were available 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.140
 very few pieces and there was a row 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.140
 endless 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.420
 but slowly with our English 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.619
 we were able to contact 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.800
 to book to learn both the 6 and 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.340
 the 6 plus and aesthetics obviously ne 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.319
 so we answered a lot 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.810
 I will give you a quick overview of the keys of the 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.819
 volume with the new shape 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.980
 no buttons for the top 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.799
 and rate the block in the side 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.269
 which should be say studied in 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.240
 cheap way 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.180
 this is kept 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.800
 we'll see it better with shots 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.800
 detailed and detailed analysis 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.800
 in the complete review with reader yes 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.930
 always does the same then lightning 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.120
 headphone jack microphone input e 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.510
 loud speaker and on this 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.140
 model we have the 4.7 screen 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.180
 inch 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.540
 we quickly see the contents of the 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.540
 package 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.049
 obviously the classic where everything is 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:06.100
 Instruction booklet apple stickers 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:07.780
 and the pin to remove the sim 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.150
 and here also without even this has 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.660
 pulled out the classic apple headphones 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.500
 the charger the lightning cable e 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.940
 let's say that for this model of e with 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.850
 quickly the boxwood which according to 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.220
 undermining yourself there are those not making you 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.800
 boring and going directly to 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:31.780
 older brother then iphone if the 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.110
 decidedly bigger box but you can 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.850
 see your own huge more or less 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.700
 same size as a samsung galaxy 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.970
 so definitely notes 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.220
 and important I hope he succeeded in 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.940
 feel me do it because when you get some air 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.940
 new below 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.849
 to open 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.579
 let's say I have the starbucks net stands 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:04.010
 conditioning the moment quite well 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:06.290
 and here too we go very quickly to 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.780
 remove the film that much from 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.120
 some part that on the ground itself 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.769
 box concept with no design 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.299
 marcon 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.729
 let's say the shape relief 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.930
 iPhone's 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:21.199
 let's go to make an opening this time 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.770
 maybe a little less for robbery and here 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:27.680
 we have the brandenburg I would call for 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.100
 who freely we are facing a 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.600
 iphone 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.510
 look at the size of the 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.630
 my crazy hand bigger mind e 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.550
 precisely huge in the difference of 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.280
 thickness does not feel so much e 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.670
 therefore effectively from the idea being 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.950
 a lot bigger to be 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:49.960
 a more subtle impact than the iPhone if 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:51.490
 however, the former is traditional 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.530
 impact even when we tried it 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.950
 this afternoon in the preserves has been 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:05:00.100
 really goodbye is an ipad mini then 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.660
 the rates really don't matter to me 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.610
 I'm going to list why I'm exactly 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.830
 the same ones he sees seen some 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.490
 second but there are all people there 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.350
 we were forgetting from starbucks that there 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.920
 they are taking absolutely for crazy 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:18.660
 and so at the moment this video ends 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.660
 here I wanted to share with you 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.880
 let's say the joy of April 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.370
 on the fly these devices of course 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.010
 here content of nice package 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.969
 it's always the same we lost a 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.829
 piece that we will recover later 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:35.749
 in the coming days we will instead see with 

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:37.270
 calm the videos a little more 

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:38.560
 detailed and where 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.690
 we will see the functions 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.670
 let's get started let's see how it is 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.620
 involves using for with one more screen 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.050
 great so we will try that which not 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.870
 can if it's really worth having one 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.910
 55-inch screen or if we can 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.360
 consider the screen as sufficient 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.060
 from 4 4 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.159
 for the moment very warm greeting a 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.020
 all fans registered for all 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:01.280
 upcoming information next books 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.580
 just take a look at mine 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.750
 facebook page to stay 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.419
