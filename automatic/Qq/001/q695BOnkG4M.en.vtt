this<00:00:23.570> is<00:00:23.720> one<00:00:23.990> part

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
this is one part

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.610 
this is one part
we<00:00:25.529> actually<00:00:25.740> want<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.220> dry<00:00:26.580> off<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:26.850> the

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:28.620 
we actually want to dry off with the

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.420 
we actually want to dry off with the
now<00:00:29.100> we'll<00:00:29.280> put<00:00:29.520> me<00:00:29.730> act

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
now we'll put me act

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.330 
now we'll put me act
you<00:00:32.390> have<00:00:32.570> about<00:00:32.840> three<00:00:33.200> minutes<00:00:33.500> I<00:00:34.070> said

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
you have about three minutes I said

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.430 
you have about three minutes I said
before<00:00:34.579> it's<00:00:34.970> pretty<00:00:35.360> much

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
before it's pretty much

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.069 
before it's pretty much
so<00:00:36.740> these<00:00:36.890> this<00:00:37.340> set<00:00:37.730> of<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:37.940> process<00:00:38.450> just

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
so these this set of the process just

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.930 
so these this set of the process just
got<00:00:39.320> a<00:00:39.350> rip<00:00:39.590> right<00:00:39.860> through<00:00:39.890> it<00:00:40.250> right<00:00:40.489> it's

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
got a rip right through it right it's

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.160 
got a rip right through it right it's
got<00:00:41.150> about<00:00:41.270> a<00:00:41.420> minute<00:00:43.480> before<00:00:44.480> we<00:00:44.840> apply<00:00:45.080> the

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
got about a minute before we apply the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.110 
got about a minute before we apply the
fingerboard<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.010> make<00:00:46.460> sure<00:00:46.610> the<00:00:46.760> thickness

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
fingerboard and make sure the thickness

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.880 
fingerboard and make sure the thickness
is<00:00:47.300> correct<00:00:47.629> and<00:00:47.900> both<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.260> first<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:48.710> the

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
is correct and both the first and the

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.979 
is correct and both the first and the
false<00:00:49.190> threats<00:00:49.550> of<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.820> night<00:00:50.000> next<00:00:50.840> we'll

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
false threats of the night next we'll

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.570 
false threats of the night next we'll
make<00:00:51.140> sure<00:00:51.379> that<00:00:51.410> the<00:00:51.739> neck<00:00:51.920> is<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.129> exact

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
make sure that the neck is the exact

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.130 
make sure that the neck is the exact
height<00:00:52.670> needed<00:00:53.150> before<00:00:53.330> a<00:00:53.570> fingerboard<00:00:54.050> is

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
height needed before a fingerboard is

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.140 
height needed before a fingerboard is

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
permanently attached once the epoxy glue

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.729 
permanently attached once the epoxy glue
is<00:00:59.269> mixed<00:00:59.660> it's<00:01:00.050> applied<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.620> entire

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
the fingerboard the glue is spread out

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.050 
the fingerboard the glue is spread out
and<00:01:05.750> thin<00:01:06.050> even<00:01:06.320> coat<00:01:06.500> any<00:01:07.369> remaining<00:01:07.670> goo<00:01:07.910> is

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
and thin even coat any remaining goo is

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:16.940 
and thin even coat any remaining goo is
reached<00:01:08.390> out<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.810> side

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.480 

this<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.880> an<00:01:18.030> aluminum<00:01:18.330> plate<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:20.009> machined

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
this is an aluminum plate it's machined

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.060 
this is an aluminum plate it's machined
with<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.820> grant<00:01:21.119> radius<00:01:21.600> that's<00:01:22.380> got<00:01:22.650> fret

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
with the grant radius that's got fret

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.130 
with the grant radius that's got fret
slot<00:01:23.460> positions<00:01:24.060> machine<00:01:24.479> down<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
slot positions machine down so that the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.050 
slot positions machine down so that the
frets<00:01:25.380> will<00:01:25.560> sit<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:25.979> there<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
frets will sit in there so that the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.490 
frets will sit in there so that the
pressure<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.570> actually<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.170> fingerboard

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
pressure is actually on the fingerboard

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.800 
pressure is actually on the fingerboard
of<00:01:28.830> on<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.189> fingerboard<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.939> then<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.450> coat

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
of on the fingerboard and then we coat

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.649 
of on the fingerboard and then we coat
it<00:01:30.960> with<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.290> gerber<00:01:31.860> mask<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.430> a

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
it with this gerber mask this is a

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.850 
it with this gerber mask this is a
material<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.440> new<00:01:34.619> car

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
material like if you see a new car

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.260 
material like if you see a new car
rolling<00:01:35.250> down<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.580> road<00:01:35.759> it's<00:01:35.970> got<00:01:36.090> oh<00:01:36.119> it

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
rolling down the road it's got oh it

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.270 
rolling down the road it's got oh it
doesn't<00:01:36.539> get<00:01:36.630> scratched<00:01:36.780> right<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.920> we're<00:01:38.130> not

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
doesn't get scratched right so we're not

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.929 
doesn't get scratched right so we're not
Mar<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> fingerboard<00:01:40.399> but<00:01:41.399> now<00:01:41.549> we<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.909> a

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
Mar in the fingerboard but now we have a

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.800 
Mar in the fingerboard but now we have a
very<00:01:42.299> solid<00:01:42.979> surface<00:01:44.000> that's<00:01:45.000> exactly<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
very solid surface that's exactly the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:55.430 
very solid surface that's exactly the
