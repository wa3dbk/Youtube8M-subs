 hello how about youtube friends 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:09.150
 in this new video I'm going to show you 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:11.610
 how to know how much memory supports 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.429
 our team whether it's going to 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.349
 buy one or we just want to know 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.360
 the characteristics that our 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.520
 RAM 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:26.100
 and many days will know that there are memories 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:29.100
 ram ddr2 ddr3 and then many more everything 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.260
 let's do with a web page is 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.540
 to say we're going through we're going to 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.940
 done through internet dare not 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.440
 you need to download some program that 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.600
 weigh and then be encouraged in our team 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.230
 well first of all let's go to the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:51.060
 description of this video and you'll find 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.130
 the page www.crucial.com 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.400
 they choose is something of this back 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.740
 and good once being on the page you 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.500
 are going to appear these three options we 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:07.500
 let's go to the one that says scanner exist 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.770
 and we are going to give a click once 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.500
 here in this on that poster or window 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.640
 we will give in scan and computer 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.200
 once given a click it will mark us 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.890
 automatically this box we are going to 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.760
 mark it and we're going to hit the arc of 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.280
 scanner 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.660
 we are going to download a file there is no 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.770
 no videos or anything like that 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.770
 we're just going to execute it 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.840
 let's ask what we did 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.859
 that will open another page of 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.950
 internet on which you are scanning and 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:51.560
 is progressing what is what 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.810
 we have in our memory ram 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.740
 and well here it's just a matter of waiting 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.680
 a moment and also thanks I want 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.210
 thank you for all those who 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.220
 have supported the channel we are going to 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.290
 help the 500 subscribers 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.330
 the truth thank you very much I have 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.730
 prepared the pack many have 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.910
 good order I do not want to overtake more 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.160
 with this video that I think after 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.940
 this continues because we are very close to 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.790
 get it and well thank you very much 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:28.440
 and although already here is already on the page 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:30.720
 as you can see, my memory is a ddr3 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.270
 and here they tell you what are the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.540
 features that you can support in 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:40.260
 your good computer here says ddr3 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.830
 maximum memory that can include 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.980
 this computer is 8 gigabytes 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.820
 I have a currently 2 gigs I have 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.630
 two slots the drafts if I want 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:58.550
 put another and good as you see here says 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:02.930
 what is empty is to say that it promises 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.810
 and also here it shows you what is the 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.030
 8GB memory that is compatible with your 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.840
 system in case you want to buy it 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:16.100
 simply click on this link and 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.440
 good follow the conditions and good what 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.600
 you can also buy from here another 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.850
 another thing that you can do to 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.630
 buy a ram or be safe 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.940
 is that ram memory you have is to remove it from 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.040
 the computer and take it with a 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.880
 specialist 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:37.020
 this is safer 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:40.080
 because because they already know they have 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.950
 the knowledge of what memories and how much 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.540
 supports on your computer also in the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.360
 description of this video I will be 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.140
 leaving more pages to be more 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.080
 sure of what memory to buy because 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.630
 then we were wrong to buy a 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.040
 memory and it may turn out that when you arrive and 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:05.970
 try them is not compatible with what is 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.730
 your computer good practically up 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.930
 here this video tutorial 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:17.790
 if you do not know how to install a memory 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:21.260
 either on a laptop or on a TV in a 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:25.560
 cabinet with many medias on youtube 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:29.520
 you can check the good ones and I also want 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.910
 advise you a type this type consists of 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.900
 that even if I had a video tutorial and 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:41.490
 you want and learn to de sant blai everything 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:45.870

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.650
 they do it with bad intentions or you have 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:59.440
 this go wrong in such an error 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.210
 that you do not do it simply for 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.970
 try a ram memory then it is not so 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:08.949
