00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
auto assembly plants so for distribution

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.969 
auto assembly plants so for distribution
and<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.600> changes<00:01:31.050> in<00:01:31.140> orders<00:01:31.410> we<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.710> react

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
and for changes in orders we can react

very quickly and have parts to the
plants<00:01:33.930> within<00:01:34.530> hours

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.520 

ultimately<00:01:58.150> we<00:01:58.360> plan<00:01:58.570> on<00:01:58.690> producing<00:01:59.110> all<00:01:59.350> the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
ultimately we plan on producing all the

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.260 
ultimately we plan on producing all the
North<00:01:59.710> American<00:02:00.160> product<00:02:00.490> in<00:02:00.610> our<00:02:00.729> facility

North American product in our facility

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.760 
North American product in our facility
right<00:02:01.630> now<00:02:01.840> there<00:02:02.080> are<00:02:02.200> three<00:02:02.500> facilities

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
right now there are three facilities

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.860 
right now there are three facilities
producing<00:02:03.640> that<00:02:03.760> so<00:02:04.090> that<00:02:04.300> equipment<00:02:04.600> would

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
producing that so that equipment would

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.750 
producing that so that equipment would
eventually<00:02:05.110> come<00:02:05.500> over<00:02:05.740> here<00:02:06.040> we<00:02:06.640> would

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
eventually come over here we would

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.699 
eventually come over here we would
supply<00:02:07.060> product<00:02:07.510> for<00:02:07.630> North<00:02:07.810> America<00:02:08.350> and<00:02:08.530> the

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
supply product for North America and the

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.109 
supply product for North America and the
other<00:02:08.890> two<00:02:09.100> facilities<00:02:09.640> would<00:02:09.759> supply

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
other two facilities would supply

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.459 
other two facilities would supply
product<00:02:10.570> for<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.929> UK<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.680> European<00:02:11.980> markets
