00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.289 
ya as acts almost like it looks like the
Sun<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.320> actually<00:01:43.829> hitting<00:01:44.009> her<00:01:44.220> bang<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.759> but

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
Sun is actually hitting her bang and but

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.240 
Sun is actually hitting her bang and but
you<00:01:45.390> can't<00:01:45.600> see<00:01:45.720> any<00:01:45.899> color<00:01:46.170> or<00:01:46.470> any<00:01:46.950> kind<00:01:47.189> of

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
you can't see any color or any kind of

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.520 
you can't see any color or any kind of
marking<00:01:48.000> there<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.329> lot<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.750> shine<00:01:48.960> actually

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
marking there a lot of shine actually

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.679 
marking there a lot of shine actually
does<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.860> take<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> long<00:01:50.310> time<00:01:50.549> like<00:01:51.030> minutes

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
does this take a long time like minutes

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.980 
does this take a long time like minutes
minutes<00:01:52.259> pretty<00:01:52.439> quick<00:01:52.880> yeah<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.420> great

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
minutes pretty quick yeah and a great

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.200 
minutes pretty quick yeah and a great
way<00:01:55.110> probably<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.649> apply<00:01:56.070> lots<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.670> fun<00:01:57.000> colors

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
way probably to apply lots of fun colors

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.690 
way probably to apply lots of fun colors
yeah<00:01:57.630> actually<00:01:57.719> if<00:01:57.960> people<00:01:58.170> are<00:01:58.259> afraid<00:01:58.469> to

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
yeah actually if people are afraid to

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.819 
yeah actually if people are afraid to
and<00:01:59.700> come<00:01:59.880> people<00:02:00.000> with<00:02:00.149> short<00:02:00.360> hair<00:02:00.479> do<00:02:00.630> this

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
and come people with short hair do this

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.620 
and come people with short hair do this
absolutely<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.759> good<00:02:02.969> way<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.299> add

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
absolutely it's a good way to just add

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.870 
absolutely it's a good way to just add
like<00:02:04.140> even<00:02:04.500> tone<00:02:04.740> down<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> color<00:02:05.310> just<00:02:05.610> add<00:02:05.850> a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
like even tone down a color just add a

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.760 
like even tone down a color just add a
low-light<00:02:06.840> people<00:02:07.140> are<00:02:07.229> afraid<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.439> do<00:02:07.619> low

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
low-light people are afraid to do low

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.650 
low-light people are afraid to do low
lights<00:02:07.950> when<00:02:08.099> they're<00:02:08.220> really<00:02:08.429> blond<00:02:08.670> okay<00:02:09.479> um

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
lights when they're really blond okay um

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.640 
lights when they're really blond okay um
so<00:02:10.440> if<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.679> just<00:02:10.860> add<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:12.500> subtle

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
so if you just add a a subtle

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.039 
so if you just add a a subtle
subtle<00:02:13.920> color<00:02:14.329> it'll<00:02:15.329> tone<00:02:15.599> it<00:02:15.720> down<00:02:15.810> without

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
subtle color it'll tone it down without

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.360 
subtle color it'll tone it down without
them<00:02:16.260> maybe<00:02:16.379> noticing<00:02:16.920> there's<00:02:17.099> color<00:02:17.310> in

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
them maybe noticing there's color in

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.399 
them maybe noticing there's color in
their<00:02:17.549> hair<00:02:17.700> right<00:02:18.360> but<00:02:18.900> it'll<00:02:19.049> just<00:02:19.079> give<00:02:19.319> an

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
their hair right but it'll just give an

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.940 
their hair right but it'll just give an
overall<00:02:19.730> like<00:02:20.730> low<00:02:21.510> light<00:02:21.720> effect<00:02:22.019> so<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:22.739> know

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
overall like low light effect so I know

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.470 
overall like low light effect so I know
we're<00:02:23.159> doing<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.400> ombre<00:02:23.730> technique<00:02:23.909> now

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
we're doing the ombre technique now

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.720 
we're doing the ombre technique now
you're<00:02:25.170> you're<00:02:25.620> using<00:02:25.769> flam<00:02:26.099> voyage<00:02:26.430> on<00:02:26.549> this

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
you're you're using flam voyage on this

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.699 
you're you're using flam voyage on this
side<00:02:26.939> and<00:02:27.390> what's<00:02:28.019> another<00:02:28.290> way<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.530> create

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
side and what's another way to create

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.339 
side and what's another way to create
that<00:02:28.950> on<00:02:29.760> protec<00:02:30.120> neke<00:02:30.299> that<00:02:30.540> everybody's

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
that on protec neke that everybody's

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.339 
that on protec neke that everybody's
kind<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.680> coming<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.430> for<00:02:32.579> lately<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.629> on<00:02:34.079> the

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
kind of coming in for lately so on the

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.199 
kind of coming in for lately so on the
other<00:02:34.470> side<00:02:34.739> we've<00:02:34.950> already<00:02:35.280> started<00:02:35.909> doing

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
other side we've already started doing

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.500 
other side we've already started doing
some<00:02:36.629> techniques<00:02:37.489> what<00:02:38.489> I've<00:02:38.609> done<00:02:38.849> for<00:02:39.329> this

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
some techniques what I've done for this

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.289 
some techniques what I've done for this
just<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.959> have<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.260> more<00:02:40.379> gold<00:02:41.250> look<00:02:41.609> is<00:02:41.849> just<00:02:42.120> a

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
just to have a more gold look is just a

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.500 
just to have a more gold look is just a
backcomb<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:43.439> avoid<00:02:43.709> roots<00:02:44.299> perfect<00:02:45.299> and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
backcomb so you avoid roots perfect and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.649 
backcomb so you avoid roots perfect and
then<00:02:47.209> taking<00:02:48.209> just<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.900> regular<00:02:49.230> foil<00:02:49.590> okay<00:02:50.659> so

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
then taking just a regular foil okay so

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.110 
then taking just a regular foil okay so
there's<00:02:51.840> more<00:02:51.959> hair<00:02:52.260> for<00:02:52.950> this<00:02:53.040> one<00:02:53.250> okay<00:02:54.060> so

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
there's more hair for this one okay so

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.180 
there's more hair for this one okay so
that's<00:02:54.389> stronger<00:02:54.870> look<00:02:55.019> yes<00:02:55.470> but<00:02:56.040> still

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
that's stronger look yes but still

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.949 
that's stronger look yes but still
giving<00:02:56.609> that<00:02:56.730> natural<00:02:57.209> look<00:02:57.359> because<00:02:57.569> you've

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
giving that natural look because you've

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.720 
giving that natural look because you've
actually<00:02:58.079> back<00:02:58.500> home<00:02:58.769> a<00:02:59.010> root<00:02:59.189> area<00:02:59.340> so<00:02:59.639> you

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
actually back home a root area so you

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.179 
actually back home a root area so you
don't<00:02:59.909> have<00:03:00.150> those<00:03:00.510> again<00:03:00.989> demarcation<00:03:01.980> there

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:02.189 
don't have those again demarcation there
