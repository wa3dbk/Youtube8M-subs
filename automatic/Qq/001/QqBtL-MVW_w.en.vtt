00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.080
 hello today I present the recipe of 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.630
 second chocolate mirror glaze 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.100
 version compared to the first one this will be 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.590
 less rich in fat 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.710
 in fact I replaced part of the cream 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.670
 with water and dark chocolate with 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.480
 I will use the bitter cocoa for the recipe 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.330
 fresh cream water granulated sugar 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.860
 bitter cocoa powder and in the other 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.570
 water they use to give up the 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.640
 jelly 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.640
 first of all it brings boiling cream 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:05.940
 water and sugar 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:19.270
 meanwhile towards the cold water in the 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:22.090
 gelatin to make her soften taken the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.800
 boil remove from the stove and a little for 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 once I add the cocoa by mixing with 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.920
 the whip 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.510
 and the last jelly with all the water 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.510
 used for the spring 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:24.409
 melted the gelatine filter all over 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.409
 eliminate any lumps 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.530
 it is a glaze is ready as cooked and 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.500
 rich in sugar it can be preserved 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.130
 once cold in the refrigerator for various 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.130
 a cold day when I poured the 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.410
 icing in a mug you take it to 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.650
 temperature of 28 degrees the temperature 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.200
 of use can range from 25 to 30 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.910
 degrees according to the desired result 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.140
 get 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.050
 practically the temperature will be 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.570
 low plus the icing will be thick 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.180
 therefore it will be more covering and with one 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.540
 greater thickness then I take a 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.720
 tray that I will need to recover the 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.540
 Glaze in excess and place over one 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.280
 grid then place in the middle a 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:25.210
 small nod to the cold mascarpone 4 e 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.210
 the icing covers it 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.580
 new slightly to level the 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:42.770
 frosting let it take 30 seconds then 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.770
 position sweet on the disk 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.360
 and lastly we decorate pleasure 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.000
 thanks to the next hello recipe
