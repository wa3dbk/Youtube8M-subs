00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.530
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new one 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.930
 exercise of tactics book 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.510
 we have a location here where the 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.829
 material more or less and paris where the 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.989
 white is very dangerous because a 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.030
 these two central pedestrians very much 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.510
 advanced is probably that 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.910
 threatening to carry a pawn in e 6 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.260
 which would be a sustained past pylon 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:59.800
 so very dangerous here in black 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.469
 plays horse f7 and now moved the call 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.660
 white let's see why in black though 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:09.580
 right away he can't take this pawn 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:14.080
 for which this attack would follow and the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:17.410
 black loses material then some way 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.479
 the mare f7 move also prevents into 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.590
 future 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.429
 let's say a landing beam 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.399
 of the bishop in the house g5 ok then 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:30.039
 move to white say well in poses 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.039
 reader try to analyze well 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:36.810
 this position to find that move 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:36.810
 best for white 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.100
 ok then first of all the suggestions 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.869
 then this is not the position of 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.960
 matti simply the white gains 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.710
 material from this position that 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.409
 definitely material then what they are 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.590
 the fundamentals of tactics to be exploited 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.229
 first step the intermediate move 15 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.890
 practically a combination of exchanges 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.930
 of material and white will interpose in 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.130
 this combination is a move that black 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.959
 it does not expect and therefore we say 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.970
 a move that normally 1 does not 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.650
 would think in the combination but that 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.459
 brings in the off-road to lose 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:31.060
 material another another foundation e 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:36.180
 the deviation a piece then comes 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:39.099
 deviated from a defensive role it has 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.290
 finally double attack a piece of the 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.140
 white will be placed so as to attack 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.660
 doubly two pieces of the opponent 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.079
 this is a great threat because of 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.130
 usually they had failed to defend 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.130
 both of these attacks 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.970
 ok let's see first how this 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.620
 push in and 6 which creates a pawn in 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.720
 past advocated is not good here 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.780
 precisely because the horse fe 7 s 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.459
 they can f7 just to take advantage of 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:15.400
 support this house and go to 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:18.060
 threaten the c4 pylon they would like the 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.650
 white could lose it anyway 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.170
 would allow the horse to position itself 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.079
 in high queens we say defend 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.170
 pushing it anyway the white game 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:32.560
 horse c4 and with and get strong 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.049
 against the game puts the venue will 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.990
 move or this will be changed 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.330
 central pedestrian attached now 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.100
 it may be that white has to lose 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.550
 material then black passes into 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.550
 benefit 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.570
 ok so usually something you can 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.340
 think in these conditions like the 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.710
 white to a strong attack on the column 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.220
 and well open this column 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:02.290
 in fact the right move in this case is 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.590
 pawn for f 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.920
 but outside a black pawn and implement a 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.290
 double tower attachment 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.050
 if there were not this black horse 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.970
 would be practically already the third because 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.040
 here it practically has to almost forcibly 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.440
 capture say otherwise loses the tower 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.800
 any later if there was not this 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.140
 horse and it could take a tower 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.020
 free at this point because of this 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:33.000
 discovery attack on the tower after that 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.380
 precisely the plan has been moved to f 6 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.780
 therefore which could be of the 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.640
 white we said this 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.410
 defender is defending the tower 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.190
 it might be an idea to remove the 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.580
 horse some way pavia moves like ad 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.140
 example horse of four are slow 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.300
 problem here that black can save the 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.970
 tower immediately by capturing that 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.000
 white and giving check 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:02.020
 so there is no time for these things 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.590
 on the other hand also moves like friezes 5 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.540
 after horse in the seven are some 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.470
 inhibited because here we would continue 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:15.460
 with horse for g5 the quid hours per se 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:19.240
 for itself 7 seems like a good idea than later 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.500
 horse for and 7 king is defending two 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.060
 horses 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.610
 although now the bank is at a disadvantage 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.220
 material manages to equalize 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.740
 capturing 1 and then after that made 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.750
 moved to recapture the horse 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.080
 capturing the other however this 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.080
 position 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.620
 the black we say should not have 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.960
 problems to equalize we say that not 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.599
 there is an imbalance and Venus more active 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.029
 the white tower is more active some 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:49.990
 so after you played it you are here 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:49.990
 there should be no problems 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:00.319
 ok so what is the right move in 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:03.229
 this case the right and change the 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:06.650
 history suffered this therefore prevents the 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:08.719
 black to change the tower to check and 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.180
 now obviously in the must to capture 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:12.379
 otherwise it loses horse material 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:18.469
 at this point black is another 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:21.199
 target the horse in and 7 can't 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:24.319
 be taken though because the king in the area 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:27.889
 there is a verse to remove the quaestor 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:31.009
 then again the g5 faith does not 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:32.930
 it always works for the f7 horse that it 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:41.080
 can eventually capture you min mint 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:47.680
 first it changes fairly little downstream for 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.680
 here you end up in the same position 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:56.149
 however there is another verse for 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:58.669
 remove the defender the facts here the king 

00:06:56.149 --> 00:07:00.620
 another way can be removed 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:03.439
 using the same piece that is 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.899
 threatening the horse the tower is 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:10.699
 simply white can play tower e 

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:13.909
 6 double attack to the king horse the king yes 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:16.210
 must move leaving the defense 

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:19.189
 of the horse which was taken white 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:22.789
 therefore it refines in material advantage 

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:24.589
 match easily won 

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:26.749
 ok so i hope you have succeeded 

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:29.120
 in order to see something in 

00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:31.580
 this video or anyway I hope you have 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.479
 learned something from the video see you 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.849
 to the next 

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:36.849
 good luck to all hello hello
