00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.730
 and very good to all kids I'm mod yes 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.520
 and I want to teach a bus that I already knew 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.050
 that existed for a long time but not 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.420
 He knew how useful because just give 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.660
 it has utility I have found one that goes 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.500
 to serve especially those who play 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.050
 on survival servers and that is not that 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.610
 there is no protection in the chests 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.700
 then what we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.739
 put the block rail and trolley with 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.930
 chest we can do also think 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.510
 there is a wagon with an oven 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.460
 we can not do it with the wagon with 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.520
 the oven and everything with all the 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.130
 wagons but I 'm going to do it with the 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.900
 that have a chest 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:57.470
 well we put block rail wagon and here 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.990
 up to the same rail rail block 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.720
 block rail wagon this we can 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.700
 do as much as we want and now 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.620
 what we are going to do you are going to remove all 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.530
 the blocks but before I'll explain 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.780
 one thing and it is so that in what I do 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.750
 this video 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.909
 and that is when we pull 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.790
 all the wagons with box are going to 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.270
 to be all here that by the way 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.020
 put a block so that it does not come out 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.729
 and tell you that the first cart or 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.250
 when they are all together 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.520
 us by clicking on it right we're going to 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.920
 open this down here if we break a 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.229
 wagon is going to break this and then 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.899
 we will be able to open the second one and so 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:46.369
 all the time then we can 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:49.060
 hide any material in the last 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.100
 trolley if you do it higher then 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.569
 you have many more chests in front and 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.970
 it's much harder to find it 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:58.130
 so that I may know that it works 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.039
 here to put good I'm going to put diamond 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.259
 in the second I will put remains and in the 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:07.189
 third I will put stone 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.380
 I'm going to put this here now I remove everything and 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.110
 as you see in the work at all I have 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.660
 put stone there is the stone if what 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.079
 I remove in the second I had put remains 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.080
 there is the rest and in the third I put 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:23.330
 diamonds and there are the diamonds 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.300
 and nothing was just for you to know this 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.610
 little bug and here I say goodbye so 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.080
 nothing this has been all for today I hope 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.320
 that you liked and until the next 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.320
 video
