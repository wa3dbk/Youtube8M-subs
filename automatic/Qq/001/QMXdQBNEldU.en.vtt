00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.640
 Hello Nita In the kitchen you are welcome. 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.440
 Today we are going to make flour of gum laddus. 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.740
 Flour gum laddus are very good at eating. 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.920
 And there are also very nutritious. 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.060
 Well they can be eaten in any season but 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.420
 They are mostly made and eaten in cold weather. 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.480
 This is beneficial for everyone. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.340
 Especially in pregnancy and pregnancy is also very beneficial. 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.020
 So let's see what they need for us to make them. 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.160
 To make gum laddus we need: - 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.920
 1 cup flour, 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.380
 Here we have used powdered sugar in 1 cup sugar. 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.180
 1/2 cup ghee, 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.300
 2 tablespoons gum 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.440
 This will get you from any grocery store 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.460
 2 teaspoons scapula brown 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.520
 If you want, you can also dry dhapra at home 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.460
 So you will find it. 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.060
 4-5 Cardamom 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.740
 Which we have coded 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.080
 It will taste good with cardamom 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.120
 And this is one of the benefits of cardamom 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.580
 The cardamom helps us digest the laddoo. 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.280
 7-8 pistachios, we have cut this length long. 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.260
 7-8 cashews, we have cut this long long thinner. 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.860
 10-12 almonds, we have cut this long long thinner. 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.120
 Now first of all we will turn on the gas 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.560
 And will keep a strict on it. 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.600
 We will ghee the ghee, and we will let the ghee warm. 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.320
 When our ghee becomes hot then we will put flour in it. 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.280
 Our ghee is hot, now the dough that we kept in it, 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.760
 We will put one cup of flour in it. 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.120
 We will continue to run it. 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.280
 So that it does not stick. 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.720
 We have been active for about 4 minutes. 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.940
 Now after sebowing for about 4 minutes, we will glue it in. 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.680
 We will flower the gum in this. 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.560
 If you want, you can place gum separately in ghee. 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.620
 Now it will run continuously or else it will stick to the bottom 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.380
 And we will keep the gas slow. 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.020
 See glue is flowing and its sound is coming. 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.220
 See our glue is fully seaked. 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.780
 And our dough has also been a good golden sink. 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.120
 Now we will stop the gas. 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.360
 It will continue to run because our rigidity is still quite hot. 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.800
 See how cute colors have come up. 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.640
 Unless it is a bit cold 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.300
 By that time we will continue to run it. 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.060
 We will not leave it, otherwise the dough will stick 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.100
 And more will seek. 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.840
 Now our glue which has blossomed, we will also break it 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.340
 Otherwise it would be difficult for us to make laddus. 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.620
 See how easily it is fitter 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.440
 This will also bring good taste and 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.060
 We will also be able to make laddus too. 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.780
 In this way we will break all the gum. 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.320
 We have broken gum well. 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.060
 And it has got well in the dough 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.640
 Which would make it very easy to make laddus 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.760
 And the taste of gum will also be very good. 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.060
 Now we will put sugar in it and mix it well. 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.300
 We've got sugar equivalent to the dough here. 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.700
 If you like to eat more sweet 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:09.820
 So you can reduce your sugar accordingly. 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.460
 Now we will get it very well. 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.100
 We have mixed the sugary brown sugar in it. 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.140
 When the dough was hot, then we have mixed sugars well 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.080
 So it got better if you think it 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.960
 Sugar sugar is not mixing well 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.060
 And you are having trouble getting it 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.980
 So you can turn the gas for a while. 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.280
 So sugar will melt away from them and they will get better. 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.500
 Now we will put all the dry fruits in it. 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.720
 Like the first we'll put 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.420
 Kapra, 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.240
 Cardamom, 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.860
 Pistachios, 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.320
 Cashew 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.120
 And almond 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.260
 Now we will merge it 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.700
 And then when it gets a bit cold 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.860
 Then we will prepare the laddoos. 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.800
 See now it has got better. 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.260
 Now we will take it out in a plate and let it cool down. 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.320
 Our dough has cooled down 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.040
 Now let us prepare its laddoos. 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.120
 We will take a little bit of flour beforehand and 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.500
 It will press with light-handed hands. 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.620
 Look, we have prepared laddus. 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.620
 In this way, we will make even more laddus. 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.380
 Look, we have prepared another laddoo. 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.380
 In this way we will make laddus. 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.460
 When we make laddus we will press it with light-handed hands 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.600
 In the beginning we will put a little emphasis and later with light-handed hands 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.480
 It will shape it and then our laddoos will be ready. 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.900
 We have prepared 15 laddus of this size from this dough. 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.840
 If you want it for 1 month 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:32.820
 Placing it in airtight container 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.760
 Can pick up looting. 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.000
 Now you also make it and share your experience with me. 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.280
