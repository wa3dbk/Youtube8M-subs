if the server has the password you put

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.849 
if the server has the password you put
in<00:02:38.280> an<00:02:38.400> eerie<00:02:38.790> password<00:02:39.389> for<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.659> server<00:02:39.930> so

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
in an eerie password for the server so

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.259 
in an eerie password for the server so

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.420 
show you do its work so flood server
means<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:45.810> going<00:02:46.109> to<00:02:46.230> join<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.040> out<00:02:47.189> and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
means it's going to join in and out and

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.929 
means it's going to join in and out and
here<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:47.849> is<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:49.530> get<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.799> CMD<00:02:50.129> and<00:02:50.489> there<00:02:50.849> it

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
here it is you get to CMD and there it

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.349 
here it is you get to CMD and there it
is<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.480> can<00:02:51.659> kind<00:02:51.989> of<00:02:52.109> see<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.379> to<00:02:52.650> the

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
is you can kind of see it to the

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.179 
is you can kind of see it to the
so<00:02:54.359> there<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.599> go<00:02:54.659> and<00:02:55.049> usually<00:02:55.709> it'll<00:02:56.010> make

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
so there you go and usually it'll make

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.699 
so there you go and usually it'll make
like<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.400> weird<00:02:57.180> noise<00:02:57.329> and<00:02:57.689> it<00:02:57.780> makes<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.049> lag

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
like a weird noise and it makes you lag

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.229 
like a weird noise and it makes you lag
out<00:02:59.150> to<00:03:00.150> stop<00:03:00.389> it<00:03:00.569> you<00:03:00.659> just<00:03:00.840> click<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.200> X<00:03:01.379> and

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
out to stop it you just click the X and

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.490 
out to stop it you just click the X and
then<00:03:03.239> now<00:03:03.480> I'm<00:03:03.599> going<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.840> make<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.139> fill<00:03:04.470> up

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
then now I'm going to make it fill up

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.819 
then now I'm going to make it fill up
the<00:03:04.739> server<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.609> so<00:03:06.030> there<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.299> go<00:03:06.829> it's

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
the server and so there you go it's

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:13.330 
the server and so there you go it's
filling<00:03:08.189> up<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.579> there's<00:03:09.569> a<00:03:11.180> fill-up<00:03:12.180> people

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
and eventually if you just keep doing

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.729 
and eventually if you just keep doing
flood<00:03:16.919> server<00:03:17.190> uh<00:03:17.810> it'll<00:03:18.810> lag<00:03:19.109> everybody<00:03:19.530> out
