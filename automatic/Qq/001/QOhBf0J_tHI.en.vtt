00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.659
 so here we go to work a piece of fact if sharman so it's a continuation 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.890
 four agreements it's not difficult 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.420
 so I remember in fact that in the end points of agreement finally be careful 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.789
 no more for the freight is very important if not 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.989
 it can curl it's called 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:16.989
 now the sacem example when in fact it is not necessary to have 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.150
 said to have done music theory before coming to class we work constantly 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.239
 in a different way 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.219
 compared to the academies that is to say that to take it on board played the 

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:28.489
 peace agreements in parallel we explain to you 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:29.659
 notions of 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.890
 two rhythms et cetera the notes of course unlike the academies in 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.730
 face 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.190
 our work method which is pretty simple it is based on them 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.070
 learning the accompaniment 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.130
 so at the beginning 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.560
 when we arrive in class 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.280
 we learn directly to play chords 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.280
 then wobbly the G-clef that here 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.100
 imminent hurry 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.100
 that's a shame 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.270
 the most important in this piece 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.170
 % and of course this concatenation 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.150
 percent especially the pace in fact I would say in a general way when you 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.610
 learn fair 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.860
 we must pay attention to the establishment so the establishment to say what 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.250
 it means that 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.100
 we dominate pulsations 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.140
 we give one more to his foot 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.690
 so we try to play 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.090
 at a rate that goes on this pulsation so here as an example three people 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.230
 first at the beginning 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.590
 it does not try to do it quickly it's useless to play better than 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.570
 slowly and not well who grants you 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.290
 in fact it really does everything gently heyer 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.290
 we need each string are properly so there you support 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.640
 the finish very well so all the odds are exactly 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:14.079
 here we are, we will be ravaged 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.569
 then raised we can add 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.309
 little fantasy 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:23.629
 we can add the little finger 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:24.739
 cousin on the ground
