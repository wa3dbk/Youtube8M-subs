00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
like the other ones I really enjoyed the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.210 
like the other ones I really enjoyed the
sound<00:02:08.009> they<00:02:08.789> do<00:02:08.849> seem<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.810> lot<00:02:10.349> louder<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:11.069> it's

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
sound they do seem a lot louder but it's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.290 
sound they do seem a lot louder but it's
just<00:02:11.430> because<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:12.480> attack<00:02:12.900> is

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
just because the attack is

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.870 
just because the attack is
brighter<00:02:13.570> than<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.290> coated<00:02:14.800> head<00:02:15.070> which<00:02:15.670> is

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
brighter than a coated head which is

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.690 
brighter than a coated head which is
