00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:11.099
 hello today we have another 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:18.080
 round bottom option here so here it is 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.080
 Looks interesting and coupon code 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:27.670
 it is in two color versions and here it is 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.670
 it is because the color of the water and 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.590
 it is done simply but 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:41.320
 An interesting result is obtained that us 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:45.070
 for this you need to take take four 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:49.390
 groups of tubules payouts I took 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:53.760
 need for this product on trial 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.760
 then we cross it under 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:12.650
 so fold 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:16.520
 a bowl of juice and if we were 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.610
 they were wrapped in ordinary rope 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.470
 I 'm starting to rub the hair would come out like this 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:31.580
 the bottom is the same way you can do it too 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:35.540
 Now we will do it with one 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.970
 the tube that is refuel for one of 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.270
 groups for now so then on refuel this 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.630
 end hide it neatly 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.560
 refuel under one of the lower 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:53.290
 the coffin of the tubules and further alternating 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:02:00.670
 alternating one group from top to second 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:06.490
 bottom one top second and under 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:09.490
 following refuel down so trying 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.490
 sell 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.220
 on top of 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.510
 below 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.460
 comparing simultaneously 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:30.750
 weave circle 1 level and continue 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.750
 further briefly 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.090
 can already rotate 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.090
 holding on 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.750
 tightly pressed 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.470
 we increase along the way 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.360
 here if the tube is not possible 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.980
 well they are not there is a possibility well 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.590
 each other for provide a glue not 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:05.620
 need so maybe glue worth in 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:14.230
 In this place we have three turns 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:14.230
 there were 3 lic everywhere . 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.870
 yes we go here here already three turns 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:28.430
 there is, then we do what 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:32.780
 way and the following will go now 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:36.489
 we change where we had under passed 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.620
 straw workers we her now on top 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.470
 let us and vice versa where we 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.720
 the tubes were from the top down and so also 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.450
 do three turns right here when we 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.519
 already reach the last vi. 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.099
 or do so now leave 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.340
 neatly 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:58.459
 the excess is then glued and clipped 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:03.169
 substitute another tube and 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:06.109
 continue to weave string for the first time 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:08.470
 we find a rope covering three 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:11.470
 tubules as if to fix 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.470
 result 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:36.350
 about having woven several rows 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.720
 takes three tubes turn on 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.270
 braiding two tubes 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.150
 as usual and then after a few rows 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.760
 start to braid 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:52.100
 tubules already in tight and so inhale 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.100
 we need the diameter we need 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.180
 Well, what picture do we get? 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.680
 so now here's another such moment 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:11.080
 mean to weave on 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:16.570
 new first example conveniently weave by 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:18.790
 clockwise here I am doing so 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.290
 I mean, I turn in 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.139
 first we need to refuel first 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.400
 ponytail remember at the very beginning we just 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.949
 I said 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.020
 that we then later to refuel here and 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.680
 hiding it here so neatly 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:36.070
 this tail 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:39.820
 it will not be visible on that side 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:43.229
 It turned out pretty trevi ride. 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.880
 and that we then continue on I 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:49.590
 I deduce 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.590
 our tubules of ours here so here 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:56.590
 rather inside and handle and now 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.840
 edge on and then I will be these tube 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.639
 already continue to weave a rope again 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.289
 I need a referral specifically for this I 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.479
 and turns everyone back there 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.919
 adapted and now wanted to show 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:10.180
 how have I been lately 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:12.130
 turn in a few products made 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.800
 I really liked it too on the advice 1 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:17.020
 masters of our site, see earlier 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.789
 We do here but wound up as a straw 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.450
 now for 2 any get more 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:21.450
 decorative 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:37.360
 Here we have it but here 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.360
 transition 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.900
 and 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.650
 music both through 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.640
 all ready lord
