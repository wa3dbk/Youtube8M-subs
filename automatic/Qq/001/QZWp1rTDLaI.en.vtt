00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.660
 this video is about sex 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.230
 comparing iphone 5 and ipod touch fifth 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.190
 generations what is here on the left lies 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.679
 iphone 5 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.320

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.090
 untie let's start where told 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.390
 why design and now you can 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.060
 watch the back of the iphone 5 and ipod 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.689
 touch 5th generation iphone 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.240
 on the left ipod on the bottom right they have a principle 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.770
 nothing different only iphone 5 2 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.630
 speaker and microphone 2 means code 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.489
 a little bit thinner due to the fact that i am 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.460
 there is no radio module it is very 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.500
 Capacitive lot takes place ipod 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.329
 touch 5th generation it has a thickness of 6.1 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.360
 millimeters in iphone 5 is a bit thicker 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.899
 the book says above here as always 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.390
 home button 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.180
 here we are here only 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.770
 the camera here is camera and conversational 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.600
 speaker ie speaker but here not 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.439
 it is necessary because it does not talk 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.390
 on top of them there are differences here we have 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.520
 5 megapixel camera isight for 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.869
 sound recording microphone and flash 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.610
 here is a slot for Wi-Fi antennas 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.259
 here are an amazing element 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.180
 metal clip for which 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.200
 open state can be fixed 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.920
 complete cord 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.590
 here we see a 8 megapixel camera 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.110
 there is again a recording microphone 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.590
 sound 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:35.220
 here there is a flash here an apple here 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.479
 here here over the whole ipod background and here 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.090
 already this metal 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.810
 there is no element so it doesn't matter to hand 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.640
 cling Else 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.610
 at the fifth iphone 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.290
 the morning component is the nuclear spirit 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.290
 apple a6 processor 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.229
 which means it is 13 hertz 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.229
 ipod touch fifth generation processor 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.300
 apple a5 which has a frequency of 800 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.430
 megahertz but in principle 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.300
 out optimization and thunder and ok yourself 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.610
 leads he slows down never behaves 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:12.810
 report give try on both devices 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:15.410
 turn on the game subway surfer here it is necessary 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.410
 for bumps 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:27.420
 everything is loaded here only only 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.420
 go 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.280
 In general, I play the same way on 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.819
 all devices well, remember a little bit 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.819
 iphone 5 5 here is this game csr racing 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:08.360
 but on both devices it goes smoothly 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:09.830
 and with the withdrawal is not enough well finally 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.420
 last game you wanted 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.420
 show this tempura 2 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.100
 he is ready to think a lot 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.790
 it's so gone 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.700
 in general, on both devices it goes 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.950
 smoothly and hang it but it does not have 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.000
 that our version ends me the most 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.000
 goodbye see you
