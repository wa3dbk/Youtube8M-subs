00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
cut-and-dry c-clamp I also use ass to

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.340 
cut-and-dry c-clamp I also use ass to
Mack<00:00:34.860> my<00:00:35.250> 12<00:00:35.550> inch<00:00:35.640> radius<00:00:36.110> sandal<00:00:37.110> call

actually<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> very<00:00:39.030> nice<00:00:39.180> clamping<00:00:39.809> call

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
actually it's a very nice clamping call

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.229 
actually it's a very nice clamping call
just<00:00:40.440> double<00:00:41.280> stick<00:00:41.489> tape<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.730> couple<00:00:41.910> pieces

just double stick tape a couple pieces

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.240 
just double stick tape a couple pieces
of<00:00:42.420> old<00:00:42.510> pork<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.079> there<00:00:43.320> put<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.860> there

of old pork on there put it on there
I<00:00:44.960> use<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.110> as<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> clamp<00:00:47.340> then<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
I use it as a for the clamp then all and

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.990 
I use it as a for the clamp then all and
then<00:00:48.629> I'll<00:00:48.750> run<00:00:48.930> up<00:00:49.890> underneath<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.820> is

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
then I'll run up underneath this is

basically you can you can call this a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.650 
basically you can you can call this a
clamping<00:00:53.250> call<00:00:53.489> or<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.059> can<00:00:54.210> call<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.600> a

clamping call or you can call this a

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.040 
clamping call or you can call this a
it's<00:00:55.379> actually<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.719> sanding<00:00:57.719> 12

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
it's actually it's really a sanding 12

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.799 
it's actually it's really a sanding 12
inch<00:00:58.199> radius<00:00:58.640> sanding<00:00:59.640> call<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.480> use<00:01:00.629> it

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.109 
to sand a radius and a fretboard that's
flat<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.710> use<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:05.580> several<00:01:05.790> things

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
flat but I use it for several things

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.890 
flat but I use it for several things
including<00:01:07.460> one<00:01:08.460> being<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.000> clamping<00:01:09.630> call

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
including one being as a clamping call

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.429 
including one being as a clamping call
to<00:01:10.830> clamp<00:01:11.130> down<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:12.330> neck<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:12.990> pocket

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
to clamp down the neck to the pocket

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.830 
to clamp down the neck to the pocket
into<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> pocket

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
into the pocket

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.020 
into the pocket
pork<00:01:15.470> here<00:01:15.680> so<00:01:15.920> there's<00:01:16.100> no<00:01:16.250> damage<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.700> the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
pork here so there's no damage to the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.200 
pork here so there's no damage to the
threats<00:01:17.299> in<00:01:17.630> any<00:01:17.780> way<00:01:18.020> shape<00:01:18.799> or<00:01:18.950> form<00:01:19.210> and

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
threats in any way shape or form and

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.620 
threats in any way shape or form and
what<00:01:20.329> I<00:01:20.360> do<00:01:20.479> is<00:01:20.840> I<00:01:21.399> put<00:01:22.399> one<00:01:22.610> clamp<00:01:22.909> down<00:01:23.210> here

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
what I do is I put one clamp down here

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.319 
what I do is I put one clamp down here
we'll<00:01:24.590> go<00:01:24.740> over<00:01:24.860> this<00:01:25.130> then<00:01:25.939> I<00:01:26.000> put<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.240> little

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
we'll go over this then I put a little

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.990 
we'll go over this then I put a little
block<00:01:26.630> of<00:01:26.840> wood<00:01:26.990> here<00:01:27.470> for<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.399> tail<00:01:28.610> end<00:01:28.880> of

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
block of wood here for the tail end of

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.399 
block of wood here for the tail end of
it<00:01:29.119> down<00:01:29.270> here<00:01:29.329> and<00:01:29.659> then<00:01:29.720> I'll<00:01:29.869> run<00:01:30.020> I'll<00:01:30.079> run

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
it down here and then I'll run I'll run

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.580 
it down here and then I'll run I'll run
a<00:01:30.619> clamp<00:01:30.950> across<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.929> get<00:01:32.929> the<00:01:33.049> tail<00:01:33.259> end<00:01:33.500> of

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
a clamp across and get the tail end of

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.760 
a clamp across and get the tail end of
it<00:01:33.710> in<00:01:33.830> so<00:01:34.039> we'll<00:01:34.159> have<00:01:34.280> down<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:35.149> then<00:01:36.140> one<00:01:36.649> in

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
it in so we'll have down and then one in

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.410 
it in so we'll have down and then one in
the<00:01:36.860> back<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.520> also<00:01:38.360> I<00:01:38.840> also<00:01:39.530> put<00:01:39.860> a<00:01:39.890> clamp

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
the back and also I also put a clamp

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.510 
the back and also I also put a clamp
across<00:01:41.420> here<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:42.380> we<00:01:42.829> have<00:01:42.950> inward<00:01:43.340> pressure

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
across here so we have inward pressure

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.240 
across here so we have inward pressure
on<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.179> side<00:01:44.420> pockets<00:01:44.960> just<00:01:45.530> in<00:01:45.710> case<00:01:45.950> you

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
on the side pockets just in case you

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.130 
on the side pockets just in case you
know<00:01:46.369> there's<00:01:47.060> you<00:01:47.539> might<00:01:47.690> get<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:47.869> little<00:01:47.959> bit

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
know there's you might get a little bit

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.960 
know there's you might get a little bit
of<00:01:48.229> squeeze<00:01:48.530> out<00:01:48.679> but<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.429> got<00:01:49.549> downward

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
of squeeze out but so you got downward

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.359 
of squeeze out but so you got downward
pressure<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.509> inward<00:01:51.110> pressure<00:01:51.289> and<00:01:52.250> then<00:01:52.340> we

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
pressure and inward pressure and then we

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.210 
pressure and inward pressure and then we
let<00:01:52.610> that<00:01:52.729> dry<00:01:53.030> overnight<00:01:53.830> unclamp<00:01:54.830> it<00:01:55.039> and

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
let that dry overnight unclamp it and

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.520 
let that dry overnight unclamp it and
it's<00:01:55.819> ready<00:01:56.000> to<00:01:56.149> roll<00:01:56.420> for<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.750> next<00:01:56.990> next

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
it's ready to roll for the next next

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.469 
it's ready to roll for the next next
session<00:01:58.220> okay<00:01:58.729> we're<00:01:58.909> going<00:01:59.000> to<00:01:59.060> glue<00:01:59.240> this

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
session okay we're going to glue this

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.410 
session okay we're going to glue this

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:31.160 

kappa<00:03:23.239> carefully<00:03:24.239> here

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.620 

and<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.590> tricky<00:03:32.010> operation<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.910> think<00:03:33.510> what

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
it just has to drive for 24 hours we

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.930 
it just has to drive for 24 hours we
