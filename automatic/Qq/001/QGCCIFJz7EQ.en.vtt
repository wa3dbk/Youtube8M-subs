00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.180
 yahoo youtube user x120 and today again 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.340
 with an unboxing of a video card and 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.080
 Although the powercolor hd 7770 I have 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.820
 which bought from a mouth now 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.340
 probably as a replacement for 580 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.859
 First, because the lasting effect has 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.750
 I have black screen more and more often 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:27.890
 currently speaks of the black forest the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.480
 graphics card is overclocked to 1,150 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:36.270
 megahertz graphics chip build the faith 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:40.170
 me and 5 ghz save yes now 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:45.930
 already here is off in front of displays so can 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:49.770
 watch four screens here 15 15 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.960
 percent more stability overclocked the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.820
 cooler brings number twelve percent more 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.809
 performance as the original and it is 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.760
 also quieter then here also the here 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.300
 gigahertz edition and i will now 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.010
 just wrap up 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.820
 the question where do what you want you to do 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.450
 I complete the film 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.450
 is wrapped 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.970
 carton if the gentleman schmidt 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.729
 I just do not care 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:29.030
 not cut but not damaged 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:37.520
 Well, not so we described the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:39.380
 plastic foil away so already sees the 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.680
 water is a bit spicy and you 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.680
 do not pay attention 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:57.180
 old, the two knew for sure now 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:03.229
 okay because in the box is still a box 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:14.340
 now just hold the empty envelope still 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:20.220
 describe the box at the top 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.510
 The graphics card is important to static 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.290
 I'll do it now 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.290
 fast like that 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:51.599
 this is because the graphics card pci express 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:55.319
 it looks like that from behind 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:03:01.019
 let's see if he's still on tour yes 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:13.230
 namely a crossfire bridge as one 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:20.700
 the card is flexible so not the fixed one 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:25.500
 quite flexible then we have the 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:29.160
 driver cd always uses the latest 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.599
 from the driver side because yes I have 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.239
 on this you are usually kept white 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:43.889
 yes never how long in there 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:46.950
 stay because dvi so dvi to vga 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:52.370
 I thought that was good 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.370
 and once again the quick installation
