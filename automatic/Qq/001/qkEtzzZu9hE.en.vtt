00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.820
 briefly but take literally 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:12.480

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:45.700
 many do not need hercules hercules can 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.480

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:53.020
 smaller principle can be rolled oats too 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.620

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.870
 get more sticky for my 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:07.650
 tomorrow's fishing is not always 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:07.650

 here 5 cookies all as possible 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.280
 add vanilla sugar 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.970
 but at that reservoir where I will be tomorrow 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.260
 catch 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:38.470
 somehow vanilla carp is not very fond of and 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:41.190
 All this is thoroughly mixed and how I 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.190
 I said 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.000
 we will add and knead water 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:58.470
 prikormku to its final form already 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:01.890
 on the pond again as an option in 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:07.160
 As a flavoring, I still sometimes 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:12.480
 add something like dill 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:16.109
 dry sold in all stores too 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:20.420
 like seasoning or basil everything is possible 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.420
 depends on your imagination and on 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:27.590
 preferences of fish in the pond on which 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.590
 you will catch 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:41.720

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:03.020
 mix and generally recommend to everyone 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.940
 immediately prikormku 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:11.450
 do not mix if you make a mistake with water 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:16.820
 there is always the option to add dry 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:20.450
 prikormki or else very nice to have 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.490

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.820
 prikormku

 leave her soak in the water set up 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:48.100
 insist while she insists 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.100
 decompose gear talent 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:06:03.639
