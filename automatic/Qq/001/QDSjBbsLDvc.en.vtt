the<00:01:37.950> other<00:01:38.009> thing<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.520> company<00:01:38.759> never<00:01:39.119> did<00:01:39.299> is

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the other thing the company never did is

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.969 
the other thing the company never did is
they<00:01:39.450> never<00:01:39.540> put<00:01:39.810> center<00:01:40.110> hangs<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.680> so

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
they never put center hangs and so

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.810 
they never put center hangs and so
there's<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.640> one<00:01:41.850> hang

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
there's the one hang

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.980 
there's the one hang
and<00:01:43.910> there<00:01:44.090> there<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.540> go<00:01:44.570> there's<00:01:44.930> your

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
and there there you go there's your

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.880 
and there there you go there's your
other<00:01:45.170> hang<00:01:45.470> we<00:01:45.650> did<00:01:45.800> bet<00:01:46.370> on<00:01:46.610> that<00:01:46.820> side<00:01:47.890> and

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
other hang we did bet on that side and

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.180 
other hang we did bet on that side and
we<00:01:48.980> did<00:01:49.160> another<00:01:49.370> one<00:01:49.460> on<00:01:49.700> that<00:01:49.730> side<00:01:49.910> so

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
we did another one on that side so

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.700 
we did another one on that side so
obviously<00:01:52.190> hence<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.730> name<00:01:52.850> Center<00:01:53.240> hang

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
obviously hence the name Center hang

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.080 
obviously hence the name Center hang
it's<00:01:54.710> in<00:01:54.800> the<00:01:54.950> center<00:01:55.250> between<00:01:55.370> the<00:01:55.640> rear<00:01:55.910> and

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
it's in the center between the rear and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.440 
it's in the center between the rear and
