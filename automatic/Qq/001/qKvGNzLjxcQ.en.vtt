00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.589

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.800

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.710
 is this list of acts then we go 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.930

 Underwear also has to carry a 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.960
 jeans or long pants 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.390
 because this is something informal when you 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.910
 You left the street when he had 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.680

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.720
 a windbreak is fixed something and permear 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.870
 something that has them warm in case 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.090
 let it be cold and wind and rain and 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.920
 he wants to leave yes or yes he does not know 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.060
