00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
that's okay um alright so in this twenty

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.510 
that's okay um alright so in this twenty
gallon<00:00:51.559> we<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.800> four<00:00:53.219> baby<00:00:53.550> corn<00:00:53.789> snakes<00:00:55.520> um

gallon we have four baby corn snakes um

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:14.180 
gallon we have four baby corn snakes um
so<00:00:57.210> let's<00:00:57.449> just<00:00:57.660> think

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.600 

there<00:01:15.190> we<00:01:15.310> go

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
there we go

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.900 
there we go
all<00:01:16.120> right<00:01:16.240> so<00:01:16.800> pretty<00:01:17.800> basic<00:01:18.040> setup<00:01:18.580> you<00:01:18.880> have

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
all right so pretty basic setup you have

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.850 
all right so pretty basic setup you have
a<00:01:19.030> cave<00:01:19.360> this<00:01:19.570> is<00:01:19.630> pretty<00:01:19.990> big<00:01:20.229> compared<00:01:20.680> to<00:01:20.710> my

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
a cave this is pretty big compared to my

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.820 
a cave this is pretty big compared to my
hand<00:01:20.890> so<00:01:21.310> basically<00:01:22.150> they<00:01:22.360> usually<00:01:23.050> all<00:01:23.410> go<00:01:23.650> in

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
hand so basically they usually all go in

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.700 
hand so basically they usually all go in
here<00:01:24.010> together<00:01:24.160> we<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.869> a<00:01:25.960> water<00:01:26.200> dish<00:01:26.410> over

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
here together we have a water dish over

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.820 
here together we have a water dish over
there<00:01:26.760> -<00:01:27.760> yep<00:01:27.970> -<00:01:28.000> in<00:01:28.330> here<00:01:28.570> just<00:01:29.320> because<00:01:29.710> we

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
there - yep - in here just because we

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.950 
there - yep - in here just because we
have<00:01:29.950> four<00:01:30.190> corn<00:01:30.400> snakes<00:01:30.670> in<00:01:30.820> here<00:01:30.970> oh<00:01:31.180> and

have four corn snakes in here oh and

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.780 
have four corn snakes in here oh and
then<00:01:32.320> another<00:01:32.560> little<00:01:32.800> log<00:01:33.160> key<00:01:33.369> over<00:01:33.610> there<00:01:33.760> a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
then another little log key over there a

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.120 
then another little log key over there a
couple<00:01:33.880> of<00:01:34.180> them<00:01:34.300> hide<00:01:34.479> there<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.920> then<00:01:36.010> this

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
couple of them hide there and then this

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.770 
couple of them hide there and then this
branch<00:01:36.520> where<00:01:36.760> they<00:01:36.850> can<00:01:37.030> shed<00:01:37.330> on<00:01:37.510> and<00:01:37.660> also

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
branch where they can shed on and also

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.560 
branch where they can shed on and also
they<00:01:38.050> like<00:01:38.200> to<00:01:38.320> climb<00:01:38.440> up<00:01:39.180> all<00:01:40.180> right<00:01:40.330> so<00:01:40.360> let's

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
they like to climb up all right so let's

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.469 
they like to climb up all right so let's
get<00:01:40.660> started<00:01:40.930> so<00:01:41.080> as<00:01:41.860> I<00:01:42.550> out<00:01:42.850> actually<00:01:43.360> they're

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
get started so as I out actually they're

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.109 
get started so as I out actually they're
all<00:01:43.509> here<00:01:44.910> okay<00:01:45.910> so<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:48.670> is<00:01:48.850> just<00:01:48.970> an

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
all here okay so this is just an

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.850 
all here okay so this is just an
overview<00:01:49.300> of<00:01:49.660> them<00:01:52.410> and<00:01:53.410> we're<00:01:53.590> going<00:01:53.830> to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
overview of them and we're going to

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.480 
overview of them and we're going to
eventually<00:01:54.009> so<00:01:54.490> all<00:01:54.610> we<00:01:54.759> have<00:01:54.940> here<00:01:55.240> is<00:01:56.490> this

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
eventually so all we have here is this

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.499 
eventually so all we have here is this
one<00:01:57.729> over<00:01:57.940> here<00:01:58.210> is<00:01:58.360> a<00:01:58.420> ghost<00:01:59.430> Henry<00:02:00.430> this<00:02:01.240> guy

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
one over here is a ghost Henry this guy

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.310 
one over here is a ghost Henry this guy
over<00:02:01.630> here<00:02:01.750> is<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.170> new<00:02:03.009> head<00:02:03.369> ghost<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:04.320> then

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
over here is a new head ghost and then

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.230 
over here is a new head ghost and then
the<00:02:05.440> other<00:02:05.560> two<00:02:05.800> are<00:02:05.920> both<00:02:06.100> normals<00:02:06.670> so<00:02:07.090> the

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
the other two are both normals so the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.510 
the other two are both normals so the
annual<00:02:07.420> hat<00:02:07.720> goes<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.320> ghost<00:02:09.100> at<00:02:09.280> Amy

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
annual hat goes and the ghost at Amy

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.289 
annual hat goes and the ghost at Amy
will<00:02:09.700> be<00:02:09.789> breeding<00:02:10.119> soon<00:02:10.539> Oh<00:02:11.910> three<00:02:12.910> years<00:02:13.120> I

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
will be breeding soon Oh three years I

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.690 
will be breeding soon Oh three years I
guess<00:02:13.510> all<00:02:13.959> right<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:14.290> let's<00:02:14.470> just<00:02:14.560> go<00:02:15.400> take<00:02:15.580> em

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700
