00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.190
 Johanna is usually served with bread 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.470
 but i do that because i enter 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.270
 Raw food recipe wanted to make with flakes 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.250
 I have already pronounced several times 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.439
 made guests all reserved 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.660
 excited 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.669
 for the dry before mixing I take 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.689
 50 grams of barley naked are three 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:34.320
 spoon in 45 grams of olive oil and 35 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.350
 gram of lemon juice and indeed flake me 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.940
 the barley I have already with that 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.140
 yellow white I'll do that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.430
 soon to make thicker 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.370
 that does not make the big one 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.980
 difference and the olive oil and 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.449
 I add lemon juice and leave that 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.640
 until I finish the other things 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.340
 then torment a bit 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.690
 the flakes have already been noticed 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.430
 although I already have a few 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.379
 hours ago always preparer than me 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.260
 do that in the morning and when guests come 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.329
 is there then at noon then I paint 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.660
 the spices and a teaspoon 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.060
 cumin and one to two teaspoons 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.510
 pomegranate grains dried who now 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.880
 No pomegranate grains can do that 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.460
 also leave out that is not so important 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.030
 as well as giving you something special one 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.980
 May increase to the lemon quantity 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.490
 pomegranate grains are available in asia 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.490
 shops 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:35.160
 and now we will hack the nuts 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.070
 and so is a so-called 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.720
 Food processor is very good the court 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.400
 usually with walnuts I made 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.560
 do that with pk I have to find that 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.660
 taste something pleasant for the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.290
 sweet note they are not so strict 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.760
 who has no cars now or the indiscriminate 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.610
 may of course like taste 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.040
 just as well perceive 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.530
 I do not pick these pk nuts now 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.910
 Do not fall too rude if we are lucky 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.979
 they are really hacked and too 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.820
 not meant that not always at the 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.080
 quality of the food processor and the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.520
 I can now separate nuts 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:14.820
 keep or already to the 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:17.880
 give fleets and with that I have the 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.130
 dry ingredients so far finished and 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.660
 come to the vegetables that also with the 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.120
 same food processor processes this 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.250
 I only do one machine 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.900
 dirty and maybe you can 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.390
 with other devices I find the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.670
 but very suitable first 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.160
 namely a red paprika pretty 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.980
 big, that is gutted then 205 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.459
 gram a medium sized tomato like 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.950
 I 90 grams two larger garlic cloves 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.130
 the bilberries peeled 9 grams a teaspoon 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.489
 salt 1 teaspoon of honey or vegan lives 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.290
 should then take one 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.170
 six grams of vinegar hot pepper that is 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.670
 chopped peppers in vinegar for some time 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.110
 are stored in pieces 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.180
 You can also chili powder 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:08.459
 if you do not have one and take one 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:10.140
 teaspoon paprika powder sweet man 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.790
 cut the things best 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.549
 you get them in the five processes 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.610
 because that can happen to us 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.230
 What the biggest pieces about staying there 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.930
 I'm a bit rough here now 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.070
 Of course, make the cloves of garlic 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.260
 what am i doing with the 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.579
 make vita mix pestos or something 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.959
 meanwhile do not do any more because 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.940
 the really broken everything but bad 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.140
 That's not what a hat process does 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.989
 You have to be careful that you can not 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.730
 There is a lot of liquid wine there you have to 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.800
 even after watching that 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.220
 not too fine 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.470
 I will now give art in this case 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.750
 her spices to it can be also the 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.890
 spices already to this nut flake me 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.390
 I've already done that 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.670
 That really does not end in taste 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.680
 in which order this is done 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.650
 but it should be better here 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.050
 because that is then mixed nicely 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.840
 and also the paprika powder is by the way 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.000
 in addition to the color also a bit 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.030
 Taste is good for two purposes 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.890
 the garlic clove does not recommend it before 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.430
 to cut and the others of course 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.710
 and for me in my kitchen is yes 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.140
 meanwhile irreplaceable this vinegar 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:19.160
 Pepperoni I buy such a swing 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.359
 pepper and put the in vinegar one 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.110
 cut and there I need 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.610
 Almost every day what was 1 teaspoon of honey 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.190
 is also important that gives again so 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.750
 It will not be a bit sweet 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.060
 I like to try without me 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.670
 think that's important in this case 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.470
 are that so two pieces I have that way 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.640
 in one to one and a half centimeters in length 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:45.620
 I have already cut that too 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:48.380
 put on in the film 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.700
 lids and essentially i have the 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.000
 important steps have already been taken 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.680
 here is so vegetables rattled 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.830
 it looks more soupy here than it is in the 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.050
 end effect is now I have to do it all 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.000
 I just mix with each other 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.919
 already done and then a bit 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.270
 Decorate nicely to mix I give 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.500
 the whole in a little bigger 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.280
 key as I afterwards to serve 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.510
 I often also make in the 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.940
 key in which I mix because I 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.800
 do not want to use so much dishes 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.210
 Here take up the hand to wipe out 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.860
 the hand is the best athlete 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.410
 I always find myself stuck 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.270
 and since I assume that all mine 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.720
 Readers also have acid on the cook 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.550
 I think that's completely okay this time 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.800
 managed the bowl big enough too 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.240
 take to interrogate in the hot you my 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.150
 Number too small it falters because it over 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.260
 no, this time it did and 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.870
 Now the question is always being decorated 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:45.169
 It fits very well with it a bit 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.220
 Mint is also in this 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.410
 original recipe not whether the different 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.150
 previously viewed and read always 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.690
 recommended i still had dried 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.340
 mint in the house and very nice too 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:00.750
 decided in this case namely to 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:02.760
 beans did not sprout long private 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.640
 find sprouts and burst out 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.990
 health but also taste 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.730
 and then I was straight at the time 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.230
 the cracker made that comes sometime 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.910
 also in the movie and that's nice then 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.980
 if you can do that too 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.320
 But it really does not have to be 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.280
 the great act as a foreplay and that 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.380
 is very filling 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.000
 who is that for a board 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.000
 prepared the really good appetite
