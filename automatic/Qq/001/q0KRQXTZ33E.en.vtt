is to complete the dungeon as fast as
possible<00:00:15.240> it's<00:00:15.869> a<00:00:15.930> race<00:00:16.139> challenge<00:00:16.830> mode

the<00:00:35.790> bosses<00:00:35.970> the<00:00:36.510> next<00:00:36.780> thing<00:00:36.870> for<00:00:37.080> you<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.170> do

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
the bosses the next thing for you to do

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.650 
the bosses the next thing for you to do
really<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.250> figure<00:00:38.640> out<00:00:38.760> how<00:00:39.240> quick<00:00:39.510> can

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
really is to figure out how quick can

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.970 
really is to figure out how quick can
you<00:00:39.720> do<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.990> tension<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.320> think<00:00:40.530> most<00:00:40.770> players

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
you do the tension I think most players

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.260 
you do the tension I think most players
feel<00:00:41.280> like<00:00:41.430> that's<00:00:41.640> what<00:00:41.700> kind<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.000> happens

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
feel like that's what kind of happens

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.540 
feel like that's what kind of happens
inherently<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:43.470> decide<00:00:43.770> oh<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.040> want<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.400> do

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
inherently they decide oh I want to do

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.800 
inherently they decide oh I want to do
however<00:00:44.790> many<00:00:45.000> vengeance<00:00:45.390> tonight<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
however many vengeance tonight the

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.750 
however many vengeance tonight the
faster<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.290> do<00:00:46.350> them<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.800> more<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.220> get<00:00:47.400> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
faster I do them the more I can get and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.460 
faster I do them the more I can get and
so<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:47.940> use<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.390> an<00:00:48.510> inspiration<00:00:49.140> you

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
so we use that as an inspiration you

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.110 
so we use that as an inspiration you
know<00:00:49.560> we<00:00:49.770> really<00:00:49.800> realize<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.400> it<00:00:50.880> can<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.090> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
know we really realize that it can be a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.340 
know we really realize that it can be a
lot<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.330> fun<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.750> have<00:00:51.870> time<00:00:52.080> pressure

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
lot of fun to have time pressure

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.410 
lot of fun to have time pressure
something<00:00:52.740> that<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.920> ordinarily<00:00:53.430> do<00:00:53.760> right

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
something that you ordinarily do right

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.120 
something that you ordinarily do right
like<00:00:54.630> going<00:00:55.050> through<00:00:55.080> a<00:00:55.230> dungeon<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.890> can

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
like going through a dungeon it can

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.310 
like going through a dungeon it can
completely<00:00:56.430> transform<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.330> experience<00:00:57.900> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
completely transform the experience to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.710 
completely transform the experience to
have<00:00:58.860> time<00:00:59.490> pressure<00:00:59.760> associated<00:01:00.090> with<00:01:00.600> it

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
have time pressure associated with it

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.060 
have time pressure associated with it

where you've got now you've got to do in
a<00:01:02.160> hurry<00:01:02.310> you<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.790> beat<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> dungeon<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.810> her

have to let kill the boss we have to

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.899 
have to let kill the boss we have to
find<00:01:28.140> neat<00:01:28.409> ways<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:29.069> creating<00:01:29.460> efficiencies

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
find neat ways of creating efficiencies

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.239 
find neat ways of creating efficiencies
as<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.689> play<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:31.079> game<00:01:31.109> you<00:01:31.530> won't<00:01:32.039> get<00:01:32.130> loot

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:32.249 
as we play the game you won't get loot

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:33.410 
as we play the game you won't get loot
from<00:01:32.369> down<00:01:32.579> challenge<00:01:32.850> posed<00:01:33.090> there's<00:01:33.299> no

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
from down challenge posed there's no

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.639 
from down challenge posed there's no
stopping<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:33.960> loot<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.259> there's<00:01:34.439> none<00:01:34.560> of

is<00:02:10.009> that<00:02:10.310> they're<00:02:10.490> based<00:02:10.670> on<00:02:10.850> skill<00:02:11.150> they're

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
is that they're based on skill they're

is that they're based on skill they're
not<00:02:12.020> based<00:02:12.320> on<00:02:12.500> item<00:02:12.950> progression<00:02:13.370> that<00:02:13.490> you

not based on item progression that you

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.100 
not based on item progression that you
might<00:02:13.790> have<00:02:13.820> done<00:02:14.030> up<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:14.570> point<00:02:14.780> so

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
might have done up to this point so

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.440 
might have done up to this point so
because<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.130> we're<00:02:16.700> normalizing<00:02:17.420> the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
because of that we're normalizing the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.210 
because of that we're normalizing the
gear<00:02:17.750> across<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.260> board<00:02:18.530> what<00:02:19.100> that

gear across the board what that

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.830 
gear across the board what that
essentially<00:02:19.550> means<00:02:19.700> is<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.239> when<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:20.600> enter

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840
