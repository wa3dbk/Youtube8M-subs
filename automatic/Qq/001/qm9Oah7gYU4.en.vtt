playing with some cutouts
from<00:00:05.549> when<00:00:05.910> I<00:00:05.940> was<00:00:06.120> stenciling<00:00:06.600> with<00:00:06.750> that

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
from when I was stenciling with that

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.140 
from when I was stenciling with that
alphabet<00:00:07.379> there<00:00:07.589> these<00:00:08.280> are<00:00:08.460> my<00:00:08.580> left<00:00:08.849> or<00:00:09.030> was

alphabet there these are my left or was
my<00:00:09.300> remnants<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:09.990> were<00:00:10.200> from<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.469> page<00:00:10.769> where

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
my remnants that were from a page where

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.850 
my remnants that were from a page where
I<00:00:11.460> had<00:00:11.790> asked<00:00:12.210> my<00:00:12.360> muse<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:13.049> send<00:00:13.320> me<00:00:13.440> an<00:00:13.530> idea

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
I had asked my muse to send me an idea

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.980 
I had asked my muse to send me an idea
because<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.340> just<00:00:14.700> didn't<00:00:15.210> feel<00:00:15.330> like<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.660> had<00:00:15.870> an

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
because I just didn't feel like I had an

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.820 
because I just didn't feel like I had an
idea<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.770> lo<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.789> behold<00:00:17.880> she<00:00:18.330> did<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.230> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
idea and lo and behold she did and the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.010 
idea and lo and behold she did and the
idea<00:00:20.130> was<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.369> use<00:00:20.640> up<00:00:20.789> these<00:00:20.939> scraps<00:00:21.330> great

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
idea was to use up these scraps great

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.050 
idea was to use up these scraps great
shapes<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.710> never<00:00:23.130> could<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.490> planned<00:00:23.760> this

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
shapes I never could have planned this

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.630 
shapes I never could have planned this
it's<00:00:24.359> just<00:00:24.449> very<00:00:25.019> random<00:00:25.590> feeling<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.369> very

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
it's just very random feeling to it very

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.570 
it's just very random feeling to it very
loose<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:28.109> that's<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.830> idea<00:00:29.099> I'm<00:00:29.310> going

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
loose and so that's the idea I'm going

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.820 
loose and so that's the idea I'm going
with<00:00:29.820> here<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.300> am<00:00:30.810> gluing<00:00:31.199> these<00:00:31.560> down<00:00:31.800> with

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
with here I am gluing these down with

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.220 
with here I am gluing these down with
gel<00:00:32.369> medium<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.300> tell<00:00:33.510> I'm<00:00:33.719> not<00:00:33.750> being

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
gel medium as you can tell I'm not being

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.670 
gel medium as you can tell I'm not being
very<00:00:34.469> careful<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.980> all<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:36.110> and<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.530> did

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
very careful at all with this and I did

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.130 
very careful at all with this and I did
want<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.920> use<00:00:38.070> up<00:00:38.250> every<00:00:38.760> last<00:00:39.149> little<00:00:39.719> bit<00:00:40.110> of

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.080 
want to use up every last little bit of
the<00:00:40.410> letters<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:41.190> way<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.460> could<00:00:41.790> feel<00:00:42.030> like

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
the letters that way I could feel like

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.209

I've<00:00:42.360> used<00:00:42.629> them<00:00:42.780> all<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:43.649> they<00:00:43.800> did<00:00:43.980> not

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
I've used them all but they did not

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.090 
I've used them all but they did not
belong<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.969> art<00:00:45.180> journal<00:00:45.510> page<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.530> what

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
and without thinking I just kind of

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.709 
and without thinking I just kind of
slapped<00:00:52.440> him<00:00:52.710> down<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.100> places<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.210> nice<00:00:54.420> part

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
slapped him down in places the nice part

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.110 
slapped him down in places the nice part
is<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.170> before<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> gel<00:00:55.890> medium<00:00:56.010> dries<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.820> can

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
is is before the gel medium dries I can

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.490 
is is before the gel medium dries I can
just<00:00:57.239> pick<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.449> up<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.809> move<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.320> where<00:00:58.469> I

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
just pick it up and move it to where I

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.029 
just pick it up and move it to where I
like<00:00:58.770> it

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
like it

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.490 
like it
this<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.910> about<00:01:00.149> not<00:01:00.449> thinking<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.260> about

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
this is about not thinking this is about

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.049 
this is about not thinking this is about
just<00:01:01.770> kind<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.949> getting<00:01:02.370> some<00:01:02.550> stuff<00:01:02.820> down

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
this lend up being the background on a

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.710 
this lend up being the background on a
tag<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.640> future<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.299> I've<00:01:06.510> actually

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
tag in the future and I've actually

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.840 
tag in the future and I've actually
cleaned<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.470> all<00:01:07.680> my<00:01:08.070> scraps<00:01:08.369> here<00:01:08.640> and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
cleaned up all my scraps here and

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.140 
cleaned up all my scraps here and
started<00:01:09.630> something<00:01:09.840> else<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.880> was<00:01:11.880> just

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
started something else I was just

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.880 
started something else I was just
thinking<00:01:12.570> about<00:01:12.659> things<00:01:13.080> too<00:01:13.320> much<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.860> I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
thinking about things too much so I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.100 
thinking about things too much so I
decided<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.549> go<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:15.090> whatever<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.479> had<00:01:15.780> around

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
decided to go with whatever I had around

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.260 
decided to go with whatever I had around
and<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.860> had<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.250> stencil<00:01:17.549> called<00:01:18.030> diamond

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and I had this stencil called diamond

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.420 
and I had this stencil called diamond
waves<00:01:18.720> already<00:01:19.049> out<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.530> counter<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.400> I

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
waves already out on the counter so I

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.760 
waves already out on the counter so I
decided<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.970> use<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.210> had<00:01:22.080> some<00:01:22.320> other<00:01:22.470> tubes

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
decided to use that had some other tubes

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.469 
decided to use that had some other tubes
of<00:01:22.920> paint<00:01:22.950> out<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.850> decided<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.390> use

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
of paint out so I just decided to use

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.170 
of paint out so I just decided to use
those<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.590> I'm<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:25.920> kind<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.310> way<00:01:26.729> too<00:01:26.790> much

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
those but I'm just kind of way too much

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.780 
those but I'm just kind of way too much
in<00:01:27.390> my<00:01:27.509> head<00:01:27.750> at<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.110> point<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:29.009> you'll<00:01:29.549> see

the<00:01:38.250> paintbrush<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:39.090> case<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.780> weren't<00:01:39.960> sure

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
the paintbrush in case you weren't sure

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.730 
the paintbrush in case you weren't sure
that<00:01:40.500> end<00:01:41.159> does<00:01:41.369> not<00:01:41.400> work<00:01:41.939> really<00:01:42.360> well<00:01:42.740> when

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
that end does not work really well when

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.289 
that end does not work really well when
it<00:01:43.890> comes<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.159> painting<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.729> brush<00:01:44.939> end<00:01:45.180> is

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
it comes to painting the brush end is

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.590 
it comes to painting the brush end is
really<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> lot<00:01:46.110> more<00:01:46.320> effective<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:47.820> anyway<00:01:48.329> I

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
really a lot more effective so anyway I

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.990 
really a lot more effective so anyway I
am<00:01:49.110> still<00:01:49.439> way<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:49.950> my<00:01:50.130> head<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.700> I'm<00:01:50.939> just

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
am still way in my head and I'm just

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.990 
am still way in my head and I'm just
stenciling<00:01:51.780> along<00:01:52.140> with<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.619> I'm<00:01:53.520> not<00:01:53.579> being

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
stenciling along with this I'm not being

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.550 
stenciling along with this I'm not being
very<00:01:54.240> careful<00:01:54.509> about<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.140> notice<00:01:55.380> I'm

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
very careful about it notice I'm

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.620 
very careful about it notice I'm
smooshing<00:01:56.009> side<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.460> side<00:01:56.700> when<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.090> probably

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
smooshing side to side when I probably

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.840 
smooshing side to side when I probably
should<00:01:57.930> be<00:01:58.020> bouncing<00:01:58.500> up<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.740> down<00:01:58.950> but<00:01:59.759> you

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
should be bouncing up and down but you

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.760 
should be bouncing up and down but you
know<00:01:59.969> what<00:02:00.210> I'm<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:00.960> feeling<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.380> doing

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
that pattern it's gonna leave a little

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.910 
that pattern it's gonna leave a little
color<00:02:39.000> remnant<00:02:39.540> here<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:39.870> there<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.290> you

color remnant here and there and you
know<00:02:41.070> what<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:41.760> gonna<00:02:42.030> work<00:02:42.270> out<00:02:42.480> in<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.720> end

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
know what it's gonna work out in the end

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.190 
know what it's gonna work out in the end
okay<00:02:43.350> but<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.830> knew<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.870> wasn't<00:02:45.870> what<00:02:46.170> I

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
okay but I knew that wasn't what I

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.640 
okay but I knew that wasn't what I
wanted<00:02:46.470> there<00:02:47.930> well<00:02:48.930> when<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.170> turned<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
wanted there well when I turned the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.160 
wanted there well when I turned the
stencil<00:02:50.130> on<00:02:50.280> its<00:02:50.610> side<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:50.910> used<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.690> this<00:02:51.870> way

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
stencil on its side and used it this way

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.820 
stencil on its side and used it this way
all<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:53.190> sudden<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.790> felt<00:02:54.180> right<00:02:54.680> now<00:02:55.680> it

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
all of a sudden it felt right now it

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.260 
all of a sudden it felt right now it
doesn't<00:02:56.160> mean<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.550> like<00:02:56.850> everything

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
doesn't mean that I like everything

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.780 
doesn't mean that I like everything
about<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:58.020> it's<00:02:58.140> perfect<00:02:58.709> but<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.220> feels

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
about it that it's perfect but it feels

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.210 
about it that it's perfect but it feels
right<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.450> I'm<00:03:00.660> gonna<00:03:00.900> trust<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.500> instinct

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
right and I'm gonna trust that instinct

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.760 
right and I'm gonna trust that instinct
that<00:03:02.670> inner<00:03:02.970> voice<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.360> muse<00:03:04.110> wherever<00:03:04.590> it's

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
that inner voice the muse wherever it's

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.310 
that inner voice the muse wherever it's
coming<00:03:05.010> from<00:03:05.280> if<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.760> feels<00:03:06.060> right<00:03:06.420> I'm<00:03:06.959> gonna

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
coming from if it feels right I'm gonna

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.100 
coming from if it feels right I'm gonna
keep<00:03:07.530> going<00:03:07.830> with<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.780> when<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.810> start

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
keep going with it and when I start

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.660 
keep going with it and when I start
listening<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.590> those<00:03:10.800> instincts<00:03:11.430> when<00:03:11.580> I

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
listening to those instincts when I

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.510 
listening to those instincts when I
start<00:03:11.970> following<00:03:12.380> those<00:03:13.380> it's<00:03:14.160> not<00:03:14.310> really

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
start following those it's not really

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.100 
start following those it's not really
thoughts<00:03:14.850> in<00:03:15.060> my<00:03:15.180> head<00:03:15.390> because<00:03:15.780> those<00:03:15.959> are

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
thoughts in my head because those are

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.690 
thoughts in my head because those are
the<00:03:16.200> kind<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.590> sort<00:03:16.800> of<00:03:16.860> locked<00:03:17.340> me<00:03:17.580> in

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
the kind that sort of locked me in

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.490 
the kind that sort of locked me in
decisions<00:03:18.239> but<00:03:18.840> when<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.019> follow<00:03:19.320> that

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
decisions but when I follow that

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.350 
decisions but when I follow that
instinct<00:03:20.040> all<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.430> sudden<00:03:20.850> this<00:03:21.090> just

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
instinct all of a sudden this just

I got for like a dollar I think at
Target<00:04:59.430> awhile<00:04:59.699> back<00:04:59.940> I<00:05:00.180> love<00:05:00.449> the<00:05:00.630> pattern<00:05:00.870> on

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
Target awhile back I love the pattern on

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.469 
Target awhile back I love the pattern on
it<00:05:01.289> so<00:05:01.440> I<00:05:01.470> just<00:05:01.560> had<00:05:01.860> to<00:05:01.979> scoop<00:05:02.190> that<00:05:02.370> up<00:05:02.479> doing

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
it so I just had to scoop that up doing

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:04.760 
it so I just had to scoop that up doing
some<00:05:03.630> scribble<00:05:03.930> journaling<00:05:04.320> on<00:05:04.470> it<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:04.680> then

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
some scribble journaling on it and then

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.960 
some scribble journaling on it and then
I'm<00:05:04.860> gonna<00:05:04.949> put<00:05:05.190> it<00:05:05.310> right<00:05:05.340> over<00:05:05.729> the<00:05:05.820> washi

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970

definition<00:05:26.820> Stabila<00:05:27.660> is<00:05:27.810> great<00:05:28.020> cuz<00:05:28.229> it<00:05:28.349> will

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
definition Stabila is great cuz it will

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.990 
definition Stabila is great cuz it will
write<00:05:28.680> over<00:05:29.160> anything

write over anything
so<00:05:30.300> all<00:05:30.449> that<00:05:30.570> texture<00:05:31.080> that<00:05:31.199> I've<00:05:31.320> got<00:05:31.530> there

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
so all that texture that I've got there

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.219 
so all that texture that I've got there
be<00:05:32.669> at<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:32.880> paint<00:05:33.150> the<00:05:33.389> gel<00:05:33.599> medium<00:05:33.780> the

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
be at the paint the gel medium the

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.950 
be at the paint the gel medium the
cardstock<00:05:34.550> it'll<00:05:35.550> work<00:05:35.789> over<00:05:36.150> that<00:05:36.180> I'm<00:05:36.810> gonna

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960

cardstock it'll work over that I'm gonna
give<00:05:37.169> her<00:05:37.260> some<00:05:37.320> lines<00:05:37.680> and<00:05:37.919> if<00:05:38.190> I<00:05:38.310> go<00:05:38.490> a<00:05:38.520> little

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
give her some lines and if I go a little

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.700 
give her some lines and if I go a little
too<00:05:39.000> far<00:05:39.240> I<00:05:39.300> can<00:05:39.599> just<00:05:39.750> add<00:05:39.960> some<00:05:40.229> water<00:05:40.440> and

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
too far I can just add some water and

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.860 
too far I can just add some water and
clean<00:05:41.010> it<00:05:41.159> right<00:05:41.340> up<00:05:41.400> and<00:05:41.820> it<00:05:42.479> was<00:05:42.570> at<00:05:42.659> this

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
clean it right up and it was at this

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.960 
clean it right up and it was at this
point<00:05:43.199> that<00:05:43.349> I<00:05:43.409> was<00:05:43.560> so<00:05:43.889> glad<00:05:44.220> that<00:05:44.250> I<00:05:44.580> turned

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
point that I was so glad that I turned

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.969 
point that I was so glad that I turned
the<00:05:45.120> diamond<00:05:45.539> wave<00:05:45.690> stencil<00:05:46.349> because

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
the diamond wave stencil because

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.430 
the diamond wave stencil because
everything<00:05:47.849> looks<00:05:48.060> like<00:05:48.330> it's<00:05:48.539> going<00:05:48.870> up<00:05:49.050> so

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
everything looks like it's going up so

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.680 
everything looks like it's going up so
I've<00:05:49.590> got<00:05:49.800> the<00:05:50.370> pattern<00:05:50.669> kind<00:05:51.060> of<00:05:51.150> moving<00:05:51.389> in<00:05:51.599> a

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
I've got the pattern kind of moving in a

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.480 
I've got the pattern kind of moving in a
vertical<00:05:51.930> way<00:05:52.080> I've<00:05:52.260> got<00:05:52.470> her<00:05:52.680> arms<00:05:53.010> way<00:05:53.220> up<00:05:53.250> in

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
vertical way I've got her arms way up in

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.120 
vertical way I've got her arms way up in
the<00:05:53.580> air<00:05:54.020> when<00:05:55.020> I<00:05:55.050> started<00:05:55.500> this<00:05:55.620> I<00:05:55.800> didn't

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
the air when I started this I didn't

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.159 
the air when I started this I didn't
have<00:05:56.220> a<00:05:56.280> plan<00:05:56.550> but<00:05:56.970> apparently<00:05:57.389> my<00:05:57.570> muse<00:05:57.870> did

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169

gonna<00:06:00.419> fit<00:06:00.659> with<00:06:00.840> the<00:06:00.930> plan<00:06:01.169> and<00:06:01.380> she<00:06:01.590> told<00:06:01.800> me

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.550 
gonna fit with the plan and she told me
no<00:06:02.009> don't<00:06:02.580> do<00:06:02.729> that<00:06:02.940> I'm<00:06:03.659> really<00:06:04.080> glad<00:06:04.199> that<00:06:04.320> I
