ever<00:01:40.140> looks<00:01:40.470> around<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.890> corner<00:01:41.189> because

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
ever looks around this corner because

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.789 
ever looks around this corner because

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
potentially being over here here maybe

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.100 
potentially being over here here maybe
here<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.820> part<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.180> great<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.659> unload

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
and you just get clean headshots now

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.499 
and you just get clean headshots now
another<00:01:52.110> fun<00:01:52.439> little<00:01:52.619> spot<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.220> over<00:01:53.610> here<00:01:53.909> you

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
another fun little spot is over here you

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.230 
another fun little spot is over here you
can<00:01:54.659> watch<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.990> construction<00:01:55.530> site<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.240> if

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
can watch the construction site and if

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.630 
can watch the construction site and if
you<00:01:57.329> pay<00:01:57.479> attention<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.829> these<00:01:59.070> cracks<00:01:59.399> in

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
you pay attention to to these cracks in

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.359 
you pay attention to to these cracks in
these<00:01:59.880> pipes<00:02:00.360> here<00:02:00.600> whatever<00:02:00.930> disease<00:02:01.350> if<00:02:01.710> you

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
these pipes here whatever disease if you

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.039 
these pipes here whatever disease if you
can't<00:02:02.610> hit<00:02:02.790> sort<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.149> here<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.509> enemy<00:02:03.780> may<00:02:03.930> be

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
can't hit sort of here the enemy may be

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.450 
can't hit sort of here the enemy may be
there<00:02:04.200> barking<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.770> can<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:05.130> look<00:02:05.280> through

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
there barking you can just look through

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.160 
there barking you can just look through
these<00:02:05.610> cracks<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.180> go<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.509> town<00:02:06.810> when<00:02:07.049> they

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
these cracks and go to town when they

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.430 
these cracks and go to town when they
come<00:02:07.320> around<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:08.580> keep<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.060> mind<00:02:09.379> these<00:02:10.379> are

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
come around so keep in mind these are

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.860 
come around so keep in mind these are
unorthodox<00:02:11.400> positions<00:02:12.239> for<00:02:12.420> defend

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
unorthodox positions for defend

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.809 
unorthodox positions for defend
they<00:02:13.379> can<00:02:13.680> give<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.220> advantage<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
they can give you the advantage on the

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.850 
they can give you the advantage on the
enemy<00:02:15.269> because<00:02:15.659> it<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.930> not<00:02:16.170> an<00:02:16.349> expected

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
enemy because it is not an expected

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.100 
enemy because it is not an expected
position<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.269> also<00:02:18.540> means<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.989> have

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
position but that also means you have

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.320 
position but that also means you have
not<00:02:19.140> covering<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:20.159> expected<00:02:20.670> positions<00:02:21.150> for

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
not covering the expected positions for

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.330 
not covering the expected positions for
your<00:02:21.480> theme<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.530> have<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.860> coordinate

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
your theme so you have to coordinate

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.949 
your theme so you have to coordinate
with<00:02:23.400> your<00:02:23.580> teammates<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.599> they<00:02:24.750> know

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
with your teammates so that they know

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.869 
with your teammates so that they know
what<00:02:25.200> skill<00:02:25.409> is<00:02:25.530> taking<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.459> they<00:02:26.640> know

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
what skill is taking so that they know

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.720 
what skill is taking so that they know
that<00:02:27.060> you're<00:02:27.269> in<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.569> weird<00:02:27.720> spot<00:02:28.110> now<00:02:29.069> over

here once again I recommend the best

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.229 
here once again I recommend the best
firing<00:02:49.260> gun<00:02:49.470> because<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.430> just<00:02:50.579> wanna<00:02:50.760> unload

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
firing gun because you just wanna unload

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.599 
firing gun because you just wanna unload
not<00:02:51.540> necessarily<00:02:52.260> go<00:02:52.620> for<00:02:52.859> clean<00:02:53.099> headshots

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
not necessarily go for clean headshots

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.140 
not necessarily go for clean headshots
so<00:02:54.650> another<00:02:55.650> good<00:02:55.920> spot<00:02:56.160> is<00:02:56.340> over<00:02:56.609> here<00:02:56.849> this

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
so another good spot is over here this

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.000 
so another good spot is over here this
is<00:02:57.269> my<00:02:57.450> favorite<00:02:57.690> spot<00:02:58.079> in<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.290> world<00:02:58.620> because

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
is my favorite spot in the world because

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.470 
is my favorite spot in the world because
you<00:02:59.280> have<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.459> split<00:02:59.670> your<00:02:59.819> attention<00:03:00.299> left

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
you have to split your attention left

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.849 
you have to split your attention left
and<00:03:00.659> right<00:03:00.870> because<00:03:01.109> they<00:03:01.409> can<00:03:01.560> come<00:03:01.709> from

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
and right because they can come from

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.240 
and right because they can come from
both<00:03:02.010> ways<00:03:02.690> but<00:03:03.690> if<00:03:04.079> you're<00:03:04.319> all<00:03:04.560> alone<00:03:04.859> and

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
both ways but if you're all alone and

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.920 
both ways but if you're all alone and
you're<00:03:05.730> sort<00:03:05.909> of<00:03:06.090> boxed<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.629> and<00:03:06.750> they're

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930

because<00:04:02.010> when<00:04:02.400> you're<00:04:02.549> coming<00:04:02.819> around<00:04:03.000> this

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
because when you're coming around this

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.150 
because when you're coming around this
corner<00:04:03.349> chances<00:04:04.349> are<00:04:04.470> you're<00:04:04.620> probably<00:04:04.859> going

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
corner chances are you're probably going

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.309 
corner chances are you're probably going
to<00:04:05.250> see<00:04:05.549> this<00:04:05.849> area<00:04:06.239> first<00:04:06.540> as<00:04:06.810> opposed<00:04:07.230> to

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
to see this area first as opposed to

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.349 
to see this area first as opposed to
this<00:04:07.530> one<00:04:07.769> now<00:04:08.310> this<00:04:08.489> can<00:04:08.699> be<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:08.819> tiny<00:04:09.090> little

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
this one now this can be a tiny little

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.420 
this one now this can be a tiny little
difference<00:04:09.930> maybe<00:04:10.169> split<00:04:10.530> second<00:04:10.919> but<00:04:11.099> it<00:04:11.250> can

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
difference maybe split second but it can

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.129 
difference maybe split second but it can
make<00:04:11.459> all<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.819> difference<00:04:11.940> in<00:04:12.449> the<00:04:12.480> world<00:04:12.720> so

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
make all the difference in the world so

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.409 
make all the difference in the world so
