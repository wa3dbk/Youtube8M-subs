1999 Mazda Miata timing belt water pump
I<00:00:09.469> think<00:00:10.469> this<00:00:10.679> spark<00:00:10.980> plugs<00:00:11.250> out<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.639> their

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
I think this spark plugs out of their

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.620 
I think this spark plugs out of their
holes<00:00:11.969> here<00:00:12.660> take<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.380> hose<00:00:13.530> off<00:00:14.509> taking<00:00:15.509> a

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
holes here take the hose off taking a

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
holes here take the hose off taking a
lot<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.139> wires<00:00:16.890> disconnected<00:00:17.580> them<00:00:18.650> from

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
lot of the wires disconnected them from

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.009 
lot of the wires disconnected them from
their<00:00:19.800> various<00:00:20.130> sensors

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:23.019 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.229 

over<00:00:23.320> here<00:00:25.800> we'll<00:00:26.800> get<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:27.460> valve<00:00:27.880> cover

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:28.239 
over here we'll get the valve cover

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.049 
over here we'll get the valve cover
gasket<00:00:28.779> off<00:00:29.009> and<00:00:30.009> then<00:00:30.130> we'll<00:00:30.250> work<00:00:30.400> away<00:00:30.759> down

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:31.059

twelve<00:00:57.039> millimeter<00:00:57.340> bolts<00:00:57.879> basically

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
twelve millimeter bolts basically

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.439 
twelve millimeter bolts basically
loosening<00:00:58.840> these<00:00:58.960> up<00:00:59.730> do<00:01:00.730> have<00:01:00.969> to<00:01:01.120> move<00:01:01.300> this

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
loosening these up do have to move this

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.020 
loosening these up do have to move this
pulley<00:01:01.929> or<00:01:02.170> move<00:01:02.379> the<00:01:02.559> belt<00:01:02.769> around<00:01:03.609> so<00:01:03.940> you

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
pulley or move the belt around so you

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.570 
pulley or move the belt around so you
can<00:01:04.149> get<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.539> the<00:01:04.860> fourteen<00:01:05.860> millimeter<00:01:06.070> bolt

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
can get to the fourteen millimeter bolt

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.169 
can get to the fourteen millimeter bolt
inside<00:01:07.110> there's<00:01:08.110> a<00:01:08.200> nut<00:01:08.530> on<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:08.860> backside

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
inside there's a nut on the backside

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:15.120 
inside there's a nut on the backside
here<00:01:10.179> to<00:01:10.300> get<00:01:10.479> to<00:01:11.729> got<00:01:12.729> the<00:01:13.110> AC<00:01:14.110> is<00:01:14.500> also<00:01:14.860> twelve

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
here to get to got the AC is also twelve

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.660 
here to get to got the AC is also twelve
millimeter<00:01:15.340> bolts<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:17.170> got<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.649> belt<00:01:17.890> off<00:01:18.250> the

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
millimeter bolts so got the belt off the

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.310 
millimeter bolts so got the belt off the
bolts<00:01:19.330> belts<00:01:19.810> off

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
bolts belts off

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.770 
bolts belts off
now<00:01:21.250> we're<00:01:21.399> draining<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:21.729> coolant<00:01:21.759> is<00:01:22.569> the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
now we're draining the coolant is the

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.469 
now we're draining the coolant is the

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
Philips screwdriver on the bottom of the

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.859 
Philips screwdriver on the bottom of the
radiator<00:01:25.990> there's<00:01:26.619> a<00:01:26.729> access<00:01:27.729> hole<00:01:28.540> down

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
radiator there's a access hole down

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.450 
radiator there's a access hole down
there<00:01:29.079> to<00:01:29.229> straighten<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.619> coolant<00:01:30.009> for

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
there to straighten the coolant for

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.389 
there to straighten the coolant for
doing<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.759> water<00:01:31.119> pump<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:32.159> we'll<00:01:33.159> start

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
doing the water pump and we'll start

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:34.679 
doing the water pump and we'll start
taking<00:01:33.700> some<00:01:33.850> of<00:01:33.880> these<00:01:34.000> ten<00:01:34.210> millimeter

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
taking some of these ten millimeter

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.350 
taking some of these ten millimeter
bolts<00:01:35.079> off<00:01:35.290> it<00:01:35.740> looks<00:01:35.920> like<00:01:36.009> 12<00:01:36.790> millimeter

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
bolts off it looks like 12 millimeter

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:47.859 
bolts off it looks like 12 millimeter
for<00:01:37.509> this<00:01:38.009> get<00:01:39.009> some<00:01:39.159> these<00:01:39.340> hoses<00:01:39.610> off

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.020 

took<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.470> radiator<00:01:48.799> and<00:01:48.950> fan<00:01:49.340> assembly<00:01:49.790> out

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
took the radiator and fan assembly out

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.890 
took the radiator and fan assembly out
give<00:01:50.450> me<00:01:50.540> more<00:01:50.780> access<00:01:51.350> down<00:01:51.710> here<00:01:52.720> let's<00:01:53.720> give

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
give me more access down here let's give

on the right put some marks on there so
we<00:02:30.440> do<00:02:30.830> good<00:02:31.040> job<00:02:31.250> looking<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.580> back<00:02:31.730> together

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
we do good job looking it back together

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.290 
we do good job looking it back together
get<00:02:33.410> this<00:02:33.590> bottom<00:02:33.950> cover<00:02:34.250> off<00:02:34.520> and<00:02:34.970> see<00:02:35.180> about

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
get this bottom cover off and see about

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:43.300 
get this bottom cover off and see about
getting<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.810> bottom<00:02:36.260> pulley<00:02:37.040> off<00:02:42.310> okay

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
getting that bottom pulley off okay
