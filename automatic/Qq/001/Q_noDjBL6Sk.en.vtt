many discussions it isn't the

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.620 
many discussions it isn't the
power-hungry<00:01:52.130> product<00:01:52.730> it<00:01:52.880> is<00:01:53.300> only

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
power-hungry product it is only

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.370 
power-hungry product it is only
marginally<00:01:54.050> more<00:01:54.850> using<00:01:55.850> of<00:01:56.030> hydro<00:01:56.570> than<00:01:57.080> for

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
marginally more using of hydro than for

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.040 
marginally more using of hydro than for
example<00:01:57.860> a<00:01:58.010> good<00:01:58.340> quality<00:01:58.760> LCD<00:01:59.450> product<00:01:59.900> and

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
example a good quality LCD product and

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.230 
example a good quality LCD product and
as<00:02:00.620> we<00:02:00.800> move<00:02:01.010> forward<00:02:01.220> we'll<00:02:01.670> also<00:02:01.850> see<00:02:02.210> some

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
as we move forward we'll also see some

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.600 
as we move forward we'll also see some
further<00:02:02.690> advances<00:02:03.410> in<00:02:03.560> that<00:02:03.740> all<00:02:03.950> the

panasonic plasmas for example carry the
Energy<00:02:07.220> Star<00:02:07.580> rating<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:08.300> they

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
Energy Star rating so they

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.660 
Energy Star rating so they
means<00:02:08.929> they<00:02:09.080> are<00:02:09.229> approved<00:02:09.770> as<00:02:10.009> energy

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
means they are approved as energy

at<00:02:49.340> an<00:02:49.610> LCD<00:02:50.330> is<00:02:50.690> what<00:02:51.380> is<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.650> contrast<00:02:52.100> ratio

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
at an LCD is what is the contrast ratio

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.870 
at an LCD is what is the contrast ratio
what<00:02:53.300> is<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.720> speed<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.590> panel<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.160> what

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
what is the speed of the panel and what

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.840 
what is the speed of the panel and what
is<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.209> abilities<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.290> panel<00:02:57.709> so<00:02:58.340> for

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
is the abilities of the panel so for

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.630 
is the abilities of the panel so for
example<00:02:58.880> this<00:02:59.569> TV<00:02:59.989> here<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.380> 4<00:03:00.739> millisecond

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
example this TV here is a 4 millisecond

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.720 
example this TV here is a 4 millisecond
refresh<00:03:02.239> rate<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.350> 10-bit<00:03:03.890> panel<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:04.610> it

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
refresh rate it's a 10-bit panel so it

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.690 
refresh rate it's a 10-bit panel so it
has<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:04.970> very<00:03:05.390> fast<00:03:05.780> processor<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:07.550> go

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
has a very fast processor and to go

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.000 
has a very fast processor and to go
along<00:03:07.940> with<00:03:07.970> that<00:03:08.180> fast<00:03:08.630> processing<00:03:09.440> it's<00:03:09.800> a

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
along with that fast processing it's a

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.670 
along with that fast processing it's a

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.050 
hundred and 20 megahertz but 120
megahertz<00:03:13.130> is<00:03:13.250> very<00:03:13.459> similar<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:13.910> the

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
megahertz is very similar to the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.600 
megahertz is very similar to the

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
processor in your computer that is what

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.880 
processor in your computer that is what
enables<00:03:17.180> your<00:03:17.329> computer<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:18.019> do<00:03:18.320> everything
