00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.039 
started or restarted I should say so you
know<00:04:13.780> a<00:04:13.810> good<00:04:14.440> way<00:04:14.739> to<00:04:15.120> hype<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.299> show<00:04:16.570> plug

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
know a good way to hype the show plug

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.990 
know a good way to hype the show plug
the<00:04:17.200> show<00:04:17.440> would<00:04:17.769> be<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:18.250> have<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.669> total

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
the show would be to have the total

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.570 
the show would be to have the total
divas<00:04:19.390> pick<00:04:20.229> up<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.500> bait<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.769> be<00:04:20.859> here<00:04:21.070> you

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
divas pick up the bait to be here you

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.700 
divas pick up the bait to be here you
know<00:04:21.609> cuz<00:04:22.000> it's<00:04:22.330> so<00:04:22.450> far<00:04:22.900> on<00:04:23.380> pay-per-view

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
know cuz it's so far on pay-per-view

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.520 
know cuz it's so far on pay-per-view
total<00:04:24.490> divas<00:04:24.880> haven't<00:04:25.479> been

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
total divas haven't been

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.250 
total divas haven't been
really<00:04:27.010> successful<00:04:27.640> at<00:04:28.030> least<00:04:28.360> not<00:04:28.630> against

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
really successful at least not against

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.170 
really successful at least not against
AJ<00:04:29.770> Lee<00:04:30.180> so<00:04:31.180> for<00:04:31.450> them<00:04:31.600> to<00:04:31.960> you<00:04:32.950> know<00:04:33.070> to<00:04:34.030> get

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
AJ Lee so for them to you know to get

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.240 
AJ Lee so for them to you know to get
this<00:04:34.330> pay-per-view<00:04:34.540> fake<00:04:35.050> three<00:04:35.320> it<00:04:35.980> would<00:04:36.130> do

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
this pay-per-view fake three it would do

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.400 
this pay-per-view fake three it would do
good<00:04:36.460> I<00:04:36.550> guess<00:04:36.700> for<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.090> total<00:04:37.840> divas<00:04:38.170> maybe

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
good I guess for the total divas maybe

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.230 
good I guess for the total divas maybe
would<00:04:38.980> do<00:04:39.130> good<00:04:39.340> for<00:04:39.370> the<00:04:39.580> total<00:04:40.000> divas<00:04:40.120> show

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
would do good for the total divas show

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.430 
would do good for the total divas show
I'm<00:04:40.720> not<00:04:40.780> sure<00:04:41.430> but<00:04:42.430> also<00:04:43.270> for<00:04:43.630> AJ<00:04:44.080> to<00:04:44.110> get<00:04:44.410> a

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
I'm not sure but also for AJ to get a

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.930 
I'm not sure but also for AJ to get a
new<00:04:44.620> challenger<00:04:45.310> for<00:04:45.520> her<00:04:45.610> Divas

I<00:05:03.820> could<00:05:04.000> see<00:05:04.500> Natalya<00:05:05.500> actually<00:05:05.800> being<00:05:06.040> the

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
I could see Natalya actually being the

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.850 
I could see Natalya actually being the
one<00:05:06.370> picking<00:05:07.180> up<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.390> victory<00:05:07.510> over<00:05:07.960> AJ<00:05:08.560> maybe

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
one picking up the victory over AJ maybe

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.440 
one picking up the victory over AJ maybe
making<00:05:09.100> her<00:05:09.310> tap<00:05:09.580> out<00:05:09.790> to<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.090> Sharpshooter

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
making her tap out to the Sharpshooter

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.250 
making her tap out to the Sharpshooter
and<00:05:10.930> then<00:05:11.530> she<00:05:11.770> could<00:05:11.920> get<00:05:12.160> a<00:05:12.400> title<00:05:12.820> shot

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
and then she could get a title shot

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.900 
and then she could get a title shot
against<00:05:14.260> AJ<00:05:14.560> Lee<00:05:14.710> or<00:05:14.800> who<00:05:15.040> knows<00:05:15.250> maybe<00:05:15.280> one<00:05:15.850> of

the<00:05:16.030> other<00:05:16.150> total<00:05:16.570> divas<00:05:16.840> maybe<00:05:17.220> Nikki<00:05:18.220> Bella

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
the other total divas maybe Nikki Bella

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.320 
the other total divas maybe Nikki Bella
gets<00:05:18.669> the<00:05:18.790> victory<00:05:18.910> or<00:05:20.640> even<00:05:21.640> not<00:05:22.000> Channel
