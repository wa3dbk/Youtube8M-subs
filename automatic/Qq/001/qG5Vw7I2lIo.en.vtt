00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
I can see from mark from watching him in

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.950 
I can see from mark from watching him in
the<00:00:25.650> practice<00:00:25.830> sessions<00:00:26.810> earlier<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
the practice sessions earlier in the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.509 
the practice sessions earlier in the
weekend<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:28.500> once<00:00:28.980> he<00:00:29.070> caught<00:00:29.250> up<00:00:29.400> to

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
weekend it's once he caught up to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.220 
weekend it's once he caught up to
prattle<00:00:29.760> his<00:00:30.240> corners<00:00:30.689> be<00:00:30.840> definitely

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
prattle his corners be definitely

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.900 
prattle his corners be definitely
dropped<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.560> little<00:00:31.680> bit<00:00:31.830> more<00:00:32.129> and<00:00:32.669> he<00:00:32.760> was

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
dropped a little bit more and he was

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.580 
dropped a little bit more and he was
really<00:00:33.239> getting<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.629> mic<00:00:33.780> stood<00:00:34.110> up<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.530> I

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
really getting the mic stood up so I

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.860 
really getting the mic stood up so I
definitely<00:00:34.830> think<00:00:35.340> he<00:00:35.460> was<00:00:35.699> really<00:00:36.449> trying<00:00:36.780> to

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
definitely think he was really trying to

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.450 
definitely think he was really trying to
save<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.199> tire<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.620> now<00:00:37.769> we<00:00:37.830> just<00:00:38.040> got<00:00:38.220> to<00:00:38.309> see

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
save the tire and now we just got to see

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.070 
save the tire and now we just got to see
what<00:00:38.610> he's<00:00:38.730> going<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.910> do<00:00:39.090> now<00:00:39.269> and<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.690> it

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
what he's going to do now and and it

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.350 
what he's going to do now and and it
still<00:00:40.320> 16<00:00:41.309> laps<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.640> go<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:41.879> he's<00:00:42.000> got<00:00:42.180> more

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
still 16 laps to go if he's got more

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.820 
still 16 laps to go if he's got more
pace<00:00:42.600> than<00:00:42.839> Bradley<00:00:43.050> doesn't<00:00:43.500> need<00:00:43.589> to<00:00:43.710> make

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
pace than Bradley doesn't need to make

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.619 
pace than Bradley doesn't need to make
the<00:00:43.980> pass<00:00:44.190> now<00:00:44.430> but<00:00:44.730> like<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.149> said<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.510> never

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the pass now but like I said you never

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.229 
the pass now but like I said you never
know<00:00:45.899> at<00:00:46.020> him<00:00:46.200> but<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.800> think<00:00:47.129> really<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
know at him but I think really the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.180 
know at him but I think really the
perfect<00:00:48.480> scenarios<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.440> about<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:50.039> know

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
perfect scenarios with about you know

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.279 
perfect scenarios with about you know
wait<00:00:50.520> two<00:00:50.789> or<00:00:50.820> three<00:00:51.120> more<00:00:51.239> laps<00:00:51.450> try<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.079> make

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
wait two or three more laps try to make

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.959 
wait two or three more laps try to make
Brattle<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.829> make<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> mistake<00:00:53.489> where<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.850> can

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
Brattle just make a mistake where it can

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.940 
Brattle just make a mistake where it can
be<00:00:54.090> easy<00:00:54.300> mess<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.200> then<00:00:55.350> if<00:00:55.469> he<00:00:55.559> doesn't<00:00:55.890> do

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
be easy mess and then if he doesn't do

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.700 
be easy mess and then if he doesn't do
that<00:00:55.980> go<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:56.640> it

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
that go for it

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.150 
that go for it
sounds<00:00:59.460> easy<00:01:00.140> you<00:01:01.140> can't<00:01:01.440> push<00:01:01.680> him<00:01:01.830> home<00:01:01.980> from

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
sounds easy you can't push him home from

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.740 
sounds easy you can't push him home from
behind<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.760> it'll<00:01:02.910> be<00:01:03.000> kind<00:01:03.240> you<00:01:03.450> can<00:01:03.600> lighten

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
behind and it'll be kind you can lighten

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.509 
behind and it'll be kind you can lighten
up<00:01:03.900> it's<00:01:04.080> night<00:01:04.350> for<00:01:04.710> sure<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.890> mean<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.370> he's

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
up it's night for sure I mean if he's

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.100 
up it's night for sure I mean if he's
comfortable<00:01:05.760> Brattle<00:01:06.420> hasn't<00:01:06.750> led<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.870> race

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
comfortable Brattle hasn't led a race

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.440 
comfortable Brattle hasn't led a race
this<00:01:07.350> long<00:01:07.530> he's<00:01:07.710> never<00:01:07.920> won<00:01:08.160> a<00:01:08.190> race<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.910> he's

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
this long he's never won a race so he's

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.120 
this long he's never won a race so he's
definitely<00:01:09.720> got<00:01:10.110> some<00:01:10.380> pressure<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.740> him<00:01:10.980> and

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
definitely got some pressure on him and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.950 
definitely got some pressure on him and
I<00:01:11.220> think<00:01:11.670> more<00:01:12.000> guys<00:01:12.180> could<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.510> sit<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.750> him

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
I think more guys could just sit on him

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.030 
I think more guys could just sit on him
for<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.140> little<00:01:13.260> bit<00:01:13.410> if<00:01:13.680> he's<00:01:13.830> that

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
for a little bit if he's that

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.590 
for a little bit if he's that
comfortable<00:01:14.550> there's<00:01:14.729> no<00:01:14.850> reason<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.240> pass

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
comfortable there's no reason to pass

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.690 
comfortable there's no reason to pass
that<00:01:15.870> quick<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.740> wait<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.250> see

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
he had a little bit of a moment right

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.100 
he had a little bit of a moment right
there<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.240> because<00:01:24.540> he's<00:01:24.690> picking<00:01:25.050> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
there but it's because he's picking the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.290 
there but it's because he's picking the
bike<00:01:25.290> up<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.650> fast<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.910> on<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> bigger

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
bike up so fast to get it on the bigger

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.850 
bike up so fast to get it on the bigger
part<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:27.780> tires<00:01:27.990> not<00:01:28.290> where<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> sides

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
part of the tires not where the sides

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.969 
part of the tires not where the sides
were<00:01:29.040> about<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.790> he<00:01:29.880> wasn't<00:01:30.210> really<00:01:30.390> sliding

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
were about that he wasn't really sliding

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.790 
were about that he wasn't really sliding
so<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.690> look<00:01:33.690> worse<00:01:33.899> than<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.200> really<00:01:34.350> is

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
so it look worse than it really is
