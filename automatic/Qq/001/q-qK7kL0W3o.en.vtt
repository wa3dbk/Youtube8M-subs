masses I know that several weeks ago he
began<00:00:29.820> testing<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.660> safe<00:00:30.840> strap<00:00:31.080> version

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.100 
began testing on the safe strap version
3<00:00:31.800> some<00:00:32.730> people<00:00:32.969> were<00:00:33.149> willing<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.600> test<00:00:33.899> it

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
3 some people were willing to test it

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.049 
3 some people were willing to test it
there<00:00:34.350> were<00:00:34.469> some<00:00:34.710> bricks<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.670> were<00:00:35.850> made

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
there were some bricks that were made

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.209 
there were some bricks that were made
some<00:00:36.420> bricks<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.899> were<00:00:37.050> recovered<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.920> bugs

some bricks that were recovered and bugs
that<00:00:38.489> had<00:00:38.670> been<00:00:38.820> squashed<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.420> make<00:00:39.540> this

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
that had been squashed to make this

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.150 
that had been squashed to make this
thing<00:00:39.870> stable<00:00:40.260> enough<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.620> release<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
thing stable enough to release to the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.430 
thing stable enough to release to the
masses<00:00:41.610> there<00:00:42.360> will<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.510> no<00:00:42.750> braking<00:00:43.200> with

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
masses there will be no braking with

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.290 
masses there will be no braking with
this<00:00:43.620> version<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.250> other<00:00:44.399> words<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.120> there<00:00:45.239> are

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
this version in other words so there are

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.000 
this version in other words so there are
several<00:00:45.480> really<00:00:45.840> big<00:00:46.050> changes<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.620> safe<00:00:46.800> strap

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
several really big changes to safe strap

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.100 
several really big changes to safe strap
3<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:48.000> biggest<00:00:48.300> change<00:00:48.539> probably<00:00:48.870> that

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
3 the biggest change probably that

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.450 
3 the biggest change probably that
you'll<00:00:49.260> notice<00:00:49.530> right<00:00:49.680> off<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.010> bat<00:00:50.160> when<00:00:50.370> you

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
you'll notice right off the bat when you

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.100 
you'll notice right off the bat when you
boot<00:00:50.640> into<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.270> recovery<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.960> first

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
boot into the recovery for the first

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.110 
boot into the recovery for the first
time<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.890> touched<00:00:53.160> based<00:00:53.460> it's

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
time is that it is touched based it's

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.060 
time is that it is touched based it's
based<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.510> team<00:00:54.750> wind<00:00:54.899> recovery<00:00:55.320> project<00:00:55.860> I

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
based on team wind recovery project I

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.340 
based on team wind recovery project I
know<00:00:56.370> more<00:00:56.670> using<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.149> clunky<00:00:57.719> hard<00:00:57.960> buttons

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
know more using the clunky hard buttons

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.950 
know more using the clunky hard buttons
you<00:00:58.829> can<00:00:58.980> just<00:00:59.219> touch<00:01:00.120> what<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.600> want<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.870> do

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
you can just touch what you want to do

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.389 
you can just touch what you want to do
and<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.260> will<00:01:01.350> do<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:01.980> makes<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.370> very

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
and it will do it so this makes it very

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.609 
and it will do it so this makes it very
user<00:01:02.910> friendly<00:01:03.170> much<00:01:04.170> more<00:01:04.350> user<00:01:04.530> friendly

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
user friendly much more user friendly

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.460 
user friendly much more user friendly
than<00:01:04.920> any<00:01:05.280> previous<00:01:05.760> version<00:01:06.200> another<00:01:07.200> big

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
than any previous version another big

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.109 
than any previous version another big
change<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.340> installed<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.939> your

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
change is that it's installed on your

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.670 
change is that it's installed on your
internal<00:01:09.390> sd<00:01:09.689> card<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.049> before<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.380> install

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
internal sd card so before you install

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.859 
internal sd card so before you install
it<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.010> want<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.700> check<00:01:11.850> out<00:01:12.060> your<00:01:12.210> file<00:01:12.479> space

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
there on your device storage I've got a

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.830 
there on your device storage I've got a
gigabytes<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.400> should<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.759> plenty<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.630> most

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
gigabytes that should be plenty the most

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.450 
gigabytes that should be plenty the most
this<00:01:18.960> thing<00:01:19.110> will<00:01:19.259> ever<00:01:19.380> use<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.890> about<00:01:20.040> three

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
this thing will ever use is about three

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.730 
this thing will ever use is about three
gigabytes<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.030> say<00:01:21.210> strapped<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:22.229> has<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.560> have

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
gigabytes so say strapped it has to have

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.999 
gigabytes so say strapped it has to have
that<00:01:23.189> space<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:24.479> install<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.049> ROM<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.710> that

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
that space to install the ROM on that

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.630 
that space to install the ROM on that
partition<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.780> also<00:01:27.930> makes<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:28.829> things

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
partition and it also makes for things

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.640 
partition and it also makes for things
like<00:01:29.850> flashing<00:01:30.540> multiple<00:01:30.960> roms<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.439> flash

up to four arms now which is a new
feature<00:01:34.079> with<00:01:34.560> version<00:01:34.860> 3<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.479> also

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
feature with version 3 and you can also

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.170 
feature with version 3 and you can also
swap<00:01:37.020> between<00:01:37.229> roms<00:01:37.740> very<00:01:38.220> quickly<00:01:38.520> used<00:01:39.030> to

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
one of these rom slots you would just

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.200 
one of these rom slots you would just
select<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.310> rom<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:21.530> choose<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:23.210> partition

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
size one gigabyte for those that

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.030 
size one gigabyte for those that
don't<00:04:27.480> use<00:04:27.660> a<00:04:27.720> ton<00:04:28.020> of<00:04:28.050> apps<00:04:28.290> if<00:04:28.470> you<00:04:28.560> use<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:28.770> ton

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
don't use a ton of apps if you use a ton

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.560 
don't use a ton of apps if you use a ton
of<00:04:29.070> apps<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.430> would<00:04:29.580> go<00:04:29.700> to<00:04:29.730> two<00:04:30.090> gigabytes

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
of apps you would go to two gigabytes

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.080 
of apps you would go to two gigabytes
and<00:04:30.780> if<00:04:31.110> you<00:04:31.260> are<00:04:31.440> just<00:04:31.650> crazy<00:04:32.250> buckwild<00:04:32.970> with

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
and if you are just crazy buckwild with

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.210 
and if you are just crazy buckwild with
apps<00:04:33.240> you've<00:04:33.390> got<00:04:33.540> unlimited<00:04:33.810> apps<00:04:34.800> then<00:04:35.130> you

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
apps you've got unlimited apps then you

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.460 
apps you've got unlimited apps then you
would<00:04:35.370> go<00:04:35.460> with<00:04:35.610> three<00:04:35.820> gigabytes<00:04:36.090> I<00:04:36.930> would

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
would go with three gigabytes I would

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.020 
would go with three gigabytes I would
just<00:04:37.650> stick<00:04:37.890> with<00:04:38.040> the<00:04:38.160> one<00:04:38.340> gigabyte<00:04:38.790> so<00:04:38.970> you

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
just stick with the one gigabyte so you

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.900 
just stick with the one gigabyte so you
would<00:04:39.210> select<00:04:39.390> that<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:40.800> create<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.760> ROM

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
would select that and create the ROM

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.460 
would select that and create the ROM
slot<00:04:46.730> that<00:04:47.730> will<00:04:47.940> take<00:04:48.150> a<00:04:48.180> few<00:04:48.570> minutes<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:49.410> I'm

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
slot that will take a few minutes so I'm

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.520 
slot that will take a few minutes so I'm
going<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.680> kind<00:04:49.770> of<00:04:49.890> pause<00:04:50.130> it<00:04:50.370> here<00:04:51.500> okay<00:04:52.500> so

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
going to kind of pause it here okay so

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.560 
going to kind of pause it here okay so
when<00:04:52.800> that<00:04:52.920> process<00:04:53.370> finishes<00:04:53.760> I<00:04:54.210> now<00:04:54.330> have<00:04:54.540> a

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
when that process finishes I now have a

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.990 
when that process finishes I now have a
ROM<00:04:54.990> slot<00:04:55.350> there<00:04:56.220> if<00:04:56.430> I<00:04:56.550> have<00:04:56.790> that

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
ROM slot there if I have that

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.260 
ROM slot there if I have that
highlighted<00:04:57.630> then<00:04:57.750> that<00:04:57.900> is<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.320> active<00:04:59.270> boot

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
highlighted then that is the active boot

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.220 
highlighted then that is the active boot
ROM<00:05:00.510> so<00:05:00.810> if<00:05:00.930> I<00:05:01.050> go<00:05:01.230> back<00:05:01.610> and<00:05:02.610> I<00:05:02.970> go<00:05:03.120> to<00:05:03.230> wipe

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
ROM so if I go back and I go to wipe

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.130 
ROM so if I go back and I go to wipe
data<00:05:04.500> I'll<00:05:05.100> get<00:05:05.250> a<00:05:05.280> wipe<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:05.820> I<00:05:06.300> go<00:05:06.420> to<00:05:06.480> factory

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
data I'll get a wipe and I go to factory

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.590 
data I'll get a wipe and I go to factory
reset<00:05:07.170> that's<00:05:07.620> gonna<00:05:07.800> wipe<00:05:08.010> that<00:05:08.040> ROM<00:05:08.490> slot<00:05:08.790> if

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
reset that's gonna wipe that ROM slot if

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.390 
reset that's gonna wipe that ROM slot if
I<00:05:09.750> have<00:05:09.930> factory<00:05:10.440> ROM<00:05:10.650> highlighted<00:05:11.280> that's

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
I have factory ROM highlighted that's

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.640 
I have factory ROM highlighted that's
going<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.670> wipe<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.510> data<00:05:12.660> on<00:05:12.930> my<00:05:13.080> factory<00:05:13.350> ROM

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
going to wipe the data on my factory ROM

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.270 
going to wipe the data on my factory ROM
or<00:05:13.920> my<00:05:14.100> what<00:05:14.850> used<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.180> be<00:05:15.410> the<00:05:16.410> unsafe

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.540 
or my what used to be the unsafe
partition<00:05:17.910> and<00:05:19.100> let's<00:05:20.100> see<00:05:20.190> if<00:05:20.250> we<00:05:20.310> go<00:05:20.400> back<00:05:20.520> to

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
partition and let's see if we go back to

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.920 
partition and let's see if we go back to
Boot<00:05:20.790> Options<00:05:20.880> I<00:05:21.300> could<00:05:21.450> actually<00:05:21.600> go<00:05:21.870> to

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
Boot Options I could actually go to

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.490 
Boot Options I could actually go to
