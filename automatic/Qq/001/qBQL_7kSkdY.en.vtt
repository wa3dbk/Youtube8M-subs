00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.910 
alarm display on the right and your
second<00:02:09.239> hand<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.599> on<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.750> bottom<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.619> when<00:02:10.890> I

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
second hand is on the bottom and when I

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.340 
second hand is on the bottom and when I
was<00:02:11.580> looking<00:02:11.819> at

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
was looking at

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.080 
was looking at
this<00:02:12.770> watch<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.220> different<00:02:13.520> photos<00:02:13.850> I

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
this watch and different photos I

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.330 
this watch and different photos I
thought<00:02:14.330> that<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.720> third<00:02:15.440> hand<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.220> they

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
thought that the third hand that they

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.560 
thought that the third hand that they
have<00:02:16.520> that<00:02:16.730> goes<00:02:16.910> at<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.150> 12<00:02:17.390> o'clock

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
have that goes at the 12 o'clock

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.780 
have that goes at the 12 o'clock
position<00:02:17.690> here<00:02:18.410> I<00:02:18.560> thought<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.520> that<00:02:19.670> was

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
position here I thought that that was

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.580 
position here I thought that that was
the<00:02:19.850> seconds<00:02:20.330> hand<00:02:20.510> that's<00:02:20.690> actually<00:02:21.170> a

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
the seconds hand that's actually a

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.310 
the seconds hand that's actually a
function<00:02:22.430> hand<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:22.940> that's<00:02:23.600> how<00:02:23.810> you'll<00:02:24.020> tell

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
function hand so that's how you'll tell

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.630 
function hand so that's how you'll tell
the<00:02:24.620> various<00:02:24.890> functions<00:02:25.280> when<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.520> go

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
the various functions when you go

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.490 
the various functions when you go
through<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.000> watch<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.810> seconds<00:02:27.200> hand<00:02:27.350> is

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
through the watch the seconds hand is

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.200 
through the watch the seconds hand is
actually<00:02:27.800> on<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.010> bottom<00:02:28.160> here<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:29.000> then<00:02:29.120> it

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
actually on the bottom here and then it

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:37.510 
actually on the bottom here and then it
displays<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.660> date<00:02:30.880> now<00:02:35.650> this<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:36.890> atomic

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
displays the date now this is a atomic

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.030 
displays the date now this is a atomic

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
see if the watch did sync to the tower

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.050 
see if the watch did sync to the tower
the<00:02:47.930> night<00:02:47.960> before<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:49.370> press<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.730> adjust

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
button and if it goes below the 3

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.650 
button and if it goes below the 3
o'clock<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.280> did<00:02:52.460> not<00:02:52.610> sink<00:02:52.970> if<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.300> goes<00:02:53.390> above

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
o'clock it did not sink if it goes above

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.110 
o'clock it did not sink if it goes above
the<00:02:53.720> 3<00:02:54.020> o'clock<00:02:54.200> it<00:02:54.500> did<00:02:54.800> now<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.430> actually<00:02:55.730> did

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
the 3 o'clock it did now I actually did

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.700 
the 3 o'clock it did now I actually did
sink<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.540> last<00:02:56.750> night<00:02:57.050> but<00:02:57.320> I<00:02:57.350> think<00:02:57.590> this

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
sink it last night but I think this

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.100 
sink it last night but I think this
morning<00:02:58.010> I<00:02:58.280> had<00:02:58.880> tried<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.180> get<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.510> signal<00:03:00.080> to

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
morning I had tried to get the signal to

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.720 
morning I had tried to get the signal to
see<00:03:00.350> if<00:03:00.440> I<00:03:00.530> can<00:03:00.620> get<00:03:00.740> it<00:03:00.830> during<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.100> daytime<00:03:01.520> and

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
see if I can get it during a daytime and

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.700 
see if I can get it during a daytime and
it<00:03:01.850> did<00:03:02.030> not<00:03:02.210> so<00:03:02.480> that's<00:03:02.660> why<00:03:02.840> it<00:03:02.900> did<00:03:03.470> go<00:03:03.650> to

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
it did not so that's why it did go to

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.910 
it did not so that's why it did go to
the<00:03:03.980> no<00:03:04.790> function<00:03:05.390> there<00:03:05.570> and<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:09.530> do<00:03:09.680> have<00:03:09.800> an

that you can get as far as the looks of

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.830 
that you can get as far as the looks of
this<00:06:16.920> watch<00:06:17.220> so<00:06:17.610> it<00:06:17.790> I<00:06:17.820> think<00:06:18.270> it'll<00:06:18.390> appeal<00:06:18.690> to

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
this watch so it I think it'll appeal to

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.830 
this watch so it I think it'll appeal to
a<00:06:18.950> wide<00:06:19.950> audience<00:06:19.980> and<00:06:21.110> I<00:06:23.210> have<00:06:24.210> a<00:06:24.270> 7<00:06:24.600> and<00:06:24.720> 1/2

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
a wide audience and I have a 7 and 1/2

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.410 
a wide audience and I have a 7 and 1/2
inch<00:06:25.050> wrist<00:06:25.350> and<00:06:25.650> one<00:06:25.920> thing<00:06:26.190> that<00:06:26.700> I<00:06:27.030> had<00:06:27.300> the

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:27.420 
inch wrist and one thing that I had the

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.970 
inch wrist and one thing that I had the
impression<00:06:27.540> of<00:06:27.960> when<00:06:28.170> reading<00:06:28.380> the<00:06:28.560> reviews

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
impression of when reading the reviews

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.970 
impression of when reading the reviews
was<00:06:29.370> that<00:06:29.640> this<00:06:29.820> was<00:06:29.970> a<00:06:30.000> smaller<00:06:30.450> watch<00:06:30.980> it's
