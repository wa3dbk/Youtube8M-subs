00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.759
 there is everyone knows jaylene 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.660
 today we make a little video 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.449
 on call of duty 4 modern warfare 1 en 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.520
 general melee on the map marie so 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.020
 on this gameplay I'm going to play in front of 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.430
 my general as I said who is a 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.890
 game mode I'm not used to 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.930
 to play but also the trick 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.760
 the good thing is that it's that 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.399
 I will play sniper and I have not 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.899
 used to play snipers so if 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.489
 never do you see I do not do a score 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.680
 terrible in your opinion that I do not follow 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.180
 all too well the arrows coop that it comes 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.620
 of the end I made a score a score 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.660
 final enough so you'll see 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.010
 I'm not used to realizing help 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.030
 as good score especially as I'm dead 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.469
 twice clothes and once 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.670
 once by my bar ask so I 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.239
 I died three times in all on his 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.980
 gameplay and here is the class 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.440
 that I say is currently late March 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.480
 displayed at the top right on the screen that 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.129
 so is the n 40 to 3 so the camouflage 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.190
 no matter how I was all about this 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.950
 modern warfare on this call of duty 4 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.080
 it's the red tiger I'm going to play with 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.940
 cartridge belt to get more balls 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.540
 because I'm going to see you I 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.610
 go all but quickly 1 sec 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.860
 I put bandolier like that it can 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.020
 it adds me more bullets forces 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.770
 opposition for to counter the lic 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.960
 marker is aimed solid so me a 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.399
 it does not matter if you use personal I 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.560
 I put myself solid or silence 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.119
 of death but I never never 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.590
 never ever overcharge cat baroud 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.690
 honor martyrs where others 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.830
 bullshit of the kind 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.420
 so I often put aim ground and so 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.610
 see there I just had to have a guy 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.720
 so predator he's called him is going 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.030
 get upset more than once during the 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.590
 part if I remember because already 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.940
 they play the grenade launcher and then that 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.619
 seemed to be a pretty person 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.899
 with a fairly high level because she 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.000
 was prestigious I saw passengers at 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.649
 passage small marker I hold 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.149
 helicopter so that's serge so 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.009
 here he killed me with the grenade launcher 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.229
 in addition look look at the view in 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.909
 which cam knew he was and I 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.229
 wanted to leave a pretty high day and 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.789
 who plays with grenades spear 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.200
 so that's why it sucked me a 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.000
 little balls and where unemployment was 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.719
 still at 1 from my helico so after 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.950
 also you will see I'm going 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.959
 start a series again I want to die at 1 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.459
 from my helicopter and after I go in 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.480
 put one back but know that I will have my 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.350
 helicopter if I'm going to 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.239
 unfortunately is my own 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.560
 bombing you can see that the 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.750
 part for me unfolds pretty unrolls 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.730
 well watch the straw you marker is 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.940
 as sure I had sure I wanted that 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.950
 do a little topic during these 2 videos 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.299
 so for you call of duty so me I 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.799
 do not know if you know but it'll do 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.540
 still a lot of time that I play 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.099
 at call of duty 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.540
 if ever for you it's like before 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.069
 conference so me personally I 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.540
 find I do not find that call of it 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.569
 as before if I remember in the 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.060
 times 2010 2010 2011 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.250
 when black ops 1 was not released on 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.690
 had only modern we played it 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.890
 but we really have fun compared to 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.140
 now I find on black ops which 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.849
 we play there rather for rage and without 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.879
 kill someone kind I do not know me 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.890
 with a Czech weapon or what are you 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.090
 insulted so you see that even 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.459
 I even talked about it just now 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.910
 that's it and it's that it has a lot of 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.440
 consequences 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.239
 it's like I said then I got 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.620
 killed by a grenade launcher so if 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.150
 never did the community say that the spear 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.980
 pomegranate was not was not shit 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.090
 and, frankly, you have it at 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.220
 passage just died second time 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.629
 well if the community ever said that 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.910
 it was not an entity 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.620
 it would make me do nothing at all 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.060
 personally even so good 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.650
 grenade launcher if ever the new biz at 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.180
 need this to start even 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.049
 those who play the grenade launcher because 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.340
 that they can not align and 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.329
 I hope me 5 kills looking for 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.180
 to make their someone drop they have 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.190
 need that to make it click 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.599
 WHEREAS it is there for them 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.470
 and then even I find that the 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.880
 blue can play hours I'm 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.590
 remember when we were calm in private 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.810
 or what and then online we enter a 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.359
 360 it's good we put that we could 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.650
 do that impressed not tend to 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.660
 appreciate I wanted to say this is 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.380
 impress the girls and that's a 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.250
 little bullshit it's a small 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.569
 expression that I say so to 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.120
 political marked at your fingertips you 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.769
 die and then yeah we were doing a little 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.669
 360 and then it's good we can dance the 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.620
 macarena in underpants 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.060
 if we were all happy with our stuff 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.340
 but now to enter 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.049
 double y or doble tango the switch 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.489
 accross the map 360 to the wayne and game 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.709
 list of adam like that I get killed 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.940
 so stupidly and yeah we can go in 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.230
 stuff at the gamepad gamecube all the 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.910
 left and not what ads we can 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.650
 to say it will be rotten so for me I 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.629
 am more i am i am rather stay 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.859
 in the east in the before times so 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.959
 I try all the time here is the passage 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.299
 people what am I doing there I love the 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.470
 do that remind me also before where 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.549
 we made a small flash chips if we 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.079
 was happy now there are some 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.690
 make five beds of times they five 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.280
 movies and here is so in passing him 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.479
 he was a little stupid because I'm killing him 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.580
 a first time at the worst come 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.690
 second time and then if I got one 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.620
 well I think it will come back a 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.180
 third time 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.740
 you do not want they were determined to 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.320
 see the look and hop and then one have 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.450
 even a fourth time I remember 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.310
 he knew I was here that I believe 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.570
 that he was there and he knew that 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.980
 I was there but have nothing to do there 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.600
 wanted he wanted to come and see me there 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.060
 in the rough shagged fucking whore avoids 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.200
 the gameplay everything is fine I think 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.160
 it's true it's the same guy whose 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.570
 fourth time they come to see me 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.230
 so was really determined to have me 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.400
 so at the passage of the gt gt gt I had 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.530
 a chance I was hot and then ben 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.840
 that's the end part so I hope 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.830
 that this part will please you if ever 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.850
 you have not seen the others yet 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.080
 videos of my channel you I that you 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.160
 invite to go see them and then I 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.250
 leave you and then the ball all the 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.250
 world
