00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
relationship to the films I thought the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.429 
relationship to the films I thought the
first<00:01:26.430> Harry<00:01:26.850> Potter<00:01:26.970> film<00:01:27.570> was<00:01:27.840> pretty<00:01:28.080> bad

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
first Harry Potter film was pretty bad

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.859 
first Harry Potter film was pretty bad
and<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.950> all<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> ones<00:01:29.820> after<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.600> were

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
and that all of the ones after that were

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.560 
and that all of the ones after that were
pretty<00:01:31.320> mediocre<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.430> that's<00:01:32.970> kind<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.420> what

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
pretty mediocre and that's kind of what

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.960 
pretty mediocre and that's kind of what
I<00:01:33.600> expected<00:01:34.439> going<00:01:34.799> into<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.159> film<00:01:35.549> yet

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
I expected going into this film yet

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.590 
I expected going into this film yet
another<00:01:37.040> mediocre<00:01:38.040> not<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.790> good<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.450> not

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
another mediocre not so good but not

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.590 
another mediocre not so good but not
really<00:01:39.659> bad<00:01:40.320> Harry<00:01:40.890> Potter<00:01:41.250> movie<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.970> mean<00:01:42.329> it

really bad Harry Potter movie I mean it

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.450

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
took six films for them to get it right

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.330 
took six films for them to get it right
but<00:01:44.939> finally<00:01:45.450> they<00:01:45.630> did<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:47.009> first

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
but finally they did this is the first

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.520 
but finally they did this is the first
Harry<00:01:48.090> Potter<00:01:48.450> movie<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.049> would<00:01:49.380> actually

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
Harry Potter movie that I would actually

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.210 
Harry Potter movie that I would actually
say<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.369> actively<00:01:50.970> good<00:01:51.420> not<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.470> mediocre

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
say is actively good not just mediocre

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.609 
say is actively good not just mediocre
not<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:54.119> something<00:01:54.360> that's<00:01:54.540> there<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
not just something that's there that you

a<00:04:23.620> sort<00:04:23.979> of

a sort of

right place and it's a really hard

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.990

summer<00:06:01.750> blockbuster<00:06:01.960> and<00:06:02.770> it<00:06:02.950> had<00:06:03.220> CG<00:06:04.030> effects

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
summer blockbuster and it had CG effects

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.290 
summer blockbuster and it had CG effects
and<00:06:04.930> stuff<00:06:05.170> in<00:06:05.350> it<00:06:05.470> but<00:06:05.650> they<00:06:06.220> didn't<00:06:06.520> overuse

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
and stuff in it but they didn't overuse

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.900 
and stuff in it but they didn't overuse
it<00:06:07.570> it<00:06:07.840> was<00:06:08.050> only<00:06:08.290> ever<00:06:08.710> used<00:06:09.250> when<00:06:09.610> necessary

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
it it was only ever used when necessary

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.170 
it it was only ever used when necessary
to<00:06:10.810> convey<00:06:11.200> a<00:06:11.230> story<00:06:11.380> point<00:06:12.100> and<00:06:12.400> it<00:06:12.730> was<00:06:12.880> used

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
to convey a story point and it was used

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.990 
to convey a story point and it was used
well<00:06:13.510> the<00:06:14.290> action<00:06:14.890> in<00:06:14.980> this<00:06:15.100> movie<00:06:15.370> was

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
well the action in this movie was

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.510 
well the action in this movie was
derived<00:06:16.510> from<00:06:17.050> character<00:06:17.980> development

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
derived from character development

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.430 
derived from character development
because<00:06:18.760> all<00:06:18.970> good<00:06:19.360> action<00:06:19.840> revolves<00:06:20.320> around

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
because all good action revolves around

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.650 
because all good action revolves around
character<00:06:21.040> development<00:06:21.460> if<00:06:21.850> you<00:06:21.910> don't<00:06:22.390> care

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
character development if you don't care

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.090 
character development if you don't care
about<00:06:22.840> the<00:06:23.080> characters<00:06:23.590> then<00:06:23.770> it<00:06:23.860> doesn't

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100 
about the characters then it doesn't

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.580 
about the characters then it doesn't
matter<00:06:24.280> how<00:06:24.760> mind<00:06:25.210> bogglingly<00:06:25.840> awesome<00:06:26.470> the

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
matter how mind bogglingly awesome the

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.860 
matter how mind bogglingly awesome the
action<00:06:27.040> scene<00:06:27.310> is<00:06:27.550> that's<00:06:28.300> the<00:06:28.480> reason<00:06:28.750> why

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
action scene is that's the reason why

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.080 
action scene is that's the reason why
the<00:06:28.930> action<00:06:29.500> is<00:06:29.620> more<00:06:29.860> engaging<00:06:30.310> in<00:06:30.670> a<00:06:30.760> movie

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
the action is more engaging in a movie

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.020 
the action is more engaging in a movie
like<00:06:31.120> No<00:06:31.570> Country<00:06:31.600> for<00:06:32.140> Old<00:06:32.320> Men<00:06:32.610> where<00:06:33.610> the

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
like No Country for Old Men where the

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.450 
like No Country for Old Men where the
action<00:06:34.480> pieces<00:06:34.930> are<00:06:35.080> rather

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
action pieces are rather

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.189 
action pieces are rather
then<00:06:37.030> there<00:06:37.180> is<00:06:37.360> in<00:06:37.720> something<00:06:38.080> like

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 
then there is in something like

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.379 
then there is in something like
transformers<00:06:38.979> where<00:06:39.220> the<00:06:39.310> action<00:06:39.760> pieces<00:06:40.180> are

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:40.389 
transformers where the action pieces are

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:42.450 
transformers where the action pieces are
rather<00:06:40.600> elaborate<00:06:41.169> but<00:06:41.800> you<00:06:41.949> don't<00:06:42.220> give<00:06:42.430> a

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
rather elaborate but you don't give a

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.730 
rather elaborate but you don't give a
fuck<00:06:42.910> about<00:06:42.940> anyone<00:06:43.479> on<00:06:43.630> screen<00:06:44.050> in<00:06:44.560> this

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
fuck about anyone on screen in this

movie<00:06:45.130> you<00:06:45.400> do<00:06:45.610> care<00:06:45.970> about<00:06:46.449> the<00:06:46.720> outcome<00:06:46.900> you

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
movie you do care about the outcome you

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
really well another good thing about the

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.719 
really well another good thing about the
movie<00:07:01.750> is<00:07:01.960> that<00:07:02.050> it's<00:07:02.199> actually<00:07:02.440> funny<00:07:03.130> the

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:03.729 
movie is that it's actually funny the

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.600 
movie is that it's actually funny the
jokes<00:07:04.150> in<00:07:04.510> most<00:07:05.380> of<00:07:05.560> the<00:07:05.650> Harry<00:07:05.860> Potter<00:07:06.160> movies

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
jokes in most of the Harry Potter movies

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.360 
jokes in most of the Harry Potter movies
before<00:07:06.970> this<00:07:07.449> kind<00:07:07.840> of<00:07:07.930> fell<00:07:08.139> flat<00:07:08.169> for<00:07:08.860> me<00:07:08.979> you

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.370 
before this kind of fell flat for me you

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.370 
before this kind of fell flat for me you
really<00:07:09.610> need<00:07:09.910> humor<00:07:10.449> in<00:07:10.570> a<00:07:10.630> movie<00:07:10.930> like<00:07:11.080> this

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:11.380 
really need humor in a movie like this

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.290 
really need humor in a movie like this
because<00:07:11.949> if<00:07:12.070> there's<00:07:12.220> no<00:07:12.370> humor<00:07:12.850> then<00:07:13.030> it<00:07:13.120> just

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300 
because if there's no humor then it just

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.110 
because if there's no humor then it just
turns<00:07:13.600> into<00:07:13.720> a<00:07:13.930> drama<00:07:14.350> with<00:07:14.770> wizards<00:07:15.220> and<00:07:15.520> you

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 
turns into a drama with wizards and you

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.939 
turns into a drama with wizards and you
know<00:07:16.240> it<00:07:16.360> loses<00:07:16.870> its<00:07:17.050> sense<00:07:17.320> of<00:07:17.560> the<00:07:17.710> you<00:07:17.889> know

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:17.949 
know it loses its sense of the you know

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:19.860 
know it loses its sense of the you know
summer<00:07:18.400> fun<00:07:18.850> where<00:07:19.150> you're<00:07:19.270> not<00:07:19.419> supposed<00:07:19.810> to
