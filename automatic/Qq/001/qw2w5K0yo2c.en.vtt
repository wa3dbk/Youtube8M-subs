Faye<00:01:20.659> faith<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.530> faith<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:24.060> when<00:01:24.390> I

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
Faye faith is it faith and so when I

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
done with them is put some of this

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.640 
done with them is put some of this
perfect<00:01:34.860> paper<00:01:35.009> adhesive<00:01:35.189> gloss<00:01:35.670> glue

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
perfect paper adhesive gloss glue

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.810 
perfect paper adhesive gloss glue
painted<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> inside<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.670> these

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
painted it on the inside and these

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.940 
painted it on the inside and these
bottles<00:01:39.390> have<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> seam<00:01:39.930> down<00:01:40.259> both<00:01:40.530> side<00:01:40.920> so

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
bottles have a seam down both side so

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.010 
bottles have a seam down both side so
it's<00:01:41.369> ideal<00:01:41.579> for<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.509> want<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.840> do

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
it's ideal for what you want to do

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.590 
it's ideal for what you want to do
because<00:01:43.740> that's<00:01:44.070> perfectly<00:01:44.610> halfway<00:01:45.149> across

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
because that's perfectly halfway across

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.870 
because that's perfectly halfway across
the<00:01:45.840> bottle<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.070> just<00:01:47.310> use<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.729> as<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the bottle so I just use that as a

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.260 
the bottle so I just use that as a
guideline<00:01:48.590> pops<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.399> glue<00:01:50.610> using<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
guideline pops in the glue using the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.850 
guideline pops in the glue using the
brush<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.750> can<00:01:51.869> get<00:01:52.290> your<00:01:52.409> brush<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.770> a

is<00:05:25.050> a<00:05:25.080> gap<00:05:25.320> and<00:05:25.590> I<00:05:25.710> just<00:05:25.890> thought<00:05:25.950> I'd<00:05:26.070> leave<00:05:26.130> it

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
is a gap and I just thought I'd leave it

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.460 
is a gap and I just thought I'd leave it
on<00:05:26.340> and<00:05:26.820> pop<00:05:27.270> up<00:05:27.540> there<00:05:27.720> like<00:05:27.930> that<00:05:27.960> so<00:05:28.320> it's

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
on and pop up there like that so it's

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.170 
on and pop up there like that so it's
matching<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:30.950> and<00:05:31.950> that's<00:05:32.130> it<00:05:32.310> basically<00:05:32.490> and

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
matching and and that's it basically and

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.090 
matching and and that's it basically and
I<00:05:33.750> think<00:05:33.990> that<00:05:34.110> looks<00:05:34.320> fun<00:05:34.560> but<00:05:34.590> I'm<00:05:34.770> not<00:05:34.860> doing

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
I think that looks fun but I'm not doing

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.090 
I think that looks fun but I'm not doing
any<00:05:35.220> more<00:05:35.430> to<00:05:35.610> it<00:05:35.760> I<00:05:35.970> like<00:05:36.510> it<00:05:36.690> as<00:05:36.780> it<00:05:36.810> is<00:05:37.100> and

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
felt butterflies and I've also added a

felt butterflies and I've also added a
tiny<00:06:46.740> available<00:06:47.340> to<00:06:47.430> fly<00:06:47.669> on<00:06:48.030> the<00:06:48.750> side<00:06:49.020> here

is

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.890 
is
and<00:06:55.310> I<00:06:56.310> think<00:06:56.640> that<00:06:56.970> sets<00:06:57.240> it<00:06:57.419> off<00:06:57.540> and<00:06:57.750> makes

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
and I think that sets it off and makes

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.380 
and I think that sets it off and makes
it<00:06:58.050> look<00:06:58.140> really<00:06:58.410> pretty<00:06:58.560> just<00:06:59.270> turn<00:07:00.270> the

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.590 
it look really pretty just turn the
light<00:07:00.570> away<00:07:00.780> from<00:07:00.930> it<00:07:01.229> slightly<00:07:01.470> whoops<00:07:02.600> so

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.600 
light away from it slightly whoops so
