00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
realistic results are going to be you do

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.830 
realistic results are going to be you do
see<00:01:11.220> results<00:01:11.790> after<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.150> first<00:01:12.270> treatment

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
see results after the first treatment

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.460 
see results after the first treatment
but<00:01:13.439> not<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> great<00:01:14.369> deal<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:15.720> good<00:01:15.960> results

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.320 

we<00:01:40.800> tend<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.490> cover<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.240> special

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
we tend to cover it with a special

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.050 
we tend to cover it with a special
camouflage<00:01:43.260> makeup<00:01:43.860> after<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.550> treatment

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
camouflage makeup after the treatment

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.270 
camouflage makeup after the treatment
which<00:01:45.450> not<00:01:45.630> only<00:01:45.900> covers<00:01:46.260> it<00:01:46.440> nicely<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.070> also

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
which not only covers it nicely but also

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.910 
which not only covers it nicely but also
helps<00:01:47.940> in<00:01:48.060> wound<00:01:48.300> healing<00:01:48.690> so<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.740> can

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
helps in wound healing so you can

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.620 
helps in wound healing so you can
