00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.329
 video of class without classes in previous 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.850
 Why do you have to go to see if the game?

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.710
 To go and see this game, it's really cool. 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:01.020

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.689

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.340

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.159
 step tutorial here a little here 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.320
 probably will not have anything that leaves 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.130
 All right, and I know where you 're going 12 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.430
 months left 13 here promises will not have 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.490
 nothing is not to be here but will stay in 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.479
 Up here probably I know will 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.530
 have to remove but leave and it is some 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.610
 thing like that 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.649
 and let them extract beauty after having 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.369
 have set up so you do not lose 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.470
 your settings you see in file 67 and 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.500
 digital that I am not 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:04.110
 the year is 200 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.840
 He already saved you, you shut down biches and 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.149
 to open it again, to say the same 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.239
 saved beauty after you saved 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.650
 You will come here in a long set and give a 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.470
 OK 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.370
 as said the name there good already selected 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.819
 some beauty settings is second 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.310
 step is let's delete this file is 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.829
 dvd file because that dvd because 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.540
 You'll pass the bug and 360 it goes. 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.329
 create another image is then you do not 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.269
 will know which one to delete? 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:42.269
 it's the same procedure as dvd 2 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:46.739
 the same good procedure there is nothing 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:51.989
 to see is not that he wants to leave later 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:58.439
 to have and then you go in the 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:03:00.780
 game play file is and select 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:03.680
 it is not the part of the game that is the duty of a 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.659
 It will back up 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.849
 let's go beauty 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.859
 he is making those settings 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.000
 apply up to 1.0 to see if the game does 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.739
 have error 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.420
 and you can see that the whole game in 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.569
 Portuguese looks that I am not the 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.510
 Conquest here, it's all in Portuguese. 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:24.540
 so he's backing up the game 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.359
 Good guys, I 'll leave it to him. 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.459
 finish right to see if you have none 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.459
 mistake is to leave us 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:39.000
 have no good mistake then you pass a 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.780
 A little video with a little bit to not 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.780
 stay too long 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:53.629
 good guys and one thing is also the game 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:53.629
 he will leave on the 27th of this month of 2011 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.930
 today is day 23 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.930
 so in the case of people who already have it 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.079
 unlocked video game that plays on live 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.479
 Look, tell me one thing for you to play. 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:12.000
 in offline mode does not go online for 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:14.280
 do not take the bank connected enters the 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.310
 offline right now 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.659
 just does not enter the live online game 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.490
 then how did it go on the 27th that you 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:26.070
 can play online 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.290
 right even if you play neither the 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.570
 some offline mode and suddenly enter 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.790
 online means want to play another 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.910
 game can play but do not play anymore 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.090

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.600
 will 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.490
 It's okay to have no complications, I always 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.590
 It is good to explain right to see everything right 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.040
 exhausting staff because I talk too much 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.130
 do not like to explain is to give information 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.770
 It's good for you, after you 've made the 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:59.010
 check there will have it between presse 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.740

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.900
 file dvd the one that we the one 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.330
 that his people are little's agent 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.940

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.920
 he does what the other dvd 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:25.350

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.930
 add my disk here 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.570
 here you have to buy the dvd file 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.910
 on the sale will probably have some 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.310
 four reais or five but depending on the 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.030
 place where you live can close in 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.300
 beauty 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.780
 today i 'm going to burn by a and himeji burn is 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.690
 a new version of the work just does not need 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.780
 configure nothing do not need to configure 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:52.650
 nothing april and a half bruni good to us 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:55.290
 known here in the 1st beauty and 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.810
 will probably never set itself up 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.910
 leave at max because if leaving max it 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.340
 will record but it will not record on 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.680
 parts will record with direct to a sonorous 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.430
 that you vote will give an error 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:12.540
 from there I was leaving 2.4 is that the 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:16.260
 good speed well adequate well sorry 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:19.470
 well suited for good game 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:22.050
 after that beauty we selected a 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.270
 our game that has just been converted 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.640
 Good, I will not do it, because I will not do it. 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.400
 the dvd two because to not let the 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:32.370
 very long video but it's the same 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.950
 personal procedure is the same only you 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.690
 it is after you have done it after 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.060
 done the duty of one is the same thing 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.740
 pass by bg 3 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.139
 I'm afraid it's going to end 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.150
 setting the same thing right 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.460
 and it is good for you to live and when 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.610
 you are recording the dem mean 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.950
 Today the DVD 2 back to the video 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.919
 go well for I do not have 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:59.990
 Let's go to the point. 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:07:02.780
 of a certain DVD file that is this is what 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:06.500
 not this one because this one will give error 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:10.850
 will always record for this one beauty 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:13.460
 selecting open and we will record going 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:16.070
 give a message that the game wants a sound 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:19.340
 for example if we summarize that the game is 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:22.820
 bigger than dvd and does not count 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:26.330
 is that she writes good personal messages 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:30.590
 there goes that he is clicking no no 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:33.440
 after that you select the 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:36.229
 last option is marked here 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.139
 in truncatus mode is truncated I'm not 

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:43.460
 cheated if you click on the first 

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:44.600
 will give error goes from there then on the bottom 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.360
 right 

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.820
 After that, give him an okay, let him do the 

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.000
 check there everything will play 

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.530
 a song of will say that the gil who 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.330
