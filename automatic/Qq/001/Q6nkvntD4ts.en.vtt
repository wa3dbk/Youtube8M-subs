00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 and so hello everyone with you damas and today 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.400
 I will show how to make an arch of mushrooms because 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.660
 that I think experienced gamers and zadrot 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.549
 Kraft they know some but what 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.770
 one of which I used to be at all 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.560
 we don't need it anymore 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.359
 catches stairs stone pickaxe Suite 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.119
 water and mushrooms and nothing else we 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.289
 still need a shovel principle new land and 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.359
 hands you can buy 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.600
 series in general in creative so that nice 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.670
 lin means so first you choose 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.469
 the place where you will build this crap 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.879
 settings fish here for example here and you 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:50.250
 pierce him stupidly I don't know the block 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:53.699
 down well, probably better than 20 then you 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.570
 doing this way this way this way but this is me 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:01.170
 so conditionally stonecrop then so as not to stupidly 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.969
 don't crash put well actually you 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.280
 should have been doing this when you were digging 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.380
 put the forest over 100 scenes on the ladder 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.750
 ladder ladder ladder sheet populesku 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:16.259
 weighs hang all yes here now but this 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:21.799
 so purely stupidly the basis of this your future 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:26.100
 farm stonecrops now yes I remembered us still 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.530
 the door will come in handy yes we will come in handy 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:34.560
 the door and any first here we are 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.509
 here I entered a little bit here I am 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.200
 here we dig a little bit here we are 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.790
 we put the door is too much it means 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.479
 now we do some here 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.240
 square or large 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:52.280
 more well for crap you are all the time to 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.920
 spider what any stinky caves 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.630
 what the hell is that 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:06.420
 okay general coffee, it won't hurt us 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:10.319
 I hope this is how there go there go there 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.360
 as many blocks as you like along the way 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:22.100
 can collect these resources cannabis 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:22.100
 products in general you probably understand 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:32.160
 shorter in shit and now that you had 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:36.299
 farm right to start the mean I think 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:41.580
 you understand it is desirable to plant in different 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:47.910
 places but whatever they would grow without 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:50.670
 water that so many people have for me is 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.459
 hesitated want though actually about 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.220
 Do not give another word to the local 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.950
 attention to my smelly skype because 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:06.049
 he's shit so I'm quick now 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:12.650
 there building that fucking cave kura yes 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:14.940
 there zombies run in general so you need 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:21.480
 arbitrarily somehow here so i would 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:23.840
 said make some damn water out of this 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:32.630
 fucking cave 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:39.540
 work a bunch of you then i think thats you 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:41.640
 Excellent now you and the workpiece and 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.260
 you here stupidly pour water a lot 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.870
 one will be explained in a little bucket 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.350
 update many many many many like that 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.889
 she became endless like this but still 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:56.819
 here you can pour now of course 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:58.690
 correct this nonsense i make a pike out 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.650
 see some hoofs 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.000
 a lot of fun is n't it true of course 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.860
 when you dig a farm not 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.870
 ruled out that you, like me, stumble upon 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.940
 all sorts of cuts so you kill one 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:15.150
 get a bunch of two birds with one stone 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.150
 resources of men heaps will please and 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:24.280
 in general, you will like it so here we are 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:27.010
 finally made such a stupid basis 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:33.100
 And here, too, you can basically pour water and 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:36.040
 Once the mouse was like not so rovnenko 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.740
 and here we are humidity and 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.990
 In general, all the mushrooms to grow on not 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.420
 missing one single detail when you 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.280
 will not grow in the dark and that's it 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.410
 for this we needed in particular 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.330
 cobblestone we often fly there but in 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.940
 in my case, you're probably surviving this 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.370
 will do and that's what we need 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:59.140
 first we need to break on the stairs 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:03.460
 put remove hello yes yes that's shorter 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:05.290
 thats given be get out actually from 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:10.660
 Such a hatch can be easy here 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:12.760
 so here's how yes and okay good good 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.030
 ok ok ok let's put 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.500
 cobblestone and we have it all but again I 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.330
 said already mushrooms do not grow in the dark 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.570
 so now we are all this quick 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:27.370
 we'll fix it up 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:31.650
 a small building 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.650
 of course make it bigger because 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:37.450
 Well, because 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.610
 shorter if buildings will be too 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:43.090
 the little light will still be here 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.760
 break and in general here is the most 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.770
 the desired way how not to put it 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.230
 the door because light through it too 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:55.850
 it will be easy 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:57.950
 put it on a pebble it 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.570
 in general, here is the safest way because 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:05.450
 what if we put the door down here 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:08.210
 You see, of course, with little light now 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.920
 In general, the night to light is still there 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.700
 see goes through that door and here 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.380
 cheese 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.990
 compare with pebbles here in common 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.270
 colors so you better close up but 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.030
 can be ground up to dig 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.950
 it was more convenient and now everything is for us 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.480
 it remains only to wait a little bit they 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.890
 principle, sooner or later grow but 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.020
 the only minus of this mushroom farm is 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.540
 that it is possible that you will fall asleep 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.090
 on her hostile mobs but although I 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:38.120
 in general, this has never been Omsk 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:41.480
 honest so don't be afraid of mine 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:44.960
 kind advice that the mushrooms would grow with 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.750
 quickly then you better land and 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.420
 then just her 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:52.340
 dig it well it was my such 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.280
 short tutorial how to make a farm 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.740
 mushroom minecraft is a very useful thing 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:01.870
 so I will finish with you 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.870
 was obviously thomas all bye
