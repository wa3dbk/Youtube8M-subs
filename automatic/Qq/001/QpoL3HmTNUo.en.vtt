through<00:01:13.180> any<00:01:13.330> stuff<00:01:13.540> like<00:01:13.750> this<00:01:13.930> you<00:01:14.170> have<00:01:14.470> to

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
through any stuff like this you have to

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.030 
through any stuff like this you have to
remember<00:01:15.010> to<00:01:15.250> breathe<00:01:15.780> because<00:01:17.040> typically

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
remember to breathe because typically

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.740 
remember to breathe because typically
it's<00:01:18.310> just<00:01:18.520> like<00:01:18.640> a<00:01:18.670> natural<00:01:18.940> reaction<00:01:19.270> like

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
it's just like a natural reaction like

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.720 
it's just like a natural reaction like
all<00:01:19.960> right<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.650> then<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:21.400> just<00:01:21.610> don't

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
all right and then you just don't

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.610 
all right and then you just don't
breathe<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:22.480> then<00:01:22.600> that's<00:01:22.900> why<00:01:23.080> people<00:01:23.410> pass

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
breathe and then that's why people pass

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.060 
breathe and then that's why people pass
out<00:01:23.860> when<00:01:24.040> stuff<00:01:24.250> like<00:01:24.340> this<00:01:24.460> happens<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:26.920> you

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
out when stuff like this happens if you

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.410 
out when stuff like this happens if you
can<00:01:27.220> remember<00:01:27.400> to<00:01:27.610> breathe<00:01:27.820> you<00:01:28.060> can<00:01:28.210> stay

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
can remember to breathe you can stay

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.200 
can remember to breathe you can stay
awake<00:01:28.690> through<00:01:28.930> it<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:30.220> I'm<00:01:30.670> pretty<00:01:31.120> sure

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
awake through it but I'm pretty sure

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.330 
awake through it but I'm pretty sure
most<00:01:31.570> people<00:01:31.720> wouldn't<00:01:32.380> be<00:01:32.530> doing<00:01:32.920> what<00:01:33.160> I'm

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
most people wouldn't be doing what I'm

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.090 
most people wouldn't be doing what I'm
feeling<00:01:33.580> they'd<00:01:33.940> probably<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:35.590> laying<00:01:35.860> back

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
feeling they'd probably be laying back

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.760 
feeling they'd probably be laying back
staring<00:01:36.520> up<00:01:36.760> at<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.910> ceiling

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.800 

this<00:01:41.220> sucks<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:41.790> it's<00:01:41.940> not<00:01:42.120> that<00:01:42.300> bad<00:01:42.480> it's

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
this sucks but it's not that bad it's

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.410 
this sucks but it's not that bad it's
more<00:01:42.960> interesting<00:01:43.230> to<00:01:43.440> me<00:01:43.620> actually<00:01:43.800> I<00:01:44.420> just

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
really count myself lucky that it didn't

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.910 
really count myself lucky that it didn't
hit<00:01:47.550> any<00:01:47.700> ligaments<00:01:48.090> cuz<00:01:48.590> it's<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.650> a<00:01:49.740> pretty
