00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.770

 piece starting from the beginning to the village 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.380
 it was already up to the last ones 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.000

 will always remain the same in style of 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.329
 game and mechanics of the silos and with 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.950
 recurrent and very faithful cutscene to 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.510
 manga passing therefore the novelties of 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.399
 this chapter we start with the campaign 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.860
 also called in dream log mode 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.630
 completely renovated allowing 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.579
 now you can face every single one 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.180
 level with a character of your choice 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.649
 player 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.989
 as for the roster they will be 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.059
 47 playable characters available 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.680
 and the combat system was 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.969
 further renewed thanks 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.980
 to the introduction of a new exhibition 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.409
 combined with allies called 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.209
 kizuna rush that will allow precisely 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.990
 to follow a combined attack together 

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:11.030
 to the allies 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.530
 obviously passing the next gen the various 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.759
 fighting scenarios have been 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.920
 expanded compared to the versions 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.779
 precedents and this will also allow for 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.579
 have a larger number on the screen 

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:21.529
 high of enemies to deal with 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.060
 which however will not weigh much 

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:25.759
 altogether on the experience of 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.380
