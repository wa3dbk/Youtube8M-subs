00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.740 
do is fundamentally mistaken with
respect<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.970> Latino<00:02:23.970> cabinet<00:02:24.390> members<00:02:24.630> I've

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
respect to Latino cabinet members I've

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.810 
respect to Latino cabinet members I've
appointed<00:02:25.020> about<00:02:25.380> half<00:02:25.740> of<00:02:25.950> my<00:02:26.130> cabinet<00:02:26.610> so

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
appointed about half of my cabinet so

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.440 
appointed about half of my cabinet so

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
far and I think that when people look

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.800 
far and I think that when people look
back<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.830> see<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.100> entire<00:02:32.490> slate<00:02:32.910> what<00:02:33.660> they

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
back and see the entire slate what they

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.500 
back and see the entire slate what they
will<00:02:33.960> say<00:02:34.170> is<00:02:34.700> not<00:02:35.700> only<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:36.090> terms<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.420> my
