00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.940
 more like aesthetics in microsoft 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.880

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.760

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.500

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.059
 this way is going to go well for who 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.260
 enjoy this because the following people 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.079
 that he does 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.390
 he picks up the items and models them in 3d 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.160
 leaving him with more details but 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.289
 realistic and is using quito with 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.030
 diamond sword in the hand a roll as 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.670
 she looks so much more fucking even 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.920
 Like a big sword but look at it. 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.619
 her style gets much more detail 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.500
 of the type vats and such of the sword is well 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.960
 more beautiful is the wooden one of iron 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.760
 the gold also looks the swords are well 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.100
 Not only legal when we exchange 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.720
 she looks like her that the staff stays 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.060
 the same is a sword that 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.100
 floating business and the same thing as 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.049
 look left left in our hand 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.759
 change is not that business anymore 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.979
 My love, that's the way you throw it on the floor. 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.020
 Look how he gets the kind of armor 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.150
 How is it in our hands? 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.840
 It's really nice that it 's the pectoral we go 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.880
 play in the ground 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.530
 You see, how do you get past the 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.710
 If you can see that it 's a 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.229
 pectoral one piece armor ap 40 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.420
 of diamond people look at this is not much 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.840
 great even looks very pretty in the mini 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.579
 not mineral crash that daddy picks and 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.680
 playing pick and we will also be playing 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.159

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.409
 floor 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.920
 that clothing and that ore business 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.049
 is mineral that the plantation to power 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.079
 planting looks pretty much the same 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.540
 as swollen and with this the 3d modeling 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.670

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.489
 well being himself is very realistic 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.320
 I think this mold is good, it's the way it goes. 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.690
 I really enjoy the staff who 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.670
 likes to do machine but the bars 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.099

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.540

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:41.379

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.709
 there was also an animation of the hour 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:48.310
 to fish film where the fishing rod 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.169
 they will see logically the clock is not 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.859
 changes a lot or changes to speak to 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.840
 truth 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.889
 the fishing rod how hard it was to stay 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.139
 type 1 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.069
 a piece of wood and it's time to get there on time 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.599

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.540

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:04.000

 Is there something pulling, is it more people? 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.319
 are several items that are in 3d 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:10.930
 these are the ones I remembered 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.939
 because I'm not mistaken, they 're just a few. 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.699
 that this baby does not get these seedlings from 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:18.159
 tree at the door and if you get 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:21.250
 redstone's door we'll get the 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:23.139
 ports around this ports 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.729

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.249

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.889
 the door to door iron the same 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:38.319
