00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.719
 hi friends of train review we are in 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.219
 the car fair 2015 in germany and we have 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.290
 gone through the adidas stand and we 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.590
 we have found as you see with this 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.800
 supernova river with bus technology as 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.930
 You see a totally new shoe here 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.930
 you have it that is characterized by this 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.570
 for this collar that reaches higher 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.000
 of the ankle here you have it I am going to 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.059
 start by saying that this riot supernova 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.850
 It's a little heavy shoe 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.050
 destined 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.280
 to training would not be a shoe 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.890
 destined for competition 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.460
 adidas with the bus has other models 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.219
 like the x's with bus technology 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.260
 but today I am going to teach you now 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.920
 the riot I'll start teaching 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.629
 sole fixes sole technology 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.449
 continental day continues to rely on the 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.350
 Continental German tire brand 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.670
 little prominent taco here you can see 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.550
 fix the relief of the cue is not very 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.020
 prominent and that these from the sides 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.210
 They give more stability are a little more 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.030
 prominent even a little more open 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.300
 out to gain in stability and 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.090
 those in the center who follow the philosophy 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:25.720
 action here you have them fixed oriented 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.979
 to favor the grip in this part 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.159
 front while in the part 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.619
 rear are oriented upside down to 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.759
 avoid what would be the skid in the 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.740
 descents 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.580
 we have asked for this one 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.320
 things of this color 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.480
 golden that you are seeing here in the 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.120
 sole and that we had imagined that 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.100
 it was a kind of protection against 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.860
 stones the branches and all this and 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.160
 indeed they have confirmed us that 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.550
 is 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.160
 rauch in front and behind we go now with 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.830
 the average midsole bus sole here 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.390
 you have it all the back and in the 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.750
 front also a small 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.840
 fringe that here you can also see the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.899
 bus to the goal area 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.650
 for this cushioning otherwise a 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.290
 half sole conadi print with eva fixes 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.450
 to this blue part in the outer zone and 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.060
 this blue part in the inner zone and 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.099
 that here has a stabilized one 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.739
 stabilizer they call the is 'stable' 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:29.700
 frame here you can read it fixed too 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:32.450
 as the sole also goes up a bit will give 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.840
 stability to the shoe fixes that not 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.420
 it moves too much with this 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.160
 got also to avoid the 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.940
 natural pronation that occurs in 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.319
 mountain we are going with the upper zone zone 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.230
 upper is an upper 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.670
 I do not know if you can hear it, it 's kind of 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.090
 sanity like this pretty sturdy nylon 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.920
 and protected all the lateral zones 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.249
 skirts with a kind of skin 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.430
 synthetic and in the back area that does not 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:09.439
 there is a chassis but it is good 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.200
 protected also as you see to avoid 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:15.530
 so that the stones are nailed all 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.469
 this also highlighted this plastic part 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.519
 here you can see it fix a material 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:24.500
 plastic that gives that grip and as you see 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.239
 here also a tie in the part 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.819
 front to finish embracing all the 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.799
 area of ​​the instep we are going with one of the 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.959
 main characteristics of this 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:36.169
 kind of collar that unlike 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.510
 other adidas models this time yes that 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:40.660
 It has more consistency fixes as is 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.420
 a kind of foam 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.220
 I'm not going to open and see how the 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.370
 standing in the shoe as it is only 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.610
 open on one side here you can not see and 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.760
 this area of foam 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.120
 quite padded is also in the 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.100
 back area as it goes up quite a bit with the 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.500
 pin to facilitate the entrance of the 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.500
 foot and now I'm going to take out the template 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.060
 it's a pretty simple template with 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.349
 about 3 millimeters or so of eba that 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.329
 help a little to the bridge and I'm going to 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.329
 teach also in the inner part 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.920
 here you see pretty well finished with 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.130
 some stitching but 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.830
 that you do not notice too much I tell you 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.110
 also that this part of the month so that 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.600
 do not be so rough 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.730
 At the foot once we put it inside 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.250
 one like a foam that is 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.910
 Coated as a foam to give 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.430
 comfort to what it would be in the part 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:43.640
 Interior closes with a Velcro adjustment 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:47.630
 in this upper area you have to try 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.039
 the concept a little bit new than adidas 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.539
 is 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.849
 applying to all its models and how 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:56.460
 you see in these supernovas 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:59.639
 it is not less finally I will highlight you 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.740
 If you see the shoe from above fix 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.820
 as the bus excels a lot of what 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.400
 it would be the vertical 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.950
 no doubt to promote stability 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.350
 across the rear and to have more 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.930
 surface at the time the people who enter 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:17.140
 especially the heel on the descents for 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.530
 have more surface this is the super 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.750
 new network with bus technology bus la 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.850
 we can see very soon and in the store 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.670
 we have found it here and the 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.120
 We classify from the fair to author 2015 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.120
 until next time
