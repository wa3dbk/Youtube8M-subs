00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
170 if you look at the back here it's

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.289 
170 if you look at the back here it's
got<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> little<00:01:01.859> waterproof<00:01:03.290> deals<00:01:04.290> for<00:01:04.650> your

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
got a little waterproof deals for your

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.350 
got a little waterproof deals for your
USB<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.689> microphone<00:01:07.939> a<00:01:08.939> little<00:01:09.510> lighter<00:01:10.159> and

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
USB and microphone a little lighter and

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.480 
USB and microphone a little lighter and
I<00:01:12.360> don't<00:01:12.659> know<00:01:12.920> takes<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.010> little<00:01:14.130> bit<00:01:14.280> better

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
I don't know takes a little bit better

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.010 
I don't know takes a little bit better
pictures<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.119> guess<00:01:15.470> but<00:01:16.470> not<00:01:17.390> really<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
pictures I guess but not really in the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.880 
pictures I guess but not really in the
sense<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.960> travel<00:01:22.470> mode<00:01:22.650> or

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
sense that it's in the travel mode or

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.920 
sense that it's in the travel mode or
action<00:01:23.250> mode<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.490> think<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.909> call<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.150> it

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
action mode I think they call it it

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.670 
action mode I think they call it it
still<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.470> takes<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.860> five<00:01:26.189> megapixel

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
still just takes a five megapixel

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.740 
still just takes a five megapixel
picture<00:01:28.680> if<00:01:28.979> you're<00:01:29.430> stationary<00:01:30.210> takes<00:01:30.570> a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
picture if you're stationary takes a

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.530 
picture if you're stationary takes a
bigger<00:01:31.409> picture<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:32.040> anyway<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.329> what

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
bigger picture but anyway this is what

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.910 
bigger picture but anyway this is what
I'm<00:01:34.020> using<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.530> know<00:01:34.590> you're<00:01:34.829> probably

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
I'm using I know you're probably

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.109 
I'm using I know you're probably
thinking<00:01:35.189> well<00:01:35.400> why<00:01:35.549> didn't<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.850> put<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
thinking well why didn't you put the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.999 
thinking well why didn't you put the
little<00:01:36.299> one<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.659> your<00:01:36.840> helmet<00:01:37.170> instead<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
little one on your helmet instead of the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.700 
little one on your helmet instead of the
big<00:01:38.189> one<00:01:38.450> well<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.720> reason<00:01:40.079> being<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.590> I

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
big one well the reason being is I

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.389 
big one well the reason being is I
already<00:01:41.070> had<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> two<00:01:41.939> gig<00:01:42.210> card<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.960> one

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
already had a two gig card for this one

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.539 
already had a two gig card for this one
this<00:01:44.399> takes<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.790> micro<00:01:45.210> SD<00:01:46.040> this<00:01:47.040> one<00:01:47.250> here

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
this takes a micro SD this one here

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.620 
this takes a micro SD this one here
takes<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.590> regular<00:01:49.590> SD<00:01:49.829> card<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.729> had<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> 16

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
takes a regular SD card and I had a 16

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.819 
takes a regular SD card and I had a 16
gig<00:01:51.899> already<00:01:52.320> for<00:01:52.619> it

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
gig already for it

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.940 
gig already for it
so<00:01:53.640> video<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.329> figured<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.110> need<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.860> know

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
so video I figured I need to you know

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.310 
so video I figured I need to you know
more<00:01:57.590> storage<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.950> less<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.600> this

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
more storage and less on this and this

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.609 
more storage and less on this and this
here<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.680> plan<00:02:02.130> on<00:02:02.310> actually<00:02:02.909> using<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.750> USB

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
here I plan on actually using that USB

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.479 
here I plan on actually using that USB
connector<00:02:05.369> I've<00:02:05.490> got<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.850> little

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
connector I've got this little

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:12.229 
connector I've got this little
waterproof<00:02:08.720> USB<00:02:09.720> deal<00:02:10.760> basically<00:02:11.760> I'm<00:02:12.120> going

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
waterproof USB deal basically I'm going

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.400 
waterproof USB deal basically I'm going
to<00:02:12.300> hardwire<00:02:12.720> that

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
to hardwire that

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.200 
to hardwire that
somewhere<00:02:13.920> I'm<00:02:14.130> not<00:02:14.160> sure<00:02:14.520> exactly<00:02:14.820> where

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
somewhere I'm not sure exactly where

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.490 
somewhere I'm not sure exactly where
maybe<00:02:15.630> something<00:02:16.020> like<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:19.260> then<00:02:19.380> I'll

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
maybe something like that and then I'll

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.830 
maybe something like that and then I'll
just<00:02:19.680> run<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.130> USB<00:02:20.670> from<00:02:20.910> here<00:02:21.210> straight<00:02:21.480> into

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
just run the USB from here straight into

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.320 
just run the USB from here straight into
the<00:02:21.930> back<00:02:22.140> instead<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.220> using<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.700> battery<00:02:23.910> so

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
the back instead of using the battery so

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.970 
the back instead of using the battery so
