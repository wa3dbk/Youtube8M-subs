just adjust it to get it to fit in there
perfect<00:01:24.439> and<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:25.590> your<00:01:25.799> boiled<00:01:26.549> over<00:01:26.729> if

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
perfect and then your boiled over if

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.120 
perfect and then your boiled over if
this<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.080> giving<00:01:28.320> gold<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.680> gold<00:01:28.860> would<00:01:29.009> be

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
this is giving gold the gold would be

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.530 
this is giving gold the gold would be
facing<00:01:29.369> up<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.820> type<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.060> foil<00:01:30.360> paper

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
facing up on this type of foil paper

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.179 
facing up on this type of foil paper
some<00:01:31.320> people<00:01:31.530> think<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:31.710> should<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:31.979> facing

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
some people think so should be facing

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.679 
some people think so should be facing
down<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.579> color<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:32.939> not<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> way<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.420> foil

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
down to color this not the way this foil

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.690 
down to color this not the way this foil
works<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.740> then<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.189> slide<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.549> into

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
works but then you just slide it into

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.420 
works but then you just slide it into
place<00:01:36.229> you<00:01:37.229> can<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.680> thing<00:01:37.740> here<00:01:38.070> is

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
place you can this thing here is

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.569 
place you can this thing here is
adjustable<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.479> high<00:01:39.659> limit<00:01:40.070> as<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.280> how<00:01:41.310> far

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
adjustable a high limit as to how far

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.069 
adjustable a high limit as to how far
this<00:01:41.729> goes<00:01:41.790> down<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.329> adjust<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.840> knob

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
this goes down you can adjust this knob

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.010 
this goes down you can adjust this knob
here<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.829> then<00:01:44.250> basically<00:01:44.670> also<00:01:44.850> these<00:01:45.450> dials

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
here and then basically also these dials

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.410 
here and then basically also these dials
here<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.549> basically<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.240> can

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
here you just and it basically you can

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.780 
here you just and it basically you can
adjust<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.100> to<00:01:50.100> certain<00:01:50.369> spots<00:01:50.579> where

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
adjust this to to certain spots where

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.469 
adjust this to to certain spots where
this<00:01:51.000> one<00:01:51.329> go<00:01:51.450> down<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.630> certain<00:01:51.840> amount<00:01:52.310> okay

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
this one go down a certain amount okay

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.359 
this one go down a certain amount okay
when<00:01:54.479> you're<00:01:54.600> giving<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:54.960> machine<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:56.159> main

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
when you're giving this machine the main

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.940 
when you're giving this machine the main
thing<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.640> want<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.790> watch<00:01:56.880> out<00:01:57.119> for<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.509> up

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
thing you want to watch out for is up

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.200 
thing you want to watch out for is up
turn<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:58.979> up<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.369> high<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.909> can<00:02:00.030> always

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
turn it up to high you can always

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.899 
turn it up to high you can always
increase<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.290> heat<00:02:01.409> later<00:02:01.700> but<00:02:02.700> if<00:02:02.790> you've

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
increase the heat later but if you've

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.160 
increase the heat later but if you've
turn<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.210> up<00:02:03.299> too<00:02:03.420> high<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.659> can<00:02:03.840> melt

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
turn it up too high you can melt

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.399 
turn it up too high you can melt
partially<00:02:05.130> melt<00:02:05.369> these<00:02:05.549> PVC<00:02:05.909> cards<00:02:06.509> or<00:02:06.750> other

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
partially melt these PVC cards or other

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.900 
partially melt these PVC cards or other
things<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.920> we<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.160> basically<00:02:08.310> mess<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.819> up

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
things and we just basically mess it up

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.520 
things and we just basically mess it up
you<00:02:09.750> need<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.929> start<00:02:10.229> with<00:02:10.379> lower

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
you need to start with lower

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.510 
you need to start with lower
temperatures<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.700> depends<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.060> what<00:02:12.180> time

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
temperatures and it depends on what time

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.550 
temperatures and it depends on what time
PBC<00:02:12.910> cars<00:02:13.150> are<00:02:13.300> using<00:02:13.660> or<00:02:13.840> what<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.170> want<00:02:14.440> type

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
PBC cars are using or what you want type

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.360 
PBC cars are using or what you want type
of<00:02:14.710> foil<00:02:14.890> paper<00:02:15.100> using<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:16.750> just<00:02:17.050> basically<00:02:18.010> it

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
of foil paper using so just basically it

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.680 
of foil paper using so just basically it
blow<00:02:18.520> them<00:02:18.640> down<00:02:18.790> how<00:02:18.970> much<00:02:19.120> pressure<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.630> put

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
blow them down how much pressure you put

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.130 
blow them down how much pressure you put
on<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.050> what<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.010> temperature<00:02:21.490> is<00:02:21.610> at<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.140> how

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
on it what the temperature is at and how

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.960 
on it what the temperature is at and how
long<00:02:23.350> you<00:02:23.530> hold<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.860> there<00:02:24.070> so<00:02:24.460> if<00:02:24.610> something

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
long you hold it there so if something

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.940 
long you hold it there so if something
depend<00:02:25.690> on<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.870> material<00:02:26.260> you're<00:02:26.380> using<00:02:26.590> and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
depend on the material you're using and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.880 
depend on the material you're using and
the<00:02:27.430> type<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.790> um<00:02:27.970> oil<00:02:28.360> paper<00:02:28.600> using<00:02:29.020> it's<00:02:29.800> just

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
the type of um oil paper using it's just

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.440 
the type of um oil paper using it's just
something<00:02:30.310> you're<00:02:30.400> going<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:30.640> work<00:02:30.880> with<00:02:31.090> to

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
something you're going to work with to

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.200 
something you're going to work with to
to<00:02:32.200> see<00:02:32.800> how<00:02:33.340> long<00:02:33.520> you<00:02:33.670> hold<00:02:33.760> it<00:02:33.910> down<00:02:34.000> how

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
to see how long you hold it down how

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.400 
to see how long you hold it down how
much<00:02:34.300> pressure<00:02:34.570> you<00:02:34.810> use<00:02:34.960> and<00:02:35.110> stuff<00:02:35.260> like

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
much pressure you use and stuff like

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.290 
much pressure you use and stuff like
that<00:02:35.620> before<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.190> it's<00:02:36.820> kind<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.120> lot<00:02:37.180> of

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
that before you it's kind of a lot of

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.610 
that before you it's kind of a lot of
trial<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.570> error<00:02:37.690> first<00:02:37.960> but<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.350> once<00:02:38.530> you

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
trial and error first but that once you

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.840 
trial and error first but that once you
get<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.830> hang<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:39.010> it<00:02:39.070> it<00:02:39.370> goes<00:02:39.640> pretty

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
get the hang of it it goes pretty

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.630 
get the hang of it it goes pretty
smoothly<00:02:40.210> it<00:02:41.020> you<00:02:41.440> can<00:02:41.590> get<00:02:41.740> any<00:02:41.890> colored<00:02:42.340> foil

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
smoothly it you can get any colored foil

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.310 
smoothly it you can get any colored foil
paper<00:02:42.850> out<00:02:43.090> there<00:02:43.240> like<00:02:43.450> here's<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.840> silver<00:02:44.080> one

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
paper out there like here's a silver one

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.380 
paper out there like here's a silver one
here's<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.370> black<00:02:45.580> one<00:02:45.880> they've<00:02:46.030> got<00:02:46.180> basically

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
here's a black one they've got basically

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.000 
here's a black one they've got basically
any<00:02:46.750> time<00:02:46.990> anyone<00:02:47.290> out<00:02:47.410> there<00:02:47.440> on<00:02:47.590> this<00:02:47.770> foil

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
any time anyone out there on this foil

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.490 
any time anyone out there on this foil
paper<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:49.390> I'm<00:02:49.510> going<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.720> use<00:02:50.050> gold<00:02:50.320> at<00:02:50.470> the

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
paper and I'm going to use gold at the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.100 
paper and I'm going to use gold at the
time<00:02:50.740> right<00:02:51.310> now<00:02:51.490> for<00:02:52.030> this<00:02:52.120> one<00:02:52.330> but<00:02:52.930> again

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
time right now for this one but again

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.630 
time right now for this one but again
here<00:02:53.290> at<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.410> PDS<00:02:53.770> card<00:02:53.950> we're<00:02:54.280> going<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.490> use

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
here at the PDS card we're going to use

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.820 
here at the PDS card we're going to use
this<00:02:55.090> these<00:02:55.450> are<00:02:55.630> indented<00:02:56.320> numbers<00:02:56.650> here<00:02:56.800> so

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
this these are indented numbers here so

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.070 
this these are indented numbers here so
it<00:02:57.070> will<00:02:57.220> not<00:02:57.400> do<00:02:58.090> anything<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.510> those<00:02:58.600> but<00:02:58.840> the

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
it will not do anything to those but the

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.200 
it will not do anything to those but the
rest<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.380> this<00:02:59.440> stuff<00:02:59.650> is<00:02:59.800> embossed<00:03:00.210> raised

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
rest of this stuff is embossed raised

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.310 
rest of this stuff is embossed raised
and<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.870> will<00:03:02.020> it<00:03:02.710> should<00:03:03.100> color<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.490> gold

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
and it will it should color that gold

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.560 
and it will it should color that gold
we'll<00:03:05.320> just<00:03:05.500> put<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:05.680> in<00:03:05.740> just<00:03:05.860> like<00:03:05.980> that<00:03:06.570> by

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
we'll just put it in just like that by

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.850 
we'll just put it in just like that by
the<00:03:07.630> table<00:03:08.050> into<00:03:08.140> place<00:03:10.290> basically<00:03:11.290> pulls

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
the table into place basically pulls

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:21.240 
the table into place basically pulls
down<00:03:12.100> I<00:03:18.780> held<00:03:19.780> for<00:03:19.840> about<00:03:20.020> five<00:03:20.260> seconds<00:03:20.709> as

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
down I held for about five seconds as

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.699
