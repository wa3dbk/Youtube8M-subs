00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600

in<00:00:25.130> Minnesota<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:27.359> end<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.660> July<00:00:28.050> our

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
in Minnesota this is the end of July our

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.310 
in Minnesota this is the end of July our
our<00:00:29.460> honey<00:00:29.760> flow<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.269> starting<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.720> taper<00:00:30.960> off

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
our honey flow is starting to taper off

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.450 
our honey flow is starting to taper off
and<00:00:31.700> so<00:00:33.079> we<00:00:34.079> probably<00:00:34.350> don't<00:00:34.530> have<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:35.250> as

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and so we probably don't have to have as

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.850 
and so we probably don't have to have as
many<00:00:35.670> supers<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.840> would<00:00:37.079> earlier<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
many supers as we would earlier in the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.940 
many supers as we would earlier in the
season<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.940> colony<00:00:39.570> started<00:00:39.840> as<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> package

season this colony started as a package
it's<00:00:41.190> gotten<00:00:41.550> into<00:00:41.790> three<00:00:42.090> DEP's<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.559> top

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800

box<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.370> full<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.760> honey<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.300> added<00:00:45.510> this

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
box is full of honey and we added this

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.729 
box is full of honey and we added this
super<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.469> couple<00:00:47.070> weeks<00:00:47.280> ago<00:00:48.289> you<00:00:49.289> always<00:00:49.500> want

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
super a couple weeks ago you always want

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.439 
super a couple weeks ago you always want
to<00:00:49.800> put<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> little<00:00:50.340> bit<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.700> smoke<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.239> there

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
to put a little bit of smoke in there

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.910 
to put a little bit of smoke in there
before<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.079> open<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:54.289> so<00:00:55.289> you're<00:00:55.440> not<00:00:55.590> don't

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
before you open it so you're not don't

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.189 
before you open it so you're not don't
get<00:00:56.129> attacked<00:00:56.840> this<00:00:57.840> box<00:00:58.579> top<00:00:59.579> super<00:01:00.120> box<00:01:00.390> was

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
get attacked this box top super box was

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.300 
get attacked this box top super box was
foundation<00:01:02.480> when<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.719> put<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:07.159> there<00:01:08.159> a

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
foundation when we put it on there a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.149 
foundation when we put it on there a
couple<00:01:08.490> ways<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.060> tell<00:01:09.330> how<00:01:10.080> full<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.740> one

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
couple ways to tell how full it is one

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.810 
couple ways to tell how full it is one
is<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.090> look<00:01:12.270> down<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.840> there<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.610> see<00:01:14.610> how

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
is to look down in there and see how

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.030 
is to look down in there and see how
much<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.420> drawing<00:01:15.840> out<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.799> I'm<00:01:16.860> going

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
much of it is drawing out so I'm going

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.030 
much of it is drawing out so I'm going
to<00:01:17.100> guess<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.549> about<00:01:17.850> half<00:01:18.360> full<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.920> other

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
to guess it's about half full the other

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.030 
to guess it's about half full the other
way<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:21.090> lift<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:22.110> after<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.799> do<00:01:23.009> a

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
way is to lift it up after you do a

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.560 
way is to lift it up after you do a
whole<00:01:23.310> bunch<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.670> these<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.880> can<00:01:24.240> just<00:01:24.420> go

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
whole bunch of these you can just go

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.359 
whole bunch of these you can just go
like<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.439> know<00:01:25.619> how<00:01:25.890> heavy<00:01:26.189> it

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
like that and you can know how heavy it

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.560 
like that and you can know how heavy it
is<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:27.360> when<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.049> lift<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.439> up<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:29.270> medium<00:01:30.270> box

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
is but when you lift it up a medium box

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.499 
is but when you lift it up a medium box
like<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:31.409> totally<00:01:32.040> full<00:01:32.509> weighs

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
like this if it's totally full weighs

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.590 
like this if it's totally full weighs
probably<00:01:33.990> 45<00:01:34.680> pounds<00:01:35.520> what<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.729> suggest<00:01:36.390> is

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
probably 45 pounds what I suggest is

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.130 
probably 45 pounds what I suggest is
that<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.110> first<00:01:38.119> however<00:01:39.119> many<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:40.110> to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
that the first however many you have to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.819 
that the first however many you have to
look<00:01:40.560> at<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.579> can<00:01:41.939> tip<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.259> we<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.619> did

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
look at you can tip it like we just did

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.770 
look at you can tip it like we just did
look<00:01:44.100> down<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.270> did<00:01:45.540> and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
look down in it like we just did and

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.260 
look down in it like we just did and
then<00:01:46.350> go<00:01:46.619> through<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.100> see<00:01:47.310> how<00:01:47.549> full<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.090> is

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
then go through and see how full it is

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.749 
then go through and see how full it is
so<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.720> tell<00:01:49.229> how<00:01:50.009> full<00:01:51.259> it<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:53.220> based<00:01:53.579> on

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
so you can tell how full it is based on

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.280 
so you can tell how full it is based on
the<00:01:53.909> weight<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.720> experienced

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.310 

nice<00:02:00.190> so<00:02:01.180> I'm<00:02:01.240> just<00:02:01.420> going<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:01.660> real<00:02:01.870> quickly

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
nice so I'm just going to real quickly

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.470 
nice so I'm just going to real quickly
go<00:02:02.500> through<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.040> see<00:02:03.250> how<00:02:03.460> full<00:02:03.790> each<00:02:04.090> frame

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
go through and see how full each frame

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.660 
go through and see how full each frame
is<00:02:04.750> typically<00:02:05.440> they<00:02:05.620> start<00:02:05.650> filling<00:02:06.370> the

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
is typically they start filling the

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.590 
is typically they start filling the
middle<00:02:07.000> part<00:02:07.960> first

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
middle part first

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.080 
middle part first
they<00:02:10.600> haven't<00:02:10.840> capped<00:02:11.290> any<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.040> yet<00:02:12.250> but

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
they haven't capped any of it yet but

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.720 
they haven't capped any of it yet but
this<00:02:13.300> one<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.690> almost<00:02:14.110> full<00:02:14.500> so<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.370> would<00:02:15.550> say

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
this one is almost full so I would say

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.700 
this one is almost full so I would say
that<00:02:15.940> this<00:02:16.120> box<00:02:16.420> is<00:02:16.690> about<00:02:16.810> half<00:02:17.200> full<00:02:17.560> it's

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
that this box is about half full it's

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.090 
that this box is about half full it's
the<00:02:17.830> only<00:02:17.980> one<00:02:18.280> that's<00:02:18.520> on<00:02:18.730> here<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.240> would<00:02:20.100> at

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
the only one that's on here I would at

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.820 
the only one that's on here I would at
this<00:02:21.190> point<00:02:21.490> just<00:02:22.150> add<00:02:22.390> one<00:02:22.660> more<00:02:22.690> box<00:02:23.230> if<00:02:23.620> this

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
this point just add one more box if this

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.290 
this point just add one more box if this
were<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.040> beginning<00:02:24.610> of<00:02:24.670> July<00:02:24.820> I<00:02:25.030> would

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
were the beginning of July I would

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.930 
were the beginning of July I would
probably<00:02:25.690> add<00:02:25.870> two<00:02:26.170> boxes<00:02:26.710> now<00:02:27.430> here<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:27.760> can

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
probably add two boxes now here you can

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.390 
probably add two boxes now here you can
see<00:02:28.150> they<00:02:28.330> started<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:28.930> cap<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.860> means<00:02:30.130> that

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
see they started to cap that means that

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.750 
see they started to cap that means that
those<00:02:30.640> are<00:02:31.110> completely<00:02:32.110> filled<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.760> they've

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
those are completely filled and they've

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.700 
those are completely filled and they've
dried<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.270> down<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.810> now<00:02:34.900> they<00:02:35.110> put<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.470> cap

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
dried it down and now they put the cap

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.860 
dried it down and now they put the cap
over<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.280> seal<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.820> until<00:02:37.540> winter<00:02:38.850> or<00:02:39.850> in<00:02:40.750> this

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
over to seal it until winter or in this

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.020 
over to seal it until winter or in this
case<00:02:41.110> until<00:02:41.530> we<00:02:41.680> take<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:42.040> off<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.400> extract<00:02:42.850> it

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
case until we take it off and extract it

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.230 
case until we take it off and extract it
but<00:02:44.020> they<00:02:44.170> don't<00:02:44.320> know<00:02:44.500> that<00:02:45.000> it's<00:02:46.000> hard<00:02:46.150> to

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
but they don't know that it's hard to

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.270 
but they don't know that it's hard to
tell<00:02:46.510> here<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.530> honey<00:02:47.710> looks<00:02:47.980> black

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
tell here and the honey looks black

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.100 
tell here and the honey looks black
because<00:02:48.610> there's<00:02:48.790> black<00:02:49.000> foundation<00:02:49.690> okay

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
because there's black foundation okay

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.199 
because there's black foundation okay
so<00:02:50.530> I'm<00:02:50.620> going<00:02:50.770> to<00:02:50.830> take<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.130> sample<00:02:51.490> and<00:02:51.940> see

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
so I'm going to take a sample and see

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.170 
so I'm going to take a sample and see
what<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.260> honey<00:02:53.470> looks<00:02:53.800> like<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.850> can<00:02:55.000> just

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
what the honey looks like you can just

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.010 
what the honey looks like you can just
poke<00:02:55.420> your<00:02:55.470> eye<00:02:56.470> tool<00:02:57.190> in<00:02:57.430> like<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.810> can

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
poke your eye tool in like that you can

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.170 
poke your eye tool in like that you can
see<00:02:59.230> that's<00:02:59.470> it's<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:00.220> little<00:03:00.730> bit<00:03:00.880> of<00:03:01.000> yellow

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
see that's it's a little bit of yellow

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.950 
see that's it's a little bit of yellow
but<00:03:01.480> it's<00:03:01.660> mostly<00:03:02.610> clear

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.810 

going<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.170> try<00:03:07.380> some<00:03:07.710> here<00:03:07.980> too<00:03:08.220> because<00:03:08.610> the

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
going to try some here too because the

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.670 
going to try some here too because the
wax<00:03:09.030> looked<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.660> little<00:03:09.960> bit<00:03:10.110> darker<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:13.560> look

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
wax looked a little bit darker so look

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.800 
wax looked a little bit darker so look
at<00:03:13.800> that<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.400> bees<00:03:14.640> already<00:03:15.120> get<00:03:15.390> ready<00:03:15.660> to

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
at that that bees already get ready to

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.630 
at that that bees already get ready to
put<00:03:15.990> it<00:03:16.110> back<00:03:16.140> where<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.560> belongs<00:03:16.920> isn't<00:03:17.490> like

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
put it back where it belongs isn't like

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:27.220 
put it back where it belongs isn't like
where<00:03:17.820> I<00:03:17.850> put<00:03:18.090> it

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.380 

crazy<00:03:27.950> beekeeper<00:03:28.610> but<00:03:28.910> it<00:03:29.030> where<00:03:29.209> it's

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
crazy beekeeper but it where it's

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.250 
crazy beekeeper but it where it's
supposed<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.870> go<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:31.370> sometimes<00:03:32.000> this<00:03:32.840> last

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
supposed to go that sometimes this last

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.250 
supposed to go that sometimes this last
frame<00:03:34.989> they're<00:03:35.989> not<00:03:36.200> doing<00:03:36.590> much<00:03:36.830> out<00:03:37.130> here

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
frame they're not doing much out here

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.490 
frame they're not doing much out here
and<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:40.310> try<00:03:40.580> to<00:03:40.610> encourage<00:03:40.849> them<00:03:41.480> to<00:03:41.510> build

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
and to try to encourage them to build

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.120 
and to try to encourage them to build
that<00:03:43.989> stronger<00:03:44.989> on<00:03:45.110> this<00:03:45.319> side<00:03:45.560> I<00:03:45.590> turn<00:03:46.010> it

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
that stronger on this side I turn it

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.860 
that stronger on this side I turn it
around<00:03:46.280> so<00:03:46.790> that<00:03:46.970> that's<00:03:47.870> now<00:03:48.260> on<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.800> inside

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.690 

and<00:03:53.870> I'll<00:03:54.319> do<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.739> same<00:03:55.010> thing<00:03:55.340> with<00:03:55.519> the

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
and I'll do the same thing with the

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.770 
and I'll do the same thing with the
frame<00:03:56.030> on<00:03:56.330> this<00:03:56.599> end<00:04:01.030> like<00:04:02.030> this<00:04:02.239> one<00:04:02.510> they've

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
frame on this end like this one they've

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.770 
frame on this end like this one they've
done<00:04:02.989> very<00:04:03.019> little<00:04:03.410> on<00:04:04.010> either<00:04:04.280> side<00:04:04.700> and<00:04:05.000> so

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
done very little on either side and so

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.309 
done very little on either side and so
I'm<00:04:05.930> going<00:04:06.140> to<00:04:06.230> put<00:04:06.500> it<00:04:06.620> as<00:04:06.830> the<00:04:07.310> second<00:04:07.760> frame

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
I'm going to put it as the second frame

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:14.740 
I'm going to put it as the second frame
over<00:04:09.319> I<00:04:10.900> have<00:04:11.900> a<00:04:12.069> new<00:04:13.069> super<00:04:13.580> here<00:04:13.880> empty<00:04:14.299> super

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
over I have a new super here empty super

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.319 
over I have a new super here empty super
this<00:04:15.380> one<00:04:15.709> still<00:04:16.489> has<00:04:17.530> Foundation<00:04:18.530> and<00:04:19.180> so<00:04:20.180> I'd

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
this one still has Foundation and so I'd

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.120 
this one still has Foundation and so I'd
like<00:04:20.479> to<00:04:20.540> put<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:20.989> on<00:04:21.169> the<00:04:21.440> bottom<00:04:21.620> so<00:04:22.040> I'm

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
like to put it on the bottom so I'm

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:33.580 
like to put it on the bottom so I'm
going<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.400> take<00:04:22.639> this<00:04:25.090> box<00:04:26.090> of<00:04:26.620> honey<00:04:27.620> off

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:53.850 

minun<00:04:34.590> minun<00:04:34.920> a<00:04:37.460> pretty<00:04:38.460> heavy<00:04:38.670> actually

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.770 

the<00:04:54.860> bee<00:04:55.070> seemed<00:04:55.430> to<00:04:55.640> draw<00:04:55.850> foundation<00:04:56.630> out

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
the bee seemed to draw foundation out

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.840 
the bee seemed to draw foundation out
better<00:04:57.080> when<00:04:57.380> it's<00:04:57.590> down<00:04:57.860> closer<00:04:58.280> to<00:04:58.520> the

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
better when it's down closer to the

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.720 
better when it's down closer to the
brood<00:04:59.090> nest<00:04:59.120> and<00:04:59.690> so<00:05:00.500> it's<00:05:00.680> best<00:05:00.980> to<00:05:01.160> have<00:05:01.250> that

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
brood nest and so it's best to have that

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.870 
brood nest and so it's best to have that
underneath<00:05:02.440> if<00:05:03.440> the<00:05:03.980> box<00:05:04.220> that<00:05:04.460> we<00:05:04.640> brought

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
underneath if the box that we brought

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.420 
underneath if the box that we brought
out<00:05:05.120> for<00:05:05.420> a<00:05:05.480> super<00:05:06.020> was<00:05:06.290> already<00:05:06.740> drawn<00:05:07.040> comb

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
out for a super was already drawn comb

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.760 
out for a super was already drawn comb
that<00:05:07.760> we<00:05:07.910> extracted<00:05:08.630> honey<00:05:08.870> from<00:05:09.170> last<00:05:09.470> year

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
that we extracted honey from last year

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:23.010 
that we extracted honey from last year
we<00:05:10.340> would<00:05:10.550> have<00:05:10.670> just<00:05:10.910> put<00:05:11.120> it<00:05:11.240> on<00:05:11.390> to<00:05:11.690> the<00:05:11.840> top

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.809 

so<00:05:23.560> now<00:05:23.740> they're<00:05:23.949> happy<00:05:24.190> to<00:05:24.460> have<00:05:24.550> a<00:05:24.580> whole

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
so now they're happy to have a whole

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:31.949 
so now they're happy to have a whole
nother<00:05:25.060> box<00:05:25.419> to<00:05:25.690> fill<00:05:25.900> up<00:05:28.949> Rock
