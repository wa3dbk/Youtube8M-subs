00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.440
 let's see the fashion davis changes 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.440
 constantly I believe that the great 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.720
 question is how does a designer with that 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.010
 piece that model that is going to be the 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.860
 true that we have action on the subject of 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.820
 the ternas of which I do not think so much 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.610
 when you sometimes go to stores to 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.140
 Fabric fairs stores always 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.330
 for some are with supposedly the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.010
 trends and I always go and of equal value 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.210
 you have these colors this the 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.190
 transparent textures I do not know how much it's worth 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.449
 for having now the boy I have seen that 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.670
 I know that's what he's going to paint the 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.290
 time to look for something other than 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.089
 follow it you have to try to create the envelope 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.650
 everything you can have was sold out 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.330
 street from all coexists well and which is 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.710
 that garment that you recommend for this 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.320
 summer that I would tell you that any 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.120
 garment while being clean 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.629
 let's think about a shorts for the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.430
 Boys 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.739
 is that you do not even cost yourself 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.360
 if you get to see footballers 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.220
 the 70s and they all leave with their pants 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.500
 short I want the one who can to 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.720
 outside of the same is not that for girl 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.260
 a shirt like a little big one 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.000
 shirt like those guys a shirt 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.960
 like but as you can see is something like 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.970
 as also with 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.650

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.450

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:38.739
 done a lot of damage in football I would tell you 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.170
 like the rollito as it was called the 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.879
 metrosexual I think that many years ago 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.769
 when we go and now how do you end up like 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.889
 the penalties of hairless throws and 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:52.959
 depilated eyebrows that also sing the 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:55.209
 mirrors nothing to see also has like 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.500

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.090
 world and how what it is what but 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.950
 that as much as they go worse now that 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.689
 start the Galician youth has seen 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.150

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.250

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.850
