00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
castle as I was saying so maybe go ahead

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.430 
castle as I was saying so maybe go ahead
and<00:02:32.390> do<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:32.690> it's<00:02:32.900> actually<00:02:33.200> not<00:02:33.380> very

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
and do that it's actually not very

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.850 
and do that it's actually not very
expensive<00:02:34.690> now<00:02:35.690> I'm<00:02:35.870> gonna<00:02:36.020> go<00:02:36.290> back<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.740> the

victory screen and click start war I

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.900 
victory screen and click start war I
thought<00:02:39.560> maybe<00:02:39.740> there<00:02:40.070> would<00:02:40.160> be<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.370> cooldown

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
thought maybe there would be a cooldown

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.690 
thought maybe there would be a cooldown
period<00:02:41.290> after<00:02:42.290> you<00:02:42.500> just<00:02:42.980> had<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.190> war<00:02:43.459> so<00:02:43.670> I
