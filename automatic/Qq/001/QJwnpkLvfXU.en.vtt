later on throughout the season exactly
the<00:00:17.730> same<00:00:17.910> shape<00:00:18.210> just<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.600> different

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
the same shape just a different

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.470 
the same shape just a different
construction<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.150> little<00:00:21.750> bit<00:00:22.820> heavier<00:00:23.820> so

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
construction a little bit heavier so

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.720 
construction a little bit heavier so
better<00:00:25.199> suitable<00:00:25.650> for<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> touring<00:00:26.310> obviously

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
better suitable for a touring obviously

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.880 
better suitable for a touring obviously
and<00:00:26.910> for<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.240> not<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:27.720> performers<00:00:28.230> orientated

peddler<00:00:29.490> are<00:00:29.609> there<00:00:29.849> so<00:00:30.779> what<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:31.019> got<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.380> is

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
peddler are there so what we got here is

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.630 
peddler are there so what we got here is
the<00:00:33.090> first<00:00:33.390> race<00:00:33.840> board<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.680> taboo<00:00:35.340> has

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the first race board that taboo has

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.270 
the first race board that taboo has
brought<00:00:36.360> out<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.840> phobia<00:00:37.559> which<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.160> know

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
brought out and phobia which you know

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.790 
brought out and phobia which you know
really<00:00:38.850> really<00:00:39.149> extremely<00:00:39.450> hard<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:40.079> coming

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
really really extremely hard on coming

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.680 
really really extremely hard on coming
up<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.129> design<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.579> would<00:00:42.210> not<00:00:42.390> only<00:00:42.420> be

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
up with a design that would not only be

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.810 
up with a design that would not only be
fast<00:00:43.110> but<00:00:43.410> very<00:00:43.770> very<00:00:43.860> stable<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.640> that's

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
fast but very very stable and that's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.819 
fast but very very stable and that's
where<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.570> know<00:00:45.690> over<00:00:45.960> 20<00:00:46.230> years<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.469> shaping

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
where you know over 20 years of shaping

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.220 
where you know over 20 years of shaping
experience<00:00:47.550> comes<00:00:47.820> into<00:00:48.149> play<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.660> lot<00:00:49.140> of

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
experience comes into play a lot of

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.690 
experience comes into play a lot of
manufacturers<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.890> stand-up<00:00:50.250> paddleboards

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
manufacturers of stand-up paddleboards

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.279 
manufacturers of stand-up paddleboards
these<00:00:50.850> days<00:00:51.120> they<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.600> want<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.809> get<00:00:52.230> some

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
these days they just want to get some

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.100 
these days they just want to get some
boards<00:00:52.890> out<00:00:53.039> there<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.629> taboos<00:00:54.629> approach<00:00:54.930> has

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
boards out there and taboos approach has

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.799 
boards out there and taboos approach has
always<00:00:55.230> been<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:56.309> want<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.789> really<00:00:57.329> really<00:00:57.570> good

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
always been we want a really really good

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.720 
always been we want a really really good
shape<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.320> suitable<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.160> majority<00:00:59.399> of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
shape and suitable for a majority of

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.330 
shape and suitable for a majority of
riders<00:01:00.180> out<00:01:00.300> there<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:01.170> business<00:01:01.710> I'll<00:01:02.070> take

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
riders out there so business I'll take

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.700 
riders out there so business I'll take
you<00:01:02.550> through<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.660> shape<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.989> little<00:01:04.019> bit<00:01:04.350> so

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
you through the shape a little bit so

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.440 
you through the shape a little bit so
we've<00:01:04.890> got<00:01:05.100> quite<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.000> nice<00:01:06.500> big<00:01:08.060> bow<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
we've got quite a nice big bow up the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.390 
we've got quite a nice big bow up the
front<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.140> will<00:01:10.439> presumably<00:01:10.920> cut

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
front so that will presumably cut

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.590 
front so that will presumably cut
through<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> waves<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.180> little<00:01:12.390> bit<00:01:12.510> better

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
through the waves a little bit better

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.190 
through the waves a little bit better
and<00:01:13.820> reduces<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> water<00:01:15.150> coming<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
and reduces the water coming on to the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.480 
and reduces the water coming on to the
dig<00:01:16.520> so<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.580> get<00:01:17.759> quite<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> nice<00:01:18.299> smooth

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
dig so you get quite a nice smooth

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.120 
dig so you get quite a nice smooth
rayline<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.210> way<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.780> tail<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.350> what

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
rayline all the way to the tail and what

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.910 
rayline all the way to the tail and what
we<00:01:23.250> got<00:01:23.430> then<00:01:23.640> down<00:01:24.330> here<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.930> very<00:01:25.650> very

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
we got then down here is a very very

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.510 
we got then down here is a very very
sharp<00:01:26.220> edge<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:27.000> only<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> last<00:01:28.320> food<00:01:29.189> off

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
sharp edge but only on the last food off

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.690 
sharp edge but only on the last food off
the<00:01:29.729> board<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:31.220> obviously<00:01:32.220> reduces

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the board and that is obviously reduces

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.060 
the board and that is obviously reduces
the<00:01:32.850> drag<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.479> gives<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.140> really<00:01:34.710> really

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
the drag and gives you really really

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.090 
the drag and gives you really really
smooth<00:01:35.369> water<00:01:36.210> release<00:01:36.659> interesting<00:01:37.650> tale<00:01:37.890> as

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
smooth water release interesting tale as

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.289 
smooth water release interesting tale as
well<00:01:38.509> so<00:01:39.740> this<00:01:40.740> also<00:01:40.979> has<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.610> lot<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.119> do<00:01:42.270> with

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
well so this also has a lot to do with

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.020 
well so this also has a lot to do with
less<00:01:42.840> drag<00:01:43.229> less<00:01:43.560> drag<00:01:43.829> obviously<00:01:44.189> means<00:01:44.460> much

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
less drag less drag obviously means much

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.950 
less drag less drag obviously means much
faster<00:01:45.570> board<00:01:45.810> speed<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.479> if<00:01:48.479> we<00:01:48.659> take<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.869> look

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
faster board speed and if we take a look

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.260 
faster board speed and if we take a look
at<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> dick<00:01:49.500> we've<00:01:49.860> got<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> slide<00:01:50.369> concave

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
at the dick we've got a slide concave

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.020 
at the dick we've got a slide concave
here<00:01:51.570> which<00:01:52.140> makes<00:01:52.460> standing<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.640> board<00:01:53.820> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
here which makes standing on the board a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.810 
here which makes standing on the board a
little<00:01:54.420> bit<00:01:54.540> more<00:01:54.950> easy<00:01:55.950> especially<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.610> chop

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
little bit more easy especially in chop

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.899 
little bit more easy especially in chop
now<00:01:57.420> again<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.869> most<00:01:58.049> important<00:01:58.770> thing<00:01:59.009> on

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
now again the most important thing on

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.090 
now again the most important thing on
this<00:02:00.210> design<00:02:00.659> was<00:02:00.689> not<00:02:00.990> only<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.649> create<00:02:01.950> a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
this design was not only to create a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.149 
this design was not only to create a
really<00:02:02.520> really<00:02:02.640> fast<00:02:03.030> board<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:04.049> also<00:02:04.229> stable

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
really really fast board but also stable
