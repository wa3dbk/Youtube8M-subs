00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 hello everybody it's maxime 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.990
 I hope you are well 1 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.870
 million euros Monday for the first 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.000
 tasting Japanese sweets then 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.650
 I thought it would be better to 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.660
 you see me in fact what material 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.040
 too much while I tasted a little bit to 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.920
 each candy each video I will 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.449
 do it then at the beginning we will start with 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.529
 I think we will make a good bulwark 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.789
 good time since I'm not going to do 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.410
 a lot of videos I'm not going to 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.580
 buy a lot of sweets because 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.859
 that it is expensive especially the expenses of 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.570
 port and costs quite expensive 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.340
 so I'm going to make a treat 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.990
 proper and when it's the same 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.480
 treats for example are two bars 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.430
 it's the same cereal bars I 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.930
 eat them but at the same time like that 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.820
 well I can not make a video for myself 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.930
 a beard is useless but by 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.020
 treats I think I'll do that 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.980
 so let's start with those I have 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.870
 show what it looks like 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.360
 that's it and the back is called the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.559
 words like the immo caue kg or so that 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.129
 not written like that is pronounced 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.359
 m chaos and macao immo h im to 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.300
 teams or ass that cool 63 cents the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.589
 little package like that and you will find 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.880
 that in the description I put a site 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.560
 which is called as said saad 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.180
 if you are interested past of supers 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.860
 good there there are chocolates and at 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.040
 candy there is what else 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.210
 there are also small cabinets late 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.159
 it's really kind of food 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.750
 noodles of the fanta or reason in 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.939
 his ranks full of stuff will captivate everything 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.040
 that as time goes by 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.479
 please and so we will start with 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.250
 the words that broccoli word cloud then 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.820
 it seems to be scrolling so done 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.220
 scroll down melon boom drain then bring back 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.549
 I learned to bring back actually 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.700
 it is the soda his sodas in Japan so we 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.140
 will open that I hope the quality 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.450
 audio she's not too disgusting 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.189
 since I use the iphone 5 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.680
 I do not know if the video will have to be top 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.549
 if it's not it was really despicable I 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.390
 would change but the province is in 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:59.070
 level quantity good so in Japan I have 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.719
 may have noticed that level quantity is 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.340
 because she better elsewhere 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.600
 I believe there is carla the booth is 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.390
 ok good then the enemy we actually did that 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.370
 in the package at the same time you me 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.780
 say it costs 63 cents is actually 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.700
 if you cut in mud 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.290
 it's full of son we'll say that 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.060
 like that but it's true that level 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.550
 quantity Japan is a little bit 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.170
 it's ok 1 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.790
 what is this expression suffering so 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.740
 here we have the two sons the son at 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.420
 melon and yarn with soda 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.440
 so listen we'll taste it all from 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:53.160
 next I suggest you to taste them 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:55.350
 sodas first it's not deueu it's 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.790
 not excellent either 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.080
 eat and you see I would have believed more 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.730
 whether it's a little bit like sending 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.750
 the sons at the bakery of the species of 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.220
 green red thread and a bit with a 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.650
 texture like that but not at all 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.910
 it's a bit of a texture a little more I 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.380
 do not know if pasty it's the word 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.959
 I'm trying to show you a little bit 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.590
 what does it look like I do not know if I can 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:22.980
 to do focus on that I tried to 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.299
 do it like that in sails to me 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.000
 I have to do better 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:30.450
 you see a little this texture a little 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:35.010
 pasty it's not I do not know if I can 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.600
 give it a little like that I do not know if 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.160
 you see I have hair 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.739
 better but that's it's not it's not 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.400
 like the movies of the bakery what 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.329
 good it was pretty good okay 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.459
 do not know how great it is 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:57.329
 excellent but it is eaten and then me 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.440
 presto da honestly it's okay it's 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.769
 not disgusting but on my game did not 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.870
 fifteen what melon that already maintains a 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.489
 little more so I do not think it's okay 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.280
 to be melon fruit chan is rather 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.940
 industrial melon agrees but 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.940
 she will have tasted that 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:32.150
 rommel have already spilled better against 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.760
 the boom have not very pronounced in 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.770
 actually it's that texture a little 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.670
 pasty 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.240
 I do not know if it's really pato but 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:44.140
 let them explain that my words 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.140
 that spoils the taste a bit I find 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.130
 no it's not bad it's not 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:54.050
 bad but I will not have any 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:57.500
 days but yeah 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.460
 honestly that's the issue 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.930
 really how it looks 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:06.490
 a blue wire a green wire soda melon and 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.320
 no if you can like 1 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.400
 but if he were to give a note to this 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.410
 thing I do not know if you want I give 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.400
 notes I do not know I know I 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.410
 know a youtuber called 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.880
 how is his name already 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.310
 I think I think they're called 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.940
 lucas i think he does things like 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.840
 that where he tastes Japanese foods 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.740
 they give notes so I do not know 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.500
 if you want to lead our selves 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.860
 also but if I had to give a note 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.080
 to his honestly I would give I think 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.570
 would give 5 out of 10 or 6th royal and five 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.980
 ten out of ten is really good 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.550
 but it's not top honestly it's 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.890
 really not top 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.120
 I would say yes after that depends on the tastes 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.620
 obviously I give you in relation to 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:47.830
 my tastes but I would say the 5 6 on 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.830
 10 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.160
 but I still have a preference for 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.320
 the melon here I hope you'll have 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.630
 I'm not showing you anyone like 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.910
 that if you are interested if you like 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.970
 a little bit girls that a little bit 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:06.410
 a little bit to say it again, do not you put a 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:09.310
 little you'll love but for those 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.360
 who are not too much that kind of stuff 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.750
 you do not go i think appreciates 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.970
 Verry much 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.380
 in any case level quantity it should 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.669
 still all the time but two finally 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.770
 I mean ok that's great because 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.690
 see big enough dock but I mean 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.400
 he could have put us a little bit 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.560
 more than 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.500
 two son type 2 before not asking 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.199
 the two of them would have been good 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.940
 So here are the words zapped like crime 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:33.580
 to the ku 63 centimes 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.370
 and that's good it's not huge either 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:41.770
 huge it's not very very very expensive I 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:44.199
 see that it's 75 kcal kcal and not good 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.000
 honestly three way without +5 slip on 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:47.770
 10 so I hope you'll have it 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.979
 we have plenty of things left 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.720
 to taste and worry I would do 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:54.340
 a lot of things I knew I 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.740
 have surely tasted something with my girlfriend 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:00.100
 is also another thing with my cane 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:02.169
 friends this is it a little video of 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.789
 seven minutes 7 7 minutes it's not too much 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:05.590
 too long and I think it's nice 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:07.960
 so if you like it tell me and I 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.520
 will continue to do it because it's 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.410
 enjoy tasting with you finally brief 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.580
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.620
 video it's the cam is a little 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.760
 comment what you thought about it and 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.449
 I will leave you the choice for the 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.979
 next video 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:25.630
 I will let you choose between the 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:28.930
 cotton candy that bites with melons and 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.470
 Made everything China and the reasons you 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.490
 lead what you give yourself 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.160
 comments and I'll take the one that 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:35.650
 has made the most everything and raisins 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.820
 and will not wash approved customers so this 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.930
 that I find funny is that we 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.669
 can really fall on stuff 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.560
 disgusting that we can fall on 

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:43.240
 super good stuff so we'll see as 

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.979
 and as we go and meet 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.400
 and here you go hi everyone and 

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:47.400
 wear well
