00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
so much better than last week's chapter

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.730 
so much better than last week's chapter
I<00:00:09.450> felt<00:00:09.840> with<00:00:10.469> that<00:00:10.710> botched<00:00:11.240> elongated

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740

rescue<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.980> Princess<00:00:14.400> Mon<00:00:14.580> chéri<00:00:14.849> though

rescue of Princess Mon chéri though
admittedly<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.440> did<00:00:16.590> get<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.920> see<00:00:16.949> more<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.340> Leo

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
admittedly we did get to see more of Leo

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.730 
admittedly we did get to see more of Leo
which<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.359> guess<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.690> bit<00:00:18.869> too<00:00:19.020> harsh<00:00:19.260> on<00:00:19.500> we

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
which I guess is a bit too harsh on we

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.170 
which I guess is a bit too harsh on we
finally<00:00:20.070> see<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.220> on<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.520> us<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.730> actually<00:00:20.910> do

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
finally see it on to us I actually do

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.390 
finally see it on to us I actually do
something<00:00:21.420> useful<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.930> indeed<00:00:22.650> indeed<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.340> a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
something useful and indeed indeed is a

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.939 
something useful and indeed indeed is a
badass<00:00:24.019> but<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.080> think<00:00:25.380> what's<00:00:25.529> more<00:00:25.710> badass

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
badass but I think what's more badass

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.839 
badass but I think what's more badass
