 It is like this to 253 series of I like special train series 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:34.250
 This bra rail wonder if many years ago 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:37.400
 I wonder if Tatsunja not Do 34 years or passed around another three years 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:42.700
 It was something that was released quite a while ago 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.700
 Extraordinary train series before it becomes fun train series 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.360
 Not but of course now 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:54.930

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:59.400
 Shopping center in the vicinity of the jr Kisuki Station of Kisukeki there without Tamada mount 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.820
 I bought it because I sold it at a fairly low price 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:10.220
 I wonder if it was 1517 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.220
 It is cheaper because the shop is already closed next year next year 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.720
 This is Narita Express 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.700
 It is quite renovated 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.530
 It is written here 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:36.170
 Oh Since this vehicle was the person who still new to this sunlight 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:41.170

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.520
 Introduced to

 This is pretty cool and cool colors 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:08.080
 Because this is the mold is almost Narita Express hook 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.080
 It is a ceremony to raise that stupid 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:17.070

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.070

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.980

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.060
 Is it broken 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.060
 Yes 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.710

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.750

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.470
 up to 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.500
 right 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.860
 Wishes and plastic train curve of time to play 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.860
 The plastic train card may be quite flashy . 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.690
 this 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.920
 I do not know what a bridge in Nikko is 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.920
 Also it comes with a pattern 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:20.290
 Looking at something from the ceiling, it's Narita Express completely 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.290
 red 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.940
 Hmm 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:38.020
 I really don't have Narita Express. 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.260
 This 9 is not new but 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.939
 As we do not have Narita Express itself 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.939
 This mold is the first time 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.480

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:20.609
 This is a mold 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:28.939
 This penetration door in front of here was buried and this window and Kyoku were newly installed 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:28.939
 I was wondering what this mold would be like, but this is a new guy 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:42.950
 With lights or something here I will stay with Ecspace 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:42.950
 It is cosplay you want to be four more and it remains the original mold 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.220
 It is a shade 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:58.860
 It is not a deliberation person, but it is a feeling that the mold of only this face screen has been recovered 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.849
 Is it land play ? 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.790

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.520
 Abene-Abene-Face Eriko 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:56.889

 In old age of this jr is One game is something sloppy feeling 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:08.530

 In the Railway Company East Japan Rail a company to write something 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:14.380

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:20.490

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.170
 If I take the supplies, it 's ok. 

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:15.020
 Something 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.860
 This something good and something Tsu diagonal 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.860
 Something like this 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:23.289
 It 's also annoying to sing too 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:27.419
 Well I say fu 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:27.419
