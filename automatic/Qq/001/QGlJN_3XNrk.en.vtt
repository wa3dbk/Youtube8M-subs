00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
want to see that series back and if I

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.430 
want to see that series back and if I
were<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:10.090> bring<00:04:10.330> it<00:04:10.480> back<00:04:10.660> I<00:04:10.930> think<00:04:11.200> I<00:04:11.320> would

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
were to bring it back I think I would

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.010 
were to bring it back I think I would
maybe<00:04:11.680> only<00:04:11.980> do<00:04:12.190> like<00:04:12.370> two<00:04:12.760> three<00:04:13.360> colors<00:04:13.720> per

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
maybe only do like two three colors per

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.930 
maybe only do like two three colors per
episode<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:14.950> honestly<00:04:15.400> it<00:04:15.550> might<00:04:15.700> only<00:04:15.820> be

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
episode and honestly it might only be

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.729 
episode and honestly it might only be
like<00:04:16.299> a<00:04:16.359> couple<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:16.930> weeks<00:04:17.080> type<00:04:17.410> of<00:04:17.560> thing

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
like a couple of weeks type of thing

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.020 
like a couple of weeks type of thing
because<00:04:18.100> you<00:04:18.250> know<00:04:18.340> eventually<00:04:18.700> we'll

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
because you know eventually we'll

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.700 
because you know eventually we'll
probably<00:04:19.210> run<00:04:19.359> out<00:04:19.480> of<00:04:19.600> colors<00:04:19.840> again<00:04:19.989> until

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:20.710 
probably run out of colors again until

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.980 
probably run out of colors again until
hopefully<00:04:20.950> maybe<00:04:21.370> by<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.609> colors<00:04:22.000> come<00:04:22.390> back

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
hopefully maybe by the colors come back

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.900 
hopefully maybe by the colors come back
