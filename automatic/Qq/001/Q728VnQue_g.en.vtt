00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.590 
running away now I would do back in
there<00:01:38.600> before<00:01:39.010> lilypads<00:01:40.010> destroy<00:01:40.460> or<00:01:41.420> these

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
there before lilypads destroy or these

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.500 
there before lilypads destroy or these
can<00:01:41.750> feel<00:01:41.930> a<00:01:41.960> bit<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.370> destroy<00:01:43.370> boots<00:01:43.610> well

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
can feel a bit to destroy boots well

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.390 
can feel a bit to destroy boots well
then<00:01:44.720> again<00:01:44.810> what<00:01:45.140> doesn't<00:01:45.470> try<00:01:45.680> but<00:01:45.890> I<00:01:46.130> think

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
then again what doesn't try but I think

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.300 
then again what doesn't try but I think
the<00:01:46.670> most<00:01:46.760> fragile<00:01:47.090> item<00:01:47.660> in<00:01:47.900> fair<00:01:48.140> game<00:01:48.410> if

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
the most fragile item in fair game if

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.470 
the most fragile item in fair game if
you're<00:01:49.580> ever<00:01:49.670> underwater<00:01:50.180> and<00:01:50.390> you're

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
you're ever underwater and you're

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.180 
you're ever underwater and you're
starting<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:50.810> drown<00:01:51.110> or<00:01:51.440> something<00:01:51.770> or<00:01:51.980> if<00:01:52.100> you

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
starting to drown or something or if you

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.130

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
just forget radio and water I would just

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.630 
just forget radio and water I would just
say<00:01:54.290> take<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.560> fence<00:01:54.890> with<00:01:55.070> you<00:01:55.190> because<00:01:55.460> if<00:01:55.550> you

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
say take a fence with you because if you

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.430

globe<00:02:51.070> so<00:02:52.070> if<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:53.000> guys<00:02:53.120> want<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.390> try<00:02:53.450> that

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
globe so if you guys want to try that

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.050 
globe so if you guys want to try that
out<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:54.020> definitely<00:02:54.410> suggest<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.790> way<00:02:55.910> this

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
out I definitely suggest it the way this

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.270 
out I definitely suggest it the way this
works<00:02:56.330> is<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:57.110> first<00:02:57.320> row<00:02:57.590> is<00:02:57.800> one<00:02:58.010> point

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
works is the first row is one point

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.520 
works is the first row is one point
second<00:02:58.670> rows<00:02:58.850> two<00:02:59.090> points<00:02:59.480> back<00:02:59.840> rows<00:03:00.170> three

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
second rows two points back rows three

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.260 
second rows two points back rows three
and<00:03:00.950> if<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.130> hit<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.310> one<00:03:01.640> back<00:03:01.850> there<00:03:01.880> you

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
and if you hit that one back there you

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.100 
and if you hit that one back there you
get<00:03:02.360> for<00:03:02.630> fun<00:03:02.870> oh<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:08.090> got<00:03:08.270> it<00:03:08.390> okay<00:03:08.630> awesome

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
get for fun oh I got it okay awesome

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.830 
get for fun oh I got it okay awesome
and<00:03:09.230> yet<00:03:09.860> that's<00:03:10.040> not<00:03:10.160> works

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.660 

fact<00:03:13.840> number<00:03:14.050> seven<00:03:14.590> if<00:03:14.770> you<00:03:14.800> shoot<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.250> regular

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
fact number seven if you shoot a regular

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.280 
fact number seven if you shoot a regular
arrow<00:03:15.880> through<00:03:16.330> lava<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:17.020> lights<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.349> on<00:03:17.410> fire

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
arrow through lava it lights it on fire

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.110
