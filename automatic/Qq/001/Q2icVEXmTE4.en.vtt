00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.609
 start with a cruise trip with i 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.580

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.290
 the marine style predominates 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.780
 while red gives that touch of 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.600
 extra class that makes everything feminine 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.050
 this look among the most elegant that your 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.350

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.520
 then applying the latter on the face 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.220
 on clean skin will give an effect 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.890
