00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.150
 and there are guys welcome the episode 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.309
 6 my career as a player in the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.389
 coritiba today we will finish the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.080
 brazilian championship 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.970
 we will finish the 38 rounds and at the end 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.550
 I'm going to be loaned to a team you 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.460
 should know what it is for the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.810
 cover of the episode but I will not talk if 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.560
 you have not seen I do not want to ruin 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.330
 the surprise 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.000
 I started the first match today. 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.349
 scoring goals four minutes 1 to 0 in 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.870
 top of the Portuguese was a game 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.180
 complicated in curitiba does not help me 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.340
 No, do not press, do not search for the ball. 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.190
 I have to do everything right telling the team I 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.559
 I'm the soul of the team because they do not 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.910
 pressure to get the ball and not attack 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.309
 they attack very little so I have 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.289
 who go there to take the ball out of the opponent 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.899
 the plays and make the tastes I have 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.379
 that I deploy to go out with 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.090
 a favorable scoreline in the game ended 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.590
 the first time with 1 to 0 second 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.260
 time continued attacking continue 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.489
 kicking and in the end after running 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.780
 both get so much ball and went 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.309
 replaced by Alex 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.080
 I 'm always being replaced by him 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.820
 As a player you do not have that much breath 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.170
 can not bear to stay long in the field and 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.880
 I eat the whole time behind the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.280
 ball and making pressure that the team does not 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.350
 makes the second match today is against the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.630
 Basque team but let's play outside 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.280
 home is worth the Brazilian championship there 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.080
 the Brazil Cup we went there in 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.970
 I start when the first of them people 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.580
 I had in the cup of Brazil, I did not participate. 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.630
 I simulated that I was in the bank. 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.670
 reserves was not 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.400
 we had this opportunity with the collection 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.780
 fault but the goalkeeper saved year not 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.450
 we had so many kicks so many 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.670
 clear opportunities not care ball 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.890
 and the Basque took advantage of the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.570
 that they had in the second half I 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.000
 I was still outside the area 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.430
 because it is hard to get through the 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.840
 fifa complicated the plays by the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.450
 field means because it's easier now 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.610
 to play by the tips and aerial ball but there 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.320
 gets very very easy is a fifa bug 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.299
 and I do not want to expose to that book that 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.829
 I will play by the way that my position 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.100
 attacking half 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.799
 then the Basque came back with you all a while 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.840
 and it is in this penalty that they 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.849
 score for 2-0 was 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.179
 complicated for the curitiba as I do not 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.099
 I'm in charge of defense. 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.450
 I can do nothing, I can only ask 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.269
 guys press 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.090
 I can not change tactics or anything then 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.650
 this is to face the charge of cpu and gpu not 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.750
 does a good job on this issue and 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.099
 defense and pressure to steal the ball in the 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.439
 half field or anything so I just 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.450
 I hope they steal the ball and move on. 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.980
 I'm going to simulate the game against 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.260
 Criciuma this time we won the 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.639
 3 to 1 match 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.530
 against the athletic paranaense we also 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.639
 we had to pretend we was not even 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.950
 on the reservation bank 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:40.659
 I went three games without playing 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.879
 first against the criciúma that was 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.769
 suspended because of yellow cards 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.180
 the second against the athletic paranaense 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.340
 I think it's the reform that does not put me 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.629
 in the field and when the black bridge the same 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.879
 thing was not put on the field either 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.129
 we also drew 1 to 1 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.230
 but then the next match after last 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.329
 two weeks without playing was the turn of 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.519
 to play against the club on this page 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.650
 Yes, the holder was not a 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.459
 spectacular match was not nothing at all 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.040
 good 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:09.069
 by the final result and we had but 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.560
 that I claim more is really from the cpu to 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.229
 defensive part of cpu and how I said 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.030
 I'm not in charge of the defense of the folder 

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:17.709
 But I feel like I have to do everything. 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.440
 the team and do not know if it's because of 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.940
 tactic or mode that is career mode 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.260
 player who is like that 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.120
 It's not the first time I 've done a 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.069
 career as a player but they do not 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.090
 Press not to steal the ball and I have 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.699
 what to go back there 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.409
 sometimes play as a steer to steal 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:34.030
 the ball passed someone to the attack and 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:37.180
 got out on the ball 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.919
 and get a kick on goal and doing 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.709
 I get really tired and that's why I 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.549
 I am you are always replaced at the end of the 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.729
 leave from there 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.199
 After 35 to 40 minutes of the matches had 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:49.150
 some attacks is a pressure at the end 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.009
 but it's because we were losing 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.419
 If I had tied, I'm sure it would 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:54.489
 I was not going to make that pressure 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.560
 we end up losing the game but everything 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.790
 the match against Fluminense I did not 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.129
 I was put on the field we go 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.900
 Yes, we lost with one, do not you. 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.129
 put on the field beauty but there in the other 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.449
 departure after the humiliating defeat 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.609
 out of home 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:08.349
 they put me against the international 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.030
 The people and I tell you that it was 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.819
 match that was my best match 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.959
 in this career and these episodes with 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.299
 sure the guys were my best 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.279
 I even start because I look at the goal I scored 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.680
 in the boy's pass back and today he has 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.290
 The way it came here 1 to 0 already at six 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.330
 minutes 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.580
 in the time with 16 minutes of the first 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.980
 time roberto bolle in the mouth of the goal 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.140
 I just kicked in the corner 2-0 with two goals 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.030
 my first time I had to 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.060
 opportunity to expand but is the third 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.460
 goal in the 24th but the goalkeeper defended a 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.780
 good defense and threw for a corner 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.850
 but it does not hurt anyone that before 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.420
 end of the first half, I 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.970
 30 retweet my first first time 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.620
 I made three goals in the match and I was very 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.780
 happy guarantee was by far the best 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.060
 performance but also was only that 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.530
 in the second half the coritiba did not attack 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.350
 more because the result was already done 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.030
 and in 30 6 I only have nor like those 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.680
 best moments for you that only the 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.370
 which was a yellow card that I 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.200
 I received 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.700
 I 'm getting abecs cards now 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.800
 in this championship final 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.420
 but okay the main there that was the 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.220
 my three goals you saw that was mine 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.900
 best match in this episode so I 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.790
 I already scored four goals 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.920
 let's go the last match of the championship 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.930
 guys going to sao paulo in 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.300
 last round of the Brazilian championship 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.340
 closing the championship I cut to the 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.310
 mean he knows how to kick but rafael plays 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.160
 put the ball in the middle and prevented the 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.210
 which would be my ninth goal in the championship 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.890
 I already have eight goals in the 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.290
 championship now this is very good for 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.360
 who plays as an attacking half and almost 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.880
 has worked in the team 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.580
 So I have a lot of possibilities to 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.500
 station wagon needs divided and 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.410
 open a new package of boots on 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.730
 mats avaí only in the next episode 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.020
 We want a new team and I was loaned. 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.970
 to another team 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.680
 and there I go customizable player again 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.930
 I'll see some points that the 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.730
 box office or no new soccer shoes 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.440
 finally we'll give a modified there is a 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.960
 new team new ares 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.970
 is a new challenge and then with the new car 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.980
 also see the score of 2 to 0 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.320
 We are going to win from Sao Paulo 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.070
 in this last round he already had that kick 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.170
 of lack 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.240
 It will be far and my last kick. 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.100
 in the last bid as a player of the 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.140
 Brazilian championship does not race in this 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.850
 championship was that volleyball there but the 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.010
 goalkeeper defended and unfortunately this is 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.000
 a beautiful goal is perhaps the most beautiful 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.070
 in this career 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.960
 After that game, I'll show you a table. 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.820
 of classification for you as finished 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.390
 the Brazilian championship in ninth place 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:31.940
 with 60 points won and balance of less 1 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.689
 but it's okay and I'm finished at 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.429
 20th 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:37.459
 in the championship artillery now eight 

00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:39.289
 goals 20th place in the top 25 for me 

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:41.749
 I like people was very good, it was a 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:42.289
 thing that I am quite happy effect eight 

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:44.599
 goals 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:47.299
 starting as a player in the 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:49.309
 ending the championship with cousins ​​there three 

00:06:47.299 --> 00:06:52.099
 of the four objectives, I just can not 

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:53.749
 to achieve was to create 30 chances of goal I 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:57.649
 I wanted half I made 15 

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:59.749
 but it's okay we 're going there from 67 to 72 

00:06:57.649 --> 00:07:01.729
 our general and in a championship the galera 

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:03.619
 I received this loan proposal 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:05.689

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:07.610
 I'm going to do an internship there in the 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:10.429
 Barcelona the guys I know the team 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.469
 reserve but put the guy called because the 

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:15.289
 barcelona hit the barça and I think it is 

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:17.389
 Good thing then I accepted, we're going. 

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:19.099

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:25.249

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:27.889
 Look at the school of passes that has the 

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:28.550
 barcelona 85% is very much very much 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:30.769
 high 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.599
 they also want an average of 7.8 in 

00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:34.610
 matches which is also quite something 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:37.879
 but come on let's take that challenge 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:40.159

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:43.249
