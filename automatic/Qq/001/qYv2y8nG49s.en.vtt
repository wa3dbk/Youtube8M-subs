notes these scribbles to conclude I've
come<00:00:23.099> up<00:00:23.249> with<00:00:23.300> y1<00:00:24.320> so<00:00:25.320> I'm<00:00:25.560> gonna<00:00:26.339> start<00:00:26.699> with

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
come up with y1 so I'm gonna start with

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.899 
come up with y1 so I'm gonna start with
the<00:00:27.060> firebox<00:00:27.989> which<00:00:28.529> how<00:00:28.679> it<00:00:28.859> has<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.310> water

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:29.909 
the firebox which how it has the water

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:34.220 
the firebox which how it has the water
tubes<00:00:30.349> critters<00:00:31.349> are<00:00:31.439> drawing<00:00:33.110> see<00:00:34.110> where<00:00:34.200> I

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
tubes critters are drawing see where I

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.250 
tubes critters are drawing see where I
go<00:00:34.440> from<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:35.329> I've<00:00:36.329> got<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> rough<00:00:36.660> idea<00:00:36.810> where

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
go from that I've got a rough idea where

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:46.660 
go from that I've got a rough idea where
I<00:00:37.290> wanna<00:00:37.500> go<00:00:37.560> with<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.460> actual<00:00:38.760> main<00:00:39.000> boiler

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:57.200 

stays<00:00:51.410> steam<00:00:52.410> dome<00:00:55.610> material<00:00:56.610> for<00:00:56.790> deforming

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
stays steam dome material for deforming

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.620 
stays steam dome material for deforming
the<00:00:57.270> ends<00:00:58.490> this<00:00:59.490> is<00:00:59.550> my<00:00:59.880> third<00:01:00.120> Boyd<00:01:00.450> I'm

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
the ends this is my third Boyd I'm

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.780 
the ends this is my third Boyd I'm
making<00:01:01.080> now<00:01:01.640> most<00:01:03.409> difficult<00:01:04.409> one<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.799> would

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
making now most difficult one I would

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.100 
making now most difficult one I would
say<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.920> it's<00:01:07.920> gonna<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.490> interesting<00:01:08.900> and<00:01:09.900> I

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
say and it's gonna be interesting and I

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.590 
say and it's gonna be interesting and I
want<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.320> capture<00:01:10.470> each<00:01:10.710> step<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> way

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
want to capture each step on the way

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.720 
want to capture each step on the way
with<00:01:12.600> these<00:01:12.780> videos<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:14.340> more<00:01:14.550> like<00:01:14.700> a

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
with these videos so it's more like a

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.540 
with these videos so it's more like a
lot<00:01:15.030> more<00:01:15.810> than<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.409> tutorial<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:19.550> hopefully

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
lot more than a tutorial and hopefully

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.610 
lot more than a tutorial and hopefully
some<00:01:21.270> people<00:01:21.300> may<00:01:21.630> pick<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.050> some<00:01:22.200> techniques

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
some people may pick up some techniques

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.140 
some people may pick up some techniques
or<00:01:22.920> hopefully<00:01:23.370> some<00:01:23.550> people<00:01:23.580> could<00:01:23.850> show<00:01:24.030> me

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
or hopefully some people could show me

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.260 
or hopefully some people could show me
some<00:01:24.180> ideas<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.890> right<00:01:26.700> away<00:01:26.760> I'm<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.210> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
some ideas so right away I'm going to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.320 
some ideas so right away I'm going to
start<00:01:27.479> with<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:28.310> I've<00:01:29.310> found<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:30.090> piece<00:01:30.300> of

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
start with this I've found a piece of

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.940 
start with this I've found a piece of
our<00:01:30.570> minyan<00:01:31.190> which<00:01:32.190> fits<00:01:32.880> pretty<00:01:33.299> good<00:01:33.620> and<00:01:34.620> I

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
our minyan which fits pretty good and I

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.280 
our minyan which fits pretty good and I
will<00:01:35.100> use<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.610> too<00:01:36.479> when<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.720> drill<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:36.990> holes

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
will use this too when I drill the holes

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.410 
will use this too when I drill the holes
because<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.680> know<00:01:37.740> what's<00:01:38.100> going<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.250> happen

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
because I know what's going to happen

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.270 
because I know what's going to happen
drill<00:01:39.420> bits<00:01:39.600> gonna<00:01:39.750> snag<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.080> bite<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:41.010> I<00:01:41.220> don't

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
drill bits gonna snag a bite and I don't

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.200 
drill bits gonna snag a bite and I don't
want<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.520> ruin<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.820> piece<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.210> copper<00:01:44.210> it's

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
want to ruin this piece of copper it's

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.300 
want to ruin this piece of copper it's
35<00:01:46.049> mil<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.920> Dinah<00:01:47.299> and<00:01:48.710> it's<00:01:49.710> wolfing<00:01:50.130> this

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
35 mil and Dinah and it's wolfing this

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.500 
35 mil and Dinah and it's wolfing this
is<00:01:50.520> one<00:01:51.510> point<00:01:51.780> two<00:01:51.960> millimeters<00:01:53.180> so<00:01:54.180> what

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
is one point two millimeters so what

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.830 
is one point two millimeters so what
we'll<00:01:54.690> do<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.049> mill<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:56.700> slots<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.360> this

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
we'll do is mill the slots in this

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.109 
we'll do is mill the slots in this
so<00:01:58.680> every<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.190> I<00:01:59.220> want<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.490> drill<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> hole<00:01:59.729> I

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
so every one I want to drill a hole I

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.140 
so every one I want to drill a hole I
move<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:01.049> position<00:02:01.520> that<00:02:02.520> way<00:02:02.729> I've

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
move it to the position that way I've

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.590 
move it to the position that way I've
got<00:02:03.680> stability<00:02:04.729> when<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.760> group<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
got stability when I group this in the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.929 
got stability when I group this in the
vise<00:02:06.780> I'm<00:02:06.930> not<00:02:07.049> gonna<00:02:07.170> crush<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.650> and<00:02:07.830> I've<00:02:08.819> got

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:08.939 
vise I'm not gonna crush it and I've got

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.990 
vise I'm not gonna crush it and I've got
clearance<00:02:09.330> we<00:02:09.629> want<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.869> go<00:02:09.959> through<00:02:10.790> so<00:02:11.790> Old

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
clearance we want to go through so Old

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.809 
clearance we want to go through so Old
Mill<00:02:12.260> two<00:02:13.260> flats<00:02:13.560> either<00:02:13.890> side<00:02:14.099> to<00:02:14.640> leather

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
Mill two flats either side to leather

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.570 
Mill two flats either side to leather
swarf<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.450> I'll<00:02:16.080> drill<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.290> big<00:02:16.470> hole

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
swarf and I'll drill a big hole

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.390 
swarf and I'll drill a big hole
clear<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.210> for<00:02:18.600> when<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:19.470> drill<00:02:19.800> through

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
clear and so for when I drill through

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.000 
clear and so for when I drill through
for<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.700> chips
