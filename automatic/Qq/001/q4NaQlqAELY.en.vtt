00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.800
(English translation: Mi42)

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.440
Dear Anonymous

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.260
Forgive me,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.500
but there's only one vacant cockpit

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.180
How many times

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.100
have those words shot down the me of tomorrow?

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.120
"The story is, that stupid guy screwed up
and became food for the dogs"

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.500
It's not a joke

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.780
they said

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.820
and yet again imitated the above

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.960
A smoldering war with the anonymous

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.400
From where are they from?

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.560
Those who dare flee

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.240
The owner of this jesting voice

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.260
laughs on

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.400
at this song of a futile struggle

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.920
Dear you, the pretender

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.340
take this graceless resistance

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.840
It's fine being clumsy

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.820
It's fine being incompetent

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.020
With just that I've been able to sing thus far

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.660
If it comes down to waving a white flag

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.700
Then you might as well

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.720
slit this throat of mine instead

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.920
Leave me alone,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.180
don't stare at us with that expression

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.620
No matter how you put it

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.720
There are no labels differing you and I

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.740
"That idiot's courage burned and crashed so bad,
no matter how much time passes it won't be cured"

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.440
If that's what you say, I get it well enough

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.460
I'm not your ideal kid

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.600
Saluting towards

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.880
The unexpected full crowd of

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.200
Gathered bystanders

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.780
Around here, I hope you drop dead

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.820
I hope you come to an end

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.040
If behind that voice there's blood circulating as well

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.540
Dear you, the pretender

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.040
What is it you want to convey?

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.400
From the darkness

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.480
you throw stones

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.640
But that's not all is it?

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.280
At that core is a black vortex

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.280
How long do you plan

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.280
to burden yourself with it?

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.420
Ah, this dawn has become lifeless

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.960
Where are they from?

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.260
the mastermind

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.120
The owner of the jesting voice

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.280
tries to laugh it off,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.360
Laugh off this song of a futile struggle

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.940
Dear you, the pretender

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.400
take this graceless resistance

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.740
Just wait and see,

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.820
just wait and see

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.960
With just that I've been able to sing thus far

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.580
If it's laughable, then laugh

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.600
Starting from now

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.100
I'm going to sing some miserable lyrics, so

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.500
Give it up already

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.240
and shut up for a bit
