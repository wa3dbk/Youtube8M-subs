00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.430
 higuey very good eyes people such as 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.280
 you are welcome to a new tutorial 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.570
 on how to make a farm plans 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.820
 100% efficient 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.050
 audi people finally the time has come 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.550
 I know the wagons when I'm not looking 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.410
 good good people what is that 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.230
 synths of the system with time this is 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.909
 very simple is the part of the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.220
 belones is worth and then there is the part of 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:33.710
 the wagons are worth what you see 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.960
 the abyss here a veil is worth what 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.430
 they would pick up as you see the wagon do not go 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.140
 up rails were like this continue 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.140
 advancing this I will explain it right now 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.730
 and well let's start with the tutorial 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.080
 good people let's start with the 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.910
 first module and I will teach how 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.490
 hook each other 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.410
 you can also do in the part 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.170
 superior and good let's start 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.870
 quickly here where will grow the 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.150
 two melons we are going to put two pythons 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.030
 sticky and on top of each 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:06.240
 of each block is to see where it is going 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.240
 grow the melon let's put a piston 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.670
 sticky goes to the normal pistons and 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.010
 up the sticky pythons well here 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.260
 let's put the blocks and here in each 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.510
 side of normal pistons or zones 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.580
 break them with candles we're going to put a 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.380
 of the rest I got on top of each one and down 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.420
 let's put a plate that will activate that 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.400
 each of them is worth not we are 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.480
 making a bat suite so that every time 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.420
 that a ball grows 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.640
 automatically next to each melon 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.590
 where is it going to grow in veron worth goes for 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.320
 do here let's put a block 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.930
 terrestrial and one of res with perfect 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.420
 well this would be badly done either 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.890
 that we are going to test it well as you see 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.479
 whenever the melon grows it will break 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.960
 the block without any problem 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.650
 ok but we still need to link it with the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.130
 another good 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.440
 this is going to be quite simple since 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.070
 we are going to serve this this 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.159
 block to do what 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.880
 be here and link it worth here was the 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.310
 melon crop and here in the other vale 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.289
 thus linking people has no more like this 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.170
 they will all go together perfectly 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.490
 a block away well here 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.790
 we will be putting the next block 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.790
 etcetera 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.470
 and here I wanted to bring our culture and 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.840
 another block of remains is perfectly 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.230
 a little to do but it's very very 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.340
 efficient is worth and collects all the sites 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.550
 good people let's start with the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.510
 collection system that here we are going to 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.510
 put and me 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.799
 our chest is worth here and here we are going to 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.489
 put our hopper is worth to catch 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.650
 all the items well here we are going to 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.069
 put a slam to be able to open then the 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.819
 chest 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:59.709
 here we are going to get a propeller king 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.709
 here that will be 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:06.260
 so that we do not leave 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.700
 wagons and here we are going to do this already 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.129
 they say culturally it's worth but it 's for not 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.769
 to explain again changes between that I do not 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.710
 it costs nothing and good here we take a 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.700
 comparator 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:23.770
 here we climb a block a torch 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.390
 another block another block and there a one of 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.670
 reston worth this what he's going to do is 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.410
 that when I get here the wagons with 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.340
 the belones are going to get in here and 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.560
 while I 'm receiving items this this 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.240
 hopper worth the vans are not going to 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.280
 re - arrange your march and go to 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.760
 leave all the items until the 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.710
 have all and continue to do now 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.390
 solving all the melons that go 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:51.690
 Perfect appearing well for the 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:56.800
 favorites move around without a trail 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:58.990
 there must be three vouchers or 244 time 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.260
 it works but the minimum is three 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.260
 that we are going to put a good one if we remove 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.860
 this better 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.610
 1 to see if I lose time 2 and 3 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:16.049
 well and to make sure they do not go away 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:18.690
 over here let's put this has been 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.419
 perfect people and good let's check 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.550
 if it works we put the rest and activate 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.570
 you can not a little the main create the 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.310
 three times 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.270
 a watermelon works 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.620
 woman 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.010
 alive 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.470
 he picks us all up and returns perfectly 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.690
 without any problem he leaves it and goes back to 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.580
 give your table to the people we are going to 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.169
 pay him a moment in two ways this 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.500
 circuit can also be done here 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.970
 it is worth without having to do the 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.990
 trick of the three wagons worth 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.990
 just put you here 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.810
 with rails here it's worth but it works 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.720
 exactly the same and also with a rail 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:03.470
 you have good people, I hope you have 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.310
 liked this tutorial and you already know 5 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.310
