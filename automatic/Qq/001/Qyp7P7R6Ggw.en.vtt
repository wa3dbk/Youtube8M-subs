00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:02.959 
all right so I put my gravity Liberty

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:06.079 
all right so I put my gravity Liberty
cxd<00:00:03.959> together<00:00:04.430> it's<00:00:05.430> fairly<00:00:05.640> easy<00:00:05.790> to

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
cxd together it's fairly easy to

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.730 
cxd together it's fairly easy to
assemble<00:00:06.600> you<00:00:06.810> got<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.020> put<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.230> handlebars

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
assemble you got to put the handlebars

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.890 
assemble you got to put the handlebars
onto<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.639> stem<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.090> tighten<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.510> stem<00:00:09.690> and

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900

onto the stem and tighten the stem and
all<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.200> down<00:00:10.440> put<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.550> skewer<00:00:11.940> on<00:00:12.000> the

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
all that down put the skewer on the

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.010 
all that down put the skewer on the
front<00:00:12.509> wheel<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.719> put<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.259> on<00:00:13.469> pedals<00:00:14.429> and

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
front wheel and put that on pedals and

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.810 
front wheel and put that on pedals and
seat<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.320> that's<00:00:17.130> basically<00:00:17.430> it

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
seat and that's basically it

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.260 
seat and that's basically it
however<00:00:18.859> now<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.039> it's<00:00:20.160> together<00:00:20.310> take<00:00:21.240> a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
however now that it's together take a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.150 
however now that it's together take a
quick<00:00:21.600> look<00:00:21.750> at<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.590> know<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:23.010> basically

quick look at it you know you basically

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.730 
quick look at it you know you basically
can<00:00:23.640> expect<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:24.600> going<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.930> be<00:00:25.019> fairly<00:00:25.350> cheap

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
can expect it's going to be fairly cheap

can expect it's going to be fairly cheap
a<00:00:26.070> lot<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.939> components<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:28.320> know<00:00:28.410> and

a lot of the components you know and

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.720 
a lot of the components you know and
even<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.980> assembly<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.650> first<00:00:31.650> thing<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
even the assembly so first thing the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.440 
even the assembly so first thing the
seats<00:00:33.000> pretty<00:00:34.100> pretty<00:00:35.100> worrisome<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.090> seat

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
the seat post and seat they include you

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.360 
the seat post and seat they include you
can<00:00:46.680> see<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.219> know<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:47.940> not<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.840> has

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
can see it's you know it's not it has

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.979 
can see it's you know it's not it has
quite<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.430> ways<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.640> go<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.360> if<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.629> needed<00:00:51.809> it

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
quite a ways to go so if you needed it

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.479 
quite a ways to go so if you needed it
lower<00:00:52.170> you'd<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.620> cut<00:00:52.860> something<00:00:53.160> or

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
lower you'd have to cut something or

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.099 
lower you'd have to cut something or
whatever<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.239> not<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.379> well-designed<00:00:55.949> I

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
whatever so not that well-designed I

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.900 
whatever so not that well-designed I
notice<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.410> shifted<00:00:58.980> fairly<00:00:59.430> good<00:00:59.640> right<00:00:59.879> out

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
notice it shifted fairly good right out

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.349 
notice it shifted fairly good right out
of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> box<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.660> that's<00:01:00.840> not<00:01:01.469> bad<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.820> welds

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
of the box so that's not bad the welds

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.570 
of the box so that's not bad the welds
look<00:01:03.930> fairly<00:01:04.379> good<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.769> know<00:01:04.830> made<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.220> China

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
look fairly good you know made in China

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.640 
look fairly good you know made in China
so<00:01:05.970> sure<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.720> made<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.080> factory<00:01:07.260> that

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
so sure it's made in a factory that

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.800 
so sure it's made in a factory that
makes<00:01:07.830> bikes<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.970> major<00:01:09.390> brands

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
makes bikes for all the major brands

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.719 
makes bikes for all the major brands
anyway<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.619> no<00:01:10.979> big<00:01:11.189> deal<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:13.100> cabling<00:01:14.100> looks

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
anyway so no big deal the cabling looks

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.440 
anyway so no big deal the cabling looks
pretty<00:01:15.000> sloppy<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:16.710> loose<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.970> probably

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
pretty sloppy and loose so probably

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.280 
pretty sloppy and loose so probably
needs<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:19.110> adjusted<00:01:20.720> one<00:01:21.720> thing<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.140> I'd

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
needs to be adjusted one thing that I'd

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.030 
needs to be adjusted one thing that I'd
noticed<00:01:22.680> was<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:23.100> pretty<00:01:24.060> horrible<00:01:24.420> is

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
noticed was just pretty horrible is

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.859 
noticed was just pretty horrible is
these<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.790> pedals<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.420> wouldn't<00:01:27.810> even

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
these the pedals I wouldn't even

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.069 
these the pedals I wouldn't even
recommend<00:01:28.259> using<00:01:28.590> them<00:01:32.689> there's<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> lot<00:01:33.960> of

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
recommend using them there's a lot of

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.340 
recommend using them there's a lot of
friction<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.590> there

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.070 

that<00:01:39.340> one<00:01:39.490> spins<00:01:39.760> okay<00:01:40.390> but<00:01:40.869> is<00:01:40.960> noisy<00:01:43.080> that

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
that one spins okay but is noisy that

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.180 
that one spins okay but is noisy that
one<00:01:44.320> sounds<00:01:45.040> like<00:01:45.070> this<00:01:45.250> just<00:01:45.630> stand<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:48.070> know
