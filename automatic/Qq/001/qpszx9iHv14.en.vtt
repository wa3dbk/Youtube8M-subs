00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.410
 how about friends how are the theme of 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.720
 this video is powers in notation 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.570
 scientific and we will perform the 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.340
 next exercise 5 by 10 at least 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.740
 2 and everything raised to the bucket 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.980
 we are going to apply laws of exponents 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.760
 first 5 we are going to elevate it to the cube and what 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.430
 we write within a parenthesis 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.500
 in the same way within a 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.500
 parentheses 10 at least 2 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.060
 and it will also be elevated to the cube 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:48.290
 we continue to continue to apply laws of 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:52.340
 the exponents 5 cubed is 125 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.920
 for now * 10 2 3 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.920
 let's write the same base that is 10 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.230
 and the exponents will multiply the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.190
 3 as no sign is seen indicates that it is 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.590
 positive 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.160
 first law of signs plus x minus is 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:11.240
 less then multiplication 3 times 2 is 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.860
 6 we continue now kids remember that 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.650
 the result in scientific notation 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.380
 it should always be between 1 and 10 if 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.350
 it can be 1 but it can not be 10 and 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.720
 the 125 is going to happen then we're going to 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.000
 convert for that let's use this 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.670
 up here as it is a whole number 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.610
 the 125 decimal point is found 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.830
 here and for this amount to be between 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.080
 1 and 10 we are going to cross this point 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.710
 decimal two places to the left and 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.780
 we do it 12 is to say the decimal point 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.670
 is going to move here and we're going to have 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.580
 the amount between 1 and 10 that is 1.25 that 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.950
 multiply to a base of 10 and for the 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.210
 exponent of this base of 10 we use 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.100
 the above 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.100
 as from the decimal point I 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.619
 travel two places to the left 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.820
 to the exponent we had that was less 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:07.009
 6 we are going to add 2 minus six plus two 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.709
 that are from the places that I moved is 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.319
 equal to minus four and this minus four 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.510
 is the exponent of base 10 so 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.900
 both boys the result of raising the 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.700
 cube this scientific annotation is 1.25 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.700
 by 10 at least 4
