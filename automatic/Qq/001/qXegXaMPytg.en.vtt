00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.640
 Hello everyone and today I want you 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.099
 tell a bit of your shopping well 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.740
 First, once again, we fixed 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.870
 price once again I grabbed this 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.299
 embroidery 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:19.640
 Of course, many probably say that 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:23.550
 embroidery there is nothing at all as we 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:27.779
 a waste of money on these fish very 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.500
 I have already seen lovely ones 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.500
 the internet 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:38.100
 strings of course there are very few of them and their 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.200
 not enough for anything bad quality 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.040
 so 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:47.309
 of course you need to embroider with your own strings 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.879
 outline here would be starched with y so 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.449
 drawing though many girls wrote that 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.449
 do not embroider better 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.730
 flip and stitch on the clean side 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:03.229
 but I do not know, and the team will take to or 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:08.400
 No, I liked them very much 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:12.180
 a bottle here is so good for everyone 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.590
 case may ever be the thing here 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:20.150
 so then went to the handicraft shop and 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:25.560
 he liked his husband 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:28.829
 a kitten in a shoe so he's on his 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.009
 discretion as it picked in a pair 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.790
 setters now I and 2 will show it 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.290
 it means a set of Aries I never embroidered 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:44.369
 you see, I want to try on a crow 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.530
 The size 24 on 26 by the way was surprised that on 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.680
 set nothing written outline of what 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:54.659

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:58.950

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.250
 Needle nothing 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.979

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.399

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.400

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.730

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.230

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.189

 hands reached for embroidery threw everything and 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:13.680
 I began to try by the way I will show 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:19.290
 two days that I cut off so I washed down the hoop 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:23.010

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.590

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.470
 summer is the thing 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:33.440
 Well, also in the theme of embroidery 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:38.370

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.190
 Great Britain 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:55.769

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.099
 asked to remake to do well and another 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.669
 Well, as of now any relevant 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:07.739
 embroidered flowers on the clothes I have found the scheme 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:11.479
 such a rose picked up strings from that 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:15.359
 what was at home but also tried it 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:19.200
 so above I do not know how good 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:23.130

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:26.680

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:36.190
 this is jeans rest there wool mixture 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:39.900
 acrylic in general is different and means told her 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:45.010
 that this rose and what do you think 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:50.490
 we do not buy for it as a gift 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:54.040
 such a set is a set of panel 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.800
 embroidery ribbons ribbons never 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.170
 did not try to take in and have no idea 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.770
 how does it embroider such a bouquet with 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:07.750
 called sunflower opened it 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:12.190
 girls in general there was such a scheme 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.470
 there is a lot of drawing here 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.370
 of course 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:22.840
 instructions on how to translate this all 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:27.460
 there are all sorts of qi rush throw tape 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:31.990
 all this should be read to study the outline here 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:42.360
 then it is generally like cloth 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:47.490
 It looks like a flax and what are two needles for 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:53.980
 tapes and probably not for the bundled 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:06:03.000
 then here are different tapes here 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:06.400
 such and strings I donâ€™t know of course 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.920
 beautifully all ribbons are generally satin 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:16.860
 shimmer here they are wider in a puddle 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:21.790
 different different well how is all embodiment 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:24.700
 so a little bit I looked these videos 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:28.260
 all the petals need all this somehow 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:33.340
 tuck erect nodules here 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:36.400
 the middle of all sorts of type tanchiki that is 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:39.160
 as they recommend you first need this 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.840
 scheme translate into fabric through 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:47.229
 copy paper either through glass and 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:50.910
 then these flowers are all sewn off but 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:55.260
 maybe someday of course and ripen 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:58.990
 but while here so this here is my 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:02.229
