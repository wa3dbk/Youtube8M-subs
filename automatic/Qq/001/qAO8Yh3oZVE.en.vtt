00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:02.560
 greetings everyone 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.150
 in this presentation but let's go from amino acids and an introduction to 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:10.149
 proteins 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.499
 proteins are biological molecules consisting of a chair 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.599
 and throw me in the United States publications peptide 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.450
 responsible for carrying out various functions within the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.869
 notably acting as agent simmons 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.800
 substances that catalyze biological reactions gradually increasing 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.720
 their speeds 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.770
 will figure on the side we have the example of advantage 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.770
 Nuclear arrigo and art 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.010
 the proteins can be forced by 20 different types of amino acids 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.310
 and each of them is a molecule consists of insurance of the world 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.470
 the seventh 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.060
 in the position called alfano carbon 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.540
 painted black 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.050
 al qosi free 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.970
 there is no way of hydrogen painted gray 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.320
 the lena group 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.860
 painted blue 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.040
 the carboxylic acid group 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.520
 in taste note 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.520
 and also a bitch will have the radical 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.610
 painted green 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.710
 which will rule in August for less 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.909
 as such the molecule possolo 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.220
 no croup 1m 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.760
 in an easy group 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.760
 hence the name is there anyway 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.770
 with regard to the functions of amino acids 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.190
 can be several 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.980
 some examples 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.910
 this component these proteins 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.800
 acts as neurotransmitters 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.450
 transport domestic production 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.680
 and functions as precursors in the synthesis of various biological molecules 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.060
 in general 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.190
 the two basic forms of negotiation through the ingestion of 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.860
 food 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.170
 the accident within the cells themselves 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.549
 generally the organisms are not able to synthesize all 20 types 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.600
 of amino acids that make up the proteins 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.740
 thus 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.270
 we can classify amino acids into two types for a given 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.819
 experience 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.259
 unless they are essential 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:17.909
 are those that can be synthesized by the body's own cells 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:23.459
 thus not necessarily have to be omitted 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.579
 unless the census takers 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.579
 are those that the organism is not able to synthesize 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:33.689
 thus it must be obtained by feeding 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.749
 in the figure beside 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:40.969
 north that the brook these parents beans are able to provide humans 

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.619
 all essential amino acids 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:52.419
 the amino acids are friends and leaving by peptide bonds 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:54.879
 on pole 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.840
 the grouping of one of them and civic something will never be the next 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.369
 really good 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:05.749
 cv the formation of a connection to PT is a symbiosis for 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:07.429
 dehydration 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:11.399
 one of them is the diagnosis of detainees' colleagues 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.349
 are called repetitive 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.839
 the proteins 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:20.319
 due to the fact that they generally consist of several amino acids are 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.319
 also called colíder sold 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.299
 from these 90 kilometers of the southern border we can identify four thousand 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.489
 cousin study 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.759
 consists of the amino acid sequence that makes up the protein 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.759
 it's not the matter 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.949
 the secondary structure consists of a first level of helical bearing 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.179
 of prodrive 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:55.749
 thanks to the interactions generally of type hydrogen bonds 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.439
 among these animals 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.889
 forming structures known as alpha helices 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.889
 and went on sales 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.209
 the structure is the three-dimensional shape that the molecule of 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.279
 protein that he autographed about himself 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:18.749
 thanks to the interactions between his students 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:22.059
 this structure is determined by the sequence of dead 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.580
 and this structure 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.580
 which determines the function of the prodem 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.629
 the quaternary structure consists of two or more seats by PT 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.340
 together the return is as soon as possible 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.180
 still with regard to the paternity structure 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.949
 the figure below 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.340
 showing some of the interactions in the palmarés that can unite a protein 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.059
 of a protein is well 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:57.909
 in a structure with loss 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:00.909
 - in this figure we can observe hydrogen bonds 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.020
 attractions if we apply positive and negative 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.020
 and forces to sell points 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.569
 saturation is the name given to the loss of the penitentiary structure of the 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:17.139
 properties 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.719
 can be thanks to the heating 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.899
 the poor federations and 3-6 as the leagues requested urgently 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:29.559
 or also due to the increase in acidity or alkalinity from yesterday's noon 5 a 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:30.389
 1 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:31.610
 in this case 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.089
 due to the breakdown of electrical attractions between amino acids 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:38.259
 the property is cured 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.259
 lose function 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.949
 let's see two examples 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:48.659
 warming an egg 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:51.919
 denature the moment the protein present in the campaign 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:56.750
 untying of the proncor of the entanglement between the molecules of 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:57.639
 some 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.889
 timbu turn the break occurred in two segments of the clear 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.650
 increased milk acidity 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.169
 which may be due to the action of microorganisms 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.990
 also tough hour of saturation and now it's my turn of protein 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.779
 milk 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:14.779
 causing him to fall 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.119
 in relation to the functions of proteins 

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:22.099
 the following 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:24.180
 can function as enzymes 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.669
 capitalizing on biological reactions to occur at fast speeds 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:29.809
 enough 

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:31.650
 for the secretary 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.779
 not all enzymes are prudent 

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:38.029
 proteins may be adequate over the years. 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:41.619
 are gangs involved in defense and very organized 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.869
 there are gratuitous contracts 

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:47.819
 responsible for cell movements 

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:51.289
 with a contraction of muscle cells 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:53.800
 proteins can also be a good year says 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.819
 substances that act in the control of the functioning of the organism 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:01.529
 but not all hormones are prudent 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:04.949
 there are problems of receiving guarantees 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:08.289
 like something bad in the face of others 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:11.139
 and finally the transport sector itself 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:12.689
 such as hemoglobin 

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:15.689
 who carried Mr. 

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:19.789
 to the next
