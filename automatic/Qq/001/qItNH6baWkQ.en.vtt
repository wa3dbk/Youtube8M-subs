over<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.299> years<00:00:06.600> I've<00:00:06.810> seen<00:00:07.080> new<00:00:07.410> channels

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
over the years I've seen new channels

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.500 
over the years I've seen new channels
with<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.160> lot<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.429> potential<00:00:09.150> for<00:00:09.360> making

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
with a lot of potential for making

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.299 
with a lot of potential for making
high-quality<00:00:09.809> machine<00:00:10.559> mouths<00:00:10.800> come<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.160> go

high-quality machine mouths come and go

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.249 
high-quality machine mouths come and go
so<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.820> think<00:00:11.969> that<00:00:12.360> it's<00:00:12.509> about<00:00:12.630> time<00:00:13.019> that<00:00:13.080> I

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
so I think that it's about time that I

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.350 
so I think that it's about time that I
make<00:00:13.500> my<00:00:13.679> own<00:00:13.710> fully<00:00:14.219> fleshed<00:00:14.610> out<00:00:14.790> tutorial
