00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
the first progression is basically just

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.499 
the first progression is basically just
a<00:01:13.960> regular<00:01:14.380> tuck<00:01:14.680> here<00:01:15.369> I'm<00:01:15.520> opening<00:01:16.000> up<00:01:16.240> my

legs a little bit and that's called the

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.160 
legs a little bit and that's called the
open<00:01:18.340> tuck<00:01:18.820> that<00:01:19.210> would<00:01:19.390> be<00:01:19.509> the<00:01:19.659> second

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
open tuck that would be the second

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.100 
open tuck that would be the second
progression<00:01:21.009> work<00:01:21.880> on<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.149> full<00:01:22.450> tuck<00:01:22.750> before

going into the open Tuck
our<00:01:26.750> third<00:01:26.960> progression<00:01:27.530> is<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:28.130> can<00:01:28.430> opener

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
our third progression is the can opener

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.430 
our third progression is the can opener
this<00:01:29.060> is<00:01:29.210> basically<00:01:29.600> where<00:01:29.960> we're<00:01:30.170> going<00:01:30.350> to

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
this is basically where we're going to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.289 
this is basically where we're going to
extend<00:01:30.890> one<00:01:31.159> leg<00:01:31.190> out<00:01:31.490> while<00:01:31.909> we<00:01:32.000> have<00:01:32.150> the

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
other leg tucked hold this for time and

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.590 
other leg tucked hold this for time and
make<00:01:35.720> sure<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.200> do<00:01:36.409> both<00:01:36.950> sides
