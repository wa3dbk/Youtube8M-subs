00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
PC version 1.8 called ender mites which

PC version 1.8 called ender mites which
were<00:01:06.250> essentially<00:01:06.700> I<00:01:06.850> guess<00:01:07.149> endermen

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
were essentially I guess endermen

versions<00:01:08.259> of<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:09.340> silverfish<00:01:09.820> at<00:01:10.119> least

versions of the silverfish at least
that's<00:01:10.570> what<00:01:10.719> I<00:01:10.750> think<00:01:10.840> of<00:01:11.079> when<00:01:11.140> I<00:01:11.259> see<00:01:11.320> him

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
that's what I think of when I see him

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.840 
that's what I think of when I see him
and<00:01:11.680> I'm<00:01:11.740> sure<00:01:11.860> you'll<00:01:12.009> agree<00:01:12.130> so<00:01:12.700> if<00:01:12.759> I<00:01:12.820> go

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
and I'm sure you'll agree so if I go

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.250 
and I'm sure you'll agree so if I go
ahead<00:01:13.060> and<00:01:13.149> I<00:01:13.270> spot<00:01:13.479> myself<00:01:13.840> an<00:01:13.900> Ender<00:01:14.110> might

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
ahead and I spot myself an Ender might

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.440 
ahead and I spot myself an Ender might

here you can see that it has a very very

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.090 
here you can see that it has a very very

you get a whole bunch of ender might
spawn<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.479> you<00:01:49.840> know<00:01:49.960> they<00:01:50.080> would<00:01:50.229> just

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
spawn and you know they would just

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.450 
spawn and you know they would just
mallya<00:01:50.799> and<00:01:50.950> so<00:01:51.040> that<00:01:51.159> was<00:01:51.220> kind<00:01:51.430> of

terrifying and so thankfully the mojang

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.050

went ahead and remove that however now

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.999

when<00:01:55.240> you<00:01:55.330> throw<00:01:55.570> an<00:01:55.689> ender<00:01:56.049> pearl<00:01:56.320> there<00:01:56.830> is<00:01:56.979> a

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
when you throw an ender pearl there is a

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.890 
when you throw an ender pearl there is a
five<00:01:57.580> percent<00:01:57.970> chance<00:01:58.210> that<00:01:58.360> they<00:01:58.509> will<00:01:58.630> spawn

so<00:01:59.380> if<00:01:59.439> i<00:01:59.500> go<00:01:59.530> ahead<00:01:59.770> and<00:01:59.920> i<00:02:00.040> swap<00:02:00.280> my<00:02:00.400> game<00:02:00.640> mode

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
so if i go ahead and i swap my game mode

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.320 
so if i go ahead and i swap my game mode
over<00:02:00.970> here<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.330> game<00:02:01.540> mode<00:02:02.460> 10<00:02:03.460> there<00:02:04.180> we<00:02:04.299> are

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
oh I messed up game mode 0 there we are

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.749 
oh I messed up game mode 0 there we are
and<00:02:08.170> I<00:02:08.679> throw<00:02:08.890> an<00:02:08.979> ender<00:02:09.159> pearl<00:02:09.399> it's<00:02:09.549> very

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
and I throw an ender pearl it's very

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.130 
and I throw an ender pearl it's very
unlikely<00:02:10.090> that<00:02:10.209> i'm<00:02:10.420> going<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.599> see<00:02:10.750> one<00:02:10.869> spawn

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
unlikely that i'm going to see one spawn

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.929 
unlikely that i'm going to see one spawn
but<00:02:11.680> it's<00:02:11.799> possible<00:02:12.310> when<00:02:12.519> you<00:02:12.549> throw<00:02:12.849> an

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
that's that's another that stop okay and

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.600 
that's that's another that stop okay and
there<00:02:41.260> we<00:02:41.350> go<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.710> so<00:02:42.040> there<00:02:42.190> actually<00:02:42.340> are

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
there we go and so there actually are

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.070 
there we go and so there actually are
relatively<00:02:43.060> easy<00:02:43.300> to<00:02:43.360> kill<00:02:43.600> but<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.930> can

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
relatively easy to kill but you can

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.510 
relatively easy to kill but you can
imagine<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.620> like<00:02:44.800> I<00:02:44.860> don't<00:02:45.010> know<00:02:45.190> why<00:02:45.340> you'd

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
imagine that like I don't know why you'd

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.500 
imagine that like I don't know why you'd
be<00:02:45.610> throwing<00:02:45.820> a<00:02:45.940> whole<00:02:46.090> bunch<00:02:46.240> of<00:02:46.330> ender

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
be throwing a whole bunch of ender

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.180 
be throwing a whole bunch of ender
pearls<00:02:46.720> but<00:02:46.840> if<00:02:46.960> you<00:02:47.050> were<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.500> like<00:02:47.530> more

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
pearls but if you were and like more

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.500 
pearls but if you were and like more
than<00:02:48.310> one<00:02:48.370> of<00:02:48.580> them<00:02:48.700> spawn<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.150> can<00:02:49.270> imagine

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
than one of them spawn you can imagine

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.240 
than one of them spawn you can imagine
just<00:02:49.780> how<00:02:49.900> shocking<00:02:50.350> that<00:02:50.440> would<00:02:50.590> be<00:02:50.740> you<00:02:51.130> know

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
just how shocking that would be you know

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.850

Ender might because now you're dead

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.170 
Ender might because now you're dead
because<00:03:12.310> you're<00:03:12.460> probably<00:03:12.670> already<00:03:12.970> low

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
because you're probably already low

because you're probably already low
health<00:03:13.420> after<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:13.780> threw<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.020> ender<00:03:14.260> pearl

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
health after you threw the ender pearl

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.750 
health after you threw the ender pearl
and<00:03:14.680> now<00:03:14.800> you<00:03:14.860> got<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.070> end<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.400> my<00:03:15.490> to<00:03:15.550> deal

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
and now you got the end of my to deal

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.670 
and now you got the end of my to deal
with<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.810> so<00:03:16.990> you're<00:03:17.140> just<00:03:17.290> kind<00:03:17.440> of<00:03:17.500> dead

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
with and and so you're just kind of dead

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.010 
with and and so you're just kind of dead
so<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.520> rights<00:03:18.730> I<00:03:18.880> guess<00:03:19.180> can<00:03:19.570> be<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.780> bad

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
so and the rights I guess can be a bad

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.230 
so and the rights I guess can be a bad
thing<00:03:20.050> but<00:03:20.650> as<00:03:21.130> far<00:03:21.460> as<00:03:21.520> when<00:03:21.910> you<00:03:21.940> would<00:03:22.090> like
