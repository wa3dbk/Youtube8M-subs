eliminating<00:03:20.269> them

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
eliminating them

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.929

is<00:03:21.099> to<00:03:21.340> simply<00:03:21.760> take<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.239> jar<00:03:22.510> itself<00:03:26.670> on<00:03:27.670> the

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:27.939 
is to simply take the jar itself on the

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.789 
is to simply take the jar itself on the
table<00:03:28.769> so<00:03:29.769> take<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.010> quick<00:03:30.340> look<00:03:30.549> around<00:03:30.730> here

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
all massage the body butter into it now

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.759 
all massage the body butter into it now
we'll<00:03:42.849> fill<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.150> rest<00:03:43.299> of<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:43.629> so<00:03:44.140> a<00:03:44.170> good

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
we'll fill the rest of it so a good
