got going on there is let's play it real
slow<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:31.259> an<00:00:31.560> E<00:00:32.330> basically<00:00:33.330> an<00:00:33.420> E<00:00:33.510> chord<00:00:34.309> with

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
slow just an E basically an E chord with

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.939 
slow just an E basically an E chord with
the<00:00:35.339> G<00:00:35.580> sharp<00:00:35.820> there<00:00:36.199> and<00:00:37.199> the<00:00:37.320> second<00:00:37.710> part<00:00:37.890> is

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
the G sharp there and the second part is

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:44.329 
the G sharp there and the second part is
up<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:42.350> so<00:00:43.350> let<00:00:43.530> me<00:00:43.589> just<00:00:43.799> do<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:43.920> slow<00:00:44.280> so

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
up here so let me just do that slow so

00:00:44.339 --> 00:01:01.160 
up here so let me just do that slow so
you<00:00:44.549> see<00:00:44.729> the<00:00:44.850> pattern

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:16.260 

that<00:01:02.170> just<00:01:02.320> keeps<00:01:02.440> repeating

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:24.399 

then<00:01:17.270> it's<00:01:17.420> just<00:01:17.450> an<00:01:17.660> act<00:01:17.840> of<00:01:17.960> lore

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.410 

the<00:01:25.409> only<00:01:25.530> change<00:01:25.829> is<00:01:26.039> in<00:01:26.609> the<00:01:26.909> verse<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.299> have

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
the only change is in the verse we have

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:35.070 
the only change is in the verse we have
it<00:01:27.509> comes<00:01:27.689> down<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.899> an<00:01:28.200> A<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.829> goes

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.469 

so<00:01:36.080> there's<00:01:36.230> that<00:01:36.820> left-hand<00:01:37.820> bass<00:01:38.090> change

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
so there's that left-hand bass change

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.880 
so there's that left-hand bass change
where<00:01:38.750> we<00:01:38.780> just<00:01:38.960> have<00:01:39.080> an<00:01:39.200> exchange<00:01:41.680> so<00:01:42.680> we<00:01:42.770> got

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
where we just have an exchange so we got

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:51.539 
where we just have an exchange so we got
to<00:01:42.979> kind<00:01:43.070> of<00:01:43.190> mimic<00:01:43.340> that<00:01:43.610> when<00:01:43.820> we<00:01:43.880> do<00:01:44.030> this

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:02:01.390 

so<00:01:52.549> I'll<00:01:52.610> do<00:01:52.729> that<00:01:52.759> slow

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.400 

you<00:02:01.760> kind<00:02:02.000> of<00:02:02.060> do<00:02:02.210> this<00:02:02.360> until<00:02:02.810> we<00:02:03.200> get<00:02:03.350> back

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
you kind of do this until we get back

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.840 
you kind of do this until we get back
into<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.890> vs.<00:02:04.220> and<00:02:04.250> you're<00:02:04.460> just<00:02:04.610> doing<00:02:04.790> this

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
into the vs. and you're just doing this

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.789 
into the vs. and you're just doing this
again

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.380 

and<00:02:08.399> that's<00:02:08.700> all<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> way<00:02:09.090> through<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
and that's all the way through the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.880 
and that's all the way through the
verses<00:02:09.750> then<00:02:09.959> we<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.170> into<00:02:11.690> chorus<00:02:12.800> let<00:02:13.800> me

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
verses then we get into chorus let me

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.500 
verses then we get into chorus let me
start<00:02:14.099> with<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.280> bass<00:02:14.430> line<00:02:14.700> we<00:02:15.180> get<00:02:15.330> this

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
start with the bass line we get this

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:27.640 
start with the bass line we get this
unique<00:02:16.050> bass<00:02:16.260> line<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.709> goes

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:39.670 

that's<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.710> again

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.780 

sort<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.740> played<00:02:40.890> us<00:02:40.980> both<00:02:41.010> hands<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.550> kind<00:02:41.760> of

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
sort of played us both hands I kind of

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:55.470 
sort of played us both hands I kind of
go

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:18.530 

it's<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.290> right<00:02:56.440> hand<00:02:56.650> we<00:02:56.709> get

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:35.160 

together<00:03:19.540> it's

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.200 

that<00:03:36.170> goes<00:03:36.319> again

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.000 

so<00:03:41.210> to<00:03:41.330> fill<00:03:41.480> this<00:03:41.600> up<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:41.870> little<00:03:42.020> bit<00:03:42.200> for<00:03:42.920> this

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
so to fill this up a little bit for this

up this chorus part I would like to I
would<00:03:44.960> take<00:03:45.290> actors<00:03:45.620> in<00:03:45.770> the<00:03:45.830> left<00:03:46.010> hand<00:03:46.190> if

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
would take actors in the left hand if

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:59.960 
would take actors in the left hand if
you<00:03:46.370> can<00:03:46.550> you're<00:03:47.480> just<00:03:47.510> kind<00:03:47.750> of<00:03:47.780> like<00:03:47.960> this

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.920 

where<00:04:00.970> you<00:04:01.030> could<00:04:01.150> do<00:04:01.269> anything<00:04:01.480> in<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.780> right

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
where you could do anything in the right

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:16.650 
where you could do anything in the right
you<00:04:02.079> can<00:04:02.230> go

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.879 

so<00:04:17.660> you<00:04:17.750> can't<00:04:18.079> get<00:04:18.199> what<00:04:18.349> I'm<00:04:18.440> saying<00:04:18.709> there

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
so you can't get what I'm saying there

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:19.830 
so you can't get what I'm saying there
now

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
now

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.260 
now
the<00:04:20.840> only<00:04:21.109> tricky<00:04:21.470> part<00:04:21.709> of<00:04:21.769> this<00:04:21.889> tune<00:04:22.190> is<00:04:22.490> the

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
the only tricky part of this tune is the

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.850 
the only tricky part of this tune is the
bridge<00:04:23.560> and<00:04:24.560> after<00:04:25.220> you<00:04:25.340> do<00:04:25.639> the<00:04:25.759> chorus<00:04:26.090> stuff

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
bridge and after you do the chorus stuff

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.899 
bridge and after you do the chorus stuff
you<00:04:27.860> know<00:04:29.289> so<00:04:30.289> after<00:04:30.620> all<00:04:30.650> that<00:04:30.770> we<00:04:31.250> get<00:04:31.400> into

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:05:02.080 

this<00:04:34.909> kind<00:04:35.150> of<00:04:35.180> a<00:04:35.300> thing

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.020 

okay<00:05:02.930> so<00:05:02.990> that<00:05:03.590> part<00:05:03.889> let<00:05:04.280> me<00:05:04.370> play<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.760> right

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
okay so that part let me play the right

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:32.460 
okay so that part let me play the right
hand<00:05:05.090> first<00:05:05.750> we<00:05:05.960> got<00:05:06.110> this

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.510 

okay<00:05:33.470> those<00:05:33.590> are<00:05:33.650> just<00:05:33.800> the<00:05:33.980> notes<00:05:34.160> we<00:05:34.370> play

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
okay those are just the notes we play

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:50.900 
okay those are just the notes we play
and<00:05:34.670> rhythms<00:05:34.910> so<00:05:35.060> we<00:05:35.150> go

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.910 

then<00:05:51.450> the<00:05:51.600> second<00:05:52.020> time<00:05:52.170> around<00:05:52.290> it<00:05:52.530> changes<00:05:52.890> a

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
then the second time around it changes a

00:05:52.920 --> 00:06:14.220 
then the second time around it changes a
little<00:05:53.040> bit<00:05:53.250> we<00:05:53.340> get

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.290 

okay<00:06:15.230> I'll<00:06:15.560> do<00:06:15.770> that<00:06:15.980> second<00:06:16.490> part<00:06:16.610> of<00:06:16.760> it

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
okay I'll do that second part of it

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.750 
okay I'll do that second part of it
much<00:06:17.870> slower<00:06:18.169> so<00:06:18.919> you<00:06:18.950> can<00:06:19.220> follow<00:06:19.400> the<00:06:19.550> left

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
much slower so you can follow the left
