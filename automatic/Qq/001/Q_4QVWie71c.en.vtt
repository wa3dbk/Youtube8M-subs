had that and so no one has any of these

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.540 
had that and so no one has any of these
things<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.470> can<00:01:05.650> take<00:01:05.800> it<00:01:05.950> and<00:01:06.130> try<00:01:06.250> it<00:01:06.370> and

things and can take it and try it and

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.050 
things and can take it and try it and
test<00:01:06.790> it

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
test it

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.570

it<00:01:07.479> all<00:01:07.660> starts<00:01:08.020> from<00:01:08.110> scratch<00:01:08.229> so<00:01:08.680> everyone's

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
it all starts from scratch so everyone's

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.100 
it all starts from scratch so everyone's
just<00:01:09.700> gonna<00:01:09.940> do<00:01:10.150> the<00:01:10.270> best<00:01:10.420> job<00:01:10.479> they<00:01:10.630> can<00:01:10.780> and

just gonna do the best job they can and
when<00:01:11.200> we<00:01:11.290> get<00:01:11.380> to<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:11.560> first<00:01:11.740> race<00:01:12.010> we'll<00:01:12.250> see

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
when we get to the first race we'll see

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.900 
when we get to the first race we'll see
who's<00:01:13.300> done<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:13.690> best<00:01:13.870> job<00:01:14.110> and<00:01:14.320> I<00:01:15.130> feel<00:01:15.640> very

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
who's done the best job and I feel very

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:31.570 
who's done the best job and I feel very
confident<00:01:16.270> we've<00:01:16.420> done<00:01:16.600> a<00:01:16.630> fantastic<00:01:16.840> job

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.720 

I<00:01:32.440> have<00:01:33.440> a<00:01:33.470> much<00:01:33.680> better<00:01:33.860> starting<00:01:34.310> point<00:01:34.550> to

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
I have a much better starting point to

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.430 
I have a much better starting point to
the<00:01:34.820> season<00:01:35.150> in<00:01:35.450> terms<00:01:35.690> of<00:01:35.870> knowing<00:01:36.080> the<00:01:36.290> team

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
the season in terms of knowing the team

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.110 
the season in terms of knowing the team
and<00:01:36.680> how<00:01:36.800> everything<00:01:37.190> works<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:37.670> how<00:01:37.850> to<00:01:37.910> get

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
and how everything works and how to get

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.390 
and how everything works and how to get
the<00:01:38.300> best<00:01:38.420> out<00:01:39.020> of<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.470> whole<00:01:40.040> group<00:01:40.280> of

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
the best out of the whole group of

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.630 
the best out of the whole group of
people<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.850> I<00:01:42.010> think<00:01:43.010> that's<00:01:43.280> really<00:01:43.610> the

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
people and I think that's really the

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.040 
people and I think that's really the
priority<00:01:43.880> at<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.270> moment<00:01:44.300> you<00:01:44.690> know<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.900> get

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
priority at the moment you know to get

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.380 
priority at the moment you know to get
the<00:01:45.170> testing<00:01:45.500> going<00:01:45.680> and<00:01:45.980> then<00:01:46.820> preparing<00:01:47.210> for

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
the testing going and then preparing for

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.190 
the testing going and then preparing for
the<00:01:47.510> first<00:01:47.690> race

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
the first race

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.680 
the first race
obviously<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.640> victory<00:01:49.970> in<00:01:50.150> Hungary<00:01:50.450> last

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
obviously the victory in Hungary last

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.240 
obviously the victory in Hungary last
year<00:01:50.900> was<00:01:50.990> a<00:01:51.020> highlight<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:51.680> there's<00:01:52.160> no

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
year was a highlight so there's no

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.770 
year was a highlight so there's no
question<00:01:52.580> that<00:01:52.610> I'd<00:01:52.850> like<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.150> get<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.480> few<00:01:53.630> more

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
question that I'd like to get a few more

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.900 
question that I'd like to get a few more
of<00:01:53.840> those<00:01:54.020> but<00:01:54.380> better<00:01:55.340> not<00:01:55.400> to<00:01:55.610> get<00:01:55.730> too<00:01:55.880> much

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
of those but better not to get too much

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.490 
of those but better not to get too much
ahead<00:01:56.390> of<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.630> things<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.020> let's<00:01:57.170> just<00:01:57.380> keep

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
ahead of the things and let's just keep

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:08.630 
ahead of the things and let's just keep
the<00:01:57.650> focus<00:01:57.950> now<00:01:58.070> at<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.310> start<00:01:58.520> of<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.670> Zeta

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.550 

well<00:02:09.640> we<00:02:09.879> all<00:02:10.149> definitely<00:02:10.599> want<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.170> build<00:02:11.410> on

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
well we all definitely want to build on

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.830 
well we all definitely want to build on
what<00:02:11.709> we<00:02:11.769> have<00:02:12.129> we<00:02:13.090> have<00:02:13.120> won<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.660> World

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
what we have we have won the World

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.630 
what we have we have won the World
Championship<00:02:14.440> Lewis<00:02:14.739> Hamilton<00:02:15.099> has<00:02:15.280> won<00:02:15.519> the

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
Championship Lewis Hamilton has won the

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.820 
Championship Lewis Hamilton has won the
World<00:02:15.790> Championship<00:02:16.390> but<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.560> know<00:02:17.709> we

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
World Championship but you know we

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.460 
World Championship but you know we
cannot<00:02:18.040> guarantee<00:02:18.580> that<00:02:19.060> we<00:02:19.720> can<00:02:19.900> repeat<00:02:20.290> it

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
cannot guarantee that we can repeat it

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.229 
cannot guarantee that we can repeat it
but<00:02:20.620> we<00:02:20.739> work<00:02:20.950> very<00:02:20.980> hard<00:02:21.280> on<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.760> that's<00:02:22.030> for

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
but we work very hard on it that's for

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:22.680 
but we work very hard on it that's for
sure

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
sure

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.809 
sure
I<00:02:22.720> think<00:02:23.709> we<00:02:23.799> have<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.980> very<00:02:24.069> good<00:02:24.340> we<00:02:24.640> have<00:02:24.760> a

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
I think we have a very good we have a

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.930 
I think we have a very good we have a
very<00:02:25.090> good<00:02:25.299> baseline<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.870> do<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:26.920> having<00:02:27.700> said

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
very good baseline to do so having said

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.080 
very good baseline to do so having said
that<00:02:27.970> we<00:02:28.629> need<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:29.019> realize<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.940> more<00:02:30.940> than

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
that we need to realize that more than

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.600 
that we need to realize that more than
half<00:02:31.330> of<00:02:31.599> the<00:02:32.290> field<00:02:32.530> more<00:02:32.860> than<00:02:32.920> half<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.430> the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
half of the field more than half of the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.180 
half of the field more than half of the
10<00:02:33.819> teams<00:02:34.060> is<00:02:34.900> definitely<00:02:35.500> in<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.680> position<00:02:35.709> to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
10 teams is definitely in a position to

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.309 
10 teams is definitely in a position to
build<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.519> winning<00:02:36.670> car<00:02:37.000> that's<00:02:37.510> my<00:02:37.750> judgment

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
build a winning car that's my judgment

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.949 
build a winning car that's my judgment
today<00:02:38.799> nobody<00:02:39.579> knows<00:02:39.940> at<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.360> stage<00:02:40.660> of<00:02:40.930> the

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
today nobody knows at that stage of the

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.009 
today nobody knows at that stage of the
year<00:02:41.379> who<00:02:41.920> has<00:02:42.160> done<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.549> best<00:02:42.579> job<00:02:42.879> but<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.900> is

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
year who has done the best job but it is

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.680 
year who has done the best job but it is
a<00:02:44.049> it<00:02:44.440> is<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.680> challenging<00:02:45.430> formula<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.209> is<00:02:46.269> not

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
a it is a challenging formula it is not

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.780 
a it is a challenging formula it is not
not<00:02:47.079> just<00:02:47.110> one<00:02:47.590> or<00:02:47.739> two<00:02:47.890> teams<00:02:48.129> that<00:02:48.250> can<00:02:48.610> win

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
not just one or two teams that can win

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.839 
not just one or two teams that can win
races<00:02:49.000> we<00:02:49.840> remember<00:02:50.560> last<00:02:50.799> year<00:02:51.190> we<00:02:51.400> have<00:02:51.579> had

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
races we remember last year we have had

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.520 
races we remember last year we have had
I<00:02:52.120> think<00:02:52.150> five<00:02:52.540> different<00:02:52.810> constructors

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
I think five different constructors

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.039 
I think five different constructors
already<00:02:53.890> that<00:02:54.099> won<00:02:54.280> races<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:54.879> probably<00:02:55.810> this

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
already that won races and probably this

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:07.920 
already that won races and probably this
will<00:02:56.260> be<00:02:56.470> more<00:02:56.849> this<00:02:57.849> year

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:17.039 

I<00:03:14.159> want<00:03:15.159> to<00:03:15.220> win<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.400> yen<00:03:15.579> so<00:03:15.939> the<00:03:16.659> pressures

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
I want to win the yen so the pressures

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.490 
I want to win the yen so the pressures
that<00:03:17.349> come<00:03:17.739> from<00:03:18.069> within<00:03:18.610> are<00:03:19.319> gonna<00:03:20.319> be

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
that come from within are gonna be

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.710 
that come from within are gonna be
different<00:03:20.920> I<00:03:21.010> think<00:03:21.040> they're<00:03:21.370> gonna<00:03:21.459> be

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
different I think they're gonna be

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.940 
different I think they're gonna be
similar<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.470> point<00:03:23.650> where<00:03:23.799> I'm<00:03:23.860> gonna

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
similar to the point where I'm gonna

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.599 
similar to the point where I'm gonna
push<00:03:24.129> myself<00:03:24.159> even<00:03:24.670> harder<00:03:25.060> but<00:03:26.340> last<00:03:27.340> year

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
push myself even harder but last year

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.660 
push myself even harder but last year
was<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:27.849> was<00:03:28.150> very<00:03:28.180> serious<00:03:28.810> very<00:03:29.109> focused

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
was I was very serious very focused

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.550 
was I was very serious very focused
didn't<00:03:30.670> enjoy<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.420> season<00:03:31.629> as<00:03:31.989> much<00:03:32.290> as

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
didn't enjoy the season as much as

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.009 
didn't enjoy the season as much as
perhaps<00:03:32.950> it's<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:33.519> looked<00:03:33.780> this<00:03:34.780> year<00:03:34.959> only

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
perhaps it's it looked this year only

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.229 
perhaps it's it looked this year only
enjoy<00:03:35.409> it<00:03:35.470> more<00:03:35.650> but<00:03:36.189> I've<00:03:36.579> got<00:03:36.879> new<00:03:37.030> goals

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
enjoy it more but I've got new goals

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.059 
enjoy it more but I've got new goals
I've<00:03:37.480> reset<00:03:37.870> all<00:03:38.140> my<00:03:38.409> goals<00:03:38.620> I<00:03:38.739> don't<00:03:38.769> go<00:03:39.010> to

head and then I'm a new competitor kind
of<00:03:48.970> thing<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.359> I<00:03:49.569> think<00:03:49.870> if<00:03:50.079> I<00:03:50.260> start<00:03:50.530> again

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
of thing and I think if I start again

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.220 
of thing and I think if I start again
and<00:03:50.950> i<00:03:51.010> refresh<00:03:51.340> start<00:03:52.209> my<00:03:52.299> training<00:03:52.510> work<00:03:53.079> on

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
and i refresh start my training work on

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.110 
and i refresh start my training work on
other<00:03:53.379> areas<00:03:53.590> that<00:03:53.859> that<00:03:54.069> I<00:03:54.400> can<00:03:54.609> be<00:03:54.700> better<00:03:54.730> on

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
other areas that that I can be better on

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.629 
other areas that that I can be better on
I<00:03:55.359> can<00:03:56.170> be<00:03:56.290> better<00:03:56.439> and<00:03:56.650> stronger<00:03:56.829> and<00:03:57.129> win

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
I can be better and stronger and win

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.429 
I can be better and stronger and win
more<00:03:57.760> races<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.329> hopefully<00:03:59.139> make<00:03:59.290> less

00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 
more races and hopefully make less
