know if I'm going to use um I think we

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.370 
know if I'm going to use um I think we
need<00:01:44.210> some<00:01:44.359> modeling<00:01:44.719> clay<00:01:44.899> because<00:01:45.139> it<00:01:45.170> might

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
need some modeling clay because it might

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.620 
need some modeling clay because it might
be<00:01:45.499> easier<00:01:45.850> but<00:01:46.850> yeah<00:01:49.179> it's<00:01:50.179> getting<00:01:50.479> there

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
be easier but yeah it's getting there

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.830 
be easier but yeah it's getting there
and<00:01:51.549> I'm<00:01:52.549> also<00:01:52.789> not<00:01:52.939> gonna<00:01:53.209> redo<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.539> doors

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
and I'm also not gonna redo the doors

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.319 
and I'm also not gonna redo the doors
I'm<00:01:54.229> gonna<00:01:54.499> go<00:01:54.619> ahead<00:01:54.709> and<00:01:54.889> keep<00:01:55.009> those

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
I'm gonna go ahead and keep those

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.389

that's ninety seven dB at 1 watt one

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:07.179 
that's ninety seven dB at 1 watt one
meter<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.619> I'll<00:02:06.619> be<00:02:06.709> running<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:06.979> pair<00:02:07.159> of

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
meter and I'll be running a pair of

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.480 
meter and I'll be running a pair of
selenium<00:02:07.819> horns<00:02:08.330> underneath<00:02:08.780> thumb

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
selenium horns underneath thumb

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.070 
selenium horns underneath thumb
underneath<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.729> dash<00:02:11.290> so<00:02:12.290> yeah<00:02:13.069> and<00:02:13.370> I<00:02:14.180> don't

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.110 
underneath the dash so yeah and I don't
know<00:02:15.189> depending<00:02:16.189> on<00:02:16.310> power<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:16.790> think

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
know depending on power I think

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.390 
know depending on power I think
we<00:02:17.239> may<00:02:17.390> go<00:02:17.569> with<00:02:17.780> stetsom<00:02:18.650> amplifiers<00:02:19.159> I

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
we may go with stetsom amplifiers I

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.759 
we may go with stetsom amplifiers I
don't<00:02:19.549> know<00:02:19.640> well<00:02:20.030> uh<00:02:20.060> we'll<00:02:20.989> have<00:02:21.019> to<00:02:21.290> see<00:02:21.500> I

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
don't know well uh we'll have to see I

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.030 
don't know well uh we'll have to see I
think<00:02:22.069> I<00:02:22.599> try<00:02:23.599> to<00:02:23.659> put<00:02:23.870> I<00:02:24.110> wanted<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.709> put<00:02:24.799> four

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
maybe stick a third 18 in here we'll

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.949 
maybe stick a third 18 in here we'll
have<00:02:38.750> like<00:02:38.989> one<00:02:39.200> here<00:02:39.730> one<00:02:40.730> here<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.269> one<00:02:41.930> here

for the baffle so all I have to do is

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.830 
for the baffle so all I have to do is
basically<00:03:25.010> just<00:03:25.340> get<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.489> two<00:03:26.299> piece<00:03:26.480> of<00:03:26.630> MDF

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
basically just get a two piece of MDF

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.599 
basically just get a two piece of MDF
glue<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:27.889> screw<00:03:28.040> them<00:03:28.099> together<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.489> then

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
glue and screw them together and then
