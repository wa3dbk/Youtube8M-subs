 we have to sv tieffeu pc vabbÃ¨ anyway 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.940
 this is the update for the game of 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.780
 read or maybe here are the files of 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.979
 installation 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.280
 we see in the rice then here it is 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:11.090
 a small ge guide mounted the disc 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.790
 1 to install then when I asked 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.720
 puts on the disc 2 end 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.010
 of the installation then put on 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.010
 the update then the crack 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.380
 that's fine by then guys 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:39.200
 let's do like this 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:45.050
 take the good old and diamond tools 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:52.490
 christ stimulators then damon dulce 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:52.490
 mount the image one is this one 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.840
 going to save time better 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:05.850
 in the second test without mounting it e 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:07.380
 then we say autorun and will leave 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.570
 installation and we put it in English 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.670
 then we will change the language 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:18.819
 later he accepts 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:21.650
 but choose the folder or 25gb 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.230
 this game then uninstall remains 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.130
 that here as 3 gb remain for fault 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.620
 of the winds that are there 15 here 15 that 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.250
 15 30 in a nutshell 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.870
 here, on the other hand , with the m5 it cocks the hard 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.489
 disk but I wanted to take place from a land 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.560
 because this is the computer one 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:46.069
 anyway old man was by all 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:50.600
 my games straight then pistoia pier 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:52.989
 we prefer and then recommend you 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.580
 delete it when you did it because 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:59.180
 consumes an incredible amount of 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:03.230
 space we did next next and here it is not 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.019
 I do install then I pause it 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.790
 I will restart when he asks me for the 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.480
 second game image to make you 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:15.260
 see how to do it now contains of 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:19.630
 putting the second record is enough 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.630
 return to the damon of urso 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:33.360
 are millions of things open work with 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:36.310
 this I mean then we remove the disc 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.850
 of the first image and take the 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.850
 second 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:56.620
 ok then now it's at the unit where you are 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:59.590
 therefore find us no ok now 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.380
 will resume the installation and start again 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.660
 as soon as it is finished 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.630
 ok just finished sorry about the 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.639
 background noise and what you wanted to 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.650
 now to install it because sometimes yes 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:15.240
 touched something strange barrier 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:18.940
 current already are 25 gb to put then 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.750
 we have finish in the folder 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:30.750
 where we installed a first place 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:30.750
 and then we take this spa as well 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.680
 we'll need the game newspaper then 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.680
 we can wish 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.530
 let's make 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:06:00.030
 magically heaven will find game but 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:04.470
 hell did find it but it's true and 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:08.220
 then we wait for it to end 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:12.060
 every Italian answers ok 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.850
 we wait for it to end once that 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:17.040
 will have finished will close alone us 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:21.170
 let's cover this file and go 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.170
 paste in the game folder 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.810
 replace 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.980
 against someone 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:36.880
 Yup 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:40.060
 ok the last step is to 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.039
 press to open the language folder 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.160
 based on your operating system 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:49.479
 choose in my case you are four 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:52.000
 do it on Italian yes perfect or 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:53.220
 we have already cooperated with daily 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.870
 Italian 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.870
