let<00:00:00.930> me<00:00:01.020> just<00:00:01.500> make<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:01.800> quick<00:00:02.129> video<00:00:02.250> on<00:00:02.429> making

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
let me just make a quick video on making

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.690 
let me just make a quick video on making
your<00:00:03.179> own<00:00:03.240> desiccant<00:00:04.279> if<00:00:05.279> you<00:00:05.430> don't<00:00:05.609> know

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
your own desiccant if you don't know

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.480 
your own desiccant if you don't know

what a desiccant is it's something that
absorbs<00:00:08.490> moisture<00:00:09.349> so<00:00:10.349> if<00:00:10.440> you're<00:00:10.590> packing

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
absorbs moisture so if you're packing

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
I bought some Alldrive looked at the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.900 
I bought some Alldrive looked at the
ingredients<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:43.829> basically<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:44.340> clay

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
ingredients it's basically just clay

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.369

better<00:00:45.270> not<00:00:45.480> clay<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.750> think<00:00:46.399> there's<00:00:47.399> no<00:00:47.610> scent

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379

I packed on a rainy day but you know I
just<00:01:34.650> almost<00:01:34.829> guarantee<00:01:35.400> that's<00:01:35.640> probably

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
just almost guarantee that's probably

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.679 
just almost guarantee that's probably
the<00:01:36.000> case<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:37.170> make<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> desiccant<00:01:38.610> what<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.390> did

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the case so make a desiccant what I did

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.770 
the case so make a desiccant what I did
was<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:39.990> put<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.320> one<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.829> Sun<00:01:41.780> 102

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
was just put this one out in the Sun 102

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.969 
was just put this one out in the Sun 102
degrees<00:01:43.079> outside

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
degrees outside

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.100 
degrees outside
I'm<00:01:44.310> sure<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.939> dried<00:01:45.210> out<00:01:45.240> everything<00:01:46.079> that

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
I'm sure it dried out everything that

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.950 
I'm sure it dried out everything that
was<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.890> waited<00:01:47.729> till<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.720> packed

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
riot but I might i waited for also a

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.149 
riot but I might i waited for also a
fairly<00:01:53.189> low<00:01:53.460> humidity<00:01:53.490> day<00:01:54.450> before<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.159> before

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
fairly low humidity day before I before

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.719 
fairly low humidity day before I before
I<00:01:56.340> packed<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:58.200> Rye<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.740> that's<00:01:59.579> the

I packed the the Rye and that's the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.709 
I packed the the Rye and that's the
desiccant<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.390> was<00:02:00.509> going<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.719> put<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.020> it

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
desiccant that I was going to put in it

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.929 
desiccant that I was going to put in it
so<00:02:03.719> it's<00:02:04.049> gonna<00:02:04.229> sit<00:02:04.560> until<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.430> get<00:02:05.700> ready<00:02:05.880> to

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
so it's gonna sit until I get ready to

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.410 
so it's gonna sit until I get ready to
pack<00:02:06.119> something<00:02:06.450> else<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.770> again<00:02:08.399> label<00:02:09.270> you

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
pack something else so again label you

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.680
