00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.550
LG Unveils 5.3-Inch Smartphone Display With
'World's Narrowest Bezel'

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:13.231
LG, back in 2013, launched what it claimed
was the world's first Quad-HD AH-IPS LCD panel

00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:20.250
for smartphones, and the company used the
panel on its 2014 flagship, the G3.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.840
Now, the South Korean company further has
upped the ante and has developed a 5.3-inch

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.940
full-HD LCD panel for smartphones sporting
what it claims is "the world's narrowest bezel

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.689
at 0.7mm".

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.829
LG reveals that it will start mass production
of the display next month, and will be supplying

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.859
it first to China.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.870
The company believes that China has more demand
for large screen smartphones.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.020
The company notes that to achieve a narrow
bezel of 0.7mm, it used a new 'Neo Edge' module

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.769
processing technology and the Advanced In-Cell
Touch (AIT) technology.

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:04.640
LG says, "To realize the 0.7mm bezel width
on the left and right sides of the panel,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.830
which is narrower than the 0.8mm thickness
of a credit card, LG Display used its "Neo

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.550
Edge" module processing technology and the
world's first "Advanced In-Cell Touch (AIT)"

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.980
technology."

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.970
The company explains that the new Neo Edge
technology uses an adhesive, which replaces

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.920
a double-sided tape used previously for attaching
and completely sealing the total area and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.110
edges of the panel's circuit board and backlight
unit.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.270
"Because there is no plastic guide panel to
attach the panel and backlight, the Neo Edge

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.610
technology helps achieve minimal bezel width,
while blocking light leakage and being waterproof

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.360
and dustproof," it adds.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.750
The Advanced In-Cell Touch (AIT) technology,
on the other hand, is said to be exclusively

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.320
developed by LG Display and is claimed to
"reduce the need for bezel space because the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.960
touch panel is embedded into the LCD module."

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.830
Commenting on the announcement, Byeong-koo
Kim, Vice President and Head of IT/Mobile

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.080
Development Group at LG Display said, "With
this innovative product having many advantages,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.200
ranging from its narrow 0.7mm bezel and high
resolution picture quality to its slim design

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.420
and touch-embedded solutions, LG Display will
continue to lead the growing market for large

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.110
screen smartphones, meeting the expectations
of customers and users by enhancing the quality

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.950
of devices."

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.450
LG earlier on Wednesday revealed that its
July-September operating profit more than

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.350
doubled from a year earlier, with the company's
mobile division serving up its highest profit

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.090
since 2009, with 16.8 million smartphones
sold in the quarter.
