over<00:02:54.079> the<00:02:54.230> pass<00:02:54.500> yeah<00:02:54.859> we<00:02:55.730> require<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.090> lot<00:02:56.329> of

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
over the pass yeah we require a lot of

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.390 
over the pass yeah we require a lot of
training<00:02:56.630> you<00:02:57.410> Miran<00:02:57.799> that's<00:02:58.010> why<00:02:58.130> we<00:02:58.280> took

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
training you Miran that's why we took

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.720 
training you Miran that's why we took
seven<00:02:58.730> years<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.910> make<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.389> no<00:03:00.079> but<00:03:00.560> remember<00:03:01.519> I

seven years to make it no but remember I

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.990 
seven years to make it no but remember I
think<00:03:01.880> I<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.569> think<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:03.079> he<00:03:03.889> believes<00:03:04.310> in<00:03:04.700> the
