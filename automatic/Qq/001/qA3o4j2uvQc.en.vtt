00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.070
 the staff is in another 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.460
 I'm 29 years old and I play magic cube 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.230
 since 2005 and today as soon as I 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.590
 I like to teach other people 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.960
 because I see it helps a lot 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.760
 in people who begin to practice moulting 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.859
 the lives of these children 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.250
 so the first as I won I did not 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.070
 I was able to mount it was very small that it was 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.960
 released in 1985 and I do not even remember that I 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.910
 I played a lot with it, they reach 15 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.180
 said that this is nothing more than a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.370
 and find a forum on the internet in Cuba 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.670
 I think Brazil in a league has 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.710
 today there are currently 19 categories 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.250
 official 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.770
 our 19 category and with then I cover 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.980
 normal you go there and resolve like 15 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.039
 The faster you win is you will solve the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.229
 cube five times to solve more 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.820
 fast and not take more account you 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.430
 average of the other three 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.530
 then whoever has the best average wins from there 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.510
 have solving mode with your feet 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.970
 there are the variations in the dark then 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.070
 I have as the little one that the 2002 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.850
 this one it's a has a format of 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.939
 cube and shamans which am 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.560
 only when you shuffle him 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.060
 changes format 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.520
 the method that really people 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.740
 learn method of layers you go 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.420
 learn the first layer of the first 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.900
 easy because the second third call 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.880
 call 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.890
 but for you to mount the first phase 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.369
 usually the easiest is for you to ride 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.460
 a cross is important to speak here the piece 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.220
 center lfc dismantle all parts 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.930
 of the hub has an axis inside and these six 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.939
 here from the center they are bolted 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.340
 on it so if you want to mount the 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.229
 white has to look for the white center 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.189
 and put the other white ones around 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.990
 her 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.270
 so if you put one around here 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.520
 white theoretically you can 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.570
 put all the other three without taking it 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.909
 of the place 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.890
 that is why it is theoretically more 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.050
 easy then I put others do not need 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.300
 move there and I can move here without 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.920
 affect the ones I 've already done 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.500
 after that 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.750
 everything you do until the end now 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.590
 always mess something already 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.390
 You made me to ride more then. 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.330
 now I 'm going to put a little corner, I'm just going 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.459
 put this song here is his place is 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.880
 I'm going to have to take it out here. 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.230
 This piece is from the cross says I do the cross to 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.450
 join the corner 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.380
 I'll be right back and cross the corner. 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.870
 together 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.620
 sometimes if you practice a little 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.319
 quick and kick the guy who invented no 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.569
 he was a mathematician he was an engineer but 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.209
 has to do but he invented the cube in 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.850
 It's true to help in a room for me. 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.160
 To say that it makes you feel proud 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.630
 Monthly offense after the guy 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.010
 he invented it took a month to 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.380
 No problem, and there were people who studied 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.120
 how mathematically now yes already 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.269
 I searched a lot 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.130
 you've never seen is for example solve the 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.200
 cube mathematically knows how to subscribe to 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.420
 family and solve now the people have 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.299
 much to do with mathematics because 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.280
 course is totally illogical right if you 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.549
 uses logic will solve the cube and 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.440
 logical mathematics then maybe there 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.799
 comes the confusion of the cube with 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.989
 mathematics is so no one uses materials 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.320
 to solve the luciano cube appeared a 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:37.140
 boy in the championship with four years of 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.900
 old right I imagine does not teach one 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.579
 4 year old child , I do not know. 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.220
 first he has to want very much that 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.970
 up to 10 11 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.920
 I already went there until I learned, I'll teach you 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.420
 Most people do not want to talk about him. 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.750
 many people say that whoever solves more 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.549
 nerd is crazy no 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.799
 we have girl and do what I do is 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.019
 that the cell cycle train sincere 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.700
 Equally, it will certainly be capoeira swimming. 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.470
 everyday 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.989
 the boy talks shopping I'm training 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.580
 six hours a day over what else 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:13.290
 People listen to this, I do not know, it's crazy, right? 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.290
 it's from another world
