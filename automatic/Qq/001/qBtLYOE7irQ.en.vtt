TPU case silicone TPU but this one is
joined<00:00:17.520> together<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:18.150> one<00:00:18.480> piece<00:00:18.720> it's<00:00:18.990> not<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
joined together in one piece it's not a

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.240 
joined together in one piece it's not a
a<00:00:20.310> two<00:00:20.910> piece<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.930> rather<00:00:22.080> unique

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
a two piece and it's a rather unique

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.560 
a two piece and it's a rather unique
comes<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.400> these<00:00:23.490> weird<00:00:23.699> colors<00:00:24.060> by<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.359> one

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
comes in these weird colors by this one

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.820 
comes in these weird colors by this one
and<00:00:24.779> chose<00:00:25.019> black<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.500> white<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.650> case

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
and chose black and white so the case

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
and chose black and white so the case
itself<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:30.019> a<00:00:31.610> silicone<00:00:33.829> part<00:00:34.829> here<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.520> soft

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
itself is a silicone part here is soft

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.650 
itself is a silicone part here is soft
there<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.960> soft<00:00:37.440> all<00:00:37.620> around<00:00:37.950> here<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:39.329> part

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
there is soft all around here this part

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.709 
there is soft all around here this part
is<00:00:39.960> like<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.379> soft<00:00:40.800> but<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.340> hard<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.600> it's

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
is like a soft but it's hard so it's

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.410 
is like a soft but it's hard so it's
like<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> two<00:00:43.230> piece<00:00:43.530> that's<00:00:44.399> joined<00:00:45.090> into<00:00:45.390> one

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
like a two piece that's joined into one

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.240 
like a two piece that's joined into one
I<00:00:45.660> guess<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.079> could<00:00:46.260> describe<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.100> it's

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
I guess I could describe it and it's

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.830 
I guess I could describe it and it's
more<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> stylish<00:00:48.000> case<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.390> isn't<00:00:48.750> so

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
more of a stylish case this isn't so

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.150 
more of a stylish case this isn't so
much<00:00:48.899> for<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> lot<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.469> protection<00:00:49.590> because<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
much for a lot of protection because the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.060 
much for a lot of protection because the
front<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.520> completely<00:00:50.969> open<00:00:51.230> but<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.860> is

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
front is completely open but this is

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.799 
front is completely open but this is
definitely<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:53.940> style<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.600> wanted

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
definitely for style and I wanted

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:55.670 
definitely for style and I wanted
something<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.079> felt<00:00:55.170> good<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.590> hand

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
something that felt good in the hand

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.150 
something that felt good in the hand
this<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> real<00:00:56.280> soft<00:00:56.899> touch<00:00:57.899> case<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.890> feels

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
this is a real soft touch case it feels

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.310 
this is a real soft touch case it feels
really<00:00:59.430> good<00:00:59.699> I<00:01:00.000> believe<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.899> only<00:01:01.140> like

see<00:01:14.580> here<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> speaker<00:01:14.970> cut<00:01:15.390> out<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.630> down

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
see here the speaker cut out this down

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.789 
see here the speaker cut out this down
here<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.770> camera<00:01:17.100> cutout<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:17.909> 3.5<00:01:18.900> 3.5

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
here the camera cutout is here 3.5 3.5

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.140 
here the camera cutout is here 3.5 3.5
millimeter<00:01:20.009> headphone<00:01:20.340> jack<00:01:20.700> cutout<00:01:21.030> is

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
millimeter headphone jack cutout is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.070 
millimeter headphone jack cutout is
there<00:01:21.360> microphone<00:01:23.240> USB<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.450> microphone<00:01:24.869> down

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
there microphone USB and microphone down

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.960 
there microphone USB and microphone down
there<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.740> volume<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.490> power<00:01:26.729> are

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
there the volume and the power are

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.300 
there the volume and the power are
covered<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.290> snaps<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.280> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
covered so this snaps in like so and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.520 
covered so this snaps in like so and
this<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> very<00:01:30.030> unique<00:01:30.630> looking<00:01:31.110> case<00:01:31.170> as

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
this is a very unique looking case as

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.100 
this is a very unique looking case as
you<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.650> see<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:32.909> not<00:01:33.270> much<00:01:33.540> protection

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
you can see so it's not much protection

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.710 
you can see so it's not much protection
for<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:35.100> far<00:01:35.369> as<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> front<00:01:35.820> goes<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.630> if

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
for this as far as the front goes but if

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.450 
for this as far as the front goes but if
you<00:01:36.810> were<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.930> drop<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.409> down<00:01:37.590> like<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.130> it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
you were to drop it down like this it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.420 
you were to drop it down like this it
would<00:01:38.909> stop<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.420> from<00:01:40.170> getting<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:40.770> smash<00:01:41.189> on

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
would stop it from getting all smash on

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.850 
would stop it from getting all smash on
the<00:01:41.520> back<00:01:41.700> for<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.090> most<00:01:42.299> part<00:01:42.710> but<00:01:43.710> as<00:01:43.799> you

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the back for the most part but as you

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.969 
the back for the most part but as you
can<00:01:43.920> see<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> buttons<00:01:44.460> are<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:46.740> able<00:01:46.890> to

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
can see the buttons are you able to

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.480 
can see the buttons are you able to
access<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.369> buttons<00:01:47.670> very<00:01:48.030> easy<00:01:48.299> on<00:01:49.310> top<00:01:50.310> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
access the buttons very easy on top and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.060 
access the buttons very easy on top and
their<00:01:50.780> microphone<00:01:51.780> cutout<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.200> there<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.530> 3.5

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
their microphone cutout is there the 3.5

now the reason I get these more

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.830 
now the reason I get these more
affordable<00:04:20.530> cases<00:04:20.980> is<00:04:21.190> because<00:04:21.489> you<00:04:22.270> know<00:04:22.360> not

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840
