00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:21.140
 these here so here my name is liza old 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.550
 project is how to tell you or not even 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:29.570
 the project is a standard project that is 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:32.080
 This is now pressed, wait, but I earned 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.040
 he must drop you 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.950
 imagine that they donâ€™t 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.700
 included now here is what an example at all 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:47.090
 not included it there is nothing go tab 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:50.060
 get less siding like this 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.550
 choose show no need a little tea 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.369
 clicked so choose touchpad 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.710
 noble click see here's your idea 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:03.950
 It must be such that it is pressed 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:05.360
 enabled here I click it lights up here 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.500
 the same settings as mine can 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:15.350
 do not need someone to look all 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:20.390
 so here I understand this is the first 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.160
 the care mode and then everything did it 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.950
 I have a kick right now 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:32.989
 tonalities I will play tell only 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:38.989
 stop it i switch myself against 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:41.570
 Kappa key and show you clearly so I 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.519
 took the sampler of the man who invested 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:49.630
 the land of the skrillex now i do now 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.630
 I will show you by example spiritually 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.170
 Immediately I want to say that someone never 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.790
 I do not use it kiwi 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.440
 miserable making music for example 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.680
 any remix 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.310
 let's better pick think not worth it 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.080
 better to first get the hang itself to the 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.530
 itself indicated these program as 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:17.630
 ableton and file judge so here it is with us 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:25.209
 beat maker fluid and see pisi that is 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:25.209
 the bit directory is now quieter that is 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.980
 you go do the standard 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.550
 Sounds here it still do not understand what it is 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.010
 such a 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:38.390
 most likely management or some 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:46.100
 effects but then you cant that is 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:49.100
 The idea is that I have samples loaded 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.650
 special bag for how i don't remember 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.230
 which is also called but when 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.430
 do remixes to a famous song 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.430
 now shit 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.709
 as it is called I would get my write so 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.220
 here that is now clean and just 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.220
 calm and 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:35.210
 that 's all at once the next lesson we have 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.139
 will be user1 by user 2 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.449
 download such a car program yourself 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:46.099
 until the mixture is dealt with by hand too 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:48.229
 later I lay here all use so 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:51.529
 Immediately tell the example that this is how I am 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.550
 understood it so no one when you turn on with 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:56.180
 these joysticks 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.370
 small dots so here it is a groz 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:03.349
 the bits you so I'll show you clearly too 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:08.300
 example this button will say it like this 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:10.449
 myself like less work long separate 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:19.520
 channels on put total load bits 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:22.870
 there was a bit of a song 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.870
 just put melodic 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.740
 to 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:39.590
 so that she can work for me 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.080
 positive knife and I'm not the one that's got a 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.020
 here he is a cruiser, too, will be green because 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.440
 that the box has not yet figured out that is 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:52.400
 see i press the buttons he switches 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:56.860
 All this is so his Japanese girl then another head 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.860
 the type does not work 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:04.790
 beatmaker's also this now 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.400
 let's see, I also have a strong dream 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.750
 I did not understand even with this something 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.550
 you can use it is 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.480
 he switches quietly just finally 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:17.780
 fill in the buttons that is tok tok to to 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:21.520
 The effect of watching, I certainly have nothing 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.520
 enjoyed let's vividly follow 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:45.940
 and so do too much 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.940
 everything needs to be set up 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.139
 not 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.139
 not 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:07:00.199
 here nights all let's do my music 

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:05.090
