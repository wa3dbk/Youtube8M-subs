in a non compatible way now let's talk

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.130 
in a non compatible way now let's talk
about<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.430> what<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.120> non<00:00:42.300> compatible<00:00:42.989> mean

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
about that what is non compatible mean

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.990 
about that what is non compatible mean
non-compatible<00:00:43.770> means<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.399> every<00:00:44.910> other

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
non-compatible means that every other

foam blaster toy that's wanted to

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.920 
foam blaster toy that's wanted to
compete<00:00:47.640> has<00:00:47.850> had<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.120> compete<00:00:48.450> with<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:48.840> is

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
compete has had to compete with what is

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.110 
compete has had to compete with what is
the<00:00:49.379> industry<00:00:49.829> standard<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.879> is

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
the industry standard and this is

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.700 
the industry standard and this is
frankly<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.230> what<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> industry

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
frankly this is what the industry

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.770 
frankly this is what the industry
standard<00:00:53.460> looks<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.360> half<00:00:54.600> inch

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
standard looks like it is a half inch

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.430 
standard looks like it is a half inch
foam<00:00:55.079> backer<00:00:55.350> rod<00:00:55.620> Dart<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:57.079> that's<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.350> it

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
foam backer rod Dart and that's what it

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.069 
foam backer rod Dart and that's what it
looks<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:58.829> these<00:00:59.550> are<00:00:59.609> non<00:01:00.300> compatible<00:01:00.930> and

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
looks like these are non compatible and

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.959 
looks like these are non compatible and
therefore<00:01:01.500> trying<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.160> kind<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.489> make<00:01:02.730> their

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
therefore trying to kind of make their

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.170 
therefore trying to kind of make their
own<00:01:03.000> way<00:01:03.359> through<00:01:04.489> this<00:01:05.489> industry<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.119> that

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
own way through this industry and that

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.450 
own way through this industry and that
is<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> very<00:01:06.659> dangerous<00:01:07.290> game<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.130> playing

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
is a very dangerous game to be playing

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.490 
is a very dangerous game to be playing
because<00:01:08.909> everybody<00:01:09.420> else<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.869> cross

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
because everybody else is cross

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.620 
because everybody else is cross

can<00:01:12.930> fire<00:01:13.200> their<00:01:13.740> darts<00:01:14.130> which<00:01:14.310> means<00:01:14.580> it's

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
can fire their darts which means it's

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.640 
can fire their darts which means it's
very<00:01:15.330> possible<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:16.110> go<00:01:16.229> out<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.500> buy<00:01:16.619> a

very possible to go out and buy a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.350 
very possible to go out and buy a

Buzzbee blaster if you're a nerf
enthusiast<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.259> very<00:01:19.549> difficult<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.909> blend

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
enthusiast it's very difficult to blend

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
enthusiast it's very difficult to blend
these<00:01:22.140> two<00:01:22.590> platforms<00:01:23.210> where<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.299> go<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.780> any

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
these two platforms where to go in any

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.740 
these two platforms where to go in any
sort<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.890> meaningful<00:01:26.130> way<00:01:27.060> as<00:01:27.330> they<00:01:27.509> just

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
sort of meaningful way as they just

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.600 
sort of meaningful way as they just
don't<00:01:27.990> jive<00:01:28.350> very<00:01:28.680> well<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> only<00:01:29.220> thing<00:01:29.369> that

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
don't jive very well the only thing that

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.789 
don't jive very well the only thing that
they<00:01:29.850> do<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.450> common<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.350> while<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
they do have in common is that while the

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.410 
they do have in common is that while the
rail<00:01:32.009> attachments<00:01:32.640> are<00:01:32.759> slightly<00:01:33.030> different

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
rail attachments are slightly different

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.440 
rail attachments are slightly different
they<00:01:34.259> are<00:01:34.650> cross<00:01:35.040> compatible<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:36.180> use

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
they are cross compatible so you can use

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.719 
they are cross compatible so you can use
rail<00:01:37.110> attachment<00:01:37.320> accessories<00:01:38.250> between<00:01:38.610> the

rail attachment accessories between the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.850 
rail attachment accessories between the
two<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.450> decided<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.470> purpose<00:01:40.799> of

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
two so I decided that for the purpose of

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.859 
two so I decided that for the purpose of
this<00:01:40.979> comparison<00:01:41.430> we<00:01:41.549> would<00:01:41.850> use<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.600> boom

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
this comparison we would use the boom

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.230 
this comparison we would use the boom
code<00:01:43.170> Dyna<00:01:43.500> mag<00:01:43.770> which<00:01:44.130> ironically<00:01:44.850> enough

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
code Dyna mag which ironically enough

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.060 
code Dyna mag which ironically enough
fires<00:01:45.930> what<00:01:46.290> would<00:01:46.409> be<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.770> technical

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
fires what would be the technical

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.980 
fires what would be the technical
definition<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.689> clip<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.990> nerf

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990

retaliator<00:01:52.909> which<00:01:53.909> ironically<00:01:54.689> fires<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.500> nerf

role<00:03:51.040> as<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.310> weird<00:03:51.610> clip<00:03:52.090> system<00:03:52.329> pistol<00:03:52.959> not

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
role as a weird clip system pistol not

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.360 
role as a weird clip system pistol not
that<00:03:53.380> there's<00:03:53.590> anything<00:03:53.829> wrong<00:03:53.980> with<00:03:54.340> that

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
that there's anything wrong with that

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.789 
that there's anything wrong with that
it's<00:03:54.700> just<00:03:54.820> more<00:03:55.600> limiting<00:03:56.049> of<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.260> platform

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
it's just more limiting of a platform

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.729 
it's just more limiting of a platform
and<00:03:56.980> that<00:03:57.070> just<00:03:57.340> boils<00:03:58.299> down<00:03:58.570> to<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:59.079> not

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
and that just boils down to it not

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.680 
and that just boils down to it not
having<00:04:00.190> that<00:04:00.340> kind<00:04:00.549> of<00:04:00.700> market<00:04:01.120> experience

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
having that kind of market experience

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.140 
having that kind of market experience
and<00:04:01.870> not<00:04:02.019> knowing<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.530> tacticool<00:04:03.280> is<00:04:03.519> where

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
and not knowing the tacticool is where

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.199 
and not knowing the tacticool is where
it's<00:04:04.329> at<00:04:04.540> in<00:04:04.810> terms<00:04:05.079> of<00:04:05.410> toy<00:04:06.130> blasters<00:04:06.820> so

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
it's at in terms of toy blasters so

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.770 
it's at in terms of toy blasters so
what's<00:04:08.019> my<00:04:08.440> verdict<00:04:08.890> on<00:04:09.100> nerf<00:04:09.519> vs.<00:04:10.030> boom<00:04:10.269> Co<00:04:10.570> we

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
what's my verdict on nerf vs. boom Co we

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.270 
what's my verdict on nerf vs. boom Co we
could<00:04:10.959> take<00:04:11.140> a<00:04:11.170> bunch<00:04:11.470> of<00:04:11.560> different<00:04:11.859> blasters

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
could take a bunch of different blasters

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.150 
could take a bunch of different blasters
but<00:04:12.549> I<00:04:12.579> I<00:04:12.940> still<00:04:13.810> like<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.410> mag<00:04:14.590> strike<00:04:14.920> more

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
but I I still like the mag strike more

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.009 
but I I still like the mag strike more
than<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.430> rapid<00:04:15.820> madness<00:04:16.299> I<00:04:16.539> like<00:04:16.720> a<00:04:16.750> knight

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019

finder<00:04:17.470> more<00:04:17.769> than<00:04:17.890> I<00:04:17.979> like<00:04:18.190> their<00:04:18.430> single

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
finder more than I like their single

niche<00:04:21.519> kind<00:04:22.180> of<00:04:22.360> blaster<00:04:22.780> for<00:04:23.050> me<00:04:23.229> but<00:04:23.470> for<00:04:24.070> the

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
niche kind of blaster for me but for the

some<00:04:57.580> people<00:04:57.909> get<00:04:58.120> to<00:04:58.150> use<00:04:58.479> boom<00:04:59.050> Co<00:04:59.289> blasters

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
some people get to use boom Co blasters

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.529 
some people get to use boom Co blasters
for<00:04:59.949> humans<00:05:00.279> versus<00:05:00.610> zombies<00:05:00.939> if<00:05:01.090> you<00:05:01.210> modify

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
for humans versus zombies if you modify

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.709 
for humans versus zombies if you modify
them<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:01.870> shoot<00:05:02.169> hard<00:05:02.529> I<00:05:03.180> feel<00:05:04.180> like<00:05:04.389> these

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:04.719 
them to shoot hard I feel like these

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:06.450 
them to shoot hard I feel like these
darts<00:05:05.139> are<00:05:05.259> almost<00:05:05.529> dangerous<00:05:05.830> they<00:05:06.250> don't

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
darts are almost dangerous they don't

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.519 
darts are almost dangerous they don't
have<00:05:06.639> a<00:05:06.669> soft<00:05:07.029> compressible<00:05:07.479> tip<00:05:07.990> so<00:05:08.259> unless

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:08.529 
have a soft compressible tip so unless

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:10.800 
have a soft compressible tip so unless
your<00:05:08.710> zombies<00:05:09.129> wear<00:05:09.340> eye<00:05:09.370> protection<00:05:09.699> I<00:05:10.300> think

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
your zombies wear eye protection I think

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.379 
your zombies wear eye protection I think
that<00:05:10.930> that's<00:05:11.050> unsafe<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:12.789> then<00:05:13.150> in<00:05:13.270> addition

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
that that's unsafe and then in addition

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:14.939 
that that's unsafe and then in addition
their<00:05:13.840> stock<00:05:14.050> performance<00:05:14.319> is<00:05:14.740> just

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
their stock performance is just

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:18.269 
their stock performance is just
atrocious<00:05:15.279> III<00:05:16.150> would<00:05:16.659> not<00:05:16.810> trust<00:05:17.199> my<00:05:17.830> human

nothing<00:05:31.839> I<00:05:32.050> definitely<00:05:32.650> think<00:05:32.860> that<00:05:33.129> is<00:05:33.490> a

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
nothing I definitely think that is a

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.459 
nothing I definitely think that is a
