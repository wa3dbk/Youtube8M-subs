 disk 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.689
 plays a lot of image and once 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.960
 when you mount the image it will look like 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.630
 this this square will open 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.439
 proposed by the archives 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.930
 and in this folder it seems that everything is growing 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.680
 a well-planned sector to give double 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.680
 click to the sector 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.800
 download here good here already in st next 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.910
 here we will choose the routes where 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:26.280
 we want it to be installed I'm going to look 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:29.040
 here you where you want next 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.970
 are these three parliaments those that do 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:38.069
 because they are the three necessary for 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.069
 install the video 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.260
 good guys here the end of the 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.140
 installation and when it finishes it's going to 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:50.030
 say and such in point net 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:54.210
 he remembered 4.0 here they are going to install the 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.570
 net framework 4.0 if any do not have it 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.930
 well I will give even better because I already 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.930
 install 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.069
 and they can say inta link 3 magazine 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.799
 this would already be the other option that 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.040
 we took homeless remove this little pill 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:22.640
 here the truth is going to take a lot 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.640
 and there not so much because I and the Italy 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:36.430
 This can lead you to something else because 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:38.459
 but you'll be to them a while 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.860
 there is not a lot of discussion if not 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.390
 will suffice 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.390
 to see it load 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.020
 and although I hope that this 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.330
 cooked and I'll pass it 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:01.030
 well it's over and now it's opened 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.030
 this other window that is going to tell you 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.520
 well I do not feel like it but they are going to have 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:11.210
 to wait a while for the truths are more 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.240
 or so I waited about 8 minutes equal 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.489
 the same thing takes the installation the 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.040
 installation the same afternoon these 8 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.590
 minutes 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.230
 and this will take more or less 87 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.190
 minutes or so and I'm going to stop 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.190
 because the truth takes me a lot 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.360
 well I think it will be over and 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:36.760
 they would facilitate redistributed 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:40.630
 accept and finish and there will be a lot of fear 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.670
 to install the first card that is and 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.370
 good guys there are we will have finished 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.690
 but they could not play now what 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.930
 we're going to have to start our 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:55.480
 steam account that I already have it started and 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:58.450
 local estimated that until game and canada 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.080

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.460
 ball 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:07.069
 sting 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:10.030
 and others but we hope that we are charged 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:10.030
 all the files because 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:20.740
 all files all files 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.550
 to see and see and I guess I'm going 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.400
 finished 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.169

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.360

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:36.340

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.870
 wait and let's wait a little while and 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.779

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.150

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.319
 play because it is bad guide all the 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.449
 concluded but if I'm going to open with the 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:53.919

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:56.469
 little window that is going to say ask me 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.389
 but what is going to look like is not going to 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:59.889
 appear in full screen not a 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:01.650
 This is how much more or less the 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:06.129
 Steam height or a little bit bigger 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:07.599
 Esteban are going to have to go to options and 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:10.180
 number and they will change all the 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:13.689
 graphics and full windows 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:16.680
