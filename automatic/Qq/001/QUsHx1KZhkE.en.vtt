with<00:00:45.149> all<00:00:45.390> day<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:46.280> know<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> argument<00:00:47.879> being

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
with all day I know the argument being

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.330 
with all day I know the argument being
that<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.840> zoom<00:00:49.170> has<00:00:49.410> all<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.770> focal<00:00:50.129> lengths

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
that a zoom has all the focal lengths

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.549 
that a zoom has all the focal lengths
available<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.960> need<00:00:52.170> several

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
available and that you need several

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.490 
available and that you need several
planes<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.340> cover<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.850> however<00:00:54.809> this

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
planes to cover this however this

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.410 
planes to cover this however this
doesn't<00:00:55.800> fit<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> way<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> shoot<00:00:56.940> anyway

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
doesn't fit with the way I shoot anyway

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.020 
doesn't fit with the way I shoot anyway
I<00:00:57.629> really<00:00:58.530> walk<00:00:58.949> around<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.430> all<00:00:59.550> my<00:00:59.670> lenses

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
I really walk around with all my lenses

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.510 
I really walk around with all my lenses
in<00:01:00.180> my<00:01:00.270> pocket<00:01:00.829> generally<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.010> something

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
in my pocket generally this is something

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.020 
in my pocket generally this is something
that<00:01:02.699> newbies<00:01:03.149> do<00:01:04.040> so<00:01:05.040> wait<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.489> big<00:01:05.790> factor

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
that newbies do so wait is a big factor

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.560 
that newbies do so wait is a big factor
I<00:01:07.100> know<00:01:08.100> many<00:01:08.460> people<00:01:08.820> who<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.000> regretted

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
I know many people who have regretted

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.590 
I know many people who have regretted
buying<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.130> 70-200<00:01:11.130> 2.8<00:01:11.159> zoom<00:01:11.970> because<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
buying a 70-200 2.8 zoom because of the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.310 
buying a 70-200 2.8 zoom because of the
weight<00:01:12.750> factor<00:01:13.970> remember<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.689> plane<00:01:15.990> also

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
weight factor remember that I plane also

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.399 
weight factor remember that I plane also
has<00:01:16.860> much<00:01:17.100> less<00:01:17.369> distortion<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.180> assume<00:01:18.509> most

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
has much less distortion in assume most

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.929 
has much less distortion in assume most
distortion<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.310> be<00:01:20.430> corrected<00:01:20.640> and

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
distortion can be corrected and

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.850 
distortion can be corrected and
post-processing<00:01:21.540> but<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.650> still

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
post-processing but it's still

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.090 
post-processing but it's still
worthwhile<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.520> consider<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:25.650> next<00:01:25.979> is

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
worthwhile to consider this the next is

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.859 
worthwhile to consider this the next is

1.4 I basically had four times or a
tantrum<00:03:24.269> at<00:03:24.480> camera<00:03:24.930> which<00:03:25.530> gives<00:03:25.799> me<00:03:25.950> the

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
tantrum at camera which gives me the

rooms<00:03:30.840> much<00:03:31.530> much<00:03:31.980> more<00:03:32.280> than<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:33.150> zoom<00:03:33.359> does

say<00:03:34.290> at<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.620> same<00:03:34.859> football<00:03:35.370> length<00:03:37.220> the

say at the same football length the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.400 
say at the same football length the
common<00:03:38.609> argument<00:03:39.120> against<00:03:39.510> primes<00:03:39.810> is<00:03:40.169> that

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
common argument against primes is that

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.750 
common argument against primes is that
they<00:03:40.500> are<00:03:40.530> fixed<00:03:40.950> lenses<00:03:41.370> by<00:03:41.519> their<00:03:41.730> very

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
they are fixed lenses by their very

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.750 
they are fixed lenses by their very
design<00:03:42.380> however<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.829> think<00:03:44.459> this<00:03:44.549> actually

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
design however I think this actually

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.970 
design however I think this actually
improves<00:03:45.359> my<00:03:45.599> shooting<00:03:46.049> rattle<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.560> hinders

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
improves my shooting rattle and hinders

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.360 
improves my shooting rattle and hinders
it<00:03:47.359> with<00:03:48.359> a<00:03:48.389> prime<00:03:48.690> lens<00:03:49.019> you're<00:03:49.829> forced<00:03:50.220> to

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
it with a prime lens you're forced to

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.520 
it with a prime lens you're forced to
move<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:50.970> find<00:03:51.269> an<00:03:51.359> interesting<00:03:51.690> composition

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
move and find an interesting composition

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.860 
move and find an interesting composition
instead<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.459> simply<00:03:53.669> zooming<00:03:54.239> into<00:03:54.389> what<00:03:54.750> you

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
instead of simply zooming into what you

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.220 
instead of simply zooming into what you

certainly<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.739> photographer<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.609> has<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.760> keen

in<00:04:02.700> fact<00:04:03.209> that's<00:04:03.540> really<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.079> only<00:04:04.109> two

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
in fact that's really the only two

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.360 
in fact that's really the only two
things<00:04:04.739> i<00:04:04.980> do<00:04:05.099> shoot<00:04:05.579> i<00:04:06.590> really<00:04:07.590> don't<00:04:07.769> see<00:04:08.040> the

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
things i do shoot i really don't see the

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.409 
things i do shoot i really don't see the
need<00:04:08.730> for<00:04:09.120> zooms<00:04:09.449> and<00:04:09.989> what<00:04:10.139> i<00:04:10.169> did<00:04:10.500> personally

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
need for zooms and what i did personally

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.629 
need for zooms and what i did personally
however<00:04:12.419> i<00:04:12.720> have<00:04:12.959> shot<00:04:13.470> several<00:04:13.859> weddings<00:04:14.190> and

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
however i have shot several weddings and

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:18.110 
however i have shot several weddings and
my<00:04:14.699> team<00:04:14.970> using<00:04:15.780> all<00:04:15.989> primes<00:04:16.880> this<00:04:17.880> is

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
my team using all primes this is

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.240 
my team using all primes this is
something<00:04:18.359> that<00:04:18.599> can<00:04:18.840> be<00:04:18.989> done<00:04:19.199> and<00:04:19.829> I<00:04:19.949> believe

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
something that can be done and I believe

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.120 
something that can be done and I believe
achieves<00:04:20.849> a<00:04:21.090> different<00:04:21.570> effect<00:04:21.750> 2i<00:04:22.440> zoom<00:04:22.800> does

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
achieves a different effect 2i zoom does

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.550 
achieves a different effect 2i zoom does
however<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:24.570> photographer<00:04:25.080> needs<00:04:25.289> to<00:04:25.380> have<00:04:25.500> a

shooting a wedding and you're having to

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.690 
shooting a wedding and you're having to
think<00:04:36.750> about<00:04:36.900> shutter<00:04:37.320> speed<00:04:37.680> aperture<00:04:38.130> and

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
think about shutter speed aperture and

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.360 
think about shutter speed aperture and
ISO<00:04:39.420> too<00:04:39.480> much<00:04:39.900> you<00:04:40.530> have<00:04:40.650> more<00:04:40.830> work<00:04:41.040> to<00:04:41.100> do

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
ISO too much you have more work to do

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.890 
ISO too much you have more work to do
and<00:04:41.640> you<00:04:41.850> maybe<00:04:42.030> shouldn't<00:04:42.420> be<00:04:42.540> there<00:04:42.720> to

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
and you maybe shouldn't be there to

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.710 
and you maybe shouldn't be there to
start<00:04:43.140> with<00:04:45.290> another<00:04:46.550> lastly<00:04:47.550> big<00:04:48.030> reason<00:04:48.540> to

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
start with another lastly big reason to

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.310 
start with another lastly big reason to
select<00:04:49.020> the<00:04:49.140> plane<00:04:49.350> lids<00:04:49.680> is<00:04:49.920> the<00:04:50.460> cash<00:04:50.670> saving

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
select the plane lids is the cash saving

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.110 
select the plane lids is the cash saving
playing<00:04:52.320> lenders<00:04:52.710> are<00:04:52.740> always<00:04:53.340> much<00:04:53.670> simpler

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
playing lenders are always much simpler

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.240 
playing lenders are always much simpler
in<00:04:54.270> construction<00:04:54.870> since<00:04:55.680> they<00:04:55.800> are<00:04:55.890> fixed

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
in construction since they are fixed

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.390 
in construction since they are fixed
pieces<00:04:56.610> of<00:04:56.730> glass<00:04:57.380> therefore<00:04:58.380> they<00:04:59.040> are<00:04:59.070> much

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
pieces of glass therefore they are much

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.680 
pieces of glass therefore they are much
cheaper<00:04:59.670> than<00:04:59.850> the<00:05:00.000> zoom<00:05:00.300> lens<00:05:00.330> of<00:05:00.870> comparison

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
cheaper than the zoom lens of comparison

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.810 
cheaper than the zoom lens of comparison
this<00:05:03.690> is<00:05:03.960> certainly<00:05:04.500> true<00:05:04.650> of<00:05:04.890> shorter<00:05:05.610> focal

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
this is certainly true of shorter focal

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.390 
this is certainly true of shorter focal
lens<00:05:06.210> but<00:05:07.200> remember<00:05:07.860> there<00:05:08.160> will<00:05:08.220> be<00:05:08.370> a

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
lens but remember there will be a

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.640 
lens but remember there will be a
different<00:05:08.820> story<00:05:08.970> if<00:05:09.420> you<00:05:09.960> want<00:05:10.140> a<00:05:10.200> 400

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
different story if you want a 400
