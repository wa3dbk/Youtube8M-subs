00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:00.999
 it's possible 

00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:04.259
 welcome to step 2 where the white corners will be placed 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.779
 first we search for white stickers in the top layer 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.839
 I have two next to each other here that he thinks they choose 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.679
 you choose this one 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.069
 this is the white 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:18.069
 blue too long 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.559
 gucci group nokia must get there well we are running again direct source 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.079
 m 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.229
 then we will try to use the wind by first using the algorithm 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.970
 but first have to know the white town on the left to get to the 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.990
 right side set 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.620
 what's not on the front yet 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.040
 in this case satyam is on the left 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.270
 and once grabbed city and that is 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.710
 every school 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.710
 about this differently 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.700
 and everyone knows that 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.740
 I have 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.740
 this block has cut which boat in itself 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.490
 bout I also walk you must come here facebook button you directly above the place 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.890
 where it should go, but now they want this white sticker on the right 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.560
 well then usual to the eyes and that algorithm is 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.640
 Jaap shook it 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.050
 and then you are in it too 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.100
 sometimes have a situation like this but with twitter sticker at the top 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.040
 Sept. 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.580
 now the parool is the white orange 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.800
 scientist cheek just do it 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.950
 so this must 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.160
 sit there but we now do secondary vocational education 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.410
 but after all turned learned may already 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.240
 three times 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.030
 terror 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.830
 yes on shot handsome shot 4 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.980
 snipers now on software for any kind of club or 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.540
 and if you are the white one it may also be that we have a situation like this 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.490
 but in it you also all put in the right place but should still be 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.620
 turned 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.350
 can quickly see on which side the white sticker is 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.450
 see links here so use the first algorithm and there were twice that 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.669
 every school liam fox l 4 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.390
 el at school parties back at school 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:11.109
 and now pathetic group in the right place 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.839
 because we have already solved male twittering very flatly 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:17.839
 and we see that they are sort of everywhere 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:20.269
 we pick pick 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.339
 We go one step further to place towels from the second layer
