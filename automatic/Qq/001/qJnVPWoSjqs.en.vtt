chasing<00:02:53.360> enemy<00:02:53.660> crew<00:02:53.900> etc<00:02:54.519> so<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.640> game<00:02:55.850> is

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
chasing enemy crew etc so the game is

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.940 
chasing enemy crew etc so the game is
really<00:02:56.209> dynamic<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:57.019> fast-paced<00:02:57.500> and
