00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.900
 competition is tough on the segment 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.540
 city ​​cars with french stars 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.950
 like the 208 and the clio one of the 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.900
 category references is no other 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.460
 that the polo proposed in 3 or 5 doors 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.310
 with a very wide choice of 10 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.689
 motorization and 9 finish among all 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.060
 these polos we try today the 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.029
 intermediate diesel engine 1 6 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.860
 tdi of 90 horses associated with the box dsg 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.329
 and the high-end sportsline finish 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.950
 and sports-oriented as his name 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.599
 the indicated it recognizes 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.230
 externally to the 16-inch wheels of 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.670
 series or over-glazed rear windows 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.440
 inside the highlight of the polo 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.969
 comes from her presentation quality she 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.530
 is one of the few in the category to 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.739
 use foamed plastics with 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.300
 the audi a1 or the citroën c3 or ds3 it's 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.379
 seriously a little too much with a 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.910
 very dark atmosphere 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.559
 we are surprised by big gaps 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.690
 of equipment like gps or kit 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.519
 bluetooth series on clio 208 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.289
 significantly cheaper as well as 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.399
 led daytime running lights at the rear 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.870
 bench is a bit hard and 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.469
 livability is in the average of the 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.050
 category 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.290
 the chest reaches 280 decimetres 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.670
 cubes a little less well than we clio 4 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.259
 one of the peculiarities of the finish 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.060
 sportline comes from greenhouse or series 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.850
 bigger but the sport chassis is not 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.380
 proposed option is 137 euros 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.790
 our car was pretty firm at low 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.890
 speed but my most flexible on 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.210
 road and 90 horses are widely 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.979
 enough for this small size and 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.259
 allow easy raises but 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.790
 fastest in the category the dsg box 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.020
 and as always fast is sweet but 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.790
 our car had to deal with 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.030
 some bass blow to unusual 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.229
 speed and a misdirected page rank 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.610
 surprise on the other hand this version 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.649
 did not have a stop and start 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.820
 in fact to benefit from a stop and 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.009
 start choose the polo 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.710
 bluemotion technology but the dsg box 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.509
 is not offered with the tdi 90 if the 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.340
 sportsline finish in our state 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.659
 test vehicle was therefore shown to these 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.159
 greedy with almost a rite 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.799
 additional measured by us 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.659
 compared to the clio dci 90 little affluent 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.700
 the reduced bluemotion version 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.560
 significantly this gap 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.789
 between excessive consumption and 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.490
 equipment gaps this polo 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.079
 sportline tdi 90 tsg lepreau clearly 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.850
 not care about your wallet 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.049
 this usual at volkswagen at 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.049
 purchase - use
