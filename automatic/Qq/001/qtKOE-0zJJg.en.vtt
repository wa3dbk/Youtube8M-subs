00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.300 
to be and why doesn't he want to UM is
it<00:03:46.720> because<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:47.140> guys<00:03:47.200> aren't<00:03:47.470> ready<00:03:47.709> yet<00:03:47.890> if

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.759 
respect him but if you've already been
active<00:03:52.360> together<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:52.959> then<00:03:53.320> he's<00:03:53.620> not

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
active together and then he's not

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.800 
active together and then he's not
