bonnet and pay $25 for but even with

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.530 
bonnet and pay $25 for but even with
that<00:01:49.230> said<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.010> is<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> nice<00:01:50.640> button<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.360> you

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
that said it is a nice button and you

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.950 
that said it is a nice button and you
might<00:01:51.810> want<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.110> pay<00:01:52.260> $25<00:01:53.100> for<00:01:53.400> i<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.720> don't

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
might want to pay $25 for i just don't

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.980 
might want to pay $25 for i just don't
think<00:01:55.050> for<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:56.430> satin<00:01:56.820> bonnet<00:01:57.000> it's<00:01:57.720> worth

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
think for a satin bonnet it's worth

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.180 
think for a satin bonnet it's worth
twenty-five<00:01:58.560> dollars<00:01:58.740> i<00:01:59.250> would<00:01:59.670> probably<00:01:59.880> pay

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
twenty-five dollars i would probably pay

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.670 
twenty-five dollars i would probably pay
fifteen<00:02:02.190> dollars<00:02:02.670> for<00:02:02.970> but<00:02:03.690> not<00:02:03.840> 25<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.650> i

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
fifteen dollars for but not 25 so i

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.150 
fifteen dollars for but not 25 so i
think<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:05.070> apart<00:02:05.340> might<00:02:05.490> want<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.790> reconsider

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
think the apart might want to reconsider

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.350 
think the apart might want to reconsider
lowering<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> price<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.759> that's<00:02:08.849> just<00:02:09.119> mine

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
lowering the price and that's just mine

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.030 
lowering the price and that's just mine
my<00:02:09.959> honest<00:02:10.440> opinion<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.970> i<00:02:12.440> have<00:02:13.440> slept<00:02:13.709> with
