00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
it really doesn't matter as long as he's

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.010 
it really doesn't matter as long as he's
outside<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> map<00:01:21.030> Utah<00:01:21.330> sounds<00:01:21.659> tactical

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
outside the map Utah sounds tactical

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.230 
outside the map Utah sounds tactical
insertion<00:01:22.110> outside<00:01:22.830> with<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.460> after

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
insertion outside with you and after

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.120 
insertion outside with you and after
that<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:24.810> both<00:01:25.110> run<00:01:25.530> over<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.040> this

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
that then you can both run over to this

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.880 
that then you can both run over to this
position<00:01:26.340> now<00:01:27.259> it's<00:01:28.259> important<00:01:28.590> you're<00:01:28.770> in

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
position now it's important you're in

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.170 
position now it's important you're in
these<00:01:29.040> positions<00:01:29.280> when<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.700> get<00:01:29.820> picked<00:01:30.030> up

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
these positions when you get picked up

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.210 
these positions when you get picked up
because<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.439> where<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:32.040> begin

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
because that is where you begin

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.950 
because that is where you begin
glitching<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.150> like<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.570> you're<00:01:33.689> not<00:01:33.810> in

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
glitching and so like if you're not in

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.690 
glitching and so like if you're not in
the<00:01:34.290> correct<00:01:34.500> position<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.100> Osprey<00:01:35.490> gunner

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the correct position the Osprey gunner

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.719 
the correct position the Osprey gunner
will<00:01:36.360> have<00:01:36.650> will<00:01:37.650> not<00:01:38.040> lift<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
will have will not lift you to the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.219 
will have will not lift you to the
correct<00:01:38.909> position<00:01:39.060> now<00:01:39.479> since<00:01:39.750> he<00:01:40.020> brought

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
correct position now since he brought

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.289 
correct position now since he brought
the<00:01:40.380> flag<00:01:40.650> out<00:01:40.860> with<00:01:41.009> him<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.579> flag<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.880> here

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
the flag out with him the flag is here

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.999 
the flag out with him the flag is here

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
and it's on Team defenders so you can

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
capture it both of you and so you need

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.420 
capture it both of you and so you need

then just wait a little bit now this is
a<00:03:00.450> little<00:03:00.720> more<00:03:00.870> technical<00:03:01.709> where<00:03:02.070> you<00:03:02.130> get

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
a little more technical where you get

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.740 
a little more technical where you get

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
picked up you want to wait for the thing

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.970 
picked up you want to wait for the thing
to<00:03:03.840> fly<00:03:04.019> over<00:03:04.050> before<00:03:04.560> they<00:03:04.650> let<00:03:04.769> you<00:03:04.830> capture

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
tactical insertion and you are actually

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.340 
tactical insertion and you are actually
on<00:03:40.890> top<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:42.060> building<00:03:42.299> now<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:42.780> in<00:03:43.260> a

on top of the building now and in a

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.479 
on top of the building now and in a
little<00:03:43.560> bit<00:03:43.680> you'll<00:03:43.799> see<00:03:43.829> how<00:03:44.160> you<00:03:44.220> can<00:03:44.340> just

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
little bit you'll see how you can just

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.800 
little bit you'll see how you can just
toss<00:03:44.610> out<00:03:44.790> some<00:03:44.910> care<00:03:45.090> packages<00:03:45.480> to<00:03:45.510> get<00:03:45.690> up

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
toss out some care packages to get up

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.960 
toss out some care packages to get up
there<00:03:45.959> so<00:03:46.350> before<00:03:46.590> anything<00:03:47.430> else<00:03:47.519> happens<00:03:47.640> I
