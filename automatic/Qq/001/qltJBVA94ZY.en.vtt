00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.010
 to make sure we do not have a 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.930
 folder in the logo already created the first 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.710
 what we will do is go to start and execute 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.260
 cmd 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.900
 now inside the console we will execute 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.849
 the netzer command 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.220
 if what that command shows you by 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.830
 screen does not contain the net logo folder 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.640
 and your route then still does not have this 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.919
 folder we close the console and we're going to 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.060
 create the folder for example on disk 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:34.360
 local we give you local disk equipment ce 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.650
 we click right new folder the 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.650
 we call net lobón 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.600
 now we right click on this and the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.699
 let's share but not from this 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.699
 option but from properties 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.320
 Share flap 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.320
 advanced sharing 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:02.160
 we click continue 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.270
 and here we label this option we leave this 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.550
 by default and now we give you to apply and 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.130
 to accept 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.020
 and we would have the folder in the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.240
 logo ready for use 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.860
 now if you want you can go back to home 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.920
 write cmd 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.230
 and when you put the netzer command you will see that 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.590
 the net lobón folder and its 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.590
 route 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.170
 now that we have in the logo we could 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.159
 access windows server users 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.010
 2008 through him euser manager point 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.240
 m sc 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.240
 we are going to continue 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.350
 and now for example we could to a 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.420
 user for example techno we're going to 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.180
 properties 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.930
 Lapel profile now we could 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.150
 add a login script 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.250
 that to add it, the 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.850
 folder in the logo we enter inside 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.939
 this and we will have to leave a script 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.090
 let's go again we create a document of 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.090
 text 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.290
 and we put a small command for example 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.000
 now 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.280
 We are going to ask you to show us 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.280
 screen that text string hello 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.230
 we save the file with point extension 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.379
 bat in my case I'll call you point script 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.379
 bat 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.739
 Once the script is created, we can 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:42.349
 give a single clean the rest of the 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.870
 folder we go back to the configuration of 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.480
 user and here we will simply write 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.340
 the name of the windows file is 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.150
 will direct access to the 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.150
 folder in the log on 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.459
 now to prove this we close session 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.849
 now we go back in as the user 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.239
 to which we put the start script 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.239
 of session 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.269
 and we see that something has been executed 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.410
 it was our hello script 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.410
 and it works correctly
