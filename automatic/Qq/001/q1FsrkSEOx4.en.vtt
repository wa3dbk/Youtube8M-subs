00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.380
 Hi, I'm Alejandro Coria and you're in my 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840
 house that is your house and this time you 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.059
 I have an amazing surprise for you 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.950
 wedding is awesome and we're going to do it 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.200
 in our colors we will see what 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.390
 material we are going to work these branches are 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.130
 they call liana good these branches after 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.470
 get in some market if not 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.140
 you specifically find these that you 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.810
 they call lianas you look for branches that can be 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.870
 moldea usually have to have them 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.540
 soaked in these are balls or fruits 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.850
 weeping willow this is called stat and 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.489
 here we have lentejita which is this 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.100
 green foliage and a little bit of egypt 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.929
 final in the country where I live there is no 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.390
 matter what matters are the 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.339
 combinations this bar is called nail 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.949
 cat we also have a little bird that 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.440
 we have we are going to use these two slats 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.149
 that is a ribbon like draft and this 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.730
 ribbon is organza we are also going to 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.789
 use this natural tie in brown 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.750
 special glue for water here 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.670
 we have a vase, a bucket 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.220
 galvanized that already have their material 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.110
 wet oasis inside and why 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.150
 you know you always have to recycle a 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.460
 little here we have a little bottle of 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.460
 soda that we're going to recycle the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.230
 scissors for flowers and scissors for 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.080
 the slats the first thing we're going to 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.300
 to do is measure our ally in half 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.480
 because how are we going to make the heart 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.630
 we need to mark the peak of the heart and 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.300
 now we are going to twist them a little bit if 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.360
 you look like this and on the other side the same and 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.320
 Now let's find the tips 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.960
 other 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.690
 you cross them and we're going to put 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.270
 a league to stop the league first 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.119
 I recommend that you put it like this between 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.640
 rods and flip it because that will 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.650
 will allow you to fix the league better 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.720
 that if you try to put the common 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.780
 tail of each one is not very firm 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.150
 so for that we're going to use this tie 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.400
 that we have here then with lasso let's go 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.400
 to tie very well the whole heart 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.650
 well here we already have our heart 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.380
 formed and then now we're going to 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.480
 work the small ships that we are going to 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.460
 put around the heart to work 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.950
 the bouquets I'm going to need a little 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.390
 of flora tape coffee my scissors and 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.150
 flowers and I will be doing my 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.990
 combinations as I like the gift 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.910
 of illia 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.050
 remember that you have to work for 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.050
 young twigs 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.069
 We remove the excess and with my flower 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.200
 tape that I chose coffee because I'm going to 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.980
 ride on my heart nothing more 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.750
 roll this you have to go stretching 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.110
 so that it hits well here we already have 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.180
 several preparations that to mount on 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.210
 our heart and now if you have to give it 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.750
 flight to the imagination 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.750
 Y 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.099
 we're going to stick and we will entangle 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.730
 and here we are going to put a little 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.380
 ribbon to cover the leagues 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.959
 we have this bar there we are going to put 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.569
 nothing else so linked and nothing else 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.430
 we end up at the bottom right 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.680
 let's start with our jar 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.599
 recycled as we remove the label 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.269
 that they think is sticky then 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.950
 we're even going to have to use 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.450
 glue but if it were not the case then 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.550
 you have to hit it with a little bit of 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.170
 silicon and the only thing we're going to do is 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.480
 with it the leaves 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.730
 roll the bottle a little and you will see 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.850
 ok father then we have the vase that 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.069
 we put a bar and we have the bucket 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.989
 that is the only thing we are going to do is with 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.069
 the bouquets that we already had prepared 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.069
 let's incorporate 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.110
 and this we will put it 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.950
 precisely the one that I was talking to you 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.950
 cat's fingernail 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.460
 and good as you will see today we have learned to 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.860
 make a decorated heart and why not 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.930
 also the table centers of volaris and 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.390
 hands were super cute and the most 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.130
 important is you can do it with the 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.620
 materials that you find flowers 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.240
 natural artificial flowers jokes 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.540

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.540
 imagination
