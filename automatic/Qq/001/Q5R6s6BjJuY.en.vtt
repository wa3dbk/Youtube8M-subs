00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.589 
because it was my Canadian nature now
it's<00:02:22.220> like<00:02:22.430> because<00:02:23.030> links<00:02:23.300> are<00:02:23.420> very

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599

it's like because links are very
important<00:02:24.170> in<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.290> United<00:02:24.560> States<00:02:24.740> like

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
elections and so way that you go for the

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.500 
elections and so way that you go for the
rock<00:02:27.500> guy<00:02:27.800> he<00:02:28.490> could<00:02:28.670> blow<00:02:28.849> up<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.180> fucking
