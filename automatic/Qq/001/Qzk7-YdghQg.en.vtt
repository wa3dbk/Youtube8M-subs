00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
that surprising or I was actually

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.540 
that surprising or I was actually
expecting<00:00:36.519> me<00:00:36.820> a<00:00:36.850> lot<00:00:37.000> more<00:00:37.030> grabby<00:00:37.420> and<00:00:38.550> this

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
roughly 750 - the wheels

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.360 
roughly 750 - the wheels
that's<00:00:45.120> hard<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.539> believe<00:00:45.980> yeah<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.159> really

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
that's hard to believe yeah it's really

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.340 
that's hard to believe yeah it's really
really<00:00:47.640> drivable<00:00:48.089> I'm<00:00:48.870> not<00:00:48.989> gonna<00:00:49.109> record

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
really drivable I'm not gonna record

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.229 
really drivable I'm not gonna record
this<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:49.739> you're<00:00:49.890> gonna<00:00:49.980> have<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.489> push<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
this but you're gonna have to push the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.270 
this but you're gonna have to push the
pedal<00:00:51.510> all<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.719> way<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.019> the<00:00:52.170> floor<00:00:52.409> because

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
pedal all the way to the floor because

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.090 
pedal all the way to the floor because
we're<00:00:53.729> gonna<00:00:53.820> make<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.239> disk<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:55.710> disk<00:00:55.739> has

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
we're gonna make the disk the disk has

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.799 
we're gonna make the disk the disk has
to<00:00:56.219> be<00:00:56.370> about<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:57.739> hair<00:00:58.739> thinner<00:00:59.510> so<00:01:00.510> basically

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
to be about it hair thinner so basically

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.179 
to be about it hair thinner so basically
what<00:01:01.019> happened<00:01:01.379> there<00:01:01.500> why<00:01:01.649> wasn't<00:01:01.949> going<00:01:02.100> to

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:02.189 
what happened there why wasn't going to

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:03.529 
what happened there why wasn't going to
third<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.549> because<00:01:02.729> your<00:01:02.939> pedal<00:01:03.210> wasn't<00:01:03.479> on

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
third is because your pedal wasn't on

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.389 
third is because your pedal wasn't on
the<00:01:03.629> floor<00:01:03.780> because<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.530> not<00:01:04.739> releasing<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
the floor because it's not releasing the

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.940 
the floor because it's not releasing the
clutch<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.909> at<00:01:06.119> all<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> way<00:01:06.630> well<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.860> this

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.550 

so<00:01:45.770> how's<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.100> shifting<00:01:46.550> you<00:01:47.060> know<00:01:47.180> just

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.830 

gear<00:01:50.070> changes<00:01:50.580> as<00:01:50.790> well<00:01:51.030> as<00:01:51.060> startup<00:01:51.630> going

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
gear changes as well as startup going

factoring<00:01:54.240> ish<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.630> mean<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.110> very<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.620> very

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
factoring ish I mean it's very it's very

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.160 
factoring ish I mean it's very it's very
much<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> factory<00:01:57.030> car<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.510> mean<00:01:58.080> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
much so like a factory car I mean the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.980 
much so like a factory car I mean the
clutch<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.530> really<00:01:58.910> engages<00:01:59.990> disengages

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
clutch it really engages disengages

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.770 
clutch it really engages disengages
really<00:02:01.229> well<00:02:01.880> its<00:02:02.880> rides<00:02:03.150> really<00:02:03.390> easy<00:02:03.600> it

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
really well its rides really easy it

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.570 
really well its rides really easy it
slips<00:02:04.140> well<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.650> mean<00:02:04.770> it's<00:02:05.010> just<00:02:05.100> one<00:02:05.340> singular

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
slips well I mean it's just one singular

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.139 
slips well I mean it's just one singular
veggie<00:02:05.850> let's<00:02:06.479> do<00:02:06.660> this<00:02:07.160> once<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.310> stop<00:02:08.640> here

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
veggie let's do this once you stop here

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.449 
veggie let's do this once you stop here
and<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.320> slowly<00:02:10.679> engage<00:02:11.100> it<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.340> people

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
and then just slowly engage it so people

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.280 
and then just slowly engage it so people
can<00:02:11.640> see<00:02:11.940> how<00:02:12.090> slow<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.450> can<00:02:12.750> engage<00:02:13.020> this

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
can see how slow you can engage this

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.470 
can see how slow you can engage this
clutch<00:02:13.620> you<00:02:14.160> just<00:02:14.340> start<00:02:14.520> moving<00:02:15.000> really

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
clutch you just start moving really

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.360 
clutch you just start moving really
slowly<00:02:15.959> because<00:02:16.350> it's<00:02:16.860> come<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.100> complete

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
slowly because it's come to a complete

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.280 
slowly because it's come to a complete
stop<00:02:17.610> because<00:02:18.570> I<00:02:18.630> want<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.780> see<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.020> just<00:02:19.080> say

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
stop because I want to see that just say

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.380 
stop because I want to see that just say
any<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:20.070> mean<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.700> can<00:02:20.850> drive<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.090> clutch

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
any I mean you can drive a clutch

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.330 
any I mean you can drive a clutch
obviously<00:02:21.810> but<00:02:22.050> just<00:02:22.680> move<00:02:22.830> as<00:02:22.980> slow<00:02:23.160> as<00:02:23.280> you

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
obviously but just move as slow as you

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.180 
obviously but just move as slow as you
can<00:02:23.580> see<00:02:23.730> there's<00:02:23.910> no<00:02:24.150> chatter<00:02:24.570> at<00:02:24.930> all<00:02:25.200> you

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
can see there's no chatter at all you

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.580 
can see there's no chatter at all you
could<00:02:26.340> probably<00:02:26.520> slip<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.180> forever<00:02:27.840> and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
could probably slip it forever and

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.320 
could probably slip it forever and
there's<00:02:28.739> gonna<00:02:28.860> be<00:02:28.950> no<00:02:29.220> engagement<00:02:30.120> chatter

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
there's gonna be no engagement chatter

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.030 
there's gonna be no engagement chatter
to<00:02:30.600> try<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.810> go<00:02:30.959> even<00:02:31.260> slower<00:02:31.350> than<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.650> see

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
to try to go even slower than that see

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.040 
to try to go even slower than that see
if<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.160> can<00:02:32.280> go<00:02:32.430> slower<00:02:32.670> than<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:32.900> come<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.020> a

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
if you can go slower than that come to a

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.340 
if you can go slower than that come to a
