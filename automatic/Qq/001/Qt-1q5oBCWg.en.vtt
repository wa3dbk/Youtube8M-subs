then this should pop up and it should

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.020 
then this should pop up and it should
spring<00:01:40.680> up<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.040> bunch<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.369> stuff<00:01:41.579> we're<00:01:41.880> going

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
spring up a bunch of stuff we're going

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.230 
spring up a bunch of stuff we're going
to<00:01:42.090> use<00:01:42.270> copy<00:01:42.570> trans<00:01:43.070> manager<00:01:44.070> which<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.520> free

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:29.669 
thirty-six point nine eight so I guess

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:32.300 
thirty-six point nine eight so I guess
it<00:07:29.820> rounds<00:07:30.120> up<00:07:30.210> a<00:07:30.330> little<00:07:30.509> bit<00:07:30.720> I<00:07:31.469> do<00:07:31.680> have<00:07:32.099> the

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:32.310 
it rounds up a little bit I do have the

64<00:07:33.180> gigabyte<00:07:33.630> iPhone<00:07:34.020> 6<00:07:34.440> so<00:07:35.099> I<00:07:35.130> guess<00:07:35.669> I<00:07:35.759> only

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:35.909 
64 gigabyte iPhone 6 so I guess I only

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:39.379 
64 gigabyte iPhone 6 so I guess I only
get<00:07:36.120> a<00:07:36.150> total<00:07:36.449> of<00:07:36.539> 56<00:07:37.110> so<00:07:37.380> a<00:07:37.409> gigs<00:07:37.919> towards<00:07:38.490> iOS

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:39.389
