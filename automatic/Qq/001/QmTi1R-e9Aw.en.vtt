the weight on this is 8.6 ounces to 45

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.250 
the weight on this is 8.6 ounces to 45
grams<00:00:48.969> so<00:00:49.210> it's<00:00:49.359> not<00:00:49.480> a<00:00:49.539> lightweight<00:00:49.809> knifes

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
grams so it's not a lightweight knifes

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.680 
grams so it's not a lightweight knifes
got<00:00:50.559> a<00:00:50.589> little<00:00:50.800> heft<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.100> it<00:00:51.219> the<00:00:51.910> blade<00:00:52.359> length

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
got a little heft to it the blade length

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.590 
got a little heft to it the blade length
is<00:00:52.929> ten<00:00:53.230> point<00:00:53.559> two<00:00:53.859> inches<00:00:54.309> or<00:00:54.460> 260<00:00:54.940> so<00:00:55.449> this

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
is ten point two inches or 260 so this

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.989

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
knife feel a little bit lighter than it

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.410

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
belly towards the tip the nice thing

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.600 
belly towards the tip the nice thing
about<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.470> 10-inch<00:02:05.830> version<00:02:06.250> it's<00:02:06.400> long

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
about the 10-inch version it's long

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.729 
about the 10-inch version it's long
enough<00:02:06.640> where<00:02:07.090> you've<00:02:07.210> got<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.450> decent<00:02:07.750> flat

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
enough where you've got a decent flat

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.830 
enough where you've got a decent flat
spot<00:02:09.069> for<00:02:09.369> some<00:02:09.519> versatility<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.450> then

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
spot for some versatility and then

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.400 
spot for some versatility and then
you've<00:02:10.989> still<00:02:11.230> got<00:02:11.379> a<00:02:11.410> pretty<00:02:12.130> nice<00:02:13.380> curve<00:02:14.380> to

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
you've still got a pretty nice curve to

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.440 
you've still got a pretty nice curve to
it<00:02:14.710> our<00:02:14.980> belly<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.700> it's<00:02:15.910> not<00:02:16.060> quite<00:02:16.330> as

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
it our belly to it it's not quite as

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.390 
it our belly to it it's not quite as
pronounced<00:02:16.750> as<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.020> aid<00:02:17.140> in

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
pronounced as to aid in

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.979 
pronounced as to aid in
and<00:02:17.519> definitely<00:02:17.670> not<00:02:17.970> as<00:02:18.060> much<00:02:18.090> as<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> 6-inch

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
and definitely not as much as the 6-inch

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.720 
and definitely not as much as the 6-inch
so<00:02:19.590> in<00:02:19.709> my<00:02:19.829> opinion<00:02:20.159> this<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.310> probably<00:02:20.430> the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
so in my opinion this is probably the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.539 
so in my opinion this is probably the
most<00:02:20.849> versatile<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.599> three<00:02:21.870> lengths<00:02:22.549> it

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
most versatile of the three lengths it

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.220 
most versatile of the three lengths it
still<00:02:23.879> got<00:02:24.030> plenty<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.329> belly<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.750> rock<00:02:24.959> but

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
still got plenty of belly to rock but

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.229 
still got plenty of belly to rock but
you<00:02:25.349> won't<00:02:25.530> have<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.739> lift<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.129> heel<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.209> the

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
you won't have to lift the heel of the

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.179 
you won't have to lift the heel of the
knife<00:02:27.420> or<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.900> knife<00:02:28.110> handles<00:02:28.560> quite<00:02:28.829> so<00:02:29.010> high

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
knife or the knife handles quite so high

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.670 
knife or the knife handles quite so high
when<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.549> rock<00:02:29.760> as<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.540> would<00:02:30.750> on<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> shorter

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
when you rock as you would on a shorter

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.050 
when you rock as you would on a shorter
blade<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.840> edge<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.549> pretty<00:02:35.760> thin

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
blade the edge of this is pretty thin

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.399 
blade the edge of this is pretty thin
these<00:02:36.209> are<00:02:36.329> all<00:02:36.450> quite<00:02:36.689> thin<00:02:36.900> behind<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.290> edge

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
these are all quite thin behind the edge

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.670 
these are all quite thin behind the edge
so<00:02:37.950> these<00:02:38.099> are<00:02:38.280> not<00:02:38.989> anemic<00:02:39.989> performers<00:02:40.560> they

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
so these are not anemic performers they

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.099 
so these are not anemic performers they
perform<00:02:41.040> quite<00:02:41.280> well<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:42.659> is<00:02:42.840> just<00:02:43.019> a

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
perform quite well and this is just a

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.479 
perform quite well and this is just a
nice<00:02:43.290> fit<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.709> finish<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.189> it

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
nice fit and finish to it

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.729 
nice fit and finish to it
nice<00:02:45.090> convex<00:02:45.629> thing<00:02:45.810> on<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.079> blade<00:02:46.290> down

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
nice convex thing on the blade down

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.399 
nice convex thing on the blade down
towards<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.250> edge<00:02:47.909> it's<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.780> good<00:02:48.930> performing

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
towards the edge it's a good performing

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.890 
towards the edge it's a good performing
knife<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.760> it's<00:02:50.970> all<00:02:51.090> stainless<00:02:51.389> low

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
knife and so it's all stainless low

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.490 
knife and so it's all stainless low
maintenance<00:02:52.159> nice<00:02:53.450> crisp<00:02:54.450> bevel<00:02:55.079> out<00:02:55.319> of<00:02:55.440> the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
maintenance nice crisp bevel out of the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.960 
maintenance nice crisp bevel out of the
box<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:55.889> it's<00:02:55.920> pretty<00:02:56.280> sharp<00:02:56.549> it<00:02:56.730> could<00:02:56.819> use<00:02:56.940> a

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
box so it's pretty sharp it could use a

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.339 
box so it's pretty sharp it could use a
little<00:02:57.150> tooth<00:02:57.480> but<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.720> talked<00:02:57.930> about<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:58.290> in

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
little tooth but I talked about that in

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.940 
little tooth but I talked about that in
the<00:02:58.530> overview<00:02:58.829> video<00:02:59.040> as<00:02:59.430> well<00:02:59.670> so<00:03:00.709> this<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.769> a

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
the overview video as well so this is a

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.830 
the overview video as well so this is a
pretty<00:03:02.489> impressive<00:03:02.730> chef's<00:03:03.150> knife<00:03:03.359> this<00:03:03.659> is
