00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
leaves that have been here for a couple

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.950 
leaves that have been here for a couple
years<00:00:51.010> and<00:00:51.639> some<00:00:52.539> of<00:00:52.569> them<00:00:52.719> have<00:00:52.809> already

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
years and some of them have already

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.840 
years and some of them have already
completely<00:00:53.559> decomposed<00:00:53.889> a<00:00:54.309> lot<00:00:54.489> of<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:54.639> fresh

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
completely decomposed a lot of the fresh

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.279 
completely decomposed a lot of the fresh
ones<00:00:55.059> are<00:00:55.179> from<00:00:55.329> this<00:00:55.420> year<00:00:55.629> of<00:00:55.719> course<00:00:55.749> but

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
ones are from this year of course but

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.840 
ones are from this year of course but
this<00:00:57.219> is<00:00:57.429> how<00:00:57.609> I<00:00:57.639> make<00:00:57.940> soil<00:00:58.589> just<00:00:59.589> have<00:01:00.280> a<00:01:00.549> ton

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
this is how I make soil just have a ton

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.460 
this is how I make soil just have a ton
of<00:01:01.319> of<00:01:02.319> leaves<00:01:02.649> to<00:01:02.920> clean<00:01:03.280> up<00:01:03.609> and<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:05.290> about

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
of of leaves to clean up and it's about

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.320 
of of leaves to clean up and it's about
time<00:01:05.770> I<00:01:05.799> did<00:01:06.070> this<00:01:06.250> I<00:01:06.549> think<00:01:06.820> I've<00:01:06.940> never<00:01:07.090> done

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
time I did this I think I've never done

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.930 
time I did this I think I've never done
this<00:01:07.450> three<00:01:07.690> years<00:01:07.870> ago<00:01:08.020> but<00:01:08.350> anyhow<00:01:09.040> making

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
this three years ago but anyhow making

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.029 
this three years ago but anyhow making
soil<00:01:10.210> making<00:01:10.630> compost<00:01:11.170> let's<00:01:11.530> go<00:01:11.649> put<00:01:11.829> some

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
soil making compost let's go put some

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:42.760 
soil making compost let's go put some
out<00:01:12.250> in<00:01:12.899> the<00:01:13.899> compost<00:01:14.320> pile

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.660 

so<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:43.979> see<00:01:44.159> got<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.729> lot<00:01:44.940> of<00:01:45.320> lot<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.350> dirt

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
so you can see got a lot of lot of dirt

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.080 
so you can see got a lot of lot of dirt
already<00:01:47.670> mixed<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.120> nice<00:01:48.360> topsoil<00:01:49.460> worms<00:01:50.460> and
