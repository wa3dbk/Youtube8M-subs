 this is not seen every day comrades 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:21.189
 We are where we are on the banks 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.279
 of the tlapan river echo at the height of 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.710
 colonia san diego watching how the 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.300
 River 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.009
 the panic is worth the redundancy 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.290
 We are in the foothills of the hill 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:39.030

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.170
 September 2013 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.170

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.800
 when something is more planned as works 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.870
 bad when they come together 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.559
 problems with the relationship 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.559
 and badly planned 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.190

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.530
 they had put blue again in the background 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.520
 we can see in the background we can see 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.679
 already that roof that is there already fell 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.350
 there was the machinery of a bridge 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:19.790
 that were recently building 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:23.510
 that connected the san diego colony with 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.490
 the area of technological advancement going 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.530

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.530

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.920

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.910
 Water 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.910

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.170
 recording
