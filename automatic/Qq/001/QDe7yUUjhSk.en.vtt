00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.000
 not 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.560
 hello my name is olivier I am 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.120
 football sports educator 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.980
 today I will teach you to 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.550
 well warm up a simple way for 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.020
 warm up 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.120
 it's starting with the lower body 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.820
 went back up forgetting no string 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.630
 muscle after having heated up all 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.950
 muscle chains 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.300
 we must not forget the 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.740
 joints I'm going to show you 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.810
 a few simple things to remember 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.060
 we'll start with warming up 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.910
 calves on a work on the tip 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.590
 feet on this move we're going 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.329
 exclusively worked on the tip 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.789
 feet for power is heated well 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.039
 the calf all the part of the calf ok 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:48.149
 so like that we can do it on 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.739
 place for about one to two minutes 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.440
 so here we come and heat the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.699
 calf we will go to the quadriceps for 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.780
 quadriceps warm-up 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.670
 we will do knee climbs 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.190
 up to so much basins 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.210
 rather dynamic like this is in 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.769
 lax we are going to move now to 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.500
 the hamstring hamstring which is the muscle 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.110
 quadriceps antagonists on a series 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.220
 buttocks as on the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.600
 knee climbs 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.759
 it will be a heel buttocks so 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.180
 dynamic and in lax by staying well 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.070
 right shoulders straight and head 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.090
 that they look at the horizon so there 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.310
 now we will go to 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.540
 adductors that are necessary for 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.100
 all that is change of focus 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.930
 and changes of direction on the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.850
 field for adductors we're going 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.890
 to go on not hunted enough 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.259
 dynamic without the feet touching each other 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.600
 by changing making right side and side 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.009
 left regarding bottom warming 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.939
 of the body all the movements that I 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.740
 have just shown you may have been 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.750
 first done at a standstill then 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.640
 movement with a frequency and a 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.049
 intensity that will go crescendo 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.549
 so now let's move on to 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.930
 warming up the upper body and I 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.790
 will show you some useful gestures 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.960
 and simple to achieve for started 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.969
 warming up the upper body we 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.680
 let's start with the pool on a 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.509
 dynamic warm-up with 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.810
 movements from right to left in varying 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.810
 meaning 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.160
 on this movement it is important to 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.960
 well to realize a step of tango of right 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.640
 left in both directions for good 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.960
 heated the pelvis appears only on the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.790
 lower body now we go back 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.590
 we are warming up the upper body to 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:24.010
 know the scapular belt with the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:26.560
 shoulders and then the cervical and 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.010
 all this can be done by hopping 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.860
 forward and backward 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.390
 the little trick on warming up but 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.830
 to warm up in the sense of the game for 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.930
 take the landmarks before a 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.160
 match it will not forget the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.470
 joints namely the ankles a 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.830
 little bit of the wrist because we can 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.090
 fall on the ground and of course the 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.430
 blow as one is heated all to 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.110
 the time it will be essential to 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.760
 warm up before each game each 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.800
 training to avoid any 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.670
 injury and that the body is ready for 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.370
 efforts he will endure 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.590
 it will be indispensable at the end of each 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.760
 warm up to stretch well and shoot 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.959
 all the muscle chains that we 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.239
 worked the quadriceps like these 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.120
 staying right the two youngsters glued 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.550
 head on the horizon go down like this 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.560
 to shoot behind the entire chain of 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.970
 the hamstring hamstring and on a movement 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.700
 like those coming from 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.100
 behind sticking the heel for the 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.930
 calf concerning adductors he in 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.300
 there are several that I advocate 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.760
 will be to spread the legs back in 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.980
 toes and to shift the hip 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.459
 which allows stretching of the adductors 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.840
 right and left you know 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.610
 now how to warm up well 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.080
 find me in an upcoming video 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.080
 I will teach you how to dribble
