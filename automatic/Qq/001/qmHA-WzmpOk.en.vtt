00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
one 280 full run-through and with the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.959 
one 280 full run-through and with the
whole<00:00:35.850> character<00:00:36.450> i<00:00:36.989> never<00:00:37.890> played<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.640> horde

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
whole character i never played a horde

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.209 
whole character i never played a horde
over<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.989> level<00:00:40.590> 20<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:42.469> it's<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.100> be

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
over to level 20 so it's going to be

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.350 
over to level 20 so it's going to be
mostly<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.420> blind<00:00:46.100> blind<00:00:47.100> running<00:00:47.579> after<00:00:47.940> that

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
mostly a blind blind running after that

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.069 
mostly a blind blind running after that
so<00:00:49.350> i<00:00:49.640> guess<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:51.030> gonna<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.539> fairly

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
so i guess this is gonna be fairly

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.110 
so i guess this is gonna be fairly
