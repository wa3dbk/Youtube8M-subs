an important skill for all RC aircraft

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.680 
an important skill for all RC aircraft
fliers<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.690> learn<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.469> how<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.309> maintain

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
fliers to learn is how to maintain

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.660 
fliers to learn is how to maintain
orientation<00:00:15.690> on<00:00:15.839> your<00:00:16.020> aircraft<00:00:16.310> just<00:00:17.310> by<00:00:17.460> its

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
orientation on your aircraft just by its

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.420 
orientation on your aircraft just by its
movement<00:00:18.150> alone<00:00:18.529> if<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.680> hasn't<00:00:19.920> happened<00:00:20.220> to

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
movement alone if it hasn't happened to

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.300 
movement alone if it hasn't happened to
you<00:00:20.520> already<00:00:20.930> there<00:00:21.930> will<00:00:22.140> come<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.500> time<00:00:22.800> when

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
you already there will come a time when

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.700 
you already there will come a time when
you<00:00:23.430> either<00:00:23.939> accidentally<00:00:24.630> or<00:00:24.750> on<00:00:24.960> purpose

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
you either accidentally or on purpose

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.099 
you either accidentally or on purpose
fly<00:00:26.189> your<00:00:26.400> aircraft<00:00:26.880> too<00:00:27.060> far<00:00:27.330> away<00:00:27.449> where<00:00:27.990> you

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
fly your aircraft too far away where you

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.410 
fly your aircraft too far away where you
really<00:00:28.410> can't<00:00:28.650> tell<00:00:28.890> which<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.939> front<00:00:30.330> and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
really can't tell which is the front and

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.569 
really can't tell which is the front and
which<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.929> back<00:00:31.160> when<00:00:32.160> such<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> case

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
which is the back when such a case

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.139 
which is the back when such a case
occurs<00:00:33.860> beginners<00:00:34.860> will<00:00:35.130> tend<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.489> panic<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
occurs beginners will tend to panic and

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.080 
occurs beginners will tend to panic and
may<00:00:37.079> accidentally<00:00:37.860> fly<00:00:38.219> their<00:00:38.430> aircraft<00:00:38.460> out

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
may accidentally fly their aircraft out

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.229 
may accidentally fly their aircraft out
of<00:00:39.239> range<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.780> possibly<00:00:40.200> lose<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:41.000> so<00:00:42.000> how<00:00:42.180> can

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
of range and possibly lose it so how can

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.940 
of range and possibly lose it so how can
you<00:00:42.480> tell<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.840> difference<00:00:42.960> which<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
you tell the difference which is the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.410 
you tell the difference which is the
front<00:00:44.280> which<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.670> back<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.120> how<00:00:45.210> do<00:00:45.270> you

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
front which is the back and how do you

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.750 
front which is the back and how do you
safely<00:00:45.840> bring<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.140> back<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.680> well<00:00:47.579> it's

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
safely bring it back to you well it's

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.510 
safely bring it back to you well it's
very<00:00:47.940> simple<00:00:48.500> for<00:00:49.500> illustration<00:00:50.039> purposes

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
very simple for illustration purposes

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.430 
very simple for illustration purposes
I'm<00:00:50.670> going<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.879> use<00:00:50.969> my<00:00:51.149> v2<00:00:51.539> -<00:00:51.719> -<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.230> maybe

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
I'm going to use my v2 - - and maybe

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.420 
I'm going to use my v2 - - and maybe
maybe<00:00:53.070> -<00:00:53.370> 6<00:00:53.670> -<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> little<00:00:54.239> later<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:55.430> imagine

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
maybe - 6 - a little later but imagine

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.910 
maybe - 6 - a little later but imagine
this<00:00:56.550> being<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.449> quadcopter<00:00:57.719> at<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.590> point

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
this being the quadcopter at a point

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.200 
this being the quadcopter at a point
where<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.250> really<00:00:59.579> can't<00:00:59.820> tell<00:01:00.000> its

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
where you really can't tell its

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.490 
where you really can't tell its
orientation<00:01:00.719> anymore

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
orientation anymore

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.850 
orientation anymore
oh<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.859> flew<00:01:02.730> accidentally<00:01:03.420> too<00:01:03.570> far<00:01:03.840> away<00:01:04.110> so

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
oh you flew accidentally too far away so

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.520 
oh you flew accidentally too far away so
how<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.339> get<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.610> back<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.000> safely

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
how do you get it back to you safely

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.080 
how do you get it back to you safely
well<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:07.619> very<00:01:07.740> simple<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.250> give<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:08.970> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
well it's very simple you just give it a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.510 
well it's very simple you just give it a
little<00:01:09.240> bit<00:01:09.450> pitch<00:01:09.689> forward<00:01:10.500> pitch<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.369> get

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
little bit pitch forward pitch to get

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.820 
little bit pitch forward pitch to get
some<00:01:11.700> forward<00:01:12.060> movement<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:13.530> case

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
some forward movement in this case

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.460 
some forward movement in this case
you'll<00:01:14.100> notice<00:01:14.250> from<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.150> distance<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:16.170> dot

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
you'll notice from a distance that dot

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.200 
you'll notice from a distance that dot
in<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.710> sky<00:01:16.950> which<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.189> your<00:01:17.430> quadcopter<00:01:18.060> will

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
in the sky which is your quadcopter will

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.840 
in the sky which is your quadcopter will
be<00:01:18.360> moving<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.869> left<00:01:19.110> all<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.670> do

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
be moving to the left all you have to do

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.240 
be moving to the left all you have to do
when<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.390> moving<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.900> left<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.830> turn

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
when it's moving to the left is turn

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.850 
when it's moving to the left is turn
left<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.630> start<00:01:24.869> bringing<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.290> back<00:01:25.439> toward

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
left to start bringing it back toward

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.270 
left to start bringing it back toward
you

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
you

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.990 
you
the<00:01:26.939> same<00:01:27.150> goes<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:29.340> quadcopter<00:01:29.579> is

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the same goes if the quadcopter is

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.399 
the same goes if the quadcopter is
pointed<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> right<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.049> start<00:01:31.320> to

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
pointed to the right and you start to

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.080 
pointed to the right and you start to
give<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.619> some<00:01:31.799> floored<00:01:32.070> movement<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:33.060> should

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
give it some floored movement you should

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.999 
give it some floored movement you should
notice<00:01:33.689> some<00:01:33.900> right<00:01:34.140> movement<00:01:34.439> off<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
notice some right movement off in the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.520 
notice some right movement off in the
distance<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.420> case<00:01:36.659> all<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.409> to

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
distance so in this case all you have to

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.130 
distance so in this case all you have to
do<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.979> turn<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> right<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.900> start

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
do is turn to the right to start

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.830 
do is turn to the right to start
bringing<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.590> back<00:01:40.740> toward<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.570> so<00:01:42.570> again

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
bringing it back toward you so again

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.240 
bringing it back toward you so again
moving<00:01:43.770> left<00:01:44.220> turn<00:01:45.119> left<00:01:45.420> if<00:01:45.920> it's<00:01:46.920> moving

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
moving left turn left if it's moving

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.550 
moving left turn left if it's moving
right<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> distance<00:01:48.119> just<00:01:48.299> turn<00:01:49.290> right

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
right in the distance just turn right

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.730 
right in the distance just turn right
very<00:01:50.369> simple<00:01:50.850> okay<00:01:51.630> I'm<00:01:51.930> going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.079> do<00:01:52.560> some

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
very simple okay I'm going to do some

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.959 
very simple okay I'm going to do some
demonstration<00:01:53.430> flights<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.880> show<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:55.969> okay

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
demonstration flights to show this okay

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.109 
demonstration flights to show this okay
let's<00:01:57.180> do<00:01:58.140> some<00:01:58.200> flights<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.829> my<00:01:59.009> v2<00:01:59.310> -<00:01:59.460> -<00:01:59.700> what

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
let's do some flights of my v2 - - what

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.039 
I'm going to do is I'm going to send it
off<00:02:02.310> into<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> distance<00:02:02.790> where<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.869> just

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
off into the distance where I can just

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.990 
off into the distance where I can just
barely<00:02:04.290> see<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.710> where<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.159> think<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.820> barely

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
barely see it where I think I can barely

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.580 
barely see it where I think I can barely
see<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.329> with<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> camera<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.020> then

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
see it with the camera and then

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.260 
see it with the camera and then
demonstrate<00:02:07.829> moving<00:02:08.429> left<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.940> then<00:02:09.060> turning

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
demonstrate moving left and then turning

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.760 
demonstrate moving left and then turning
left<00:02:09.390> we're<00:02:09.840> moving<00:02:10.200> right<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.410> turning

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
left we're moving right and turning

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:24.880 
left we're moving right and turning
right

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.480 

okay<00:02:26.990> now<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.050> can<00:02:28.230> see<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.830> here<00:02:29.160> but<00:02:29.340> the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
okay now I can see this here but the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.920 
okay now I can see this here but the
camera<00:02:29.850> is<00:02:29.910> probably<00:02:30.090> having<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> hard<00:02:30.900> time

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
camera is probably having a hard time

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.440 
camera is probably having a hard time
seeing<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:32.250> right<00:02:32.760> now<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:32.910> don't<00:02:33.090> know<00:02:33.270> what

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
seeing it so right now I don't know what

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.510 
seeing it so right now I don't know what
is<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.720> orientation<00:02:33.900> my<00:02:34.410> quadcopter<00:02:35.070> so<00:02:35.400> how

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
is the orientation my quadcopter so how

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.160 
is the orientation my quadcopter so how
do<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.700> bring<00:02:35.880> it<00:02:35.970> back<00:02:36.030> well<00:02:36.870> I'll<00:02:36.930> give<00:02:37.080> it

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
do I bring it back well I'll give it

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.670 
do I bring it back well I'll give it
some<00:02:37.200> forward<00:02:37.709> pitch<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:40.230> notice<00:02:40.560> some

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
some forward pitch and I notice some

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.250 
some forward pitch and I notice some
slight<00:02:40.830> movement<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.820> left<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.750> all<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:43.020> got

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
slight movement to the left so all I got

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.680 
slight movement to the left so all I got
to<00:02:43.380> do<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.830> turn<00:02:44.580> left<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:46.800> keep<00:02:47.250> turning<00:02:47.459> left

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
to do is turn left and keep turning left

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.479 
to do is turn left and keep turning left
until<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.810> movement<00:02:49.020> more<00:02:49.530> or<00:02:49.620> less<00:02:49.770> stops<00:02:50.100> or

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
until the movement more or less stops or

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.280 
until the movement more or less stops or
it<00:02:50.730> starts<00:02:51.060> turning<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.480> opposite<00:02:52.170> direction

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.350 
it starts turning the opposite direction
I'm<00:02:52.830> still<00:02:53.280> turning<00:02:53.520> left<00:02:53.790> still<00:02:54.060> turning

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.530 
said before it will let you fly greater
distances<00:04:16.989> than<00:04:17.049> you<00:04:17.320> normally<00:04:17.470> would

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
distances than you normally would

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.900 
distances than you normally would
okay<00:04:19.540> let's<00:04:19.690> set<00:04:19.900> it<00:04:20.019> out<00:04:20.109> again<00:04:20.910> scrambling

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
okay let's set it out again scrambling

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.480 
okay let's set it out again scrambling
it<00:04:22.060> give<00:04:23.050> it<00:04:23.169> some<00:04:23.320> poor<00:04:23.590> pitch<00:04:23.890> which<00:04:24.250> way<00:04:24.430> is

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
it give it some poor pitch which way is

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.430 
it give it some poor pitch which way is
it<00:04:24.580> moving<00:04:24.850> it's<00:04:25.060> moving<00:04:25.150> to<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:25.570> right<00:04:25.660> so<00:04:26.410> I

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
it moving it's moving to the right so I

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.440 
it moving it's moving to the right so I
turn<00:04:26.740> right<00:04:27.010> keep<00:04:27.760> turning<00:04:28.090> right<00:04:28.210> keep

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
turn right keep turning right keep

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.820 
turn right keep turning right keep
turning<00:04:28.750> right<00:04:28.840> now<00:04:29.080> it's<00:04:29.260> starting<00:04:29.560> to<00:04:29.620> move

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
turning right now it's starting to move

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.980 
turning right now it's starting to move
to<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.100> left<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:31.210> here<00:04:31.540> it<00:04:31.630> comes<00:04:31.660> back

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
to the left and here it comes back

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.020 
to the left and here it comes back
toward<00:04:32.350> me<00:04:35.280> let's<00:04:36.280> do<00:04:36.490> that<00:04:36.669> again

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
toward me let's do that again

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.650 
toward me let's do that again
I<00:04:37.240> just<00:04:37.930> keep<00:04:38.080> demonstrating<00:04:38.740> it<00:04:39.479> let's<00:04:40.479> see

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
I just keep demonstrating it let's see

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.880 
I just keep demonstrating it let's see
I'm<00:04:40.750> going<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:40.900> move<00:04:41.020> it<00:04:41.140> off<00:04:41.290> in<00:04:41.560> this

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
I'm going to move it off in this

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:48.659 
I'm going to move it off in this
direction<00:04:47.220> turning<00:04:48.220> turning<00:04:48.520> turning

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
direction turning turning turning

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.330 
direction turning turning turning
turning<00:04:49.030> just<00:04:49.740> okay<00:04:50.740> now<00:04:50.890> let's<00:04:51.040> give<00:04:51.190> it<00:04:51.220> some

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
turning just okay now let's give it some

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.000 
turning just okay now let's give it some
forward<00:04:51.940> pitch<00:04:52.410> it's<00:04:53.410> moving<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:53.919> right

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
forward pitch it's moving to the right

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.360 
forward pitch it's moving to the right
so<00:04:54.400> I<00:04:54.430> turn<00:04:54.729> right<00:04:55.620> keep<00:04:56.620> turning<00:04:56.979> right<00:04:57.100> until

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
so I turn right keep turning right until

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.990 
so I turn right keep turning right until
it<00:04:57.460> stops

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
it stops

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.710 
it stops
and<00:04:58.450> here<00:04:58.660> comes<00:04:58.870> back<00:04:59.110> toward<00:04:59.440> me<00:05:03.150> and<00:05:04.150> one

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
and here comes back toward me and one

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.090 
and here comes back toward me and one
more<00:05:04.900> time<00:05:05.110> I'm<00:05:05.290> going<00:05:05.380> to<00:05:05.500> demonstrate<00:05:05.650> with

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
more time I'm going to demonstrate with

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.830 
more time I'm going to demonstrate with
a<00:05:06.130> v-22<00:05:06.700> and<00:05:07.150> then<00:05:07.390> I'm<00:05:07.479> going<00:05:07.570> to<00:05:07.660> switch<00:05:07.810> to

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
a v-22 and then I'm going to switch to

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:15.600 
a v-22 and then I'm going to switch to
the<00:05:08.080> beat<00:05:08.229> -<00:05:09.040> six<00:05:09.340> -<00:05:14.010> okay<00:05:15.010> it's<00:05:15.160> in<00:05:15.280> the<00:05:15.340> sky<00:05:15.580> I

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
the beat - six - okay it's in the sky I

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.360 
the beat - six - okay it's in the sky I
don't<00:05:15.790> know<00:05:16.060> which<00:05:16.210> way<00:05:16.419> it's<00:05:16.570> pointed

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
don't know which way it's pointed

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.430 
don't know which way it's pointed
forward<00:05:18.370> pitch<00:05:18.640> it's<00:05:19.300> turning<00:05:19.660> right<00:05:19.840> so<00:05:20.320> I'm

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
forward pitch it's turning right so I'm

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.680 
forward pitch it's turning right so I'm
learning<00:05:20.710> to<00:05:20.860> turn<00:05:21.010> right<00:05:21.310> turn<00:05:22.180> right<00:05:22.240> turn

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
learning to turn right turn right turn

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.130 
learning to turn right turn right turn
right<00:05:22.750> and<00:05:23.110> here<00:05:23.410> comes<00:05:23.680> back<00:05:23.890> toward<00:05:24.220> me

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.240 

okay<00:05:29.140> let's<00:05:29.320> try<00:05:29.470> that<00:05:29.680> with<00:05:29.830> the<00:05:30.000> v26<00:05:31.000> too
