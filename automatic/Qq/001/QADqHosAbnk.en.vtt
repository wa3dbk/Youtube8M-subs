another<00:00:03.300> video<00:00:03.540> I<00:00:03.720> get<00:00:03.959> on<00:00:04.110> how<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.350> take<00:00:04.560> out

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
another video I get on how to take out

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.460 
another video I get on how to take out
this<00:00:04.950> cylinder<00:00:05.400> lock<00:00:05.609> and<00:00:05.970> I<00:00:06.629> still<00:00:07.350> had<00:00:07.440> a

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
this cylinder lock and I still had a

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.259 
this cylinder lock and I still had a
problem<00:00:07.770> with<00:00:08.010> it<00:00:08.130> but<00:00:08.490> it<00:00:08.610> turned<00:00:08.790> out<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.000> be

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
problem with it but it turned out to be

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.450 
problem with it but it turned out to be
not<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.660> tumblers<00:00:10.139> inside<00:00:10.679> because<00:00:11.070> actually

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
not the tumblers inside because actually

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.330 
not the tumblers inside because actually
few<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.820> those<00:00:11.880> were<00:00:12.059> taken<00:00:12.300> out<00:00:12.630> or<00:00:12.870> sticking

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340 
few of those were taken out or sticking

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.170 
few of those were taken out or sticking
turned<00:00:14.340> out<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.730> be<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.480> pin<00:00:15.990> right<00:00:16.230> here<00:00:17.190> see

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
turned out to be this pin right here see

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.470 
turned out to be this pin right here see
that<00:00:18.359> pin<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.949> rides<00:00:19.949> on<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.789> date<00:00:21.000> aunts

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
that pin that rides on the date aunts

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.290 
that pin that rides on the date aunts
and<00:00:21.689> when<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:21.960> turn<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.760> turns<00:00:23.760> easy<00:00:24.000> now

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
and when you turn this turns easy now

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.759 
and when you turn this turns easy now
but<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.289> can<00:00:25.380> see<00:00:25.560> what<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.740> did<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.310> here<00:00:27.769> see

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
but you can see what I did in here see

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.250 
but you can see what I did in here see
if<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.890> can<00:00:29.010> clear<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.400> up<00:00:29.960> yeah<00:00:30.960> right<00:00:33.260> right

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
if I can clear that up yeah right right

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.610 
if I can clear that up yeah right right
in<00:00:34.440> there<00:00:34.710> where<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.219> pin<00:00:35.640> sits<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.180> there

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
in there where that pin sits in there

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.770 
in there where that pin sits in there
actually<00:00:37.620> took<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.890> dremel<00:00:38.280> tool<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.790> I

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
actually took the dremel tool and I

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.920 
actually took the dremel tool and I
ground<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.559> out<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:41.010> ground<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.579> out<00:00:41.760> I'll<00:00:42.510> open

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
ground it out I ground it out I'll open

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.850 
ground it out I ground it out I'll open
up<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.110> lock<00:00:43.410> all<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.489> way<00:00:48.140> there<00:00:49.170> hopefully

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
up the lock all the way there hopefully

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.770 
up the lock all the way there hopefully
that<00:00:49.950> bigger<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.340> clear<00:00:50.579> as<00:00:50.670> mud<00:00:50.910> but<00:00:51.210> open

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
that bigger this clear as mud but open

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.299 
that bigger this clear as mud but open
up<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.930> lock<00:00:52.260> all<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.710> way<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:55.190> went<00:00:56.190> in

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
up the lock all the way so I went in

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.459 
up the lock all the way so I went in
here<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:57.840> an<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.140> an<00:00:58.260> off

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
here and it's it's like an it's an off

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.380 
here and it's it's like an it's an off
position<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:59.039> sits<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.430> there<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.820> actually

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
position it sits in there I actually

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.389 
position it sits in there I actually
took<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> Dremel<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.710> ground<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.219> there<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
took the Dremel and I ground in there a

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.620 
took the Dremel and I ground in there a
little<00:01:02.640> bit<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:03.570> touching<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.619> lo<00:01:04.830> seed

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.840 

because<00:01:09.630> what<00:01:09.810> was<00:01:09.960> going<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.520> it's<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.700> this

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
because what was going on it's like this

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.730 
because what was going on it's like this
pin<00:01:12.770> that<00:01:13.770> pin<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.090> little<00:01:15.479> bit<00:01:15.630> worn<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
pin that pin is a little bit worn it's a

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.280 
pin that pin is a little bit worn it's a
little<00:01:17.009> bit<00:01:17.210> so<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.540> when<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.840> worn<00:01:19.080> it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
little bit so like when it's worn it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.719 
little bit so like when it's worn it
might<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> little<00:01:19.680> bit<00:01:19.890> crooked<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.520> way

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
might be a little bit crooked this way

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.200 
might be a little bit crooked this way
or<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.090> way<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:22.310> it<00:01:23.310> kind<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.759> gets<00:01:23.939> jammed

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
or that way and it kind of gets jammed

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.810 
or that way and it kind of gets jammed
up<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.780> made<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.560> doesn't<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.070> go

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
up so I made it so it doesn't have to go

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.480 
up so I made it so it doesn't have to go
over<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.330> big<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> bump<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.920> get<00:01:29.100> out<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
over as big a bump to get out of the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.390 
over as big a bump to get out of the
runt<00:01:29.729> position<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.829> if<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.979> got<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> lock

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
runt position and if you got a lock

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.830 
runt position and if you got a lock
cylinder<00:01:32.939> that's<00:01:34.250> you<00:01:35.250> know<00:01:35.369> jam<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.659> it

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
cylinder that's you know jam it up on it

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.569 
cylinder that's you know jam it up on it
might<00:01:37.049> not<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> tumblers<00:01:37.979> inside<00:01:38.430> it

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
might not be the tumblers inside it

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.030 
might not be the tumblers inside it
could<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:40.500> again<00:01:40.740> I'm<00:01:40.920> going

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
could just be that and again I'm going

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.389 
could just be that and again I'm going
to<00:01:41.100> use<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.400> Dylan<00:01:41.759> blue<00:01:42.150> magic<00:01:42.689> oil<00:01:42.990> with

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
to use this Dylan blue magic oil with

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.080 
to use this Dylan blue magic oil with
Teflon<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:45.240> for<00:01:45.390> guns<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.430> oil<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.579> up<00:01:47.700> again

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
Teflon just for guns and oil it up again

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.870 
Teflon just for guns and oil it up again
but<00:01:48.740> that<00:01:49.740> should<00:01:50.070> solve<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.549> problem

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
but that should solve the problem

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.550 
but that should solve the problem
because<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.119> had<00:01:51.270> actually<00:01:51.780> today<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.290> mean<00:01:52.530> I

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
because I had actually today I mean I

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.170 
because I had actually today I mean I
was<00:01:52.860> able<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.070> start<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> car<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:53.939> I'd<00:01:54.030> like

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
was able to start the car but I'd like

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.440 
was able to start the car but I'd like
tap<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.689> lock<00:01:54.930> I'm<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.130> mmm<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.390> that

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
tap the lock I'm like mmm I like that

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.209 
tap the lock I'm like mmm I like that
because<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.110> don't<00:01:58.140> want<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.439> be<00:01:58.530> stuck<00:01:58.770> nowhere

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
because I don't want to be stuck nowhere

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.170 
because I don't want to be stuck nowhere
but<00:01:59.490> for<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> simple<00:02:00.390> problem<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.909> it<00:02:02.909> turns

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
but for a simple problem and it turns

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.910 
but for a simple problem and it turns
out<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.600> wasn't<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.960> tumblers<00:02:04.380> inside<00:02:04.740> cuz

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
out it wasn't the tumblers inside cuz

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.170 
out it wasn't the tumblers inside cuz
actually<00:02:05.219> similars<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.759> are<00:02:05.880> actually

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
actually similars that are actually

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.350 
actually similars that are actually
taken<00:02:06.540> out<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.200> stupid<00:02:07.500> little<00:02:07.740> pin

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
taken out it's a stupid little pin

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.230 
taken out it's a stupid little pin
thinking<00:02:09.690> well<00:02:10.490> so<00:02:11.490> you<00:02:11.580> have<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.820> do<00:02:12.000> was

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
thinking well so you have to do was

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.870 
thinking well so you have to do was
grind<00:02:13.230> out<00:02:13.470> right<00:02:14.070> in<00:02:14.220> here<00:02:15.440> right<00:02:16.440> in<00:02:16.620> there

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
grind out right in here right in there

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.400 
grind out right in here right in there
so<00:02:17.880> when<00:02:18.060> it's<00:02:18.210> in<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.360> off<00:02:18.510> position<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:19.200> sits

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
so when it's in the off position it sits

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.490 
so when it's in the off position it sits
in<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.680> slot<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:21.150> it's<00:02:21.360> got<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.600> jump<00:02:21.840> up<00:02:22.050> out

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
in that slot and it's got to jump up out

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.470 
in that slot and it's got to jump up out
of<00:02:22.770> that<00:02:22.890> slot<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.610> then<00:02:23.760> when<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:24.000> pushes<00:02:24.360> in

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
of that slot and then when it pushes in

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.840 
of that slot and then when it pushes in
that<00:02:24.660> pin<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.940> know<00:02:27.060> see<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.570> pin<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:29.430> goes<00:02:29.640> in

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
that pin you know see the pin it goes in

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.420 
that pin you know see the pin it goes in
that's<00:02:30.270> in<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> off<00:02:30.720> position<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.530> now<00:02:31.740> it

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
that's in the off position so now it

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.940 
that's in the off position so now it
doesn't<00:02:32.640> have<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:33.030> jump<00:02:33.720> up<00:02:33.900> over<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.260> little<00:02:34.440> as

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
doesn't have to jump up over a little as

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.590 
doesn't have to jump up over a little as
big<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.160> bump<00:02:35.520> because<00:02:35.700> I'd<00:02:35.940> ground<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.450> out

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
big a bump because I'd ground it out

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.960 
big a bump because I'd ground it out
with<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.750> drummer<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.760> just<00:02:38.760> going<00:02:38.880> to

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
with a drummer so just going to

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.400 
with a drummer so just going to
double-check<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.840> triple-check<00:02:39.900> a

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
double-check and triple-check a

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.170 
double-check and triple-check a
quadruple<00:02:41.130> check<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.640> make<00:02:41.700> sure<00:02:41.820> it's

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
quadruple check it and make sure it's

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.880 
quadruple check it and make sure it's
working<00:02:42.390> all<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.780> time<00:02:42.840> but<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.380> seems<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.830> be

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
working all the time but it seems to be

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.770 
working all the time but it seems to be
100%<00:02:44.670> better

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
100% better

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.290 
100% better
like<00:02:46.050> I<00:02:46.170> don't<00:02:46.230> stick<00:02:47.010> at<00:02:47.160> all<00:02:47.340> it's<00:02:48.150> actually

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
like I don't stick at all it's actually

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.020 
like I don't stick at all it's actually
hanging<00:02:48.900> up<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.320> these<00:02:49.440> pins<00:02:49.740> so<00:02:50.070> that's

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
hanging up on these pins so that's

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.699 
hanging up on these pins so that's
something<00:02:51.330> else<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.660> watch<00:02:51.930> for<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:52.530> might

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
something else that watch for you might

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.320 
something else that watch for you might
not<00:02:52.890> need<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.130> put<00:02:53.430> new<00:02:53.459> tumblers<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.209> your

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
not need to put new tumblers in your

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.910 
not need to put new tumblers in your
lock<00:02:54.540> or<00:02:54.780> anything<00:02:54.990> like<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:55.740> could<00:02:55.890> just

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
lock or anything like that it could just

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.740 
lock or anything like that it could just
be<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.220> simple<00:02:56.640> problem<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:57.390> if<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.510> take

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
be that simple problem so if you take

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.710 
be that simple problem so if you take
your<00:02:57.930> drummel<00:02:58.380> you'd<00:02:59.340> probably<00:02:59.550> fix<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:00.150> just

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
your drummel you'd probably fix it just

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.210 
your drummel you'd probably fix it just
be<00:03:00.930> careful<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.440> don't<00:03:01.590> take<00:03:01.860> off<00:03:02.010> too<00:03:02.190> much

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
be careful you don't take off too much

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.420 
be careful you don't take off too much
metal<00:03:02.790> but<00:03:03.090> that's<00:03:03.840> not<00:03:04.110> really<00:03:04.530> like<00:03:04.770> a<00:03:04.800> super

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
metal but that's not really like a super

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.320 
metal but that's not really like a super
essential<00:03:05.880> area<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.540> lock<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:08.120> anyway<00:03:09.120> see

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
essential area to lock and anyway see

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.000 
essential area to lock and anyway see
the<00:03:09.420> pins<00:03:09.660> get<00:03:09.930> crooked<00:03:10.200> like<00:03:10.560> I'm<00:03:10.680> repeating

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
the pins get crooked like I'm repeating

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.460 
the pins get crooked like I'm repeating
it<00:03:11.250> but<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.430> pins<00:03:11.700> kind<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.150> get<00:03:12.270> crooked<00:03:12.510> so

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
it but the pins kind of get crooked so

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.970 
it but the pins kind of get crooked so
it's<00:03:14.400> not<00:03:14.790> it's<00:03:15.780> probably<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:16.110> gouge<00:03:16.440> in<00:03:16.739> here

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
it's not it's probably a gouge in here

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.890 
it's not it's probably a gouge in here
or<00:03:17.100> something<00:03:17.519> where<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.850> pin<00:03:18.090> goes<00:03:18.420> in<00:03:18.660> and

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
or something where the pin goes in and

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.410 
or something where the pin goes in and
it<00:03:19.709> probably<00:03:20.010> hits<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.519> so<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.820> pin<00:03:21.120> doesn't

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
it probably hits that so the pin doesn't

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.979 
it probably hits that so the pin doesn't
go<00:03:21.540> in<00:03:21.750> as<00:03:22.110> easy<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.550> just<00:03:24.239> made<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:24.780> it

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
go in as easy so I just made it so it

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.990 
go in as easy so I just made it so it
doesn't<00:03:25.620> have<00:03:25.830> to<00:03:25.950> ride<00:03:26.160> up<00:03:26.190> as<00:03:26.519> much<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.910> a

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
doesn't have to ride up as much of a

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.640 
doesn't have to ride up as much of a
bump<00:03:27.269> that's<00:03:28.019> all<00:03:28.350> should<00:03:29.040> work<00:03:29.220> good<00:03:29.400> now
