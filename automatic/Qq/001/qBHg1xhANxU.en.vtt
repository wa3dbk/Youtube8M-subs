ah look how cool that is so there's five
internal<00:02:23.109> rotating<00:02:24.109> spheres<00:02:24.650> or<00:02:25.750> such<00:02:30.069> inside

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
internal rotating spheres or such inside

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.250 
internal rotating spheres or such inside
a<00:02:31.100> bigger<00:02:31.700> sphere<00:02:31.940> inside<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:32.750> bigger<00:02:33.019> one<00:02:33.170> in

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
a bigger sphere inside a bigger one in

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.020 
a bigger sphere inside a bigger one in
the<00:02:33.319> bigger<00:02:33.470> one<00:02:33.620> but<00:02:33.799> can't<00:02:34.519> get<00:02:34.639> these<00:02:34.819> out

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
the bigger one but can't get these out

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.930 
the bigger one but can't get these out
now<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:36.079> did<00:02:36.620> have<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:36.769> problem<00:02:37.040> with<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:37.579> print

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
now I did have a problem with this print

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.430 
now I did have a problem with this print
and<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:39.650> points<00:02:40.750> lets<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:41.870> see<00:02:42.079> here<00:02:42.290> what<00:02:42.410> I

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
and the points lets you see here what I

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.289 
and the points lets you see here what I
did<00:02:42.560> is<00:02:42.799> I<00:02:42.920> drilled<00:02:43.250> them<00:02:43.400> out<00:02:43.549> and<00:02:43.790> added<00:02:44.239> a

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
did is I drilled them out and added a

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.259 
did is I drilled them out and added a
little<00:02:44.510> bitty<00:02:44.810> cotter<00:02:45.500> pin<00:02:45.859> that<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:46.850> flattened

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
little bitty cotter pin that I flattened

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.340 
little bitty cotter pin that I flattened
out<00:02:47.389> that's<00:02:48.019> all<00:02:48.139> I<00:02:48.200> could<00:02:48.319> find<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:50.350> the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
out that's all I could find and the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.750 
out that's all I could find and the
reason<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.650> did<00:02:51.799> that<00:02:51.829> is<00:02:51.950> for<00:02:52.190> some<00:02:52.370> reason

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
reason I did that is for some reason

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.539 
reason I did that is for some reason
they<00:02:52.850> don't<00:02:53.000> quite<00:02:53.269> fit<00:02:53.480> in<00:02:53.660> there

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
they don't quite fit in there

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.220 
they don't quite fit in there
the<00:02:55.549> regular<00:02:56.030> points<00:02:56.389> that<00:02:56.540> were<00:02:56.630> printed<00:02:57.049> for

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
the regular points that were printed for

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.559 
the regular points that were printed for
this<00:02:57.349> model<00:02:57.889> after<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.430> printed<00:02:59.090> this<00:02:59.209> I<00:02:59.389> found

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
this model after I printed this I found

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.410 
this model after I printed this I found
some<00:02:59.840> better<00:02:59.930> ones<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.910> this<00:03:01.910> was<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.239> first

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
some better ones and this was the first

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.449 
some better ones and this was the first
one<00:03:02.540> obviously<00:03:03.019> that<00:03:03.109> I<00:03:03.290> tried<00:03:03.560> but<00:03:03.920> pretty

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
one obviously that I tried but pretty

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.330 
one obviously that I tried but pretty
darn<00:03:04.700> cool<00:03:06.160> oops<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.519> just<00:03:07.849> knocked<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.299> out<00:03:09.340> but

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
darn cool oops I just knocked it out but

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.089 
darn cool oops I just knocked it out but
anyway<00:03:11.000> if<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:12.079> do<00:03:12.200> print<00:03:12.560> this<00:03:14.769> this<00:03:15.769> version

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
anyway if you do print this this version

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.280 
anyway if you do print this this version
didn't<00:03:16.669> work<00:03:16.819> out<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.299> best<00:03:17.510> these<00:03:17.840> points

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
didn't work out the best these points

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.190 
didn't work out the best these points
the<00:03:19.190> very<00:03:19.400> center<00:03:19.819> the<00:03:20.030> very<00:03:20.540> center<00:03:20.870> one<00:03:21.019> here

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
the very center the very center one here

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.479 
the very center the very center one here
is<00:03:21.319> actually<00:03:21.650> sitting<00:03:21.890> on<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.189> to<00:03:22.310> write

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
is actually sitting on it to write

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.360 
is actually sitting on it to write
original<00:03:22.849> points<00:03:23.540> I<00:03:23.720> didn't<00:03:24.709> add<00:03:24.860> any<00:03:24.920> the

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
original points I didn't add any the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.790 
original points I didn't add any the
rest

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
rest

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.960 
rest
I<00:03:25.830> added<00:03:26.010> some<00:03:26.160> just<00:03:26.460> so<00:03:26.550> it<00:03:26.640> worked<00:03:26.790> out

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
I added some just so it worked out

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:38.950 
I added some just so it worked out
better<00:03:27.150> but<00:03:28.340> yeah<00:03:29.340> that's<00:03:30.210> pretty<00:03:30.420> cool<00:03:30.690> Oh

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.670 

slippery

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.050 

so<00:03:45.579> that's<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.480> gyroscopic<00:03:48.060> spherical

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
so that's the gyroscopic spherical

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.199 
so that's the gyroscopic spherical
thingamabob<00:03:49.900> er<00:03:50.010> pretty<00:03:51.010> darn<00:03:51.250> cool<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.819> you

thingamabob er pretty darn cool and you
can't<00:03:52.420> get<00:03:52.540> these<00:03:52.659> out<00:03:52.900> they're<00:03:53.140> printed<00:03:53.470> in

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
can't get these out they're printed in

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.039 
can't get these out they're printed in
there<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:53.950> they're<00:03:54.250> there<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.640> stay<00:03:54.849> so<00:03:55.150> Russ
