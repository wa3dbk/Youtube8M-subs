a silencer I mean the suppressor already
so<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.190> mean<00:01:20.580> why<00:01:20.880> not<00:01:21.000> use<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.390> instead<00:01:21.780> it's

so I mean why not use this instead it's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.270 
so I mean why not use this instead it's
like<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.710> little<00:01:22.890> bit<00:01:22.979> heavier

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
like just it's just a little bit heavier

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.370 
like just it's just a little bit heavier
you<00:01:23.580> know<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.360> use<00:01:24.479> athleticism<00:01:25.050> or

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.550 
rounds and pretty much what they do is
that<00:01:47.970> they<00:01:48.360> are<00:01:48.479> grenades<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.170> travel

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
that they are grenades that travel

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.590 
that they are grenades that travel
faster<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.160> harder<00:01:50.580> so<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.240> guess<00:01:51.360> normal

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
faster and harder so I guess normal

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.960 
faster and harder so I guess normal
grenades<00:01:51.930> from<00:01:52.050> this<00:01:52.259> nagas<00:01:53.070> rocket<00:01:53.670> personal

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
grenades from this nagas rocket personal

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.950 
grenades from this nagas rocket personal
don't<00:01:54.270> travel<00:01:54.509> us<00:01:54.780> far<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:55.680> whatever<00:01:56.810> but<00:01:57.810> this

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
don't travel us far in whatever but this

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.210 
don't travel us far in whatever but this
is<00:01:58.080> pretty<00:01:58.229> much<00:01:58.350> LA<00:01:58.530> I'll<00:01:58.680> just<00:01:58.830> shoot<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.040> and

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
is pretty much LA I'll just shoot it and

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.150 
is pretty much LA I'll just shoot it and
you'll<00:01:59.430> see<00:01:59.640> then<00:02:00.330> so<00:02:00.840> apparently<00:02:01.590> that's<00:02:01.950> how

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
you'll see then so apparently that's how

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.120 
you'll see then so apparently that's how
far<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.990> know<00:02:04.080> that<00:02:04.259> apparently<00:02:04.740> apparently

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
far you know that apparently apparently

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.219 
far you know that apparently apparently
that's<00:02:05.520> further<00:02:05.940> and<00:02:06.660> apparently<00:02:07.080> that's

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
that's further and apparently that's

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.430 
that's further and apparently that's
faster<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:07.979> i<00:02:08.160> guess<00:02:08.700> normal<00:02:09.510> youtube<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.140> kind

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
faster so i guess normal youtube is kind

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.320 
faster so i guess normal youtube is kind
of<00:02:10.500> slower<00:02:10.739> than<00:02:10.979> my<00:02:11.130> shirt<00:02:11.370> but<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:12.209> pretty

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
of slower than my shirt but it's pretty

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.800 
of slower than my shirt but it's pretty
cool<00:02:12.570> i'm<00:02:12.720> like

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
cool i'm like

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.870 
cool i'm like
I'm<00:02:14.260> not<00:02:14.440> sure<00:02:14.800> if<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.459> know<00:02:15.580> this<00:02:15.610> would<00:02:15.849> be

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
I'm not sure if you know this would be

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.420 
I'm not sure if you know this would be
for<00:02:16.060> like<00:02:16.180> mid<00:02:16.450> mid<00:02:16.989> range<00:02:17.230> new<00:02:17.950> people<00:02:18.280> on

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
for like mid mid range new people on

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.290 
for like mid mid range new people on
that<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:20.080> can<00:02:20.200> get<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.709> costs<00:02:21.300> 27,000

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
that so you can get this it costs 27,000

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.960 
that so you can get this it costs 27,000
so<00:02:22.810> that's<00:02:23.050> pretty<00:02:23.290> expensive<00:02:23.470> but<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.340> mean<00:02:24.880> if

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
so that's pretty expensive but I mean if

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.850 
so that's pretty expensive but I mean if
you<00:02:25.060> got<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.330> money<00:02:25.450> why<00:02:25.780> not<00:02:25.989> buy<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.230> why<00:02:26.560> not

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
you got the money why not buy it why not

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.979 
you got the money why not buy it why not
buy<00:02:27.069> it<00:02:27.130> anyway<00:02:28.030> let's<00:02:28.510> move<00:02:28.569> on<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.930> next

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920

actually<00:02:55.510> evaporate<00:02:56.140> in<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.319> game<00:02:56.470> but<00:02:57.280> I

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
actually evaporate in the game but I

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.160 
actually evaporate in the game but I
can't<00:02:57.940> really<00:02:58.150> show<00:02:58.239> you<00:02:58.299> guys<00:02:58.480> cuz<00:02:58.900> this<00:02:58.989> is

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.390 
a d/s scope it pretty much is just a red
dot<00:03:26.569> sight<00:03:26.900> that<00:03:27.319> increases<00:03:27.709> accuracy<00:03:28.069> and

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
dot sight that increases accuracy and

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.970 
dot sight that increases accuracy and
mid-range<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:29.209> as<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:29.870> can<00:03:29.989> see<00:03:30.020> it's<00:03:30.830> just

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
mid-range and as you can see it's just

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.800 
mid-range and as you can see it's just
like<00:03:31.100> really<00:03:31.340> big<00:03:31.760> I'm<00:03:32.209> not<00:03:32.330> sure<00:03:32.390> if<00:03:32.540> I<00:03:32.600> like

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
like really big I'm not sure if I like

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.550 
like really big I'm not sure if I like
this<00:03:32.989> it<00:03:33.230> just<00:03:33.260> a<00:03:33.830> really<00:03:34.190> big<00:03:35.560> holographic

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
this it just a really big holographic

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.340 
this it just a really big holographic
with<00:03:36.770> netskope<00:03:37.100> yeah<00:03:38.000> I<00:03:38.180> guess<00:03:38.720> it<00:03:38.870> increases

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
with netskope yeah I guess it increases

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.930 
with netskope yeah I guess it increases
accuracy<00:03:39.590> it<00:03:40.190> looks<00:03:40.340> pretty<00:03:40.430> nice<00:03:40.670> I<00:03:40.730> might

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
accuracy it looks pretty nice I might

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.309 
accuracy it looks pretty nice I might
try<00:03:41.090> it<00:03:41.209> out<00:03:41.300> on<00:03:41.330> some<00:03:41.600> guns<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:42.050> do<00:03:42.110> a<00:03:42.140> live

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
try it out on some guns and do a live

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.530 
try it out on some guns and do a live
commentary<00:03:42.800> with<00:03:43.069> if<00:03:43.459> you<00:03:43.730> guys<00:03:43.910> are<00:03:44.209> up<00:03:44.239> for

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
commentary with if you guys are up for

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.660 
commentary with if you guys are up for
that<00:03:44.720> and<00:03:44.989> yeah<00:03:45.680> it's<00:03:46.010> pretty<00:03:46.130> cool<00:03:46.310> gun<00:03:46.489> I

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
that and yeah it's pretty cool gun I

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.809 
that and yeah it's pretty cool gun I
like<00:03:47.330> it<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:47.569> mean<00:03:47.660> pretty<00:03:48.019> cool<00:03:48.230> scope<00:03:48.950> sight<00:03:49.519> i

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
like it I mean pretty cool scope sight i

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.150 
like it I mean pretty cool scope sight i
like<00:03:50.750> it<00:03:50.900> i<00:03:50.959> think<00:03:51.140> i'll<00:03:51.230> be<00:03:51.380> using<00:03:51.530> it<00:03:51.739> like<00:03:52.010> it

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
like it i think i'll be using it like it

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.900 
like it i think i'll be using it like it
just<00:03:52.310> seems<00:03:53.000> nice<00:03:53.239> when<00:03:53.510> shoots<00:03:53.840> i<00:03:54.819> think<00:03:55.819> i'm

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
just seems nice when shoots i think i'm

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.539 
just seems nice when shoots i think i'm
gonna<00:03:56.000> save<00:03:56.239> up<00:03:56.390> for<00:03:56.540> this<00:03:56.600> it<00:03:57.049> also<00:03:57.200> costs

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
gonna save up for this it also costs

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.110 
gonna save up for this it also costs
14,000<00:03:58.549> so<00:03:58.930> yeah<00:04:00.220> that's<00:04:01.220> that<00:04:01.340> for<00:04:01.640> this<00:04:01.760> and

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
14,000 so yeah that's that for this and

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.320 
14,000 so yeah that's that for this and
next<00:04:02.290> up<00:04:03.290> is<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.620> wat<00:04:04.430> cut<00:04:04.790> around<00:04:04.910> so<00:04:05.269> i'm

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
next up is the wat cut around so i'm

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.789 
next up is the wat cut around so i'm
pretty<00:04:05.420> much<00:04:05.510> all<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.780> water<00:04:05.930> runs<00:04:06.290> are<00:04:06.470> for

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
pretty much all the water runs are for

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.610 
pretty much all the water runs are for
is<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.220> tiger<00:04:07.549> x3<00:04:08.269> and<00:04:08.510> pretty<00:04:09.319> much<00:04:09.380> they're

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
is the tiger x3 and pretty much they're

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.740 
is the tiger x3 and pretty much they're
just<00:04:09.830> flat<00:04:10.069> those<00:04:10.310> bullets<00:04:10.760> for<00:04:11.390> increased

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
just flat those bullets for increased

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.630 
just flat those bullets for increased
accuracy<00:04:12.110> so<00:04:12.500> i<00:04:12.560> guess<00:04:12.769> because<00:04:13.220> it<00:04:13.459> goes<00:04:13.549> you

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
accuracy so i guess because it goes you

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.370 
accuracy so i guess because it goes you
know<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:13.850> tiger<00:04:14.120> x3<00:04:14.390> is<00:04:14.420> like<00:04:14.600> really<00:04:14.840> spray

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
know the tiger x3 is like really spray

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.860 
know the tiger x3 is like really spray
and<00:04:15.709> like<00:04:15.980> total<00:04:16.700> everywhere<00:04:17.000> so<00:04:17.540> here's<00:04:17.780> just

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
and like total everywhere so here's just

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.080 
and like total everywhere so here's just
like<00:04:18.109> just<00:04:18.769> accuracy<00:04:19.310> can<00:04:19.489> increase<00:04:19.850> and

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
like just accuracy can increase and

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.810 
like just accuracy can increase and
still<00:04:20.329> pretty<00:04:20.539> pretty<00:04:21.260> terrible<00:04:21.680> but

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
still pretty pretty terrible but

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.620 
still pretty pretty terrible but
apparently<00:04:22.820> that<00:04:22.850> is

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
apparently that is

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.240 
apparently that is
so<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.020> know<00:04:24.170> I'm<00:04:24.410> taking<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:24.830> word<00:04:24.980> for<00:04:25.160> it

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
so you know I'm taking it word for it

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.970 
so you know I'm taking it word for it
and<00:04:26.000> yeah<00:04:26.210> so<00:04:26.900> that's<00:04:27.080> what<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.380> walk<00:04:27.530> arounds

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
and yeah so that's what the walk arounds

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.890 
and yeah so that's what the walk arounds
do<00:04:28.100> they<00:04:28.610> also<00:04:28.760> cost<00:04:29.030> twenty<00:04:29.390> two<00:04:29.510> thousand

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
do they also cost twenty two thousand

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.050 
do they also cost twenty two thousand
game<00:04:30.500> points<00:04:30.530> so<00:04:31.070> if<00:04:31.550> you<00:04:31.610> have<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:31.820> money<00:04:31.850> you

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
game points so if you have the money you

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.670 
game points so if you have the money you
can<00:04:32.360> get<00:04:32.480> but<00:04:32.690> that's<00:04:32.990> like<00:04:33.140> all<00:04:33.350> you<00:04:33.380> have

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
can get but that's like all you have

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.820 
can get but that's like all you have
allowed<00:04:34.250> suggest<00:04:34.700> you<00:04:34.790> get<00:04:34.880> something<00:04:35.210> else

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
allowed suggest you get something else

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.110 
allowed suggest you get something else
but<00:04:36.830> yeah<00:04:37.010> that's<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.580> for<00:04:37.730> the<00:04:37.790> walk<00:04:37.940> of<00:04:37.970> the

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
but yeah that's it for the walk of the

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.160 
but yeah that's it for the walk of the
rats<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:38.480> let's<00:04:38.630> move<00:04:38.750> on<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:38.930> the<00:04:39.110> next

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
rats and let's move on to the next

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.650 
rats and let's move on to the next
attachment<00:04:40.060> alright<00:04:41.060> guys<00:04:41.180> so<00:04:41.330> this<00:04:41.450> new

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
attachment alright guys so this new

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.780 
attachment alright guys so this new
attachment<00:04:42.140> is<00:04:42.230> called<00:04:42.980> the<00:04:43.160> advanced<00:04:43.610> hollow

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
attachment is called the advanced hollow

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.280 
attachment is called the advanced hollow
and<00:04:44.000> pretty<00:04:44.270> much<00:04:44.330> is<00:04:44.540> just<00:04:44.570> for<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:44.900> compact

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
and pretty much is just for the compact

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.260 
and pretty much is just for the compact
as<00:04:45.410> I<00:04:45.530> as<00:04:46.130> I<00:04:46.250> believe<00:04:46.400> right<00:04:46.580> down<00:04:47.000> that's

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
as I as I believe right down that's

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.490 
as I as I believe right down that's
tributes<00:04:47.540> on<00:04:47.630> any<00:04:47.810> other<00:04:47.930> guns<00:04:48.140> but<00:04:48.290> it's<00:04:48.410> what

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
tributes on any other guns but it's what

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.310 
tributes on any other guns but it's what
a<00:04:48.700> compact<00:04:49.700> and<00:04:49.970> it's<00:04:50.630> pretty<00:04:50.840> much<00:04:51.020> just<00:04:51.080> a

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
a compact and it's pretty much just a

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.080 
a compact and it's pretty much just a
lightweight<00:04:51.710> a<00:04:51.770> holographic<00:04:52.310> sight<00:04:52.640> of<00:04:52.790> slide

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
lightweight a holographic sight of slide

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.330 
lightweight a holographic sight of slide
zooms<00:04:53.510> so<00:04:53.840> i'll<00:04:54.200> just<00:04:54.260> show<00:04:54.560> you<00:04:54.590> guys<00:04:54.800> how<00:04:54.860> it

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
zooms so i'll just show you guys how it

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.640 
zooms so i'll just show you guys how it
looks<00:04:55.610> so<00:04:56.000> inside<00:04:56.480> it<00:04:56.630> looks<00:04:56.750> like<00:04:56.900> this<00:04:57.110> kind

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
looks so inside it looks like this kind

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.220 
looks so inside it looks like this kind
of<00:04:57.680> as<00:04:57.830> you<00:04:57.950> the<00:04:58.100> high<00:04:58.310> MOA<00:04:58.670> RDS<00:04:59.210> scope<00:04:59.540> except

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
of as you the high MOA RDS scope except

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.740 
of as you the high MOA RDS scope except
just<00:05:00.380> a<00:05:00.530> little<00:05:00.980> more<00:05:01.360> usable<00:05:02.360> and<00:05:02.510> has<00:05:02.720> a

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
just a little more usable and has a

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.660 
just a little more usable and has a
slight<00:05:03.050> zoom<00:05:03.290> in<00:05:03.500> just<00:05:03.680> it's<00:05:04.340> just<00:05:04.400> really

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670

actually been killing me all the

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.990 
actually been killing me all the
freaking<00:05:48.920> time<00:05:48.950> now<00:05:49.310> it's<00:05:49.430> really<00:05:49.730> good

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
freaking time now it's really good

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
apparently deals a lot of damage and

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.010 
apparently deals a lot of damage and
stuff<00:05:52.070> like<00:05:52.160> that<00:05:52.220> so<00:05:52.480> this<00:05:53.480> is<00:05:53.630> the<00:05:53.720> grenade

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
stuff like that so this is the grenade

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.750 
stuff like that so this is the grenade
as<00:05:54.260> you<00:05:54.440> can<00:05:54.560> see<00:05:54.740> right<00:05:54.770> here<00:05:55.160> I<00:05:55.340> guess<00:05:55.670> I

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
as you can see right here I guess I

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.700 
as you can see right here I guess I
think<00:05:55.970> this<00:05:56.030> kind<00:05:56.180> of<00:05:56.330> and<00:05:56.570> I<00:05:57.140> only<00:05:57.170> have<00:05:57.500> one

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710

you<00:06:01.160> can<00:06:01.460> kill<00:06:01.760> in<00:06:01.940> one<00:06:02.090> hit<00:06:02.390> so<00:06:03.260> that's<00:06:03.530> pretty

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
you can kill in one hit so that's pretty

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.980
