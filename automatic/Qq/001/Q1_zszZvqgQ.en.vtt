00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
about having shorter hair and she asked

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.790 
about having shorter hair and she asked
specifically<00:00:21.150> what<00:00:21.539> were<00:00:21.720> some<00:00:21.960> ways<00:00:22.199> for

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
specifically what were some ways for

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.939 
specifically what were some ways for
shorter<00:00:23.460> hair<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:24.570> keep<00:00:24.840> curls<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.769> your<00:00:25.800> hair

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
shorter hair to keep curls in your hair

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.670 
shorter hair to keep curls in your hair
while<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.580> sleep<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.750> if<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.260> had<00:00:28.439> longer

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
while you sleep so if you had longer

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.250 
while you sleep so if you had longer
hair<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.880> might<00:00:30.210> not<00:00:30.390> work<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:30.630> much<00:00:30.960> just

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
hair this might not work so much just

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.720 
hair this might not work so much just
because<00:00:31.380> longer<00:00:31.890> hair<00:00:32.040> naturally<00:00:32.579> weighs

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
because longer hair naturally weighs

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.200 
because longer hair naturally weighs
