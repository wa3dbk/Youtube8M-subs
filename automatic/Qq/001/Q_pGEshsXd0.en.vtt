00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
that's right the string ensemble er we

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.380 
that's right the string ensemble er we
are<00:00:21.410> using<00:00:21.650> VST<00:00:22.189> isin<00:00:22.519> these<00:00:22.670> episodes<00:00:23.000> right

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
are using VST isin these episodes right

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.740 
are using VST isin these episodes right
now

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
now

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.570 
now
unlike<00:00:24.260> getting<00:00:24.680> deeper<00:00:25.039> we<00:00:25.160> only<00:00:25.279> use

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
unlike getting deeper we only use

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.759 
unlike getting deeper we only use

nothing Julie give me that feel so I

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.310 
nothing Julie give me that feel so I
just<00:01:29.000> thought<00:01:29.300> a<00:01:29.480> little<00:01:29.510> bit<00:01:29.810> out<00:01:29.960> of<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.110> box

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
just thought a little bit out of the box

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.040 
just thought a little bit out of the box
remember<00:01:30.800> whenever<00:01:31.340> making<00:01:31.730> music<00:01:32.150> the<00:01:32.330> sky's

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
remember whenever making music the sky's

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.810 
remember whenever making music the sky's
the<00:01:33.080> limit<00:01:33.290> just<00:01:33.920> try<00:01:34.190> to<00:01:34.250> think<00:01:34.550> out<00:01:34.670> of<00:01:34.700> the

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
the limit just try to think out of the

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.130 
the limit just try to think out of the
box<00:01:34.850> try<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.330> do<00:01:35.540> something<00:01:35.750> different

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
box try to do something different

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.510 
box try to do something different
because<00:01:36.260> that's<00:01:36.530> when<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:36.860> get<00:01:37.010> recognized

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
because that's when you get recognized

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.690 
because that's when you get recognized
so<00:01:38.150> what<00:01:38.630> we<00:01:38.750> did<00:01:38.930> was<00:01:39.140> opened<00:01:39.890> up<00:01:40.070> a<00:01:40.190> strings

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
so what we did was opened up a strings

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.580 
so what we did was opened up a strings
ensemble<00:01:41.240> up<00:01:41.300> once<00:01:41.750> again<00:01:42.050> this<00:01:42.200> strings<00:01:42.440> on

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
ensemble up once again this strings on

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.380 
ensemble up once again this strings on

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.290 
of a button well so I opened up the
strings<00:01:54.470> ensemble<00:01:54.980> over<00:01:55.160> here<00:01:55.370> and<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:56.060> cause

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
strings ensemble over here and the cause

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.150 
strings ensemble over here and the cause
which<00:01:56.510> we<00:01:56.630> played<00:01:56.900> for<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.260> cord<00:01:57.530> plug<00:01:57.860> sound

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
which we played for the cord plug sound

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.880 
which we played for the cord plug sound
I<00:01:58.310> just<00:01:58.850> drag<00:01:59.210> and<00:01:59.450> drop<00:01:59.750> them<00:01:59.960> down<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.770> this

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
I just drag and drop them down to this

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.550 
I just drag and drop them down to this
instrument

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
instrument

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.250 
instrument
and<00:02:02.680> I<00:02:03.220> had<00:02:03.610> cut<00:02:03.910> that<00:02:04.090> claw<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.750> cord<00:02:04.990> pluck

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
and I had cut that claw the cord pluck

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.380 
and I had cut that claw the cord pluck
was<00:02:05.440> cut<00:02:05.710> into<00:02:05.950> little<00:02:06.040> make<00:02:06.310> sections<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:06.880> just

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
was cut into little make sections I just

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.210 
was cut into little make sections I just
joined<00:02:07.870> all<00:02:08.050> of<00:02:08.170> them<00:02:08.320> and<00:02:08.500> made<00:02:08.860> them<00:02:09.039> into

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
joined all of them and made them into

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.030 
joined all of them and made them into
simple<00:02:09.820> chords<00:02:10.450> well<00:02:11.020> if<00:02:11.230> you<00:02:11.500> listen<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.890> them

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
simple chords well if you listen to them

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:21.330 
simple chords well if you listen to them
this<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.430> how<00:02:12.610> they<00:02:12.910> sound

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.699 

now<00:02:22.340> if<00:02:22.549> you<00:02:22.640> listen<00:02:22.909> to<00:02:22.939> the<00:02:23.090> pluck<00:02:23.500> cord<00:02:24.500> and

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
now if you listen to the pluck cord and

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.410 
now if you listen to the pluck cord and
the<00:02:25.099> strings<00:02:25.370> together<00:02:25.519> this<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.180> what<00:02:26.269> it

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
the strings together this is what it

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:34.839 
the strings together this is what it
sounds<00:02:26.689> like<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:32.739> there<00:02:33.739> you<00:02:33.829> go<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.519> same

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
sounds like so there you go the same

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.059 
sounds like so there you go the same
chord<00:02:35.450> progression<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:36.440> same<00:02:36.680> notes

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
chord progression the same notes

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.490 
chord progression the same notes
everything<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.909> same<00:02:38.090> just<00:02:38.690> change<00:02:39.079> the<00:02:39.260> pads

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
everything the same just change the pads

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.619 
everything the same just change the pads
into<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.860> strings<00:02:40.159> well<00:02:41.090> when<00:02:41.239> I<00:02:41.299> put<00:02:41.510> the

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
into the strings well when I put the

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:42.970 
into the strings well when I put the
strings<00:02:41.930> on<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.290> I<00:02:42.319> was<00:02:42.440> playing<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.799> whole

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
strings on and I was playing the whole

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.410 
strings on and I was playing the whole
track<00:02:43.190> together<00:02:43.489> I<00:02:43.700> just<00:02:43.940> felt<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.299> the

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
track together I just felt that the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.270 
track together I just felt that the
strings<00:02:44.690> were<00:02:44.840> sort<00:02:45.200> of<00:02:45.290> overpowering<00:02:46.040> and

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
strings were sort of overpowering and

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.009 
strings were sort of overpowering and
not<00:02:46.489> really<00:02:46.790> going<00:02:47.060> with<00:02:47.329> the<00:02:47.450> field<00:02:47.720> with<00:02:47.900> the

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
not really going with the field with the

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.559 
not really going with the field with the
rhythmic<00:02:48.170> cord<00:02:48.650> plug<00:02:48.890> so<00:02:49.489> just<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.239> give<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.420> a

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
rhythmic cord plug so just to give it a

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.380 
rhythmic cord plug so just to give it a
slight<00:02:50.810> difference<00:02:51.260> what<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.709> did<00:02:52.010> was<00:02:52.209> put<00:02:53.209> on

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
slight difference what I did was put on

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.080 
slight difference what I did was put on
a<00:02:53.569> compression<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:54.980> if<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.579> listen<00:02:55.879> to<00:02:56.000> the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
a compression so if you listen to the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.180 
a compression so if you listen to the
chords<00:02:56.450> this<00:02:57.230> is<00:02:57.379> what<00:02:57.500> this<00:02:57.620> strings<00:02:57.950> sound

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
chords this is what this strings sound

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.720 
chords this is what this strings sound
like<00:03:01.269> and<00:03:02.269> then<00:03:03.139> you<00:03:03.709> put<00:03:03.950> on<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.220> compression

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
like and then you put on a compression

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.899 
like and then you put on a compression
and<00:03:04.819> this<00:03:04.940> is<00:03:05.090> how<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.329> changes<00:03:09.609> can<00:03:10.609> you<00:03:10.700> feel

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
and this is how it changes can you feel

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:11.949 
and this is how it changes can you feel
the<00:03:11.030> rhythm<00:03:11.150> which<00:03:11.389> is<00:03:11.450> coming<00:03:11.780> in<00:03:11.870> the

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
the rhythm which is coming in the

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.759

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
compression let's listen to the strings

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.770

sound and the track is just going to
change<00:04:12.940> well<00:04:13.930> now<00:04:14.470> we<00:04:14.530> have<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.890> full<00:04:15.099> groove

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
change well now we have the full groove

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.240 
change well now we have the full groove
section<00:04:15.849> the<00:04:16.359> bassline<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.380> cord<00:04:17.709> plugs<00:04:18.010> and

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
section the bassline the cord plugs and

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.939 
section the bassline the cord plugs and
the<00:04:18.820> strings<00:04:19.150> together<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:20.109> let's<00:04:20.709> see<00:04:20.829> how

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
the strings together and let's see how

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:29.629 
the strings together and let's see how
it<00:04:20.979> goes

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.920 

well<00:04:30.639> I'm<00:04:30.820> really<00:04:31.150> getting<00:04:31.360> the<00:04:31.389> feel<00:04:31.690> I<00:04:31.720> hope

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
well I'm really getting the feel I hope

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.240 
well I'm really getting the feel I hope
you<00:04:32.110> guys<00:04:32.290> are<00:04:32.440> getting<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:32.710> feel<00:04:32.889> as<00:04:33.040> well

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
you guys are getting the feel as well

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.460 
you guys are getting the feel as well
once<00:04:34.030> again<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.720> strings<00:04:35.020> are<00:04:35.229> slightly

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
once again the strings are slightly

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.379 
once again the strings are slightly
processed<00:04:36.010> I<00:04:36.160> put<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.550> compression<00:04:36.940> on<00:04:37.150> it<00:04:37.270> to

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
processed I put a compression on it to

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.420 
processed I put a compression on it to
give<00:04:37.540> it<00:04:37.570> that<00:04:40.050> pop<00:04:41.050> effect<00:04:41.560> basically<00:04:42.130> what

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
give it that pop effect basically what

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.530 
give it that pop effect basically what
the<00:04:42.520> compression<00:04:42.940> is<00:04:43.000> doing<00:04:43.180> is<00:04:43.270> every<00:04:43.450> time

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
the compression is doing is every time

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.240 
the compression is doing is every time
the<00:04:43.600> kick<00:04:43.900> hits<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.590> strings<00:04:44.889> are<00:04:45.040> pressed

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
the kick hits the strings are pressed

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.890 
the kick hits the strings are pressed
down<00:04:45.340> compressed<00:04:45.970> down<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:46.389> when<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.750> kick

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
down compressed down and when the kick

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.230 
down compressed down and when the kick
is<00:04:47.050> off<00:04:47.200> it<00:04:47.500> goes<00:04:47.710> back<00:04:47.919> up<00:04:48.100> that's<00:04:48.940> what<00:04:49.120> it

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
is off it goes back up that's what it

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.240 
is off it goes back up that's what it
gives<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:49.479> sound<00:04:49.720> but<00:04:50.289> this<00:04:50.800> is<00:04:50.950> not<00:04:51.130> about

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
gives the sound but this is not about

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.800 
gives the sound but this is not about
compression<00:04:51.910> this<00:04:52.120> is<00:04:52.300> about<00:04:52.479> making

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
compression this is about making

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.570 
compression this is about making
something<00:04:53.169> about<00:04:53.530> this<00:04:53.650> beat<00:04:53.889> we<00:04:54.310> told<00:04:54.520> you

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
something about this beat we told you

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.710 
something about this beat we told you
were<00:04:54.669> going<00:04:54.700> to<00:04:54.850> be<00:04:54.910> taking<00:04:55.180> compression<00:04:55.630> in

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
were going to be taking compression in

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.820 
were going to be taking compression in
another<00:04:55.900> episode<00:04:56.020> fully<00:04:56.850> so<00:04:57.850> we<00:04:58.180> put<00:04:58.389> that<00:04:58.419> and

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
another episode fully so we put that and

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.080 
another episode fully so we put that and
just<00:04:59.830> to<00:04:59.919> give<00:05:00.100> it<00:05:00.130> a<00:05:00.250> little<00:05:00.370> bit<00:05:00.610> more<00:05:00.880> of

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
just to give it a little bit more of

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.610 
just to give it a little bit more of
high<00:05:01.330> frequencies<00:05:01.930> in<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.139> mid<00:05:02.350> so<00:05:02.530> the

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
high frequencies in the mid so the

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.770 
high frequencies in the mid so the
strings<00:05:02.919> are<00:05:03.070> heard<00:05:03.280> properly<00:05:03.760> we<00:05:04.270> increase

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
strings are heard properly we increase

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.529 
strings are heard properly we increase
the<00:05:04.930> highs<00:05:05.139> and<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:06.100> mids<00:05:06.400> so<00:05:06.880> just<00:05:07.090> put<00:05:07.240> on<00:05:07.389> a

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
the highs and the mids so just put on a

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.950 
the highs and the mids so just put on a
simple<00:05:08.139> logic<00:05:08.740> pro<00:05:08.950> x<00:05:09.130> eq<00:05:09.639> and<00:05:09.850> that's<00:05:10.630> what<00:05:10.840> we

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
simple logic pro x eq and that's what we

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.440 
simple logic pro x eq and that's what we
have<00:05:11.200> the<00:05:11.740> strings<00:05:12.100> ensemble<00:05:12.789> err<00:05:12.820> let's

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
have the strings ensemble err let's

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.000 
have the strings ensemble err let's
listen<00:05:13.720> to<00:05:13.810> it<00:05:13.840> one<00:05:14.050> more<00:05:14.080> time<00:05:17.010> with

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
listen to it one more time with

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.310 
listen to it one more time with
compression<00:05:19.650> without<00:05:20.650> compression<00:05:22.320> with

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
compression without compression with

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.029 
compression without compression with
compression<00:05:23.919> I<00:05:25.500> think<00:05:26.500> less<00:05:26.650> is<00:05:26.680> leave<00:05:27.010> it

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
compression I think less is leave it

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.029 
compression I think less is leave it
with<00:05:27.280> compression<00:05:27.700> I<00:05:27.760> like<00:05:27.940> it<00:05:28.090> that<00:05:28.180> way<00:05:28.389> well

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
with compression I like it that way well

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.680 
with compression I like it that way well
something<00:05:30.039> about<00:05:30.280> this<00:05:30.400> beat<00:05:30.669> we<00:05:31.330> are<00:05:31.419> getting

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
something about this beat we are getting

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.080 
something about this beat we are getting
there<00:05:31.930> just<00:05:32.410> finishing<00:05:32.800> it<00:05:32.889> but<00:05:33.280> not<00:05:33.520> done<00:05:33.849> yet

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
there just finishing it but not done yet

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.879 
there just finishing it but not done yet
few<00:05:34.720> more<00:05:34.870> episodes<00:05:34.960> and<00:05:35.410> you<00:05:35.680> have<00:05:35.860> a

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
few more episodes and you have a

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.539 
few more episodes and you have a
fantastic<00:05:36.099> track<00:05:36.669> to<00:05:36.910> dance<00:05:37.090> to<00:05:37.330> soon
