00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
I think I'm in the shade sort of and

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.200 
I think I'm in the shade sort of and
look<00:01:34.680> at<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.220> looks<00:01:35.400> beautiful<00:01:35.579> i<00:01:35.880> hope<00:01:35.909> my

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
look at the it looks beautiful i hope my

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.060 
look at the it looks beautiful i hope my
render<00:01:36.540> settings<00:01:36.869> don't<00:01:37.110> look<00:01:37.290> too<00:01:37.470> bad<00:01:37.500> also

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
render settings don't look too bad also

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.590 
render settings don't look too bad also
I've<00:01:38.250> got<00:01:38.280> flux<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:38.939> when<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.180> was<00:01:39.360> recording

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
I've got flux on when I was recording

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.539 
I've got flux on when I was recording
this<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.409> tell<00:01:40.619> remember<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.369> turn

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
this I have to tell remember to turn

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.700 
this I have to tell remember to turn
that<00:01:41.729> off<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.119> because<00:01:42.810> i<00:01:43.140> don't<00:01:43.439> know<00:01:43.500> if<00:01:43.619> you

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
that off and because i don't know if you

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.109 
that off and because i don't know if you
guys<00:01:43.829> have<00:01:43.979> heard<00:01:44.310> what<00:01:44.520> flux<00:01:44.759> does<00:01:44.970> but

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
guys have heard what flux does but

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.469 
guys have heard what flux does but
basically<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.930> changes<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:47.390> fluorescence<00:01:48.390> of

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
basically it changes the fluorescence of

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.139 
basically it changes the fluorescence of
your<00:01:48.630> screen<00:01:48.869> at<00:01:49.049> sarah<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> nighttime

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
your screen at sarah so that a nighttime

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.880 
your screen at sarah so that a nighttime
it's<00:01:51.540> easy<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.899> look<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.170> anyway<00:01:52.590> what<00:01:52.860> I

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
it's easy to look but anyway what I

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.170 
it's easy to look but anyway what I
wanted<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.189> talk<00:01:53.369> about<00:01:53.399> really<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.090> this

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
wanted to talk about really in this

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.330 
wanted to talk about really in this
commentary<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.439> best<00:01:55.799> gun<00:01:56.100> on

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
commentary is the best gun on

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.190 
commentary is the best gun on
battlefield<00:01:56.820> 3<00:01:57.090> am<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.509> mean<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.750> can't<00:01:57.780> really

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
battlefield 3 am I mean we can't really

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.060 
battlefield 3 am I mean we can't really
say<00:01:58.530> what<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.670> best<00:01:59.909> gun<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.360> out<00:02:01.350> right<00:02:01.710> so

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
say what the best gun is out right so

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.800 
say what the best gun is out right so
far<00:02:02.280> because<00:02:02.490> I'm<00:02:02.729> pretty<00:02:02.969> sure<00:02:03.180> no<00:02:03.210> one's<00:02:03.600> got

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
far because I'm pretty sure no one's got

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.870 
far because I'm pretty sure no one's got
slower<00:02:04.049> 50<00:02:04.530> I'm<00:02:04.619> another<00:02:04.860> sad<00:02:05.159> guy<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.759> was

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
slower 50 I'm another sad guy that was

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.930 
slower 50 I'm another sad guy that was
on<00:02:05.909> lake<00:02:06.180> level<00:02:06.509> 40<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.710> 40s<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.280> he

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
on lake level 40 in the 40s and he

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.520 
on lake level 40 in the 40s and he
played<00:02:09.179> for<00:02:09.360> 27<00:02:09.840> hours<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.379> was

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
played for 27 hours and that was

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.050 
played for 27 hours and that was
yesterday<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.340> actual<00:02:11.550> fact<00:02:11.610> he<00:02:11.910> probably

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
yesterday so in actual fact he probably

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.520 
yesterday so in actual fact he probably
is<00:02:12.239> at<00:02:12.330> level<00:02:12.450> 50<00:02:12.780> but

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
is at level 50 but

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.350 
is at level 50 but
also<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.980> betta<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.520> I'm<00:02:14.850> assuming<00:02:15.209> most

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
also the betta so I I'm assuming most

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.300 
also the betta so I I'm assuming most
guns<00:02:15.630> will<00:02:15.750> be<00:02:15.870> toned<00:02:16.110> down<00:02:16.200> now<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:16.800> think<00:02:16.920> this

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
guns will be toned down now I think this

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.970 
guns will be toned down now I think this
server<00:02:17.940> I'm<00:02:18.120> on<00:02:18.240> now<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.720> hardcore<00:02:19.560> mode<00:02:19.740> I'm

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
server I'm on now is hardcore mode I'm

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.650 
server I'm on now is hardcore mode I'm
not<00:02:20.459> exactly<00:02:20.730> sure<00:02:20.880> maybe<00:02:21.180> someone<00:02:21.569> will

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
not exactly sure maybe someone will

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.860 
not exactly sure maybe someone will
verify<00:02:21.959> that<00:02:22.380> but<00:02:22.560> I'm<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:23.420> teammate<00:02:24.420> killed<00:02:24.690> me

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
verify that but I'm a teammate killed me

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.720 
verify that but I'm a teammate killed me

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.070 
load of guns I've tried out some of the
LMGs<00:02:59.550> the<00:03:00.060> assault<00:03:00.360> class<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.720> probably<00:03:00.959> my

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
LMGs the assault class is probably my

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.860 
LMGs the assault class is probably my
favorite<00:03:01.250> i<00:03:02.250> love<00:03:02.459> how<00:03:02.819> they<00:03:03.000> merge<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.600> medic

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
favorite i love how they merge the medic

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.150 
favorite i love how they merge the medic
class<00:03:03.959> into<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.410> assault<00:03:04.650> class<00:03:04.800> i<00:03:04.980> think

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
class into the assault class i think

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.350 
class into the assault class i think
that<00:03:05.250> was<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.400> really<00:03:05.580> good<00:03:05.760> idea<00:03:05.880> because<00:03:06.120> now

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
that was a really good idea because now

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.630 
that was a really good idea because now
the<00:03:06.420> assault<00:03:06.750> class<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.110> much<00:03:07.290> more<00:03:07.500> viable<00:03:07.739> in

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
the assault class is much more viable in

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.150 
the assault class is much more viable in
terms<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.150> i<00:03:09.360> think<00:03:10.050> it<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.769> was<00:03:10.860> my<00:03:10.950> dog

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
terms of i think it that was my dog

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.220 
terms of i think it that was my dog
barking<00:03:11.580> by<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.760> way<00:03:11.910> if<00:03:12.030> she<00:03:12.600> bucks<00:03:12.840> again

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
barking by the way if she bucks again

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.759 
barking by the way if she bucks again
