00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.800
 it was always right for me 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.450
 the devices to the suits to the music 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.430
 everything just fits together 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.140
 that's all with one look 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.820
 overall impression of course not in the 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.460
 evaluation of the elements which must also 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.150
 jana clean gymnastics to their people to 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.640
 receive 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.640
 but the overall concept it always visible 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.610
 almost everything always wonderful 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.140
 dusy 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:30.240
 and with movement designation suit 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.110
 implementation of the dramaturgy of everything 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.110
 city â€‹â€‹just out 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.500
 was 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.780
 I have that with some of his 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.970
 previous speaker already spoken several times 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.510
 So there are many people who 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.510
 made sport 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.890
 Observe and say for decades 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.890
 such a danced her 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.030
 reinforce that is all that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.170
 It looks incredibly easy with her 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.270
 not to be exhausting at all 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.550
 in Saxony 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.580
 It's going to be so cheap 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.580
 Yes 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.350
 that's just the difficulty 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:41.840
 I'm back 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:57.580
 but nobody is flawless, hopefully 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:01.840
 Years did not find it good 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.840
 Human entrances went 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.790
 but if that was a pity that was absolutely perfect 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.680
 and in the last millisecond begins 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.940
 again the two did not die for 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.670
 then overfills the device just as well 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.549
 our line here you can see it again 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.390
 she also takes care of herself 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:27.810
 limit line at it of course 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.810
 interesting that this is deducted
