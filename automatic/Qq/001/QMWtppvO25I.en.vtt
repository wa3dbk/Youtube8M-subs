thing<00:03:16.280> now<00:03:16.459> is<00:03:16.700> that<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:16.940> same<00:03:17.150> equipment

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
thing now is that the same equipment

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.750 
thing now is that the same equipment
that<00:03:17.840> we<00:03:17.959> use<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.440> develop<00:03:18.560> our<00:03:18.920> saddles<00:03:19.340> you

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
that we use to develop our saddles you

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.460 
that we use to develop our saddles you
can<00:03:19.910> find<00:03:20.180> at<00:03:20.330> your<00:03:20.360> local<00:03:20.480> trek<00:03:20.989> bike<00:03:21.200> shop

and so that saddle wall that was once

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.740 
and so that saddle wall that was once
daunting<00:03:24.440> is<00:03:24.680> no<00:03:25.340> longer<00:03:25.850> so<00:03:26.120> intimidating

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
daunting is no longer so intimidating

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.479 
daunting is no longer so intimidating
because<00:03:26.989> a<00:03:27.380> rider<00:03:27.590> can<00:03:27.920> put<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.250> saddle

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
because a rider can put the saddle
