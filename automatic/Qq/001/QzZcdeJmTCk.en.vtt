00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
on this Oh 48 curve out there kind of

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.760 
on this Oh 48 curve out there kind of
like<00:05:33.260> where<00:05:33.470> that<00:05:34.180> PIR<00:05:35.180> flat<00:05:36.110> car<00:05:36.350> is<00:05:36.530> right

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
like where that PIR flat car is right

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.620 
like where that PIR flat car is right
there<00:05:36.830> I'm<00:05:37.700> thinking<00:05:37.910> about<00:05:38.150> putting<00:05:38.300> the

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
there I'm thinking about putting the

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
there I'm thinking about putting the
switch<00:05:39.320> in<00:05:39.530> and<00:05:40.100> running<00:05:40.400> a<00:05:40.460> line<00:05:40.670> out<00:05:41.110> put<00:05:42.110> an

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
switch in and running a line out put an

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.190 
switch in and running a line out put an
extension<00:05:43.250> over<00:05:43.400> here<00:05:43.850> in<00:05:44.000> the<00:05:44.510> future<00:05:44.840> like

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
extension over here in the future like

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.140 
extension over here in the future like
coming<00:05:45.530> out<00:05:45.590> that<00:05:45.800> way<00:05:46.010> with<00:05:46.280> some<00:05:46.490> yard<00:05:46.970> area

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
coming out that way with some yard area

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.520 
coming out that way with some yard area
that's<00:05:47.480> where<00:05:47.630> the<00:05:47.780> brewery<00:05:48.080> is<00:05:48.200> going<00:05:48.320> to<00:05:48.380> end

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
that's where the brewery is going to end

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.560 
that's where the brewery is going to end
up<00:05:48.620> so<00:05:49.010> I<00:05:49.250> think<00:05:49.640> that's<00:05:49.940> gonna<00:05:50.120> look<00:05:50.270> much

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
up so I think that's gonna look much

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.390 
up so I think that's gonna look much
better<00:05:50.750> than<00:05:51.080> the<00:05:51.710> idea<00:05:52.010> I<00:05:52.070> had<00:05:52.220> before

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
better than the idea I had before

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.040 
better than the idea I had before
because<00:05:52.640> I<00:05:52.820> like<00:05:52.970> being<00:05:53.210> able<00:05:53.270> to<00:05:53.420> walk<00:05:53.660> behind

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
because I like being able to walk behind

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.040 
because I like being able to walk behind
