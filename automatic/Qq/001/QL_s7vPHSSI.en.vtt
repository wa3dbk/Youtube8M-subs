trying to put them like flat twice and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.030 
trying to put them like flat twice and
I'm<00:01:56.520> gonna<00:01:56.759> try<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.180> put<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.869> way<00:01:58.200> instead<00:01:58.799> of

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
I'm gonna try to put this way instead of

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.170 
I'm gonna try to put this way instead of
stacking<00:01:59.430> them<00:02:00.799> one<00:02:01.799> after<00:02:01.920> another<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.909> look

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
stacking them one after another so look

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.240

at<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.259> way<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.530> think<00:02:04.619> they<00:02:05.070> can

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
at this one this way I think they can

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.119 
at this one this way I think they can
carry<00:02:05.460> more<00:02:07.129> okay

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129
