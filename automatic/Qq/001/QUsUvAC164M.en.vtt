00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840
 and that like this process 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.170
 clear that we find with input 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.219
 with a new guide you already know that I have 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.550
 a motorcycle engine gp 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.660
 version 1 or model or first generation 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.160
 and very good that I find this 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.779
 that the wii that is very small thing 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.310
 that I love because I 'm really 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.939
 very comfortable for me to handle it if there is 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.939
 genius and went down a little bit 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.800
 well I really loved how it looks 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.210
 this as you can see this is very 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.739
 boy in the truth 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.210
 the focus when I have an English because 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.280
 I like it more in English than in Spanish 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.070
 I understand nothing of Spanish is poop in the 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.809
 true football wind and email guard and 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.239
 all this good here is the option to 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.890
 change the 6 button that is the 6 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.320
 they have changed as you can see is very 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.660
 beautiful enters the world of worship 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.350
 Minecraft 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.090
 as you can see it is very very cool what 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.430
 that would guide me and my equipped and what 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.840
 I can handle perfectly apart 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.360
 I mark less space this side to 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.010
 can play here and can not jump without 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.110
 No reason or circumstance a 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.610
 that I do not want musicians that has not 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.860
 been everything that they added did not fix 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.900
 this version to the air arranged that the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.030
 wolves can already eat meats are me 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.250
 things that they did not do not eat meat of 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.690
 zombie so now you can later 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.220
 restore your life with zombie meat 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.200
 you can not tame them with meats or 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.000
 you know that they are only domesticated with bones 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.369
 but they can restore your life with 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.110
 zombie meat have reduced in the when 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.360
 it rains or new that is very cool 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.130
 because if when I was already working almost 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.229
 half of the fps good me at least 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.060
 while recording the particles have 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.460
 reduced the aic of the particles the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.630
 snow monkeys now leave what would be 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.550
 Caminito level when they walk 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.039
 where he says that I am a golem and I go 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.060
 walking and I'm leaving a capita 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.820
 snow above the grass 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.530
 if that also already added it could be 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.259
 say so add a lot of things 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.340
 Good news good not to add 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:59.259
 but they fixed and they added him 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.939
 to certain maps that was the most remarkable thing 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.990
 that I saw of the entire change list of 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:02.860
 the list of changes in 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.009
 I leave it to you here in the 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.780
 description and I really loved it 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.369
 the guide already as you can see says the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.050
 mass of enchantments here in cuito 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.489
 minecraft because I did not know how and I 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.170
 They said that they had another one but good if 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.390
 you put aside that they will see the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.680
 while the link took away minecraft na 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.730
 guys about whether there was dismissal or a 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.500
 I discard up in the description already 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.730
 they know that there is enough highlights is not 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.069
 complete in case you want to see something that 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.040
 they added something that they removed because then 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.480
 I really can not be not not only 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.160
 write the list of changes for 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.810
 be reading minds to bolt video but 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.360
 the guys I went to again enter a 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.360
 alone is already then goodbye
