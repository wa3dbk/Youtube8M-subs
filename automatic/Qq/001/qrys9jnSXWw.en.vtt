00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.660
 with you about eyelashes 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.399
 in order for the century to be voluminous we 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.770
 must apply shadows 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.019

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.870
 us today the main focus on eyelashes 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.910
 shadows we take neutral better to 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.470
 it was a cold beige brown tone 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:09.210
 I apply it with such circular movements 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.210
 over the crease of the century 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.520
 apply darker on the mobile eyelid 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.520
 tone 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.440
 very beginning in order to give 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.260
 the thickness of the eyelashes we will 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.820
 we paint over the interstitial space 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.820
 dark brown pencil for black 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.770
 Now I will dwell on 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.570
 the same is a novelty from avon 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.580

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.470
 section lifts eyelashes and 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.620
 evenly distribute the mascara on each 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.540
 cilia formula with hollow fibers 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.880

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.380
 weight cilia now I will show how 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.200
 This is an example of daytime makeup. 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.180
 to make the mascara look more natural 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.700
 and better go to bed better paint over 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.980
 initially the tips of the eyelashes and then already 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.560
 stains ink from the base of growth 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.840
