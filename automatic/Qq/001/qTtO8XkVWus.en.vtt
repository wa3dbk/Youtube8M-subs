00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:03.840
 drumheads are part of the instrument 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.340
 which is making a sound 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.880
 some skin making in the traditional way 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.419
 from animal skin but natural leather 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:12.799
 sensitive to fluctuations 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.549
 temperature and humidity 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.240
 so most drummers 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.929
 prefer modern 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.929
 synthetic materials 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:29.839
 all top of the drum often 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:30.770
 called cats 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.310
 as the head of the department reported 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.890
 talk about skin 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.910
 this is artificial leather mark 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.670
 elastic film flew away 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.820
 loss of phthalates produced on the 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.199
 same 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.269
 policy is expensive as plastic for 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:44.150
 bottles 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.080
 workers load a few sheets 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.030
 plastics russia 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.620
 which squeezes their forces 75 tons into sharp 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.230
 round stencils 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.300
 the cut circles are then pulled over 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.300
 drum 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.970
 drumhead skin may not consist of one 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.080
 whole circle or several glued 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.920
 seams collect novak smart turn steel 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.280
 air pressure to hold film 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.470
 while the workers stick their tape 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.539
 outer edge 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.780
 and attach to it the second film 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.040
 films are called layers the more 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.040
 layers of the lower drum purity 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.090
 then the skin is treated on 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.550
 drilling machine 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.390
 the machine is drilling tiny holes 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.560
 share of their perimeter at a distance of 3 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.560
 millimeter edge 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.210
 bore diameter no larger than nail head 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.570
 they have six millimeters apart 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.780
 friend 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.530
 the next machine heats the edges of the films 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.130
 to post them does not give them shape under 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.600
 pressure 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.040
 grooved edges withstand tension 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.680
 even when the musicians will pull the skin 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.680
 tuning drum 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.370
 meanwhile in profile bending 

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.189
 car bends gradually 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.319
 aluminum strip shaping hoop 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:19.659
 will hold the skin on the base of the drum 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.189
 which is called a cylinder 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:22.729
 providing tension 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:24.859
 necessary to create sound 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.099
 this machine also create dragged on 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.059
 surface on one side of the pavement 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:31.229
 which provides additional 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.229
 bonding strength hoop m with leather 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.560
 then the machine bends the edges of the hoop inside 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.609
 creating a zholob where then glue will be poured 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.909
 when the floor is turned small 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.969
 embedded saw blade trimming concept 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.819
 then the worker transfers the hoop to 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.819
 rotary solder jig 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.379
 put silver on the joint 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.609
 solder 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.959
 then gas welding torch 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.959
 alloy wallow seam 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.419
 after metal shelling under the action 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:30.419
 water hoop 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.609
 finally it's time to fix on the hoop 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.989
 the shell is quite complicated 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.680
 process so how to thoroughly 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.980
 center the skin 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:49.769
 otherwise 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.790
 when tuning drums short 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.510
 the side will pull before 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.209
 other and uneven 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.069
 tension will not allow to adjust 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.249
 instruments 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:00.419
 this part of the assembly is carried out on 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.139
 special steel putting the skin circular 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:04.399
 vacuum clamp 

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:06.059
 while the whole structure 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:07.589
 held still under 

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:09.709
 air pressure mechanical arm 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.709
 poured potholes on potassium hoop 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.349
 glue flows down through tiny 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.439
 holes around the perimeter of the skin then 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:22.139
 dries firmly fixing the skin of the window 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.559
 experience h 

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:25.229
 puts on some drums 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.590
 additional texture coating 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.760
 adding a sharp coating drowns out 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.030
 high fidelity amplifying 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.919
 low 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.729
 such a tool produces more 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.419
 warm low then she is also that whistling 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.599
 sound when jazz drummers play 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.719
 princely brushes 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:43.699
 when the coating dries up probably 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.610
 printing press stamps the name 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.879
 companies only 30 percent of the drums 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:50.710
 has additional coverage 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.340
 the rest of the so-called 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.210
 transparent head in other words when 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.410
 it's about drums 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.530
 transparent goals prevail
