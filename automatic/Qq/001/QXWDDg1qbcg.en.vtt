so<00:00:50.160> October<00:00:51.000> 12th<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.140> guess<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.620> couple<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.219> days

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
so October 12th I guess a couple of days

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
years so let's take his example of

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.050 
years so let's take his example of
Romania<00:05:19.120> Ceausescu<00:05:19.650> hideous<00:05:20.650> regime<00:05:21.190> which

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
supported I supported right till the end

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.570 
supported I supported right till the end
as<00:05:28.120> did<00:05:28.510> Britain<00:05:28.960> so<00:05:29.650> the<00:05:29.800> example<00:05:30.310> that<00:05:30.340> he

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
as did Britain so the example that he

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.510 
as did Britain so the example that he
gave<00:05:30.880> is<00:05:31.240> a<00:05:31.300> perfect<00:05:32.110> example<00:05:32.320> and<00:05:33.040> it's<00:05:33.400> a

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
gave is a perfect example and it's a

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.520 
gave is a perfect example and it's a
small<00:05:33.790> example<00:05:34.360> because<00:05:34.960> we<00:05:35.110> support<00:05:35.410> much

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
small example because we support much
