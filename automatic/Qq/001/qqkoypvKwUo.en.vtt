00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.710

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.880
 pact of knights and gentlemen today in 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.060
 women's day today that is a day for 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.310
 today it seems that we get along and 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.109
 that we are good people both and that 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.170
 nobody is going to try a little snack 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.929
 ok come today training day that is 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.670
 almost almost resting not resting not 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.670
 because our path and smooth 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.720
 do not 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.820
 that is to say 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:01.910
 and well now it's the part of 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.910
 decoration and look what face we are 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.150
 both in a face of good already 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.100
 we will make socials of ironman and already 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.880
 but hey, he's going to run a little bit like 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.880
 you went legs 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.390
 to see if between the one and the other one does not 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.390
 tell a joke 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.620
 they mark the road , the road is out 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.690
 towards glory 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:38.380
 I'm fixed if you have to mark me 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:38.380
 we have been on the road for a while and you too 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.470
 we lose all 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.470
 more or less and piedrahita 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.780
 basic pleasure train departures 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.580
 and the ones that we carry 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.470
 I think that by playing 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.890
 d 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.890
 ghosts 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.819
 the mixed good then and say 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.819
 pretty or depressing deserted but 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.819
 good 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:40.239
 wait for the moment the camera focusing 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.239
 for here 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.590
 do not 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:58.629
 what about the tri monkey or if not then 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.459
 I'm left with the dark palette that 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:03.099
 then like this in Barcelona I do not know 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.510
 you can do took advantage and then here and 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.510
 I put the aesthetic that yes no 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.110
 clean 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.730
 a little but five minutes ago they were 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.750
 yellow 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.750
 we are going new 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.960
 since the new actions 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.490
 they will have to be washed, because I believe that 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.440
 mine begin to be even cleaner 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.030
 that before and everything goes by the way very 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.330
 important if you go out here with this 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.580
 sun put on sunscreen that says that you 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.970
 I bet you 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.330
 well I'm red 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.940
 so solar cream water to hydrate 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.770
 and some gel for the road that if not to 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.660
 half this has come before the return 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.680
 you are already done looking at the 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.680
 landscape we have here 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.960
 the rectum here is like when the 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.000
 barcelona taxis cut the diagonal 

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.780
 because they are doing things here in the 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.780
 booklets well 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.889
 with these formats 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.490
 Well, as they have bad milk 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.380
 break 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.380
 about 36 minutes 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.950
 yes 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.630
 we're going to run around here in 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.940
 principle is where ge suspension 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.520
 espadrilles and you arrive here and they find you 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.920
 some tests with the circuits for vice 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.040
 or for motorcycle whatever is made company is 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.470
 who reads them pas from the next holy day 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.090
 we come on motorcycle the next day fuck 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.190
 It seems to me that it has less 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.139
 orientation to see what leads I do not know 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:38.120
 how much time saying ay 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.120
 so it's OK 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.100
 Send us the location to see where it is 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.900
 passes and has busted and pep the bike three 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.900
 times or has not busted wheels 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:55.390
 shit I tell you that here says there 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.490
 one dead all the other calorazo takes me 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.260
 volcano and if you have had so far I'm going 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.530
 here that seems to have eaten me three 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.240
 polvorones fall to the adventure for 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.440
 down here you saved our lives here 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.440
 take a little bit of water 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:20.730
 today of the mother freezer that does not work 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.730
 well here there is no current 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.750
 Now you have good face 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.750
 person 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:35.000
 the last sip so I can 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:38.040
 happen 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.920
 and these are the saleh routes of castro 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.330
 you're running and suddenly has 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:46.590
 past it has happened that the 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:51.110
 way and especially downhill and that's how it is 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.110
 how are the sneakers 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:01.370
 what happened but yes 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.200
 in today's plenary
