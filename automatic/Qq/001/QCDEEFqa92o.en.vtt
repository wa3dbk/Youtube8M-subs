00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:05.460
 so happy in 2005 and talk about this book creating 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.309
 which is an essay on contemporary art 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.439
 helped by the calm I gathered that 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.149
 all my experience 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:17.800
 of artists' art places 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.310
 the creators 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.269
 especially in plastic art because I wrote on the dance 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.239
 contemporary on the ground 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.359
 on literature but here it is really painting sculpture 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.739
 contemporary 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.669
 who does not have much for them 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.790
 touched by what seems to me that 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.340
 handover she puts the game back into play 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.390
 on the job 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.530
 the question of systems accra to what we do 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.610
 we'll see after 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.040
 what we are capable of true 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.150
 work to subsist and already and at the same time to bring out a little bit of 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.160
 self 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.250
 I would not even go into resonance with the creation 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.700
 the creation of the world such as genesis but seguela 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.580
 he drew 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.070
 Biblical youth 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.570
 he drew in terms a little symbolic metaphorical 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.090
 we know very well that the world was created 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.330
 for exists for billions of years but that 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.300
 creative 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.480
 are rare 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.930
 and that it is precisely to bring into existence things that 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.450
 they are not quite 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.270
 and so that I'm showing 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.080
 kepler 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.420
 he had contemporary art through all kinds example I take 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.920
 in this place I visit 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.280
 the museums of new york is well established 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.670
 p likewise 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.900
 the the Germans time 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.610
 so you also need to in France 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.250
 I show it 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.420
 t 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.410
 in a way 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.940
 one year ago 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.940
 the theme of contemporary art 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.450
 far beyond 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.800
 questions that have usually been asked about art that resists 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.609
 the death 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.049
 that makes me a hero 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.640
 art and religion 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.119
 relay it and break with what preceded 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.430
 this case actually shows 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.630
 we have freed ourselves from all these themes and that the reconstruction 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.059
 really is to try 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:23.409
 to make particular creatures exist for his humanity 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.529
 animal pub budgets are works 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:29.529
 the authors are creatures who asked to live 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:35.180
 the artist when he arrives hooked and it failed inside that 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:37.469
 his desire 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:39.260
 his call of air to be 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.569
 his call of air 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.419
 afp these offers space projects 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.729
 and then it comes in a terrible reality 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:48.609
 reality 2 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.389
 crossed m upset the common reality 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.040
 I was there for the good cause that's six 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.040
 they did not know that it was necessarily crazy 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:03.719
 and well because they get there the artist produces it something 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:08.159
 fortis accounts conveys this existence and I had a lot of local 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.619
 from artists after this worst 

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:14.519
 very moving progress p 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.289
 several deputies without having given the word 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:18.879
 I have the impression 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.749
 that wanting to meet him he has a long way of the cross in the essonne 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:28.879
 she's just one who are fighting there with their creations and since then I'm doing 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.119
 portraits of artists 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:35.059
 they keep a lot of artillery calls against Europe and I am 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:38.409
 quite happy when thanks to what I learned in this book 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.949
 I'm pretty happy it happened there 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:44.419
 in the middle east in case 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:48.769
 personality their existence is alive of two men two women 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.000
 but fragile and at the same time 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.130
 seeking 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.269
 supports 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.560
 and when growing samassa of materials 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.039
 with which he spoke with which gives body 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:03.309
 to this fantasy at this lack 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:08.539
 ellis with which they transmit something that cross another 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.499
 our movement our defense 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:14.760
 and I just have to laugh all kinds of shapes and the apple 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.859
 the delay 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.709
 it's the crossroads of narcissism 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.289
 that of the artist and that of the viewer but which clings to their point of 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:25.479
 fragility
