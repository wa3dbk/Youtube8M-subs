00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:04.220
 hello to all we will introduce you today a new 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.220
 product we received in euros within the shop 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.340
 so in fact he is addressing the subtle author of iphone 4 iphone 3gs and 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.629
 the iphone 3gs 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.629
 and mainly to his people that of the memorandum 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.640
 and for good reason there are about 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.609
 60% of the game in front of the advertising plastor plate 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.699
 as dark sessions for these people 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.989
 so what does that mean it's called boom box 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.980
 and if not a multimedia controller for Tunisians 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.080
 because this controller actually integrates different features like 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.380
 stereo spitfires 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.740
 for this immediate release sensor 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.700
 vibration motors 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.360
 a charging battery 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.880
 not yet see we'll see that 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.990
 cross 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.990
 gold bagadig is very light and very little sadness infinite 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.690
 these centers 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.050
 charles if you have a t-shirt that's what to do 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.980
 to recharge the battery 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.180
 but if you have a little hollow a small flapper that will allow you to 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.880
 switch the device to mode then vote the bodies - visualization ajacides 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.880
 and I want to show how they manage in turn 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.090
 so in fact we talked about it in this form if you're a little 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.600
 bag 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.030
 and you have side 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.360
 it's the iphone connector 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.370
 so are you going you can all the punishment is very very good to afp 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.780
 arlette have enough light effect 112 118 grams 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.250
 Eugenie finish 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.570
 to sing 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.090
 on the jump the face the big challenges nation replacing on the back side 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.670
 me my iphone 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.670
 we plug it like that 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.120
 and as you can see in fact what happens directly on less chance 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.360
 unleaded it's actually the battery 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.610
 e external ap that is a little near all edges is a capacity of 2000 50 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.350
 millions of losses 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.159
 and already plugged in so you see that allows us to have autonomy in 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.159
 plus a little bit 10 hours to 10 hours of play coming out of the sergeant more 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.849
 so there present in these cultures place before we go now 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.139
 in the convoy diouf polluted 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.329
 characteristics 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.829
 yes here if you have an opening for for volume buttons 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.379
 this is wrong we can do for 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.189
 to cut the best sound 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.749
 the interesting thing is that its buttons are magnified this 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.939
 on the planet itself that is to say the facts are there you have the button 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.939
 volume 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.769
 here you have the button to cut 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.409
 when you have more people 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.459
 here you do not have a button that connects stereo headphones 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.419
 the usb connector for charging 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:56.329
 here a button that decrypts and turns off the screen so saved 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.579
 in fact to be on top 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.039
 his redemption by the city 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:03.259
 but life is so 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.889
 and if there is a button that actually turns on or off in celebration the 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.989
 country the lamenting engines 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.139
 like on a ps3 controller for example 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.139
 and the last the csc the volume buttons 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.590
 more his words for the job port-bou must not you get it I I I 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:21.599
 think we played in green october 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.439
 percent on the dollar against the euro to 1 8 euro 26% in the title losing from 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.489
 take photos 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.709
 and both of the stereo sculptures that are raw to vote bussang 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:36.179
 so that the little keyboard go 

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:37.929
 to perfect everything 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:39.539
 allows you to 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:41.159
 to pass 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.289
 the crust 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:46.529
 the controller in less than two seconds she was afraid to power for 34 years 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.729
 convenient 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:57.919
 good after all can power in games 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.069
 cleveland this season 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.979
 in majesty of the pole 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.979
 according to michael hewson 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:08.779
 you can also this one on the run his wife 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.639
 m 

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:18.799
 May 10, 2010 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.969
 sign that she is with three years 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:23.969
 she still has 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.520
 and for that monsterrat his five senses the judokas to feel the vibrations in 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.789
 launching in innovations not been linear motors health in the 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.479
 machine 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.610
 what to say more this product being on the shop at 59 94 it is available 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.389
