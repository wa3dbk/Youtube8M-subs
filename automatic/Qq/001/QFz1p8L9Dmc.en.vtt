00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.520 
happens we're going to try switching out
shooters<00:02:00.790> I<00:02:00.970> guess<00:02:01.180> and<00:02:01.479> maybe<00:02:02.140> try<00:02:02.350> some

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
shooters I guess and maybe try some

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.930 
shooters I guess and maybe try some
different<00:02:02.619> ammo<00:02:02.979> I<00:02:03.009> have<00:02:03.100> a<00:02:03.160> feeling<00:02:03.580> it<00:02:03.700> may

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
different ammo I have a feeling it may

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.139 
different ammo I have a feeling it may
be<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.330> animal<00:02:04.710> turns<00:02:05.710> out<00:02:05.950> take<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.729> couple<00:02:07.000> of

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
be the animal turns out take a couple of

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.630 
be the animal turns out take a couple of
shots<00:02:07.300> and<00:02:07.720> just<00:02:07.750> like<00:02:08.380> Colton<00:02:08.770> shooting<00:02:09.100> one

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
shots and just like Colton shooting one

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.060 
shots and just like Colton shooting one
ty<00:02:09.820> ones<00:02:10.270> low<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:10.810> they're<00:02:10.929> far<00:02:11.410> apart<00:02:11.800> so<00:02:11.860> I

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
ty ones low and they're far apart so I

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.920 
ty ones low and they're far apart so I
know<00:02:12.130> there's<00:02:12.880> a<00:02:12.970> problem<00:02:13.270> but<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.570> can't<00:02:13.810> be

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
know there's a problem but it can't be

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.960 
know there's a problem but it can't be
the<00:02:14.050> scope<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.830> can't<00:02:15.070> be<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.340> gun<00:02:15.489> so<00:02:15.760> there's

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
the scope it can't be the gun so there's

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.670 
the scope it can't be the gun so there's
only<00:02:16.090> one<00:02:16.330> other<00:02:16.750> thing<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:17.170> can<00:02:17.290> be

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
only one other thing it can be

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.430 
only one other thing it can be
it's<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.850> ammo<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.910> need<00:02:22.060> change<00:02:22.300> ammo<00:02:22.570> go

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
it's the ammo you need change ammo go

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.750 
it's the ammo you need change ammo go
ahead<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.739> change<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.070> ammo<00:02:24.310> out<00:02:24.489> that's

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
ahead and change the ammo out that's

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:42.430 
ahead and change the ammo out that's
what<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.000> is

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.650 

not<00:02:42.830> uncommon<00:02:43.160> for<00:02:43.400> us<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.610> see<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:43.970> gun<00:02:44.270> that

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.470 
not uncommon for us to see a gun that
just<00:02:45.650> doesn't<00:02:45.980> like<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.370> bullets<00:02:46.820> that<00:02:46.910> we're

simple<00:03:12.950> simple<00:03:13.610> but<00:03:13.730> we<00:03:13.820> had<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.060> isolate<00:03:14.480> it

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
simple simple but we had to isolate it

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.390 
simple simple but we had to isolate it
down<00:03:14.780> first<00:03:15.050> off<00:03:15.260> I<00:03:15.500> saved<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.070> down<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.280> make

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
down first off I saved it down to make

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.500 
down first off I saved it down to make
sure<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:16.640> equipment<00:03:17.090> was<00:03:17.180> put<00:03:17.390> together

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
sure the equipment was put together

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.110 
sure the equipment was put together
right<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.200> it<00:03:18.320> was<00:03:18.500> make<00:03:19.310> sure<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.880> form

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
right and it was make sure that the form

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.600 
right and it was make sure that the form
was<00:03:20.330> right<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:20.870> was<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.530> when<00:03:22.010> everything

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
was right and it was and when everything

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.310 
was right and it was and when everything
else<00:03:22.760> isn't<00:03:22.970> working<00:03:23.090> look<00:03:24.080> at<00:03:24.200> the

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
else isn't working look at the

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.930 
else isn't working look at the
ammunition<00:03:24.530> I<00:03:24.950> think<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.400> everybody<00:03:25.790> can

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
ammunition I think that everybody can

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.460 
ammunition I think that everybody can
learn<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.090> lesson<00:03:26.300> from<00:03:26.570> that<00:03:26.630> if<00:03:27.020> you've<00:03:27.290> got

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
learn a lesson from that if you've got

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.260 
learn a lesson from that if you've got
everything<00:03:27.980> right<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.700> you're<00:03:28.910> still<00:03:29.240> not

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
everything right and you're still not

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.970 
everything right and you're still not
shooting<00:03:29.720> right<00:03:29.930> odds<00:03:30.200> are<00:03:30.560> you<00:03:30.740> need<00:03:30.890> to

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
shooting right odds are you need to

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.750 
shooting right odds are you need to
change<00:03:31.160> your<00:03:31.340> ammunition<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.270> try<00:03:32.540> that
