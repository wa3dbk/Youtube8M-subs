tannin on the backend and some vanilla a
little<00:02:15.960> bit<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.350> caramel<00:02:16.740> bourbon<00:02:17.370> notes

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
little bit of that caramel bourbon notes

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.080 
little bit of that caramel bourbon notes
to<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.140> it's<00:02:19.350> it's<00:02:19.890> pretty<00:02:20.370> complex<00:02:20.790> right

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
to it so it's it's pretty complex right

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.090 
to it so it's it's pretty complex right
away<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:24.450> nuances<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.380> think<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.890> year

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
away and the nuances I think this year

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.910 
away and the nuances I think this year
are<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.490> little<00:02:26.880> more<00:02:27.060> barrel-aging<00:02:27.720> plus<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
are a little more barrel-aging plus the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.550 
are a little more barrel-aging plus the
I<00:02:29.280> think<00:02:29.490> it<00:02:29.550> was<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:30.630> black<00:02:30.840> currants<00:02:31.380> in

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
I think it was the black currants in

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.480 
I think it was the black currants in
there<00:02:31.800> as<00:02:31.980> well<00:02:32.750> adding<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.710> Tartar

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
there as well adding a like a Tartar

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.760 
there as well adding a like a Tartar
dark<00:02:36.300> fruit<00:02:36.630> character<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.260> there<00:02:37.440> as<00:02:37.560> well

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
dark fruit character in there as well

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.100 
dark fruit character in there as well
and<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:39.000> kind<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.270> picked<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.600> up<00:02:39.660> towards

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
and you kind of picked that up towards

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.510 
and you kind of picked that up towards
the<00:02:40.200> end<00:02:40.380> actually<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.800> more<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.010> drink<00:02:41.220> more

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.250 
the end actually the more I drink more
of<00:02:41.580> those<00:02:41.760> those<00:02:42.090> tart<00:02:42.510> currants<00:02:42.900> are<00:02:42.959> coming
