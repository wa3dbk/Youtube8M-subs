00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.790
 terna have our beautiful 2015 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.220
 planet even if it is put to the test 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.860
 our continued obsession 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.080
 wanting to ruin everything that is beautiful 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:22.130
 still holding up showing an image of himself 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:25.190
 of blue planet that still makes us today 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.810
 feel good just looking at it but also the 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.400
 our beautiful blue planet has risked 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.980
 to be sent in value to 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.800
 a human invention that turned the world 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.370
 as we know it from blue in 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.260
 red and even managed to dub 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.170
 the image of it for wanting to restore a 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.100
 three-dimensional appearance creating cases of 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.230
 strong headaches throughout dr 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.420
 but alas, neither was the mature yet 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.000
 time for certain inventions and three 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.149
 technologies so that for our luck 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.460
 it takes little to get everything back to the 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.510
 normality 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.820
 this is the story of the first 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.649
 embodiment of 3d in the field 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.899
 gaming 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.899
 thanks over time initials 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.450
 we're fine 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.450
 I understand the man 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:46.360
 we are often in 1995 and nintendo 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.650
 undisputed precursor for what 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.240
 regards innovation in the field 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.540
 videoludico is working on a project 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.520
 called vr 32 based on vision 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.520
 stereoscopic images those that 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.590
 today we all know how to 3d 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.630
 the project comes from the skilled hands of 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.030
 yokoi gombe already game and creator 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.229
 watch and the leader of the portable game 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.450
 game boy 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.610
 everything is born transported by the wave of 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.950
 success of the allman movie 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.959
 tagliaerbe where one was shown 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.780
 virtual reality that aroused a lot 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.090
 so nintendo interest going against 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.130
 to the will of the same who then decided to 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.180
 commercialize the vuelle 32 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.340
 renamed in virtual boy already in 1995 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.180
 and test the market for this new one 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.430
 technology 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.959
 the same okay convinced of the fact that 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.150
 it was not yet the right time for 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.580
 offer to an audience according to him 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.670
 still unripe and immature for these 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.739
 kinds of technological innovations one 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.900
 machine like or virtual boy left the 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.209
 nintendo going to the band and where 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.600
 later developed the bandai wonders 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.110
 on the 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.880
 but this is another story the console 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.010
 use glasses containing the 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.100
 complex system of oscillating mirrors 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.010
 lenses and LEDs to project into the eyes 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.760
 users three-dimensional images 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.340
 monochrome video games 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.120
 this system consisted of a single one 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.540
 line of 224 LEDs that made it scroll 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.680
 horizontally the frames 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.200
 synchronized with the oscillations of the 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.680
 mirror to project to the eyes 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.900
 complete and stereoscopic images said 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.130
 so make a system believe 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.580
 futuristic then that actually is 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.880
 was 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.710
 but with some very significant flaws and 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.570
 starting the console was capable of 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.320
 generate only color images 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.390
 Red and black 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.820
 in contrast with the 16 heart console 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.230
 bits that were already on the market that 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.970
 they managed to get scenario 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.550
 very colorful and visually situation 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.050
 pleasant and appealing 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.610
 unfortunately the console was penalized 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.010
 a lot also because of the developers 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.750
 of the games that they didn't fully exploit 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.180
 the stereoscopic capabilities of the 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.160
 machine and then went to engrave then 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.740
 negatively on public feedback 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.930
 that the park could also flow into it 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.660
 games was very limited indeed there 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.750
 there were only 22 titles among which 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.680
 some titles of titles from nes snes 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.220
 and only two mario killer applications 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.180
 tennis and mario clash and they didn't have any 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.250
 a great success 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.130
 genius blow was that of 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.109
 advertise it as a portable console but 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.810
 as for portability just not 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.750
 it had nothing and a touch of class 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.090
 final on the package was indicated that 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.640
 prolonged use could cause sense of 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:32.500
 discomfort and nausea seizures e 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.580
 even most visual disturbances 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.710
 these dangers were enough 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.720
 unlikely and bound to use 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.180
 extremely excessive of the appliance 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.400
 however the discomfort actually felt 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.310
 in players after about an hour of play 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.169
 it could be worrying discouraging 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.450
 any buyers of the console in 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.750
 particular parents worried about 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:55.450
 their children's health 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.340
 marketed in 1995 it was abandoned 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:01.300
 a year later with poor results of 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.910
 sales about 770 thousand copies were 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.640
 then the exit of thirty is canceled 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.090
 upcoming titles and the 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.820
 marketing of several 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.430
 peripherals like the link cable to join 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.190
 more consoles in multiplayer games 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.290
 what else to say about virtual boy well pompei 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.030
 or he had told nintendo that he was 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.160
 still early and seen that this 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.770
 technology has since been taken up many 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.260
 years later with the launch of the 3ds interior 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.050
 perhaps they had to listen to him 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.970
