00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
probably april time i think it was and

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.799 
probably april time i think it was and
I've<00:00:11.849> got<00:00:11.880> my<00:00:12.059> hand<00:00:12.300> over<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.630> microphone

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
this time so hopefully it won't sound

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.450 
this time so hopefully it won't sound
like<00:00:14.610> I'm<00:00:14.790> in<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> gale<00:00:15.350> and<00:00:16.350> not<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> bare<00:00:17.190> ground

and<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.530> lot<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.710> bloom<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.219> they<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.430> don't

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
and a lot of bloom but they just don't

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.160 
and a lot of bloom but they just don't
seem<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> be<00:00:45.059> set<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.390> many<00:00:45.570> beans<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.020> think

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
seem to be set in many beans I think

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.420 
seem to be set in many beans I think
it's<00:00:46.289> because<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.829> dry<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
it's because it's so dry and the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.889 
it's because it's so dry and the
blossoms<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:47.820> sector<00:00:48.239> then<00:00:48.360> we've<00:00:48.600> had<00:00:48.629> a

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
blossoms not sector then we've had a

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.049 
blossoms not sector then we've had a
problem<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.440> water<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:50.969> can

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
problem with the water here so we can

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.400 
problem with the water here so we can
only<00:00:51.180> walked<00:00:51.420> by<00:00:51.600> hand<00:00:51.840> now<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.079> can't<00:00:52.260> use<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
only walked by hand now we can't use the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.590 
only walked by hand now we can't use the
hose<00:00:52.680> pipe<00:00:52.949> because<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.430> pipe<00:00:54.180> systems

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
hose pipe because the pipe systems

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.880 
hose pipe because the pipe systems
leaking<00:00:55.020> somewhere<00:00:55.199> under<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.500> ground<00:00:55.649> so

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
leaking somewhere under the ground so

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.260 
leaking somewhere under the ground so
I've<00:00:56.010> been<00:00:56.160> able<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.370> spray<00:00:56.730> them<00:00:57.000> very<00:00:57.210> well

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
I've been able to spray them very well

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.630 
I've been able to spray them very well
to<00:00:57.539> make<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> bloom<00:00:57.960> set<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.469> there's

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
to make the bloom set that there's

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.709 
to make the bloom set that there's
possibly<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.789> problem<00:01:00.090> or<00:01:00.239> possibly<00:01:00.539> it's

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
possibly the problem or possibly it's

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:01.910 
possibly the problem or possibly it's
just<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:00.989> variety<00:01:01.410> doesn't<00:01:01.649> like<00:01:01.739> hot

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
just this variety doesn't like hot

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.030 
just this variety doesn't like hot
weather<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:03.500> wandering<00:01:04.500> through<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> gap

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
weather and wandering through the gap

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.020 
weather and wandering through the gap
here<00:01:05.299> you<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.450> see<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.340> pumpkin<00:01:08.340> patch<00:01:08.520> is

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
here you can see the pumpkin patch is

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.750 
here you can see the pumpkin patch is
getting<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> little<00:01:09.420> bit<00:01:09.600> out<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.720> hand<00:01:10.760> some

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
getting a little bit out of hand some

half<00:01:45.750> times<00:01:45.840> way<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.320> get<00:01:46.470> about<00:01:46.590> half<00:01:46.829> as<00:01:46.950> big

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040

coming<00:01:52.740> along<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.040> made<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> bit<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.520> stupid

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
coming along I made a bit of a stupid

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.399 
coming along I made a bit of a stupid
mistake<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.390> didn't<00:01:54.750> walk<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.079> them<00:01:55.200> enough

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
mistake I didn't walk to them enough

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.990 
mistake I didn't walk to them enough
early<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:55.860> because<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.520> don't<00:01:56.759> know<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.850> suppose

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
early on because I don't know I suppose

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.340 
early on because I don't know I suppose
I<00:01:57.329> thought<00:01:57.479> they<00:01:57.600> were<00:01:57.659> like<00:01:57.840> shrubs<00:01:58.200> or

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
I thought they were like shrubs or

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.889 
I thought they were like shrubs or
bushes<00:01:58.409> or<00:01:58.829> something<00:01:59.159> which<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.899> stupid

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
bushes or something which is the stupid

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.929 
bushes or something which is the stupid
but<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.320> think<00:02:01.740> Matt's<00:02:01.920> probably<00:02:02.250> one<00:02:02.430> as<00:02:02.729> far

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
but I think Matt's probably one as far

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:03.200 
but I think Matt's probably one as far
as

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
as

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.930 
as
