in college oudy ghosts now the first

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.770 
in college oudy ghosts now the first
thing<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.759> I'm<00:00:14.910> gonna<00:00:15.000> be<00:00:15.150> demonstrating<00:00:15.690> to

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
thing that I'm gonna be demonstrating to

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.790 
thing that I'm gonna be demonstrating to
you<00:00:15.870> guys<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.379> middle<00:00:16.650> range

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
you guys is the middle range

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.590 
you guys is the middle range
quickscoping<00:00:17.550> now<00:00:17.789> middle<00:00:18.449> range

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
quickscoping now middle range

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.510 
quickscoping now middle range
quickscoping<00:00:19.230> it's<00:00:19.410> decent<00:00:19.980> it's<00:00:20.130> definitely

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
quickscoping it's decent it's definitely

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.370 
quickscoping it's decent it's definitely
not<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.699> best<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.240> know<00:00:21.270> it's<00:00:21.449> not<00:00:21.630> as<00:00:21.869> good

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
not the best you know it's not as good

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.990 
not the best you know it's not as good
as<00:00:22.439> long<00:00:22.769> range<00:00:23.100> but<00:00:23.279> it's<00:00:23.430> definitely<00:00:23.580> not<00:00:23.789> to

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
as long range but it's definitely not to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.310 
as long range but it's definitely not to
the<00:00:24.029> point<00:00:24.210> where<00:00:24.300> short<00:00:24.630> range<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.109> bad

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
the point where short range is that bad

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.019 
the point where short range is that bad
like<00:00:25.529> short<00:00:25.859> range<00:00:26.039> I'm<00:00:26.189> also<00:00:26.310> demonstrating

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
like short range I'm also demonstrating

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.759 
like short range I'm also demonstrating
middle<00:00:27.510> range<00:00:27.689> decently<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.320> cure<00:00:28.590> can

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
middle range decently a cure can

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.290 
middle range decently a cure can
sometimes<00:00:29.250> get<00:00:29.400> knife<00:00:29.580> or<00:00:29.760> killed<00:00:29.939> by<00:00:30.060> dogs

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
sometimes get knife or killed by dogs

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.330 
sometimes get knife or killed by dogs
hard<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.019> aim<00:00:31.050> sometimes<00:00:31.619> too<00:00:31.890> but<00:00:31.920> short

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
hard to aim sometimes too but short

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.490 
hard to aim sometimes too but short
range<00:00:32.520> right<00:00:32.759> here<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.090> impossible<00:00:34.050> no

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
range right here it is impossible no

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.080 
range right here it is impossible no
scopes<00:00:34.800> are<00:00:34.980> completely<00:00:35.460> useless<00:00:35.640> no

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
scopes are completely useless no

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.790 
scopes are completely useless no
crosshairs<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.809> snipers<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:37.440> no<00:00:37.530> scopes

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
crosshairs on snipers for no scopes

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.290 
crosshairs on snipers for no scopes
really<00:00:38.370> hard<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.640> follow<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.969> guy<00:00:39.090> through

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
really hard to follow the guy through

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.389 
really hard to follow the guy through
the<00:00:39.329> scope<00:00:39.660> too<00:00:39.960> but<00:00:40.230> long<00:00:40.469> range<00:00:40.800> right<00:00:41.040> here

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
the scope too but long range right here

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.920 
the scope too but long range right here
which<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.910> guys<00:00:42.120> hopefully<00:00:42.420> are<00:00:42.660> watching

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
which you guys hopefully are watching

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.569 
which you guys hopefully are watching
the<00:00:43.020> gameplay<00:00:43.350> not<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.710> listening<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.280> am

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
the gameplay not just listening to I am

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.549 
the gameplay not just listening to I am
demonstrating<00:00:45.239> all<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.390> them<00:00:45.629> long<00:00:46.110> range<00:00:46.350> is

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
demonstrating all of them long range is

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.080 
demonstrating all of them long range is
very<00:00:46.890> very<00:00:47.160> accurate<00:00:47.430> you'll<00:00:47.760> see<00:00:47.910> some

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
very very accurate you'll see some

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.060 
very very accurate you'll see some
gameplay<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> little<00:00:48.750> bit<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.620> video<00:00:49.800> so

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
gameplay a little bit on in the video so

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.319 
gameplay a little bit on in the video so
make<00:00:50.190> sure<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.340> stay<00:00:50.550> for<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.789> whole<00:00:50.820> time<00:00:51.120> but

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
make sure to stay for the whole time but

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.510 
make sure to stay for the whole time but
it's<00:00:51.449> very<00:00:51.660> accurate<00:00:51.930> easy<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.980> take<00:00:53.190> down

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
it's very accurate easy to take down

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.279 
it's very accurate easy to take down
gives<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> really<00:00:54.360> good<00:00:54.390> advantage<00:00:54.780> can't

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
gives you a really good advantage can't

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.840 
gives you a really good advantage can't
get<00:00:55.440> after<00:00:55.620> killed<00:00:55.980> by<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> guard<00:00:56.430> dog<00:00:56.610> unless

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
get after killed by a guard dog unless

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.189 
get after killed by a guard dog unless
you're<00:00:57.090> running<00:00:57.270> at<00:00:57.600> them<00:00:57.899> which<00:00:58.079> is

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
you're running at them which is

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.139 
you're running at them which is
definitely<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.829> bad<00:00:59.309> decision<00:00:59.640> but<00:00:59.879> right<00:01:00.030> now

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
definitely a bad decision but right now

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.310 
definitely a bad decision but right now
you<00:01:00.210> guys<00:01:00.359> are<00:01:00.420> gonna<00:01:00.570> see<00:01:00.780> some<00:01:00.809> combat

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
you guys are gonna see some combat

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.080 
you guys are gonna see some combat
training<00:01:01.620> gameplay<00:01:02.129> also<00:01:02.579> I'm<00:01:02.820> gonna<00:01:02.969> go

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
training gameplay also I'm gonna go

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.280 
training gameplay also I'm gonna go
through<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.359> show<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.600> guys<00:01:03.629> where<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.019> hit

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
through and show you guys where I hit

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.600 
through and show you guys where I hit
them<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.530> wasn't<00:01:04.680> trying<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:04.979> hit<00:01:05.100> completely

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
them I wasn't trying to hit completely

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.580 
them I wasn't trying to hit completely
in<00:01:05.700> one<00:01:05.939> spot<00:01:06.210> every<00:01:06.540> time<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.380> trying<00:01:07.530> to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
in one spot every time I was trying to

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.570 
in one spot every time I was trying to
show<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.830> guys<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.310> were<00:01:08.369> paying

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
show you guys if you were paying

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.370 
show you guys if you were paying
attention<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:09.060> where<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.240> shot<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.200> did

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
attention to where I shot that it did

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.630 
attention to where I shot that it did
most<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> time<00:01:11.010> hit<00:01:11.189> there<00:01:11.340> if<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.490> was<00:01:11.610> a

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
most of the time hit there if I was a

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.100 
most of the time hit there if I was a
long-range<00:01:12.030> most<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.600> time<00:01:12.780> at<00:01:12.930> middle

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
long-range most of the time at middle

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.840 
long-range most of the time at middle
range<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:13.890> short<00:01:14.130> range<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.490> wasn't

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
range and it's short range it wasn't

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.820 
range and it's short range it wasn't
really<00:01:15.000> accurate<00:01:15.119> at<00:01:15.479> all<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.930> definitely<00:01:16.680> go

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
really accurate at all so definitely go

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.050 
really accurate at all so definitely go
with<00:01:16.920> more<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.280> middle<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.610> long<00:01:17.790> range

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
with more of the middle the long range

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.760 
with more of the middle the long range
know<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.330> guess<00:01:18.540> short<00:01:18.840> range<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.500> if

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
know I guess short range if you have if

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.280 
know I guess short range if you have if
you<00:01:19.920> most<00:01:20.130> definitely<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.720> USR

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
you most definitely have to but this USR

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
why I chose more of an orangish red camo

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.340 
why I chose more of an orangish red camo
looks<00:02:23.820> really<00:02:24.060> good<00:02:24.210> at<00:02:24.300> this<00:02:24.420> map<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.660> I<00:02:24.960> just

looks really good at this map and I just

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.570 
looks really good at this map and I just
think<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.620> autumn<00:02:25.860> camera<00:02:26.160> looks<00:02:26.340> really

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
think the autumn camera looks really

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.340 
think the autumn camera looks really
good<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:26.970> hopefully<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.750> guys<00:02:27.840> enjoyed<00:02:28.230> this

video<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.650> also<00:02:28.860> would<00:02:29.100> suggest<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.580> guys<00:02:29.670> to

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
video I also would suggest you guys to

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.060 
video I also would suggest you guys to
try<00:02:30.090> out<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.300> armor<00:02:30.630> piercing<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.290> FMJ<00:02:31.830> in

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
try out the armor piercing it is FMJ in

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.010 
try out the armor piercing it is FMJ in
my<00:02:32.430> opinion<00:02:32.820> actually<00:02:33.120> helps<00:02:33.360> quite<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.690> bit<00:02:33.930> it

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
my opinion actually helps quite a bit it

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.230 
my opinion actually helps quite a bit it
does<00:02:34.170> work<00:02:34.350> against<00:02:34.650> infantry<00:02:35.070> so<00:02:35.520> I<00:02:35.820> guess

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
does work against infantry so I guess

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.670 
does work against infantry so I guess
sometimes<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.720> kind<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.930> does<00:02:37.140> actually<00:02:37.350> help

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
sometimes it kind of does actually help

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.590 
sometimes it kind of does actually help
to<00:02:37.800> kill<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.580> enemy<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:38.880> little<00:02:39.120> bit<00:02:39.240> faster

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
to kill the enemy a little bit faster

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.790
