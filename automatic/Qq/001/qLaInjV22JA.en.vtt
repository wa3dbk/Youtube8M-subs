old consoles using the HD PVR 2 but
before<00:01:50.159> we<00:01:50.250> start<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.579> want<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:50.939> remind

because<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:53.130> need<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.460> bypass<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.119> hdmi

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
because we need to bypass the hdmi

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.510 
because we need to bypass the hdmi
output<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.409> HD<00:01:55.770> PVR<00:01:55.799> 2<00:01:56.840> when<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.960> comes<00:01:58.140> to

output of the HD PVR 2 when it comes to

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.429 
output of the HD PVR 2 when it comes to
converting<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.729> composite<00:02:00.600> all<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.350> way

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
converting the composite all the way

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.990 
converting the composite all the way
over<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.710> hdmi<00:02:02.399> there's<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.390> lot<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.570> problems

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000
