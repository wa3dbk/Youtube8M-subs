drives so this is for app data so then

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.060 
drives so this is for app data so then
when<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.079> see<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.320> we're<00:01:01.469> guns<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:01.859> they

here is the rendered videos that I have

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.050 
here is the rendered videos that I have
made<00:01:18.689> I've<00:01:18.869> only<00:01:19.020> made<00:01:19.200> four<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.710> far<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.939> as

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
you can see this is literally just war

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.249 
you can see this is literally just war
straight<00:01:23.400> from<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:26.000> show<00:01:27.000> from<00:01:27.210> their<00:01:27.420> editor

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
so you know it does it does kind of it

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.130 
so you know it does it does kind of it
makes<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.670> all<00:01:32.820> easier<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:33.990> much

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
makes it all easier you can just so much

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.440 
makes it all easier you can just so much
my<00:01:34.350> ten<00:01:34.590> tricks<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.460> know<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:36.090> cut

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
my ten tricks and you know you can cut

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.109 
my ten tricks and you know you can cut
slices<00:01:36.780> out<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:38.340> one<00:01:38.790> thing<00:01:38.970> it's

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
slices out and like one thing it's

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.420 
slices out and like one thing it's
important<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.570> me<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.750> timing<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.439> after<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.340> did

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
important to me is timing so after I did

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.100 
important to me is timing so after I did
a<00:01:41.549> couple<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> timing<00:01:42.509> was<00:01:42.630> bad<00:01:42.810> because

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
a couple in the timing was bad because

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.260 
a couple in the timing was bad because
you<00:01:43.200> pick<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.470> music<00:01:43.590> off<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.460> or<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.119> way

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
you pick the music off that or this way

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.880 
you pick the music off that or this way
you<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.509> pick<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> music<00:01:46.020> first<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.560> kind<00:01:46.799> of

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
you can pick the music first and kind of

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.429 
you can pick the music first and kind of
build<00:01:47.100> your<00:01:47.630> your<00:01:48.630> clips<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:48.960> stuff<00:01:49.170> around
