00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
at Walmart there are actually little

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.590 
at Walmart there are actually little
kids<00:01:46.320> ones<00:01:46.560> because<00:01:46.860> my<00:01:46.980> head's<00:01:47.160> tiny<00:01:47.400> but<00:01:48.210> I

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
kids ones because my head's tiny but I

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.460 
kids ones because my head's tiny but I
just<00:01:51.600> take<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.050> pull<00:01:52.230> it<00:01:52.320> back<00:01:52.440> like

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
just take it and I pull it back like

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.320 
just take it and I pull it back like
that<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.100> it'll<00:01:53.280> keep<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.640> pretty<00:01:53.910> straight

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
that so it'll keep it pretty straight

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.310 
that so it'll keep it pretty straight
and<00:01:56.240> people<00:01:57.240> will<00:01:57.420> be<00:01:57.570> able<00:01:57.660> to<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.080> top

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and people will be able to see the top

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.150 
and people will be able to see the top
so<00:01:59.480> it's<00:02:00.480> really<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.870> only<00:02:01.110> important<00:02:01.830> part<00:02:02.010> I

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
so it's really the only important part I

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.450 
so it's really the only important part I
guess<00:02:02.370> so<00:02:03.000> then<00:02:03.900> I<00:02:03.930> take<00:02:04.140> my<00:02:04.440> bandana<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.280> have

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.420 
and then I just take it bring it up
around<00:02:22.730> try<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:23.850> make<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.000> as<00:02:24.150> like<00:02:25.020> as

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
around try and make it as like as

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.730 
around try and make it as like as
symmetrical<00:02:26.430> as<00:02:26.550> possible<00:02:27.140> squeeze<00:02:28.140> pretty

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
symmetrical as possible squeeze pretty

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.540 
symmetrical as possible squeeze pretty
damn<00:02:29.010> tight<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:30.350> then<00:02:31.350> this<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.370> point

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
damn tight and then this is the point

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.630 
damn tight and then this is the point
where<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.730> take<00:02:32.850> this<00:02:33.030> out<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:34.160> squeeze<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.190> a

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
where I take this out and squeeze it a

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.340 
where I take this out and squeeze it a
little<00:02:36.570> bit<00:02:36.900> tighter<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:38.000> then<00:02:39.320> we've<00:02:40.320> got

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
little bit tighter and then we've got

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:51.600 
little bit tighter and then we've got
this<00:02:40.620> going<00:02:40.830> on

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.290 

so<00:02:52.180> you<00:02:52.240> see<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.570> take<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:52.960> and<00:02:53.650> bring<00:02:54.040> it<00:02:54.160> up

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
so you see you take that and bring it up

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.710 
so you see you take that and bring it up
and<00:02:55.350> then<00:02:56.350> tuck<00:02:56.950> in<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.910> hair<00:02:58.180> thats<00:02:58.510> like
