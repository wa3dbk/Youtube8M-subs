00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.740
 good afternoon everyone i want 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:14.420
 to cook 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:14.420
 all known dish of pancakes here I am 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:27.710
 peeled carrots on a grater 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.790
 added one egg there 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.940
 cleaned the same onion rubbed on 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:52.980
 terochku 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:56.210
 Iâ€™ll add two spoons of flour 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.210
 stir well 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.450
 when 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.610
 of course you can grate the potatoes on 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.790
 combine or different there maybe 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.460
 some technical devices 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.140
 but it's easier for me and grate it 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.710
 we are there like one aunt than later 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.340
 to worry 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:29.050
 the whole combine is when preparing 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:35.600
 small quantities 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:37.150
 Here I have here 5 medium potatoes 1 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.690
 bulb 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:47.440
 salt pepper and one egg course on 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:58.360
 a large family will not be enough here 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:02:03.250
 but since there is one scene that is full 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.250
 knead well enough 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.500
 and start at this time I already 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.599
 warmed up 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.599
 in the pan sunflower oil and 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:24.700
 put our pancakes on the pan 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.120
 will now hiss I will warn 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.120
 noisy 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.480
 but you can twist a very big 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.989
 I already said preheated 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:54.900
 pan and we have a teaspoon 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.900
 recruit weak 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.310
 Well, how can you like more smaller 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:16.470
 the pan was very hot and for now 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:16.470
 I impose already reddened 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.930
 i fry 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.020
 check now 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:45.799
 you can fry big not i love 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.799
 to not be so yellow 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.180
 but when 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:56.750
 more they fry more crispy 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.750
 so like 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.040
 Of course this is not very critical 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:18.359
 say potato carbohydrates and on 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:29.590
 fried with sunflower oil 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:31.600
 but sometimes you can afford it 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:37.750
 to cook 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:39.790
 I already have all the people on pancakes when 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.500
 gonna whole family thats come from 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:50.520
 also scenes husband of course this portion 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.520
 very little needs to be done 3 times more 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:05:00.640
 when I come to the center is rubbed 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:03.730
 rubs the potato on draniki son because 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.920
 he clears a lot and in a huge not in 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.800
 huge huge claims nothing by this in 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.810
 huge size of large such sizes 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:19.560
 but more of course a bowl points for three 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:19.560
 rubbed and here and so 2 3 potatoes and 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.199
 I can imagine 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.169
 will allow to rub so look 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:40.099
 maybe a little more you can fry 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.099
 but basically that's a principle 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:56.950
 when browned I impose on 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:20.340
 napkin to go off the excess fat served on 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:23.669
 draniki exactly with us so smith all 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:29.990

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:41.819
