00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.369 
stats where I think the f2000 is best
suited<00:00:43.739> attachment<00:00:44.670> recommendations<00:00:45.540> recall

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.719 
with the f2000 for a good week and I
just<00:00:52.440> want<00:00:52.589> to<00:00:52.620> start<00:00:52.830> off<00:00:52.920> by<00:00:52.979> saying<00:00:53.159> it's

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
just want to start off by saying it's

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.229 
just want to start off by saying it's
great<00:00:54.030> very<00:00:54.350> solid<00:00:55.350> assault<00:00:55.830> rifle<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:56.610> it's

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
great very solid assault rifle but it's

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.329 
great very solid assault rifle but it's
one<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.510> those<00:00:57.570> guns<00:00:57.900> I<00:00:58.140> don't<00:00:58.500> really<00:00:58.710> see<00:00:58.860> it

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
one of those guns I don't really see it

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.750 
one of those guns I don't really see it
replacing<00:01:00.089> any<00:01:00.390> other<00:01:00.600> salt<00:01:00.960> rifle<00:01:01.610> in<00:01:02.610> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
replacing any other salt rifle in a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.969 
replacing any other salt rifle in a
competitive<00:01:03.239> match<00:01:03.659> but<00:01:04.170> I'll<00:01:04.409> get<00:01:04.650> more<00:01:04.920> into

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
competitive match but I'll get more into

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.160 
competitive match but I'll get more into
that<00:01:05.280> later<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.090> let's<00:01:06.299> get<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.630> stats<00:01:06.900> out

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that later on so let's get the stats out

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.039 
that later on so let's get the stats out
the<00:01:07.350> way<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:08.040> has<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> fire<00:01:08.580> rate<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.940> 850<00:01:09.780> so

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the way it has a fire rate of 850 so

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.170 
the way it has a fire rate of 850 so
it's<00:01:10.320> fairly<00:01:10.560> decent<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.340> close<00:01:11.640> quarters

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
it's fairly decent in close quarters

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.719 
it's fairly decent in close quarters
combat<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:13.140> holds<00:01:13.380> 30<00:01:13.710> rounds<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.189> mag<00:01:14.460> and

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
combat it holds 30 rounds in the mag and

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.899 
combat it holds 30 rounds in the mag and
one<00:01:15.119> chambered<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.810> has<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.439> typical<00:01:16.909> 25-18

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
one chambered and has it typical 25-18

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.060 
one chambered and has it typical 25-18
assault<00:01:18.299> rifle<00:01:18.720> damage<00:01:19.049> model<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.950> a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
assault rifle damage model it's a

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.130 
assault rifle damage model it's a
bullpup<00:01:20.430> design<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.150> has<00:01:21.240> really<00:01:21.630> good<00:01:21.930> hip

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
bullpup design so it has really good hip

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.959 
bullpup design so it has really good hip
fire<00:01:22.439> which<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:22.979> definitely<00:01:23.579> one<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.759> its

certain extent but I'll get more into

that<00:02:00.869> later<00:02:01.020> on<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.979> has<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.219> very<00:02:02.490> generous

muzzle<00:02:03.569> velocity<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.079> 600<00:02:04.859> which<00:02:05.039> I<00:02:05.159> would<00:02:05.340> say

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
muzzle velocity of 600 which I would say

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.330 
muzzle velocity of 600 which I would say
is<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.789> the<00:02:05.880> higher<00:02:06.090> end<00:02:06.389> of<00:02:06.840> things<00:02:07.170> now<00:02:08.160> as

is on the higher end of things now as

is on the higher end of things now as

for where I think the f2000 is best

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.440 
for where I think the f2000 is best
suited<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.679> well<00:02:11.160> assuming<00:02:12.000> you're

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
final opinion I was really hoping the

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.100 
final opinion I was really hoping the
f2000<00:03:57.010> would<00:03:57.130> be<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.310> very<00:03:57.670> competitive<00:03:58.480> weapon

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
f2000 would be a very competitive weapon

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.830 
f2000 would be a very competitive weapon
and<00:03:59.320> sure<00:03:59.560> it<00:03:59.860> does<00:04:00.280> have<00:04:00.519> potential<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:01.360> be<00:04:01.570> if

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
and sure it does have potential to be if

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.500 
and sure it does have potential to be if
you're<00:04:02.079> very<00:04:02.530> confident<00:04:03.190> with<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:03.640> and<00:04:03.880> timing

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
you're very confident with it and timing

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.449 
you're very confident with it and timing
your<00:04:04.690> reloads<00:04:05.140> well<00:04:05.410> and<00:04:05.680> if<00:04:05.920> that's<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.280> case

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
your reloads well and if that's the case

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.210 
your reloads well and if that's the case
then<00:04:06.519> you're<00:04:06.940> going<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.299> absolutely<00:04:08.220> shred

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
particular weapon but anyway my final

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.139 
particular weapon but anyway my final
result<00:04:51.389> I<00:04:51.899> give<00:04:52.469> you<00:04:52.619> up<00:04:52.649> two<00:04:52.889> thousand<00:04:53.550> seven

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:54.149 
result I give you up two thousand seven

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:56.119 
result I give you up two thousand seven
out<00:04:54.539> of<00:04:54.569> ten<00:04:54.899> which<00:04:55.499> i<00:04:55.649> think<00:04:55.710> is<00:04:55.949> a<00:04:56.009> very

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:56.129 
out of ten which i think is a very

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.760 
out of ten which i think is a very
generous<00:04:56.939> score<00:04:57.270> but<00:04:57.869> i<00:04:58.110> would<00:04:58.229> go<00:04:58.740> with

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
generous score but i would go with

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.730 
generous score but i would go with
something<00:04:59.339> else<00:05:00.029> over<00:05:00.569> it<00:05:00.629> if<00:05:01.139> the<00:05:01.349> relay

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
something else over it if the relay

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.739 
something else over it if the relay
times<00:05:02.069> were<00:05:02.339> a<00:05:02.369> little<00:05:02.639> bit<00:05:02.879> less<00:05:03.089> i<00:05:03.389> would

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:03.749 
times were a little bit less i would

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:05.719 
times were a little bit less i would
probably<00:05:03.990> recommend<00:05:04.559> this<00:05:04.889> as<00:05:04.949> a<00:05:05.159> competitive

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
probably recommend this as a competitive

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.299 
probably recommend this as a competitive
weapon<00:05:06.119> but<00:05:06.449> it<00:05:06.659> just<00:05:06.899> doesn't<00:05:07.559> quite<00:05:08.009> make<00:05:08.249> it

00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:08.309 
weapon but it just doesn't quite make it

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:10.670 
weapon but it just doesn't quite make it
anyway<00:05:09.119> like<00:05:09.330> I<00:05:09.449> said<00:05:09.479> before<00:05:09.779> if<00:05:10.289> you<00:05:10.379> want<00:05:10.559> to
