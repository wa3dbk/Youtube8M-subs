00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.700
 "The main thing about the tanks. means of communication " 

00:00:08.511 --> 00:00:11.622
 In Russian, the word "gibberish" (literally - "no connection") is explained as follows: 

00:00:11.622 --> 00:00:13.888
 "The fact that he could not, the unity, 

00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:16.888
 fetal sequence sense. " 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.600
 These words seemed to indicate, 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.600
 how important it is for any kind of troops have a connection, 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.133
 including - for the armored forces. 

00:00:26.422 --> 00:00:29.380
 Communication makes the separate parts and subsections 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.622
 into a single force, 

00:00:30.622 --> 00:00:33.088
 aimed at fulfilling a combat mission, 

00:00:33.088 --> 00:00:37.822
 and the crew of each tank forces to act as a single organism. 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.980
 To provide a normal battle tank interaction - 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.380
 tanks for early this was no easy task: 

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:48.177
 noise in the car to turn off the human voice, 

00:00:48.177 --> 00:00:51.911
 and if some of the tankers are separate from the other, 

00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:54.580
 the dokrichatsya them impossible. 

00:00:54.844 --> 00:00:56.755
 We had to use gestures, 

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:59.180
 touch and even strokes. 

00:00:59.333 --> 00:00:59.980
 for example, 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.711
 when the commander of the "thirty-four" showed naboytsu fist 

00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:05.533
 it is necessary to fill an armor-piercing shell 

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.600
 but if a hand with fingers spread - 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.580
 high-explosive. 

00:01:10.288 --> 00:01:14.980
 Kick to the left or right shoulder of the driver set the direction of rotation of the tank. 

00:01:15.177 --> 00:01:16.044
 And so on. 

00:01:16.755 --> 00:01:20.577
 Another way to transmit orders were light signals - 

00:01:20.577 --> 00:01:23.466
 lights that were lit in the driver, 

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.822
 gunner and tank driver, who was sitting in the tower. 

00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:28.311
 Thus, of course, it is possible to convey to the recipient 

00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:30.244
 Only the most simple message, 

00:01:30.244 --> 00:01:31.755
 but it's at least something. 

00:01:32.644 --> 00:01:35.688
 In the early tanks voice samples could be transferred 

00:01:35.688 --> 00:01:39.200
 through negotiation pipe as on vehicles. 

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:43.111
 But it was too primitive and very cumbersome system, 

00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:44.980
 which gradually passed into history. 

00:01:45.977 --> 00:01:49.780
 In the thirties, when the tank station, 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.060
 invented and tank intercom - 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.400
 CCI. 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.900
 At its core, it is a phone, 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.300
 subscribers who - all 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.400
 or only the key crew members. 

00:02:01.022 --> 00:02:02.000
 In the second case 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.780
 instructions for those who have not had the CCI, 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.266
 handed gestures. 

00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:08.311
 If you are using the CCI, 

00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:10.822
 tankers hear each other on headphones, 

00:02:10.822 --> 00:02:13.220
 embedded directly into ringing. 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.088
 To transmit voice in a loud noise, 

00:02:16.088 --> 00:02:19.780
 a special device - laryngafon. 

00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:22.180
 It differs from the microphone is 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.980
 the sound removed from the mechanical vibrations of the skin around dyhnitsy (larynx) 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.980
 where men are the vocal cords. 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.780
 On the quality of the sound laryngafon inferior microphone 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.422
 but in noisy environments 

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:40.711
 only he can transmit voice quite clearly. 

00:02:41.088 --> 00:02:44.380
 Therefore laryngafony used on tanks, airplanes, 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.380
 and noisy industrial enterprises today. 

00:02:49.177 --> 00:02:53.288
 It was even more difficult to establish an interaction between the tanks, 

00:02:53.288 --> 00:02:55.400
 with headquarters or other parts. 

00:02:56.177 --> 00:02:58.222
 Walkie-talkies during World War I. 

00:02:58.222 --> 00:03:00.488
 It was too primitive and cumbersome, 

00:03:00.488 --> 00:03:02.488
 to install them on the tanks. 

00:03:02.733 --> 00:03:05.488
 We had to get out in other ways. 

00:03:05.488 --> 00:03:08.088
 For example, to send soldiers messengers 

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:11.620
 or let out of the tank carrier pigeon with a message to headquarters. 

00:03:12.466 --> 00:03:14.777
 On the British tanks, which are known, 

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:18.222
 developed and built under the tutelage of the Admiralty, 

00:03:18.222 --> 00:03:20.311
 We used more and semaphores. 

00:03:20.844 --> 00:03:24.580
 For a long time widely used flag alarm - 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.555
 raised box particular color indicates a specific action. 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.533
 But it is clear that the effectiveness of these methods was very low. 

00:03:34.177 --> 00:03:35.466
 It is enough to imagine 

00:03:35.466 --> 00:03:40.088
 it is difficult in the midst of battle, when there's all smoke and exploding shells, 

00:03:40.088 --> 00:03:43.088
 see the box on the tower tank commander. 

00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:46.955
 Post a tank effective communications become possible, 

00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:49.955
 when there were enough small walkie-talkie, 

00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:53.044
 which could be put into the body, or tower. 

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:56.200
 Walkie-talkies can work on the transmission and reception 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.844
 or receive-only. 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.733
 First radio transmitters 

00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:04.466
 We put only a tank commander subsections 

00:04:04.466 --> 00:04:06.533
 not less than the union or company, 

00:04:06.777 --> 00:04:10.466
 but then they spread to the linear machine. 

00:04:11.066 --> 00:04:13.222
 The troops of a number of European countries 

00:04:13.222 --> 00:04:16.244
 Each sub had a special connection tanks 

00:04:16.444 --> 00:04:19.780
 with two or three different power stations. 

00:04:19.888 --> 00:04:22.866
 In the Soviet Union, the first radio station tank 

00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:25.400
 was short-71-TC 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.400
 established in 1931. 

00:04:28.844 --> 00:04:31.400
 It weighed about 60 kg 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.780
 and in perfect conditions should provide a link between the tanks 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.777
 over the phone at a distance of 15 km while driving 

00:04:38.777 --> 00:04:40.800
 up to 30 km in the parking lot. 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.980
 In addition, the telegraph mode - Morse code - 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.780
 radio signal can reach up to 50 km. 

00:04:50.444 --> 00:04:55.066
 Walkie-talkies at the time for needed large antenna. 

00:04:55.222 --> 00:04:58.266
 Radios tanks 20-30s 

00:04:58.266 --> 00:05:00.755
 We had in it a distinctive look. 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.600
 Here the Soviet T-35 radios. 

00:05:04.933 --> 00:05:07.466
 The design of the tower - an antenna. 

00:05:08.022 --> 00:05:11.100
 Through its appearance it is called: 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.460
 handrail. 

00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:16.555
 The antenna of this kind can be fixed not only on the tower, 

00:05:16.555 --> 00:05:17.380
 but also on the body. 

00:05:18.022 --> 00:05:20.733
 Another type of antenna was shtyravaya - 

00:05:20.733 --> 00:05:23.733
 she looked more familiar to us. 

00:05:23.733 --> 00:05:26.980
 Shtyravaya antenna is not as strong as the handrail, 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.380
 so on the march in the difficult terrain 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.380
 it is often folded in the stowed position. 

00:05:33.044 --> 00:05:34.244
 Currently, radio 

00:05:34.244 --> 00:05:38.022
 set nearly every combat vehicle. 

00:05:38.177 --> 00:05:39.133
 Moreover: 

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:41.066
 In some countries troops 

00:05:41.066 --> 00:05:44.244
 tanks may be combined with each other and with the headquarters 

00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:46.022
 into a single tactical network. 

00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:49.555
 This allows the possibility of on-board computers, 

00:05:49.555 --> 00:05:52.180
 using secure communications channels. 

00:05:52.777 --> 00:05:57.288
 In this regard, the communication system continues to evolve today. 

00:05:57.444 --> 00:05:59.980
 What's next - time will tell.
