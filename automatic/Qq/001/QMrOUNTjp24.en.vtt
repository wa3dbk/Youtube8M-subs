00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.639
 hello after two years of delivery on 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.759
 superb christian helene returns to the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.849
 life after about twenty minutes of 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.250
 gentle warmth in we were running them 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.930
 cylinders that as you know on 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.270
 this machine is an adria this weapon 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.230
 no bernard is an ethical bernard this 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.019
 machine bernard and yews of 35 centimeters 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.390
 about cubic runs at full speed to 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.880
 around how much 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.000
 his entourage he's pretty much I think 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.690
 and between 60 and 80 between 60 and 80 rounds 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.220
 minutes in the water for about 120 to 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.520
 empty but that does not mean big 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.440
 thing 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.640
 so as you can see it's ultra back 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.500
 because now that the cylinders 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.670
 have been purged there is more blow 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.040
 so it is in initial configuration 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.629
 that's what this boat had recovered 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.730
 then a rate or a bridge 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.159
 superior while you did it in 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.899
 version its basic versions see a 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.899
 rates here to shelter people from 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.990
 knowing that this attitude boat of 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.039
 open it there are all these dead is that 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.899
 you want it's not something we see 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.720
 the belts in the room you see I 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.929
 take an element of the superstructure g 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.220
 takes the second on others have I 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.300
 take the second everything is fine like that 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.770
 we will be able to go to the water 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.649
 because the baby I call him back it's 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.869
 still at 1m 73 and a half for a 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:35.920
 weight of 12 kg 12 kg approximately 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.850
 beautiful baby so I leave you 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.689
 imagine the logistics that allows us 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.689
 to put his babies in the water 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.290
 I could have treated but without ice if 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.150
 you wanted habits so you do like 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.000
 as I'm on the job people that's 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.430
 to say that you use the cartridge of 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.860
 gas directly on the boat or 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.450
 to use the tank which forces you to 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.140
 measure the time that's it then you need me 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.650
 First must you watch and the 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.890
 nobody will touch that it was then 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.350
 christian used to turn on his 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.489
 gas to the uvula 1 to stay at most 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.790
 near the traditions of the steam hop 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.790
 Let's go 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.750
 and he fires very soft so that's 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.750
 perfect for that 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.420
 during the cua everything is closed what 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.840
 substrate that you first go up kernel but 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.840
 since the stop 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.930
 no it's for everyone it's for 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.380
 everyone is first of all it's even 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.380
 no toys 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.550
 then you open all the doors for 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.550
 air is that okay okay 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.959
 certainly he is good if it's good he must 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:20.519
 do what 22 23 in the sun his name 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.430
 okay ok let's listen to real alert 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.930
 on my toolbox and 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.930
 here is the baby part nicely 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.800
 superman of the drama followed with the 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.480
 book speed it's going to be our 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.350
 antipodes 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.600
 I am curious, especially, that 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.560
 I redid the escape we will see 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.910
 jali as the picture is are you 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.030
 please come back to me please 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.569
 because there really and I do not get tired 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.140
 not this beauty 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.470
 so it's true that it's not a 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.470
 outboard 1 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.380
 you are thoroughly there you are thoroughly yes we are going 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.240
 get them up the pressure 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.550
 you can come back to me you can 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.100
 iron gently at 30 cm from the 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:20.040
 edge because a meter 73 is big and 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:22.860
 at the same time it's a real boat to 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.770
 steamy young man has so we heat up 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.910
 water like a pressure cooker 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.360
 except that instead of drying them escape 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.260
 and nebo it's beautiful it's 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.260
 paddle wheels it's called 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.430
 these are called paddle wheels and 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.690
 that was what was invented before 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.430
 read them me I'll show you next 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:46.020
 a propeller boat when you stay a 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:48.480
 little little here are the friends afterwards for 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.040
 new adventures including the rowboat 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.040
 gilbert goodbye
