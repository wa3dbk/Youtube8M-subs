00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
is just I think the features they are

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.260 
is just I think the features they are
like<00:00:50.329> promoting<00:00:51.329> better<00:00:52.820> home<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.030> other

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
like promoting better home the other

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.229 
like promoting better home the other
side<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.050> pad<00:00:55.500> by<00:00:55.739> razor<00:00:56.239> control

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
side we have pad by razor control

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
side we have pad by razor control
addition<00:00:57.809> if<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.170> look<00:00:58.440> at<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.649> wave<00:00:58.859> there

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
addition if you look at that wave there

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.709 
addition if you look at that wave there
that's<00:00:59.640> what<00:00:59.879> it<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.980> okay<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.300> this<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.480> funny

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
that's what it is okay so this is funny

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.289 
that's what it is okay so this is funny
because<00:01:04.140> um<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.309> oversized<00:01:05.760> dition

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.280 
just going to put it like that and you
pause<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.700> video<00:01:51.149> because<00:01:51.630> i'll<00:01:51.840> ask<00:01:51.960> gonna

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
pause the video because i'll ask gonna

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.469 
pause the video because i'll ask gonna
wear<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.590> much<00:01:52.710> time<00:01:52.950> then<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:54.000> rehab

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
wear so much time then you can rehab

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.690 
wear so much time then you can rehab
those<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.960> other<00:01:55.710> languages

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
those in other languages

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.670 
those in other languages
and<00:01:57.700> these<00:01:58.240> are<00:01:58.420> just<00:01:58.480> some<00:01:58.780> gamers<00:01:59.080> that<00:01:59.470> use

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
and these are just some gamers that use

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.800 
and these are just some gamers that use
this<00:01:59.890> mouse<00:02:00.160> pad<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.790> I<00:02:00.970> guess<00:02:01.180> promote<00:02:01.420> these

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
this mouse pad and I guess promote these

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.760 
this mouse pad and I guess promote these
mass<00:02:02.140> pad<00:02:02.350> as<00:02:02.500> well<00:02:03.360> ok<00:02:04.360> so<00:02:04.690> if<00:02:04.900> let's<00:02:05.260> go<00:02:05.470> and

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
mass pad as well ok so if let's go and

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:21.100 
mass pad as well ok so if let's go and
take<00:02:06.460> it<00:02:06.610> out

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.160 

there<00:02:22.110> we<00:02:22.170> go<00:02:22.320> ok<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:24.120> it's<00:02:24.270> rolled<00:02:24.600> up<00:02:24.750> as<00:02:25.020> you

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
there we go ok so it's rolled up as you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.560 
there we go ok so it's rolled up as you
can<00:02:25.290> see<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:25.980> we'll<00:02:26.190> just<00:02:26.270> take<00:02:27.270> it<00:02:27.330> down<00:02:29.570> take

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
can see so we'll just take it down take

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.030 
can see so we'll just take it down take
a<00:02:30.630> look<00:02:30.810> at<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:30.990> it's<00:02:31.200> like<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.410> size<00:02:31.710> my

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
a look at that it's like the size my

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.180 
a look at that it's like the size my
table<00:02:32.580> it's<00:02:33.000> pretty<00:02:33.210> funny<00:02:33.590> ok<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:34.650> this<00:02:35.040> is

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
table it's pretty funny ok so this is

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.220 
table it's pretty funny ok so this is
just<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.520> table<00:02:35.700> i<00:02:35.940> usually<00:02:36.330> play<00:02:36.510> on<00:02:36.750> anyway

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
just the table i usually play on anyway

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.860 
just the table i usually play on anyway
but<00:02:38.160> it's<00:02:38.280> not<00:02:38.400> actually<00:02:38.880> my<00:02:39.030> table<00:02:39.450> it's<00:02:39.720> just

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
but it's not actually my table it's just

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.930 
but it's not actually my table it's just
because<00:02:40.110> i'm<00:02:40.200> lazy<00:02:40.530> sometimes<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.700> i<00:02:41.730> don't

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
now back to mousepad let's just take a

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.110 
now back to mousepad let's just take a
look<00:02:57.030> at<00:02:57.270> it<00:02:57.300> quickly<00:02:58.250> ok<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.310> down<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.880> bottom

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
look at it quickly ok so down the bottom

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.650 
look at it quickly ok so down the bottom
just<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.630> name<00:03:01.050> vegetable<00:03:01.770> Isis<00:03:02.390> plain<00:03:03.390> black

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
just the name vegetable Isis plain black

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.850 
just the name vegetable Isis plain black
and<00:03:03.930> logo<00:03:04.800> up<00:03:05.010> under<00:03:05.430> far<00:03:05.910> right<00:03:06.210> corner<00:03:06.860> so

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
and logo up under far right corner so

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.610 
and logo up under far right corner so
this<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.730> just<00:03:09.210> the<00:03:09.480> first<00:03:09.660> edition<00:03:09.990> I<00:03:10.320> think

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
this is just the first edition I think

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.440 
this is just the first edition I think
and<00:03:10.830> then<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.310> think<00:03:11.820> they<00:03:11.880> made<00:03:12.060> one<00:03:12.270> now

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
and then I think they made one now

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.990 
and then I think they made one now
that's<00:03:12.720> called<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.110> whatever<00:03:14.000> something

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
that's called the whatever something

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.450 
that's called the whatever something
frag<00:03:15.450> position<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.470> same<00:03:16.680> glass<00:03:16.950> this<00:03:17.280> one

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
frag position the same glass this one

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.460 
frag position the same glass this one
but<00:03:17.700> fragmentation<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.630> what<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.020> is<00:03:19.050> is

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
but fragmentation and what that is is

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.380 
but fragmentation and what that is is
like<00:03:19.590> they<00:03:20.340> just<00:03:20.490> have<00:03:20.670> paint<00:03:21.000> kind<00:03:21.270> of

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
like they just have paint kind of

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.150 
like they just have paint kind of
splatters<00:03:21.780> on<00:03:21.930> here<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.350> just<00:03:22.380> looks<00:03:22.770> a<00:03:23.040> lot

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
splatters on here it just looks a lot

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.070 
splatters on here it just looks a lot
better<00:03:23.370> it's<00:03:23.670> green<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.900> looks<00:03:25.050> like

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
better it's green and it looks like

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.560 
better it's green and it looks like
paint<00:03:25.620> splatters<00:03:26.100> on<00:03:26.310> here<00:03:26.640> it's<00:03:27.150> pretty<00:03:27.390> cool

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
paint splatters on here it's pretty cool

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.870 
paint splatters on here it's pretty cool
but<00:03:28.350> there<00:03:28.770> were<00:03:28.830> out<00:03:29.010> of<00:03:29.130> stocks<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.580> couldn't

sticky slightly sticky but yeah okay so
if<00:04:00.050> we<00:04:00.200> just<00:04:00.490> quickly<00:04:01.490> take<00:04:02.000> a<00:04:02.030> look<00:04:02.209> at<00:04:02.270> the

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
if we just quickly take a look at the

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.510 
if we just quickly take a look at the
back<00:04:02.540> here

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.000

microsoft mass 3000 wireless mobile
mouse<00:04:36.850> 3000<00:04:37.690> so<00:04:38.140> this<00:04:38.470> is<00:04:38.590> how<00:04:38.710> big<00:04:38.860> it<00:04:39.010> is<00:04:39.040> if<00:04:39.220> i

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
mouse 3000 so this is how big it is if i

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.600 
mouse 3000 so this is how big it is if i
put<00:04:39.550> it<00:04:39.610> on<00:04:39.730> the<00:04:39.880> edge<00:04:40.090> here<00:04:40.950> it's<00:04:41.950> like<00:04:42.190> that

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
put it on the edge here it's like that

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.590 
put it on the edge here it's like that
big<00:04:42.820> it's<00:04:43.030> pretty<00:04:43.330> huge<00:04:45.330> should<00:04:46.330> have<00:04:46.450> shown

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
measurements before so I don't know just

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.890 
measurements before so I don't know just
go<00:04:51.220> back<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.430> the<00:04:51.520> video<00:04:51.850> if<00:04:51.970> you<00:04:52.120> want<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:52.450> take

go back to the video if you want to take

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.720 
go back to the video if you want to take
the<00:04:52.990> measurements<00:04:53.410> out<00:04:53.560> now<00:04:54.010> might<00:04:54.700> be

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
the measurements out now might be

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.400 
the measurements out now might be
thinking<00:04:55.150> like<00:04:55.360> in<00:04:55.570> your<00:04:55.870> gaming<00:04:56.140> with<00:04:56.380> a

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
thinking like in your gaming with a

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.650 
thinking like in your gaming with a
wireless<00:04:56.710> so<00:04:57.190> I<00:04:57.490> do<00:04:57.610> have<00:04:57.970> my<00:04:58.150> gaming<00:04:58.420> mouse

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
wireless so I do have my gaming mouse

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.400 
wireless so I do have my gaming mouse
here<00:04:58.960> which<00:04:59.140> is<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.550> logitech<00:05:00.550> mx518<00:05:01.330> and<00:05:01.840> so

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
here which is the logitech mx518 and so

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.280 
here which is the logitech mx518 and so
if<00:05:02.650> you<00:05:02.680> see<00:05:02.950> here<00:05:02.980> it's<00:05:03.340> still<00:05:03.960> really<00:05:04.960> really

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
if you see here it's still really really

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.490 
if you see here it's still really really
big<00:05:05.470> and<00:05:05.680> as<00:05:06.570> for<00:05:07.570> the<00:05:07.630> gliding<00:05:07.870> look<00:05:08.320> how

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
big and as for the gliding look how

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.610 
big and as for the gliding look how
easily<00:05:08.800> the<00:05:09.250> slides<00:05:09.580> is<00:05:09.790> pretty<00:05:10.090> good<00:05:10.560> so<00:05:11.560> you

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
easily the slides is pretty good so you

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.240 
easily the slides is pretty good so you
can<00:05:11.860> lower<00:05:12.070> your<00:05:12.190> dpi<00:05:12.730> if<00:05:13.030> you<00:05:13.180> want<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:13.900> and<00:05:14.320> I

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
can lower your dpi if you want to and I

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.790 
can lower your dpi if you want to and I
have<00:05:16.120> get<00:05:16.360> to<00:05:16.540> try<00:05:16.750> this<00:05:16.810> but<00:05:17.230> i<00:05:17.260> guess<00:05:17.530> i<00:05:17.740> will

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
have get to try this but i guess i will

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.070 
have get to try this but i guess i will
add<00:05:17.920> annotations<00:05:18.820> or<00:05:18.940> something<00:05:19.360> to<00:05:19.960> the

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
add annotations or something to the

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.230 
add annotations or something to the
video<00:05:20.380> to<00:05:20.440> see<00:05:20.680> how<00:05:20.890> well<00:05:21.310> it<00:05:21.370> works<00:05:21.670> but<00:05:21.970> i

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
video to see how well it works but i

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.180 
video to see how well it works but i
can't<00:05:22.810> be<00:05:22.900> bothered<00:05:22.930> making<00:05:23.320> another<00:05:23.740> review

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
can't be bothered making another review

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.890 
can't be bothered making another review
because<00:05:24.370> as<00:05:24.790> i<00:05:24.910> said<00:05:24.940> before<00:05:25.240> i<00:05:25.450> don't<00:05:25.630> know

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
because as i said before i don't know

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.690 
because as i said before i don't know
much<00:05:26.080> mouse<00:05:26.770> pads<00:05:27.040> and<00:05:27.220> i'm<00:05:27.310> not<00:05:27.400> going<00:05:27.610> to

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
much mouse pads and i'm not going to

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.730 
much mouse pads and i'm not going to
make<00:05:27.790> another<00:05:28.060> video<00:05:28.300> there's<00:05:29.200> useless<00:05:29.590> to

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
make another video there's useless to

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.350 
make another video there's useless to
everyone<00:05:30.190> because<00:05:30.400> i<00:05:30.730> don't<00:05:30.940> know<00:05:31.030> anything

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
everyone because i don't know anything

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.900 
everyone because i don't know anything
about<00:05:31.570> them<00:05:31.930> so<00:05:32.290> I'm<00:05:33.160> probably<00:05:33.490> just<00:05:33.640> gonna

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
about them so I'm probably just gonna

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.120 
about them so I'm probably just gonna
add<00:05:34.780> comment<00:05:35.170> such<00:05:35.290> as<00:05:35.470> like<00:05:35.680> what<00:05:35.890> I<00:05:35.920> like

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
add comment such as like what I like

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.040 
add comment such as like what I like
about<00:05:36.160> it<00:05:36.550> and<00:05:36.700> why<00:05:36.970> I<00:05:37.000> think<00:05:37.300> is<00:05:37.480> just

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
about it and why I think is just

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.190 
about it and why I think is just
slightly<00:05:38.320> off<00:05:38.530> um<00:05:39.160> nothing<00:05:40.030> more<00:05:40.330> i<00:05:40.750> think<00:05:41.140> i'm

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
slightly off um nothing more i think i'm

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.170 
slightly off um nothing more i think i'm
going<00:05:41.350> to<00:05:41.440> enjoy<00:05:41.650> this<00:05:41.770> mouse<00:05:42.010> pad<00:05:42.220> especially

going to enjoy this mouse pad especially
with<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.390> new<00:05:43.420> computer<00:05:44.050> new<00:05:44.560> call<00:05:44.770> of<00:05:44.800> duty

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
with the new computer new call of duty

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.680 
with the new computer new call of duty
that's<00:05:45.550> coming<00:05:45.760> out<00:05:45.850> yes<00:05:46.210> you<00:05:46.450> might<00:05:46.570> be

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
that's coming out yes you might be

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.800 
that's coming out yes you might be
thinking<00:05:46.810> in<00:05:47.140> call<00:05:47.560> of<00:05:47.590> duty<00:05:47.710> but<00:05:48.220> whatever<00:05:48.880> so

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810

yeah
hopefully<00:05:51.270> this<00:05:51.450> video<00:05:51.570> has<00:05:51.840> been<00:05:52.050> somewhat

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
hopefully this video has been somewhat

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.470 
hopefully this video has been somewhat
helpful<00:05:53.990> but<00:05:54.990> it<00:05:55.110> is<00:05:55.320> unboxing<00:05:56.280> that<00:05:57.270> it<00:05:57.360> might
