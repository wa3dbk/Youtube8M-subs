00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:10.520
 already we come to step number three inserting the retirement age here 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.570

 List of available objects 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.539
 and a smaller window for preview operation 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.139
 The grid structure represents the structure of the page being edited 

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:27.989
 each cell may contain no content-update 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.130
 so you can, for example, a text on the EKD with pressed mouse button in the 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:33.950
 insert first source 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.090
 also a third place can drag and drop into the neighboring favela 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.470

 Page layout and text and money of course can also be fancier 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.820
 be constructed 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.620

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.620
 Content is the responsibility to place next to each other 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.760
 If we look at the text object more open with a double click is the 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.040

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.890
 this is the site x5 especially easy first the disk will be marked the 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.860

 and it opens a window in which the desired link is selected 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.030
 can be 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.109
 For example, a link to another page of your own website 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.100
 at a time can be downloaded without its external website 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.430
 For example, I am behind an internal pop-art that is its class 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.850
 shown well 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.020
 Closing it in front of the window provides the options for design 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.050

 the ad text enlarged 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.810
 Well, let's take a look at the picture objects with a double click 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.419

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:33.779

 which is optimized for publication on the Internet 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.489

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.919

 For example, a mask can be inserted 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:13.739
 or an effect like mirroring or filtering the perspectives 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.569
 or even an outer frame 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.629
 DAPD 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.279
 regardless of whether you all changes are confirmed and the two themselves emperor 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.279
 Immediately seeing the result slowly takes the page shape 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:43.129
 It is important to know that changes in the layout threatened
