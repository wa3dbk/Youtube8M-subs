00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
so I tried a denture but I think of that

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.880 
so I tried a denture but I think of that
age<00:00:20.210> is<00:00:20.420> quite<00:00:20.599> sort<00:00:21.050> of<00:00:21.109> you<00:00:21.470> know<00:00:21.500> you<00:00:21.590> could

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
age is quite sort of you know you could

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.560 
age is quite sort of you know you could
type<00:00:22.189> that<00:00:22.310> in<00:00:22.400> maybe<00:00:22.550> years<00:00:22.910> to<00:00:23.060> come<00:00:23.269> and<00:00:23.449> not

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
type that in maybe years to come and not

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.689 
type that in maybe years to come and not
even<00:00:24.050> having<00:00:24.320> the<00:00:24.439> 20<00:00:24.830> so<00:00:25.070> I<00:00:25.130> found<00:00:25.519> really

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
even having the 20 so I found really

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.810 
even having the 20 so I found really
difficult<00:00:25.880> to<00:00:26.419> so<00:00:26.990> wearing<00:00:27.589> a<00:00:27.859> confidence

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
difficult to so wearing a confidence

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.089 
difficult to so wearing a confidence
even<00:00:28.970> speaking<00:00:29.359> with<00:00:29.509> that<00:00:29.720> in<00:00:29.869> right<00:00:30.080> so<00:00:30.410> you

even speaking with that in right so you

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.080 
even speaking with that in right so you
know<00:00:31.189> that's<00:00:31.369> why<00:00:31.490> I<00:00:31.519> went<00:00:31.699> forward<00:00:31.970> with<00:00:32.060> the
