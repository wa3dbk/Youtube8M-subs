do but it's well worth it in the end and
it's<00:01:39.570> really<00:01:39.960> exciting<00:01:40.289> to<00:01:40.469> be<00:01:40.619> at<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.799> point

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
it's really exciting to be at this point

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.660 
it's really exciting to be at this point
when<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> dog<00:01:42.539> isn't<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.289> duty<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:44.070> stays<00:01:44.460> at

considered the family pet we try to

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.590 
considered the family pet we try to
integrate<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.640> dog<00:01:50.820> into<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.210> life<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.539> the
