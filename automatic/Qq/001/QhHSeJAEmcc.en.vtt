00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.160
 special about this potato selection 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.440
 it is true that it is completely electric 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.860
 which is improved compared to the previous one 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.780
 methods that he is mostly quiet normally 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.890
 I have a lot of noise around you because of 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.980
 the diesel engine 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.750
 and that noise is now beautiful 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.090
 complete silence so you can fully 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.940
 focus on your work 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.440
 well done by the 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.720
 to insert the battery and 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.090
 to place an electric motor on this 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.190
 You can now drive six hours for promotions, but we 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.230
 all have an improved battery 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.630
 can find and allow 9 to 10 hours 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.850
 can drive is just an entire region 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.450
 In the morning , the person you drive goes with 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.280
 work together with the champion in the 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.650
 tractor with the selection car behind 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.180
 travel to parcel and they can from 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.550
 can work nine to ten hours a day 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.760
 they rows so they can have a full day 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.860
 anyway and the end of the day one 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.780
 back to company here is where the moons 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.610
 belader who need two to three hours 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.220
 to charge it 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.770
 and the next day he got up every 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.140
 surface you just have a good grip 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.940
 that in lisse deluxe is a fairly narrow 18 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.790
 centimeter which is the same 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.050
 normal wheel only what you now so what we 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.490
 so they have fixed the drive 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.320
 which is also completely allowing 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.909
 at the bottom of the caps 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.420
 can stay very narrow on that 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.310
 easily by the crop name have a 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.710
 combination between the normal 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.940
 conventional control and articulated steering 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.040
 And because of that the wheels can come like that 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.750
 be bothered that name and 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.390
 turning circle of less than one 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.610
 meter while selecting 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.170
 as soon as you see a wrong plant 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.570
 so what the seats are up to normal 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.410
 working heights there you stepped took away 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.420
 plant and throw it in the bin 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.130
 and as soon as you sit again you can seat the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.510
 stop that yes one height from the other 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.700
 chair what you can see now 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.190
 raise and above the crop so you're good 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.480
 overview there was an instance than idea 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.620
 from a customer a customer is with us 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.590
 come from there is not the possibility 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.210
 to make such a cart electric and 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.250
 then developing his right and 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.960
 brainstorming and with different 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.560
 suppliers is going to talk what is one 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.729
 possible 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.260
 and then we have several 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.580
 suppliers different parts 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.020
 get a job again 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.050
 yes that the development process is with that 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.450
 began to anyone the idea 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.490
 and it has ended recently 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.060
 seasons with this trolley with a lot 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.060
 pleasure turned
