00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.930
 well up here the weekend welcome to 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.360
 another video of enamels mike amy in this 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.550
 chance let's watch a video 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.429
 good is not a video with current is a 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.310
 video a bit special since it's a 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.649
 cooperative in the single practice 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.990
 that is, you know that the 

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:24.760
 cooperative games 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.280
 now the heart games of 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.530
 cooperative they do 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.340
 between player players against the 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.550
 player then forgiveness in player 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.579
 against the machine and then so good 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.760
 in these games 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:46.020
 of player against the machine 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.020
 We can currently get what it is 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.440
 favor 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.420
 and the experience now we are about 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.250
 to finish this then we will be able to 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.710
 see that the favor and the experience that 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.140
 that we can win with this 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.550
 with 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.550
 with side as is the cooperative 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.790
 they catch us here something that is 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.740
 the player's cooperative against 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.560
 machine that could not think but good 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.170
 what will a person do in cooperation 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.159
 With their cooperation cooperative the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.270
 machine well it turns out that 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.829
 and here cooperative verso the machine if 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.369
 we finish the game we can win what 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:35.490
 which are both points of favor as 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.810
 experience points 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.329
 so then I'm saying good 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.560
 that some games to see how it works in 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.409
 the first the truth is that it has 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.509
 worked pretty well so good 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.360
 I suppose you can go 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.909
 doing the games maybe change it 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.670
 but for the moment this moment works 2 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.130
 and we finished since we have that 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.740
 mean medium titan and you can see then a 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.719
 little experience and in addition we can 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.719
 serve both to earn points in favor 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.069
 we are talking about following some between 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:14.250
 15 20 points of favor is not that it's a 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.250
 millionaire but really worth it 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.600
 because you can do there in a jiffy 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.870
 a few points of favor 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.060
 but good and so you can also catch and 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.460
 try those gods that say good to see 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.950
 God how this works you can try 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.900
 because it's not as simple as it is painted 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.090
 the truth that may seem 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.150
 extremely simple but really 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.280
 it's not so simple are three gods that 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.200
 are combined wii that are coordinated to the 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.970
 perfection 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.410
 and we can get to make life 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.730
 impossible thanks so good 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.280
 difficulty none 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.910
 and really 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.830
 in the angles really are departures 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.580
 fast is 10 minutes maximum what is not 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.580
 what we can do 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:07.330
 when I do not fast but how is it here 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.100
 in favor in this case 17 points and gives us 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.140
 experience 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.960
 if in this account when you reach the level of 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.240
 26 500 additional bonus points 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.720
 so for them I say 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.580
 a little part of what is 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.580
 the cooperative what is this from here the 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.580
 cooperative you have three kisses three in the 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.670
 sand and the assault then by throwing 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.530
 some little games look to see what 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.580
 get more more experience and more 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.400
 please and then that's why after 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.430
 games tests the gods perfect 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.440
 those who already know you can go testing 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.150
 items to see then start with these 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.870
 first I start with the other make a 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.030
 little bit like that they are not going to perfect us 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:57.030
 a lot but the truth is that in 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:00.000
 the subject of marksmanship etcetera and handling 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.340
 of the gods gameplay yes that you 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.459
 can serve and I tell you even if they are three 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.270
 bots three characters of the machine you 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.730
 they can get to make life impossible 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:12.330
 because I already tell you they can throw you a 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.640
 stunt mainly are she to nur and 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:19.500
 poseidÃ³n then you can put nation 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:21.299
 stun and the ultimate of a nur and the last 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.820
 and position and they leave you fried in the 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.860
 good series site is to hang out 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.930
 you can play it with friends you can 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.960
 Take three friends and put them here 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.390
 batches of 3 versus 3 and I tell you if 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.790
 get gods that kill you so much that 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.650
 we keep and fast you can do it in 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.730
 five minutes you have done what they are 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.169
 the games 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.640

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.770
