00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
I've never played the game so I don't

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.740 
I've never played the game so I don't
know<00:06:22.550> what<00:06:23.020> Leonardo<00:06:24.020> da<00:06:24.140> Vinci's<00:06:24.500> role<00:06:24.860> is<00:06:25.130> I

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
know what Leonardo da Vinci's role is I

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.960 
know what Leonardo da Vinci's role is I
did<00:06:26.750> see<00:06:27.050> this<00:06:27.230> figure<00:06:27.650> in<00:06:27.860> stores<00:06:28.370> a<00:06:28.490> couple

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
did see this figure in stores a couple

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.200 
did see this figure in stores a couple
of<00:06:29.090> times<00:06:30.280> but<00:06:31.280> I<00:06:31.340> wasn't<00:06:31.850> really<00:06:32.000> impressed

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
of times but I wasn't really impressed

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.960 
of times but I wasn't really impressed
with<00:06:32.900> like<00:06:33.830> the<00:06:33.980> face<00:06:34.250> sculpt<00:06:34.670> and

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
with like the face sculpt and

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.720 
with like the face sculpt and
articulation<00:06:35.630> or<00:06:35.960> anything<00:06:36.370> but<00:06:37.370> I<00:06:37.430> think

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:37.730 
articulation or anything but I think

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.400 
articulation or anything but I think
it's<00:06:37.850> such<00:06:38.090> a<00:06:38.120> nice<00:06:38.420> gesture<00:06:38.780> for<00:06:39.200> you<00:06:39.290> to

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
it's such a nice gesture for you to

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.990 
it's such a nice gesture for you to
think<00:06:39.650> outside<00:06:39.800> the<00:06:39.980> box<00:06:40.250> like<00:06:40.520> that<00:06:40.640> that's

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
think outside the box like that that's
