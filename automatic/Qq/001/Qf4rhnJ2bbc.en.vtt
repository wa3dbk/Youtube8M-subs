00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.340
 here very good layouts in case the way 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.030
 that you are seeing that it serves to 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.910
 the defense if you want to climb is not want 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.399
 take an attack or if you want to take I do not know if 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.790
 What are you up to? 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.309
 to defend against attacks is a 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.010
 layout that is this account that happens to me 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.440
 with ary already seeing has already been using this 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.480
 layout that po long time 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.629
 It's been a long time since I've changed and I 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.579
 I really liked the defenses I made 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.760
 here you will not be able to 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.680
 defend from very good attacks only not 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.189
 It's going to be anyone who's leaving. 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.369
 attacking and making that 100% of the galley 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:12.150
 I'll show you the layout now. 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.479
 For fame, a lot of people do not know what layout 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.869
 to use infamous I'm showing it to 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.630
 you guys in which a good layout another tip is 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.360
 leave these two layouts from here to 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.439
 You always had to change according to 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.650
 the need 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.829
 take a look at the real and celtic is very 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.360
 good because it centralizes all your 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:39.689
 resources here if you want to 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.990
 in can touch and the castle through the deposit 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.509
 He was black and I did not actually do it. 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.899
 This is how I want to do the 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.799
 My King, soon I left this scolding that the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.750
 place of the day is here in this drill that this 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.659
 Damn it was not from here she could be here 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.390
 off but I do not have my king yet 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.820
 dropped with 8 thousand of investment then 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.579
 I leave it here in the already avoided 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.660
 some theft is the following if you 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:12.150
 You want to change who does this here? 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:16.050
 kept is safe lewis seiler and boy 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.870
 black is good, and it 's going to be good 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.599
 layout if you want to leave the mages in 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.360
 a castle defense is also good to leave 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.330
 right there in the center that the magicians go 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.640
 do that celtic havoc that he is a 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.330
 The best of them, I found 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.180
 even because they leave the 10 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.629
 here with the magicians in the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.500
 units in each giving good and here 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:46.140
 This is the original layout of this layout. 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.129
 deposit is in front of him 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.510
 attracts 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:54.030
 I just like to preserve my 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.230
 book then we centralized myself 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.920
 I was here and put the garbage dump 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.980
 back there O air defense has thousand 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.920
 life, this gives insured people the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.290
 troops there over time as we have a 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:15.720
 mortar here to do damage right 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.610
 already prevents some course towards a difficult and 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.519
 No theft, right? 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.430
