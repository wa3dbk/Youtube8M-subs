00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
string through the outline beads to the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:58.200 
string through the outline beads to the
black<00:00:26.750> okay

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.410 

okay

okay

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.510 
okay
so<00:00:59.780> once<00:01:00.380> your<00:01:00.560> coming<00:01:00.860> out<00:01:00.980> of<00:01:01.100> this<00:01:01.220> black

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
so once your coming out of this black

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.790 
so once your coming out of this black
you're<00:01:02.030> going<00:01:02.360> to<00:01:02.540> string<00:01:02.810> on<00:01:02.990> another<00:01:03.290> black

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
you're going to string on another black

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:16.630 
you're going to string on another black
and<00:01:05.530> string<00:01:06.530> it<00:01:06.650> through<00:01:06.680> this<00:01:07.340> black<00:01:15.640> and

and string it through this black and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.210 
and string it through this black and
then<00:01:19.240> it<00:01:20.240> would<00:01:20.420> look<00:01:20.570> like<00:01:20.630> that<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.740> you

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
then it would look like that and you

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.180 
then it would look like that and you
should<00:01:22.460> have<00:01:22.640> four<00:01:23.090> more<00:01:23.780> black<00:01:24.530> beads<00:01:24.920> left

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
should have four more black beads left

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:32.109 
should have four more black beads left
absolutely<00:01:26.060> no<00:01:26.690> white<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.190> then<00:01:30.880> take<00:01:31.880> the

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
absolutely no white and then take the

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.670 
absolutely no white and then take the
string<00:01:33.010> then<00:01:34.010> put<00:01:34.340> another<00:01:34.369> black<00:01:34.880> bead<00:01:35.150> on<00:01:35.330> it

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
string then put another black bead on it

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.960 
string then put another black bead on it
take<00:01:36.680> your<00:01:36.860> other<00:01:37.040> string<00:01:37.460> put<00:01:37.760> it<00:01:37.850> through

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
take your other string put it through

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.750 
take your other string put it through
the<00:01:38.270> opposite<00:01:38.840> way<00:01:39.050> like<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.380> ladder<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:40.250> then

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
the opposite way like a ladder and then

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.040 
the opposite way like a ladder and then
just<00:01:41.270> pull<00:01:42.050> it<00:01:42.200> down<00:01:43.180> so<00:01:44.180> it<00:01:44.300> switches<00:01:44.600> strings

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
just pull it down so it switches strings

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.969 
just pull it down so it switches strings
put<00:01:45.979> a<00:01:46.010> black<00:01:46.280> bead<00:01:46.550> on<00:01:46.670> this<00:01:46.850> string<00:01:47.979> that's

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
put a black bead on this string that's

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.830 
put a black bead on this string that's
switched<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:49.670> then<00:01:49.850> put<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:50.180> down<00:01:50.210> into<00:01:50.540> this

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
switched and then put it down into this

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.130 
switched and then put it down into this
black<00:01:51.140> bead<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:55.310> then<00:01:55.550> you<00:01:55.820> should<00:01:56.060> have<00:01:56.140> two

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
black bead and then you should have two

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.800 
black bead and then you should have two
bees<00:01:57.350> left<00:01:57.680> so<00:01:58.670> again<00:01:59.000> we're<00:01:59.150> going<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.660> be

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
bees left so again we're going to be

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.620 
bees left so again we're going to be
going<00:02:00.080> through<00:02:00.290> some<00:02:00.620> more<00:02:00.980> beads<00:02:01.220> with<00:02:01.970> no<00:02:02.300> I

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
going through some more beads with no I

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.100 
going through some more beads with no I
mean<00:02:02.960> yeah<00:02:03.850> we're<00:02:04.850> going<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.090> past<00:02:05.360> string

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.289 
guess you can just no but okay so now we
have<00:04:00.319> to<00:04:00.530> tie<00:04:00.709> it<00:04:00.739> off<00:04:00.919> because<00:04:01.430> one<00:04:01.819> strings

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
have to tie it off because one strings

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.599 
have to tie it off because one strings
coming<00:04:02.720> through<00:04:02.959> on<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.650> side<00:04:03.919> and<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.489> other

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
coming through on the side and the other

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.879 
coming through on the side and the other
strings<00:04:04.879> come<00:04:05.150> through<00:04:05.389> on<00:04:05.629> the<00:04:05.780> side<00:04:06.400> so<00:04:08.889> we

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
strings come through on the side so we

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.159 
strings come through on the side so we
are<00:04:10.010> going<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.489> have<00:04:10.699> to<00:04:10.909> string<00:04:11.269> to<00:04:11.599> one<00:04:11.840> side

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.169 
are going to have to string to one side

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.879 
are going to have to string to one side
and<00:04:12.590> I'm<00:04:13.430> going<00:04:13.699> to<00:04:14.150> do<00:04:14.299> that<00:04:15.019> with<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.680> one

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
and I'm going to do that with the one

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.490 
and I'm going to do that with the one
I'm<00:04:16.459> going<00:04:16.669> to<00:04:16.849> string<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.930> string<00:04:17.989> that<00:04:18.440> is

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
I'm going to string the string that is

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.060 
I'm going to string the string that is
longest<00:04:19.870> so<00:04:20.870> I'll<00:04:21.109> do<00:04:21.229> it<00:04:21.289> on<00:04:21.349> the<00:04:21.470> side<00:04:21.680> so
