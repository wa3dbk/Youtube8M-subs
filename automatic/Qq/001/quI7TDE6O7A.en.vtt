inches<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.410> thread<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.580> one<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.810> one

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
inches of thread on this one and the one

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.020 
inches of thread on this one and the one
on<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.349> second<00:00:31.769> pole<00:00:31.949> down<00:00:32.219> there<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.700> I<00:00:32.730> can

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
on the second pole down there so I can

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.100 
on the second pole down there so I can
tighten<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.420> thing<00:00:33.480> up<00:00:33.780> seven<00:00:34.140> inches<00:00:36.110> and

tighten this thing up seven inches and
then<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.800> put<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.010> wire<00:00:38.309> through<00:00:38.579> this

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
then you just put the wire through this

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.760 
then you just put the wire through this
little<00:00:39.030> log<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.780> don't<00:00:40.350> know<00:00:40.410> I'm<00:00:40.559> going<00:00:40.710> to

little log I don't know I'm going to

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.200 
little log I don't know I'm going to
call<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.219> cleat<00:00:41.489> I'm<00:00:41.670> sure<00:00:41.850> that's<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
call it a cleat I'm sure that's the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.330 
call it a cleat I'm sure that's the
proper<00:00:42.540> name<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.410> way<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.829> wires<00:00:44.040> not

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
proper name that way the wires not

rubbing<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.510> thing<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:46.379> sliding<00:00:46.770> on

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
rubbing on this thing it's sliding on

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.400 
rubbing on this thing it's sliding on
that<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.760> then<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.629> loop<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.989> through<00:00:49.020> this

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
that and then you loop it through this

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.080 
that and then you loop it through this
clamp<00:00:50.360> it's<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.539> double<00:00:51.960> nut<00:00:52.789> clamp<00:00:53.789> and

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
clamp it's a double nut clamp and

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.970 
clamp it's a double nut clamp and
tighten<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.199> down<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:01.260> since<00:01:01.559> I'm<00:01:01.800> running

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
tighten it down and since I'm running

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.950 
tighten it down and since I'm running
this<00:01:02.309> eight<00:01:02.579> feet<00:01:02.820> apart<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.390> drilled<00:01:03.840> a

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
this eight feet apart I just drilled a

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.270 
this eight feet apart I just drilled a
hole<00:01:03.989> through<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.769> ran<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.129> cable

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
hole through that and ran the cable

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.010 
hole through that and ran the cable
through<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.210> see<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.570> one<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
through and you can see the one on the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.510 
through and you can see the one on the
back<00:01:10.170> holding<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> grapevine<00:01:11.040> up<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520

back holding the grapevine up on the
left<00:01:11.760> has<00:01:11.970> been<00:01:12.000> run<00:01:12.510> up<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> threads

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
left has been run up on the threads

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.100 
left has been run up on the threads
right<00:01:13.500> much<00:01:14.270> primarly<00:01:15.270> because<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.840> poles

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
right much primarly because this poles

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.859

sand and what I try to do is this is a
very<00:01:44.040> weak<00:01:44.340> grapevine<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.329> was<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> back

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
very weak grapevine it was in the back

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.870 
very weak grapevine it was in the back
of<00:01:46.380> my<00:01:46.530> greenhouse<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.040> didn't<00:01:47.430> get<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.579> lot<00:01:47.759> of

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
of my greenhouse and didn't get a lot of

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.260 
of my greenhouse and didn't get a lot of
Sun<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.950> first<00:01:50.189> thing<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.549> do<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:50.909> plant

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
Sun and the first thing I do is I plant

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.030 
Sun and the first thing I do is I plant
the<00:01:51.479> plant<00:01:51.750> put<00:01:51.990> some<00:01:52.200> soul<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.860> give<00:01:53.009> it

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
the plant put some soul on it to give it

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.520 
the plant put some soul on it to give it
some<00:01:53.310> weight<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.759> anchor<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.479> then<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.110> use<00:01:55.500> a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
some weight and anchor and then I use a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.700 
some weight and anchor and then I use a
tie<00:01:56.180> one<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.210> my<00:01:57.360> little<00:01:57.600> nylon<00:01:57.780> ties<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.590> to

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
tie one of my little nylon ties just to

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.249 
tie one of my little nylon ties just to
hold<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.340> place<00:01:59.520> and<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.060> did<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.899> under<00:02:01.229> a

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
hold it in place and just did it under a

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.459 
hold it in place and just did it under a
leaf<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.399> wouldn't<00:02:02.640> slip<00:02:02.850> off<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:04.170> then<00:02:04.320> I

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
leaf so it wouldn't slip off and then I

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.580 
leaf so it wouldn't slip off and then I
tie<00:02:04.740> one<00:02:05.040> up<00:02:05.250> here<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.210> then<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.290> tie<00:02:07.530> this

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
tie one up here and then I tie this

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.490 
tie one up here and then I tie this
around<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:09.209> leaf<00:02:09.420> node<00:02:09.720> just<00:02:10.020> wrap<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.319> around

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
around the leaf node just wrap it around

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.860 
around the leaf node just wrap it around
twice<00:02:10.890> there's<00:02:11.310> no<00:02:11.489> not<00:02:11.700> there<00:02:12.030> I'm<00:02:12.209> not<00:02:12.239> it<00:02:12.720> up

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
twice there's no not there I'm not it up

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.640 
twice there's no not there I'm not it up
here<00:02:13.140> so

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
here so

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.800 
here so
won't<00:02:13.860> strangle<00:02:14.189> it<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:14.700> then<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:15.510> did<00:02:15.689> the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
won't strangle it and then I did the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.770 
won't strangle it and then I did the
same<00:02:16.019> thing<00:02:16.079> with<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.530> one<00:02:16.739> and<00:02:17.569> as<00:02:18.569> this

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
same thing with that one and as this

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.649 
same thing with that one and as this
grows<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.560> can<00:02:19.769> just<00:02:20.010> cut<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:20.939> off<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.450> pull

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
grows you can just cut this off and pull

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.690 
grows you can just cut this off and pull
it<00:02:21.780> up<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:21.989> tell<00:02:22.200> another<00:02:22.470> nun<00:02:22.709> in<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.040> but

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
it up and tell another nun in it but

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.280 
it up and tell another nun in it but
you're<00:02:23.879> trying<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.209> get<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.420> straight<00:02:24.689> trunk

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
you're trying to get a straight trunk

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.240 
you're trying to get a straight trunk
and<00:02:26.120> this<00:02:27.120> is<00:02:27.329> actually<00:02:27.750> two<00:02:29.359> grapevines<00:02:31.250> last

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
and this is actually two grapevines last

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.069 
and this is actually two grapevines last
year<00:02:32.459> when<00:02:32.609> I<00:02:32.700> pruned<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.239> I<00:02:33.359> didn't<00:02:33.659> take<00:02:33.840> the

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
year when I pruned it I didn't take the

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.720 
year when I pruned it I didn't take the
that<00:02:34.560> year's<00:02:34.829> growth<00:02:35.129> that<00:02:35.400> took<00:02:35.579> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
that year's growth that took the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.940 
that year's growth that took the
previous<00:02:35.939> year's<00:02:36.359> growth<00:02:36.659> and<00:02:36.900> as<00:02:37.500> long<00:02:37.769> as

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
previous year's growth and as long as

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.910 
previous year's growth and as long as
you've<00:02:38.129> got<00:02:38.540> four<00:02:39.540> buds<00:02:39.810> on<00:02:40.079> it<00:02:40.109> you<00:02:40.620> can<00:02:40.739> stick

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
you've got four buds on it you can stick

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.759 
you've got four buds on it you can stick
it<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.159> Seoul<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:42.209> just<00:02:42.930> do<00:02:43.049> it<00:02:43.079> in<00:02:43.260> my<00:02:43.379> potting

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
it in Seoul I just do it in my potting

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.460 
it in Seoul I just do it in my potting
soil<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.220> wet<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.519> down<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.900> buds<00:02:46.109> under

soil and wet it down the the buds under
the<00:02:46.620> soil<00:02:46.829> will<00:02:47.069> grow<00:02:47.250> roots<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:48.209> buds

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
the soil will grow roots and the buds

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.879 
the soil will grow roots and the buds
above<00:02:48.870> will<00:02:49.170> grow<00:02:49.349> Leafs

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
above will grow Leafs

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.599 
above will grow Leafs
and<00:02:50.220> you've<00:02:50.639> got<00:02:50.819> a<00:02:50.849> free<00:02:51.150> grapevine<00:02:52.370> this<00:02:53.370> is

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
and you've got a free grapevine this is

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.699 
and you've got a free grapevine this is
a<00:02:53.639> little<00:02:53.970> healthier<00:02:54.420> one<00:02:54.659> they've<00:02:55.290> both<00:02:55.470> done

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
a little healthier one they've both done

a little healthier one they've both done
at<00:02:55.889> the<00:02:56.040> same<00:02:56.280> time<00:02:56.609> but<00:02:56.819> you<00:02:57.000> can<00:02:57.180> see<00:02:57.359> that

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
up so birds and things won't eat them

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
live caterpillar stage worm under it and

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.439 
live caterpillar stage worm under it and
that's<00:03:47.879> how<00:03:48.000> hard<00:03:48.750> this<00:03:49.250> sole<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.579> that's<00:03:51.150> at

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
that's how hard this sole is that's at

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.890 
that's how hard this sole is that's at
the<00:03:51.599> base<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.810> that<00:03:52.049> hole<00:03:53.569> see<00:03:54.569> there's<00:03:54.840> a

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
the base of that hole see there's a

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.899 
the base of that hole see there's a
little<00:03:55.319> bit<00:03:55.440> of<00:03:55.560> sand<00:03:55.829> in<00:03:56.069> it<00:03:56.190> because<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.579> can

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
little bit of sand in it because you can

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.240 
little bit of sand in it because you can
break<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.299> up<00:03:57.419> it<00:03:57.810> took<00:03:57.989> was<00:03:58.169> clay<00:03:58.500> total<00:03:59.040> clay

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
break it up it took was clay total clay

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.390 
break it up it took was clay total clay
wouldn't<00:03:59.639> break<00:03:59.729> up<00:03:59.970> like<00:04:00.209> that<00:04:01.040> but<00:04:02.040> when<00:04:02.220> we

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
wouldn't break up like that but when we

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.719 
wouldn't break up like that but when we
dug<00:04:02.609> these<00:04:02.849> postholes<00:04:03.470> about<00:04:04.470> 20<00:04:04.859> inches<00:04:05.010> it

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
dug these postholes about 20 inches it

wasn't that hard to dig down and we

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.860 
wasn't that hard to dig down and we
realized<00:04:08.459> there<00:04:08.699> was<00:04:08.819> a<00:04:09.120> little<00:04:09.449> more<00:04:09.540> sand

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870

here the sand is anywhere from four feet
under<00:04:13.139> the<00:04:13.290> surface<00:04:13.530> of<00:04:13.949> the<00:04:14.489> 21<00:04:15.000> feet<00:04:15.269> that's

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
under the surface of the 21 feet that's

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.990 
under the surface of the 21 feet that's
why<00:04:15.720> there's<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:16.250> septic<00:04:17.250> tank<00:04:17.280> parking
