and but there are a couple things I

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.990 
and but there are a couple things I
would<00:01:13.460> not<00:01:13.670> use<00:01:14.060> this<00:01:14.330> it's<00:01:14.720> real<00:01:15.080> soft<00:01:15.789> so<00:01:16.789> it

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
would not use this it's real soft so it

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.160 
would not use this it's real soft so it
would<00:01:17.240> be<00:01:17.539> perfect<00:01:18.020> for<00:01:18.080> playsets<00:01:19.899> and<00:01:20.899> stuff

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
would be perfect for playsets and stuff

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.350 
would be perfect for playsets and stuff
like<00:01:21.350> that<00:01:21.619> but<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:22.520> thing<00:01:22.550> is<00:01:23.200> that<00:01:24.200> it's

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
like that but the thing is that it's

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.859 
like that but the thing is that it's
that<00:01:26.360> when<00:01:26.539> I<00:01:26.570> was<00:01:26.810> putting<00:01:27.110> it<00:01:27.350> out<00:01:27.560> I<00:01:28.869> went

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
that when I was putting it out I went

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.660 
that when I was putting it out I went
and<00:01:29.960> washed<00:01:30.140> my<00:01:30.350> hands<00:01:30.590> after<00:01:30.770> I<00:01:30.920> was<00:01:31.160> done<00:01:31.340> and

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
and washed my hands after I was done and

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.039 
and washed my hands after I was done and
I<00:01:32.479> had<00:01:32.600> something<00:01:32.869> in<00:01:33.590> my<00:01:34.070> teeth<00:01:34.510> so<00:01:35.510> I<00:01:35.540> went<00:01:35.869> to

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
I had something in my teeth so I went to

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.820 
I had something in my teeth so I went to
get<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:36.650> out<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:38.260> instantly<00:01:39.260> I<00:01:39.350> could<00:01:39.650> tell<00:01:39.799> I

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
get it out and instantly I could tell I

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.830 
get it out and instantly I could tell I
had<00:01:40.070> something<00:01:40.520> on<00:01:40.610> my<00:01:40.760> hands<00:01:41.180> I<00:01:41.330> guess<00:01:41.630> it's

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
had something on my hands I guess it's

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.170 
had something on my hands I guess it's
the<00:01:41.930> chemicals<00:01:42.470> from<00:01:42.619> this<00:01:42.770> stuff<00:01:43.040> and<00:01:43.939> I

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
the chemicals from this stuff and I

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.609 
the chemicals from this stuff and I
don't<00:01:44.240> know<00:01:44.479> how<00:01:44.630> well<00:01:44.869> they<00:01:45.020> cleaned<00:01:45.290> it<00:01:45.439> no

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
don't know how well they cleaned it no

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.280 
don't know how well they cleaned it no
but<00:01:46.610> I<00:01:46.640> wouldn't<00:01:47.000> want<00:01:47.210> my<00:01:47.330> kids<00:01:47.600> playing<00:01:48.020> in

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
but I wouldn't want my kids playing in

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.359 
but I wouldn't want my kids playing in
it<00:01:48.430> just<00:01:49.430> because<00:01:49.729> of<00:01:49.970> that<00:01:50.200> so<00:01:51.200> I<00:01:51.680> would<00:01:51.979> avoid

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
it just because of that so I would avoid

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.359 
it just because of that so I would avoid
putting<00:01:52.820> this<00:01:53.210> brand<00:01:53.600> out<00:01:53.810> on<00:01:53.930> playsets<00:01:54.500> but

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
putting this brand out on playsets but

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.910 
putting this brand out on playsets but
as<00:01:55.640> far<00:01:55.880> as<00:01:55.909> putting<00:01:56.900> in<00:01:57.140> your<00:01:57.290> yard

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
as far as putting in your yard

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.460 
as far as putting in your yard
like<00:01:58.729> real<00:01:59.000> bushes<00:01:59.450> and<00:01:59.600> stuff<00:01:59.810> like<00:01:59.960> this<00:02:00.229> I

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
like real bushes and stuff like this I

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.340 
like real bushes and stuff like this I
see<00:02:01.250> no<00:02:01.430> problem<00:02:01.610> with<00:02:01.909> that<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.960> I<00:02:03.320> think

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.319 
see no problem with that and I think
it's<00:02:03.650> gonna<00:02:03.799> last<00:02:03.979> a<00:02:04.159> long<00:02:04.340> time<00:02:04.369> and<00:02:05.150> it's

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
it's gonna last a long time and it's

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.080 
it's gonna last a long time and it's
going<00:02:05.509> to<00:02:05.630> stay<00:02:05.810> looking<00:02:06.049> good<00:02:06.579> and<00:02:07.579> again
