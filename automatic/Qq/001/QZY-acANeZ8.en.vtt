00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.140 
what it is that I do they often ask
aren't<00:02:31.720> they<00:02:31.810> resistant<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.800> how<00:02:33.790> do<00:02:33.850> you<00:02:34.000> get

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
aren't they resistant and how do you get

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.590 
aren't they resistant and how do you get
them<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.360> dance<00:02:34.860> well<00:02:35.860> yes<00:02:36.100> initially<00:02:36.730> there

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
them to dance well yes initially there

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.620 
them to dance well yes initially there
is<00:02:37.630> some<00:02:37.960> resistance<00:02:38.290> but<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.310> find<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.880> once

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
is some resistance but I find that once

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.710 
is some resistance but I find that once
I<00:02:40.810> give<00:02:41.050> them<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.440> permission<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.310> dance<00:02:43.060> that

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
I give them the permission to dance that

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.300 
I give them the permission to dance that
it<00:02:43.900> is<00:02:44.020> allowed<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:45.220> walls<00:02:45.510> quickly<00:02:46.510> crumble

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
it is allowed the walls quickly crumble

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.720 
it is allowed the walls quickly crumble
and<00:02:48.310> when<00:02:48.490> I<00:02:48.520> say<00:02:48.790> dance<00:02:49.270> I<00:02:49.690> mean<00:02:50.230> move<00:02:50.890> stretch

talking about dance in the traditional

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.280 
talking about dance in the traditional
sense<00:02:59.830> there<00:03:00.790> are<00:03:00.910> many<00:03:01.150> ways<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.780> express

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
sense there are many ways to express

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.040 
sense there are many ways to express
ourselves<00:03:02.470> in<00:03:03.220> an<00:03:03.730> embodied<00:03:04.240> way<00:03:04.420> through

ourselves in an embodied way through

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.920 
ourselves in an embodied way through
movement<00:03:05.590> gesture<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.670> look<00:03:07.060> facial

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
movement gesture a look facial

about<00:03:13.510> being<00:03:13.840> in<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.290> body<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.860> moving<00:03:15.400> in<00:03:15.790> a

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
about being in the body and moving in a

way that feels authentic and meaningful
what<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.650> find<00:03:21.040> is<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.550> patients<00:03:21.970> have<00:03:22.120> a

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
what I find is that the patients have a

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.949 
what I find is that the patients have a
deep<00:03:23.350> need<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:24.160> be<00:03:24.280> creative<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.060> play<00:03:25.660> and

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
deep need to be creative and to play and

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.750 
deep need to be creative and to play and
that<00:03:26.260> that<00:03:26.590> need<00:03:26.860> has<00:03:27.100> not<00:03:27.280> been<00:03:27.489> being

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
that that need has not been being

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.360 
that that need has not been being
answered<00:03:27.970> for<00:03:28.330> a<00:03:28.360> very<00:03:28.570> long<00:03:28.840> time<00:03:29.190> most<00:03:30.190> of

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
them have left creativity behind and

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.580

years I've collected quotes from
veterans<00:04:39.540> and<00:04:39.990> there<00:04:40.830> are<00:04:41.010> groups<00:04:41.280> together

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
veterans and there are groups together

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.010 
and kept them as a reminder of the
growth<00:04:43.980> change<00:04:44.880> and<00:04:45.300> healing<00:04:45.750> that<00:04:45.900> has

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
growth change and healing that has

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.040 
growth change and healing that has
happened<00:04:46.440> in<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.740> dance<00:04:46.950> space<00:04:47.340> I<00:04:47.900> think<00:04:48.900> that

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
happened in the dance space I think that

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.770 
happened in the dance space I think that
the<00:04:49.170> best<00:04:49.470> way<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:50.270> understand<00:04:51.270> the
