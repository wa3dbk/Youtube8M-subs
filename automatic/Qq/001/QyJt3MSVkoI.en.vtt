00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:10.711
 Welcome to the World of Warcraft Raiding Paladin Crash Course. 

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:14.778
 In this video, you'll learn what you need to do 

00:00:14.778 --> 00:00:18.508
 to begin with a retaliatory paladin at level 90. 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.544
 The damage rotation of Retribution generates and consumes Holy Power. 

00:00:24.544 --> 00:00:29.261
 Like all paladins, the tamer has a mana bear, but he should 

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:33.228
 Do not worry too much. Concentrate only on your Holy Power. 

00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:36.992
 Before the fight you should activate blessing of power. 

00:00:37.392 --> 00:00:39.759
 That's a pretty big boost to your mastery, 

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:42.208
 which means a pretty big increase in your damage. 

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:46.923
 You should also activate Seal of Truth - another source of damage 

00:00:46.923 --> 00:00:48.579
 for your melee attacks. 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.474
 In combat you should use Crusader Strike as often as possible, 

00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:54.972
 followed by Judgment and Exorcism. 

00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:58.755
 Each of these abilities generates one point of Holy Power, 

00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:01.116
 So try to always keep it in the cooldown. 

00:01:01.116 --> 00:01:05.638
 Remember that your automatic attacks sometimes complete the cooldown of exorcism, 

00:01:05.638 --> 00:01:09.002
 what you are informed with a notification. 

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:14.397
 You can also use Hammer of Wrath if your target falls below 20% health, 

00:01:14.397 --> 00:01:18.347
 which also creates Holy Power and causes a lot of damage. 

00:01:18.347 --> 00:01:22.608
 When you have achieved 3 Holy Power, you can spend it for judgment of the Templar. 

00:01:22.608 --> 00:01:24.741
 This is your most powerful attack. 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.698
 There is much more to learn to master your paladin, 

00:01:28.698 --> 00:01:32.804
 but we hope this first insight will get you on the right track. 

00:01:33.304 --> 00:01:34.885
 Once you have mastered the basics, 

00:01:35.185 --> 00:01:40.453
 look at your spellbook, your talents and glyphs, 

00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:43.281
 to get to know even more skills. 

00:01:43.781 --> 00:01:47.182
 Thank you for watching! See you at Draenor.
