00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
okay max size of 24 is a problem since

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.060 
okay max size of 24 is a problem since

goes up to 41 and this is coming from a
pulse<00:01:07.350> rifle<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> math

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
pulse rifle so if you do the math

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.730 
pulse rifle so if you do the math
there's<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.360> very<00:01:09.659> high<00:01:09.840> chance<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.380> each

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
there's a very high chance that each

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.859 
there's a very high chance that each
burst<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.790> do<00:01:11.909> well<00:01:12.210> over<00:01:12.540> 100

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869

burst is going to do well over 100
damage<00:01:13.080> if<00:01:13.610> you<00:01:14.610> compare<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.390> Red

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.810 
damage if you compare this with the Red
Death<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.200> has<00:01:16.560> higher<00:01:16.860> rate<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.250> fire<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
Death it has higher rate of fire and

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.120 
Death it has higher rate of fire and
slightly<00:01:18.150> lower<00:01:18.540> impact<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.680> messenger

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
slightly lower impact but the messenger

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.950 
slightly lower impact but the messenger
blows<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.640> Red<00:01:20.820> Death<00:01:21.060> out<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.390> water<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
blows the Red Death out with water and

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.950 
blows the Red Death out with water and
range<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.590> stability<00:01:23.189> also<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.720> higher

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
range and stability also the higher

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.260 
range and stability also the higher
impact<00:01:25.409> gives<00:01:25.710> more<00:01:25.950> leeway<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.580> killing

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
impact gives more leeway for killing

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.660 
impact gives more leeway for killing
people<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.720> two<00:01:27.930> bursts<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:29.009> has<00:01:29.220> pretty<00:01:29.520> much

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
people in two bursts it has pretty much

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.120 
people in two bursts it has pretty much
the<00:01:29.700> same<00:01:29.939> stats<00:01:30.299> as<00:01:30.540> three<00:01:30.930> little<00:01:31.170> words<00:01:31.380> but

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the same stats as three little words but

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.789 
the same stats as three little words but
with<00:01:32.549> better<00:01:32.790> perks<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.240> sights<00:01:33.530> now<00:01:34.530> let's

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
with better perks and sights now let's

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.980 
with better perks and sights now let's
go<00:01:35.009> into<00:01:35.220> parks<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:36.030> first<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.509> second<00:01:36.780> perk

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
go into parks the first and second perk

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.560 
go into parks the first and second perk
our<00:01:37.170> third<00:01:37.650> eye<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.070> head<00:01:38.280> seeker<00:01:38.670> third<00:01:39.420> eye

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
our third eye and head seeker third eye

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.749 
our third eye and head seeker third eye
is<00:01:39.630> universally<00:01:40.500> helpful<00:01:40.829> especially<00:01:41.040> since

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
is universally helpful especially since

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.969 
is universally helpful especially since
this<00:01:41.970> weapon<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.570> not<00:01:42.780> as<00:01:42.930> capable<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.590> close

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
this weapon is not as capable in close

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.039 
this weapon is not as capable in close
quarters<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.299> see<00:01:45.450> when<00:01:45.659> someone's

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
quarters so you can see when someone's

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.590 
however the best thing about the perks
is<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:46.890> they<00:02:47.070> are<00:02:47.100> fixed<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.850> no<00:02:48.360> they

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
is that they are fixed and no they

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.570 
is that they are fixed and no they
