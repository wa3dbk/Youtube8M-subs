00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.509 
is the blade shape I mean it would
remind<00:04:42.149> you<00:04:42.329> a<00:04:42.359> bit<00:04:42.599> of<00:04:42.629> the<00:04:42.899> Spyderco<00:04:43.559> thing

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:44.519 
remind you a bit of the Spyderco thing

00:04:44.519 --> 00:04:46.999 
remind you a bit of the Spyderco thing
going<00:04:44.969> on<00:04:45.089> here<00:04:45.419> but<00:04:45.989> the<00:04:46.319> blade<00:04:46.559> they<00:04:46.769> made

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
going on here but the blade they made

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:52.219 
going on here but the blade they made
somewhat<00:04:47.819> of<00:04:48.029> a<00:04:48.329> drop<00:04:49.579> spear<00:04:50.579> point<00:04:51.079> going<00:04:52.079> on

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
somewhat of a drop spear point going on

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.949 
somewhat of a drop spear point going on
here<00:04:52.529> tapering<00:04:53.219> towards<00:04:53.759> the<00:04:53.939> end<00:04:54.089> probably

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:54.959 
here tapering towards the end probably

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:59.719 
here tapering towards the end probably
for<00:04:55.199> better<00:04:55.679> piercing<00:04:56.339> or<00:04:58.039> a<00:04:59.039> stabbing<00:04:59.549> motion

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
for better piercing or a stabbing motion

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.869 
for better piercing or a stabbing motion
or<00:05:00.269> picking<00:05:00.899> whatever<00:05:01.109> so<00:05:01.859> it's<00:05:02.069> really<00:05:02.609> nice

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:02.879 
or picking whatever so it's really nice

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:06.919 
or picking whatever so it's really nice
and<00:05:03.119> it's<00:05:03.629> got<00:05:03.809> this<00:05:04.049> I<00:05:04.939> haven't<00:05:05.939> gone<00:05:06.119> into<00:05:06.509> it

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:06.929 
and it's got this I haven't gone into it

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:11.629 
and it's got this I haven't gone into it
as<00:05:07.219> much<00:05:08.219> as<00:05:08.489> I<00:05:08.609> wanted<00:05:09.059> to<00:05:10.039> but<00:05:11.039> look<00:05:11.399> at<00:05:11.489> the

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
as much as I wanted to but look at the

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.959 
as much as I wanted to but look at the
look<00:05:12.389> at<00:05:12.449> the<00:05:12.509> profile<00:05:13.049> of<00:05:13.079> the<00:05:13.439> the<00:05:13.969> the

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:14.969 
look at the profile of the the the

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:17.269 
look at the profile of the the the
sharpening<00:05:15.449> style<00:05:16.169> does<00:05:16.529> have<00:05:16.709> a<00:05:16.799> secondary

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:17.279 
sharpening style does have a secondary

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.179 
sharpening style does have a secondary
bevel<00:05:17.519> here<00:05:17.849> but<00:05:18.809> it<00:05:18.929> looks<00:05:18.959> as<00:05:19.379> if<00:05:19.409> it's<00:05:19.739> it's

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:20.189 
bevel here but it looks as if it's it's

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:23.509 
bevel here but it looks as if it's it's
a<00:05:20.369> it's<00:05:21.049> somewhat<00:05:22.049> of<00:05:22.079> a<00:05:22.289> almost<00:05:22.709> Scandi<00:05:23.489> grind

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:23.519 
a it's somewhat of a almost Scandi grind

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:26.479 
a it's somewhat of a almost Scandi grind
you<00:05:24.119> know<00:05:24.149> it's<00:05:24.749> got<00:05:24.959> a<00:05:24.989> little<00:05:25.379> a<00:05:25.559> little

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:26.489 
you know it's got a little a little

00:05:26.489 --> 00:05:28.699 
you know it's got a little a little
Scandi<00:05:27.059> grind<00:05:27.089> look<00:05:27.509> to<00:05:27.719> it<00:05:27.869> but<00:05:28.409> I<00:05:28.469> would

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:28.709 
Scandi grind look to it but I would

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:31.399 
Scandi grind look to it but I would
probably<00:05:29.269> refer<00:05:30.269> to<00:05:30.419> it<00:05:30.569> as<00:05:30.719> a<00:05:30.749> flat<00:05:31.079> grind

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
probably refer to it as a flat grind

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.399 
probably refer to it as a flat grind
with<00:05:31.619> a<00:05:31.649> secondary<00:05:32.509> but<00:05:33.509> it's<00:05:33.659> it's<00:05:33.989> really

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
with a secondary but it's it's really

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:35.539 
with a secondary but it's it's really
sharp

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:35.549 
sharp

00:05:35.549 --> 00:05:37.459 
sharp
I<00:05:35.579> would<00:05:36.119> probably<00:05:36.299> sharpen<00:05:36.839> it<00:05:36.929> a<00:05:36.959> bit<00:05:37.259> more

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
I would probably sharpen it a bit more

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:41.179 
I would probably sharpen it a bit more
to<00:05:37.529> make<00:05:37.829> it<00:05:37.860> hair-splitting<00:05:38.219> sharp<00:05:38.849> but<00:05:40.189> and

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:41.189 
to make it hair-splitting sharp but and

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:44.269 
to make it hair-splitting sharp but and
overall<00:05:41.669> a<00:05:41.879> really<00:05:42.019> really<00:05:43.019> nice<00:05:43.229> really<00:05:43.829> nice
