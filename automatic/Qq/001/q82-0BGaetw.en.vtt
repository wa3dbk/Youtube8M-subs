 thank you 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.090
 go home 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.550
 from 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.860
 not missing 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.850
 in half 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:22.450
 the controversy comes back to life 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.430
 to you 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.560
 to displace 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.129
 john m 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.400
 half 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.140
 it is not life 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.340
 Hello everyone, my name is Maria Piccaluga 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.010
 I'm a new body teacher 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.970
 teachers of the musical are teacher of 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.160
 vocal technique 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.019
 I'm here to present my course 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.360
 I would like to explain how one of mine unfolds 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.940
 lesson starts first from the 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.480
 body posture that the most thing 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.640
 important is the basis to then be able to 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.680
 then develop the technique from 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.450
 body posture then it starts with 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.239
 breathing exercises cost 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.580
 diaphragmatic and usually this part 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.739
 it takes little lesson time then yes 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.380
 part with the local vocalizations are 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.489
 obviously progressive depending on the 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.590
 student level 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.560
 we always start from the central area 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.870
 of the entry for then is exercised first 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.349
 the central area and then to increase 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.060
 the extension when the secure entry is there 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.989
 these item have upward or 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.470
 downward 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.390
 the most interesting part of the lesson 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.430
 obviously it's what 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.200
 which concerns the preparation of 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.490
 repertoire the repertoire can be said 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.680
 you choose based on the level 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.350
 student based on attitudes 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.780
 vocal and based on the extension of 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:45.940
 usually it starts with slow tunes that 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.950
 have long notes to create the 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.820
 sound position to have a sound 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.580
 effective and then you pass to tracks 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.280
 of higher difficulty always a 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.250
 depending on the student's level me 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.709
 I will also take the choir course 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.750
 at the beginning the repertoire will be more 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:08.500
 focused on pop for harmonization 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.410
 simpler and then together with the class 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.500
 we 'll level up and we'll do it 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.660
 we will approach melodic rock to soul and 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.450
 at the gospel the laboratory of course 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.540
 open to various levels of preparation e 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:26.010
 we will grow together with this I greet you 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:29.720
 and I wait for my courses bye 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.720
 of that other thing I said brown 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.580
 cut in half 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.480
