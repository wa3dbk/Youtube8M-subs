00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
just felt really good to be here it's

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.770 
just felt really good to be here it's
definitely<00:00:31.740> one<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.129> my<00:00:32.279> best<00:00:32.550> programs<00:00:33.030> my

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
definitely one of my best programs my

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.540 
definitely one of my best programs my
spins<00:00:34.170> were<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> lot<00:00:34.560> better<00:00:34.739> here<00:00:35.160> than<00:00:35.400> they

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
spins were a lot better here than they

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.880 
spins were a lot better here than they
have<00:00:35.760> been<00:00:35.970> in<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> past<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.810> my<00:00:37.380> speed<00:00:37.739> is

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
have been in the past and my speed is

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.400 
have been in the past and my speed is
improved<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.550> my<00:00:38.970> jumps<00:00:39.300> up<00:00:39.420> they<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.260> feel

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
improved and my jumps up they just feel

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.660 
improved and my jumps up they just feel
the<00:00:40.560> same<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:40.860> they<00:00:40.980> were<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:43.010> elementwise<00:00:44.010> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
the same as they were so elementwise I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.600 
the same as they were so elementwise I
think<00:00:45.120> it's<00:00:45.300> almost<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.780> same<00:00:45.930> but

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
think it's almost the same but

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.770 
think it's almost the same but
component-wise<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:48.059> definitely<00:00:48.540> gotten<00:00:48.720> a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
component-wise it's definitely gotten a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.990 
component-wise it's definitely gotten a
lot<00:00:48.899> better<00:00:49.140> for<00:00:49.410> me<00:00:49.470> I<00:00:49.890> really<00:00:50.370> feed<00:00:50.579> off<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
lot better for me I really feed off the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.450 
lot better for me I really feed off the
crowds<00:00:51.239> energy<00:00:51.840> especially<00:00:52.410> when<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> land<00:00:53.309> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
crowds energy especially when I land a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.959 
crowds energy especially when I land a
jump<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:53.969> they<00:00:54.680> clap<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.980> cheer<00:00:56.040> and<00:00:56.579> that

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
jump it's they clap and cheer and that

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.970 
jump it's they clap and cheer and that
gives<00:00:57.239> me<00:00:57.300> just<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.230> much<00:00:58.350> more<00:00:58.559> excitement<00:00:58.800> to

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
gives me just so much more excitement to

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.440 
gives me just so much more excitement to
get<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.340> next<00:00:59.520> jump<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.910> land<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.300> hear

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
get to the next jump and land it to hear

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.069 
get to the next jump and land it to hear
that<00:01:00.629> again

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
that again

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.780

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
after my jobs were done I just knew I

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.669 
after my jobs were done I just knew I
can<00:01:15.179> have<00:01:15.420> fun<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.929> rest<00:01:16.079> the<00:01:16.259> program

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 
can have fun for the rest the program

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:19.849 
can have fun for the rest the program
and<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.450> went<00:01:18.779> overboard<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.380> everything

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:19.859 
and I just went overboard on everything

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:21.349 
and I just went overboard on everything
and<00:01:20.039> the<00:01:20.100> footwear<00:01:20.429> sequence<00:01:20.909> was<00:01:21.029> so<00:01:21.209> much

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 
and the footwear sequence was so much

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.090 
and the footwear sequence was so much
easier<00:01:21.389> to<00:01:21.840> do<00:01:22.020> when<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.319> have<00:01:22.499> everyone<00:01:22.920> also

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
easier to do when you have everyone also

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.699 
easier to do when you have everyone also
clapping<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:23.819> you<00:01:24.029> and<00:01:24.439> still<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.679> that

00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:25.709 
clapping with you and still have that

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:27.830 
clapping with you and still have that
mentality<00:01:26.249> to<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:26.880> enjoy<00:01:27.209> everything<00:01:27.569> I'm

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
mentality to just enjoy everything I'm

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.279 
mentality to just enjoy everything I'm
doing

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
doing

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.010 
doing
I<00:01:28.619> learned<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.880> past<00:01:30.090> couple<00:01:30.299> weeks<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.869> if

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
I learned the past couple weeks that if

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.050 
I learned the past couple weeks that if
you<00:01:31.109> take<00:01:31.289> everything<00:01:31.590> too<00:01:31.889> seriously<00:01:32.060> you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
you take everything too seriously you

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.169 
you take everything too seriously you
won't<00:01:33.420> get<00:01:33.659> as<00:01:33.810> good<00:01:33.899> and<00:01:34.289> I<00:01:34.909> learned<00:01:35.909> that

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
won't get as good and I learned that

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.699 
won't get as good and I learned that
because<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.599> started<00:01:37.079> getting<00:01:37.319> nervous<00:01:37.469> for

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:37.709 
because I started getting nervous for

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:39.529 
because I started getting nervous for
this<00:01:37.859> competition<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.700> little<00:01:39.179> bit<00:01:39.420> because

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
this competition a little bit because

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.199 
this competition a little bit because
knowing<00:01:39.929> the<00:01:40.020> expectations<00:01:40.709> and<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.399> realized

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:42.209 
knowing the expectations and I realized

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:46.370 
knowing the expectations and I realized

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
times better than I have been lately and

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:49.609 
times better than I have been lately and
it<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.450> felt<00:01:48.659> amazing<00:01:48.779> just<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.319> have<00:01:49.590> fun

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
it just felt amazing just to have fun

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.459 
it just felt amazing just to have fun
and<00:01:49.859> know<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.490> do<00:01:50.609> it<00:01:50.639> I<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.630> have<00:01:52.109> the

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
and know I can do it I just have the

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.739 
and know I can do it I just have the
expectation<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.249> have<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.609> good<00:01:53.999> long<00:01:54.479> program

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:54.749 
expectation to have a good long program

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:56.599 
expectation to have a good long program
and<00:01:55.169> see<00:01:55.289> if<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.499> couldn't<00:01:55.679> feed<00:01:56.279> off<00:01:56.429> what<00:01:56.579> I

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
and see if I couldn't feed off what I

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:58.489 
and see if I couldn't feed off what I
did<00:01:56.819> today<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.119> make<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.200> through<00:01:58.409> another

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
did today and make it through another

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:01.370 
did today and make it through another
long<00:01:58.889> program<00:01:59.340> but<00:01:59.909> expectation<00:02:00.899> was

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
long program but expectation was

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.149 
long program but expectation was
replacing<00:02:02.039> I'm<00:02:02.219> not<00:02:02.399> expecting<00:02:02.939> too<00:02:03.119> much<00:02:03.179> I

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
replacing I'm not expecting too much I

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.800 
replacing I'm not expecting too much I
really<00:02:05.159> would<00:02:05.429> hope<00:02:05.609> to<00:02:05.880> win<00:02:06.029> this<00:02:06.239> year<00:02:06.569> and

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
really would hope to win this year and

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.389 
really would hope to win this year and
that's<00:02:07.289> something<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.649> wasn't<00:02:07.950> even<00:02:08.069> hoping

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
that's something I wasn't even hoping

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.110 
that's something I wasn't even hoping
for<00:02:08.580> last<00:02:08.759> year<00:02:09.119> but<00:02:10.280> other<00:02:11.280> than<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.790> if<00:02:12.000> I

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
for last year but other than that if I

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.750 
for last year but other than that if I
don't<00:02:12.300> make<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.600> podium<00:02:12.780> I'll<00:02:13.140> be<00:02:13.290> fine

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
a lot of more years to skate so if I

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.520 
a lot of more years to skate so if I
don't<00:02:19.640> make<00:02:19.879> the<00:02:20.030> podium<00:02:20.209> I'll<00:02:20.689> be<00:02:20.930> fine<00:02:21.170> but

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
if I metal I'll just be extraordinarily

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.800 
if I metal I'll just be extraordinarily
happy<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:25.010> knowing<00:02:25.459> that<00:02:25.640> it'll<00:02:26.299> just<00:02:26.420> be

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
happy and knowing that it'll just be

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.040
