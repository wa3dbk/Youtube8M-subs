00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.440
 thought to answer this tag before because 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.700
 There were some big responders but I 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.619
 I was really happy that she betrayed me 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.369
 So I'm going to answer it today. 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.890

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.390

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.490
 The second question is a lot until 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.380
 because you already have a video here of 50 talks 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.300
 About me so I decided that I'm going 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.220
 select some questions that I think 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.849

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.830

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.960
 the first question is what you are 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.270

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.489

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.110

 the second question how much do you move me? 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.550
 I have a method that has seven 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.140
 I'm very softly by photo so it looks like 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.789
 I'm not that tiny, right? 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.500
 I risked meeting you personally. 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.109
 amazed because I'm very little 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.010
 third question how much do you weigh? 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.090
 I ask between 45 and 46 pounds you have 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.640
 tattoos 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.760
 Yes, I have a tattoo here on my shoulder. 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.810
 what a star 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.060

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.189
 hair over and such has a tattoo 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.890
 in the belly are three stars in the 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.420
 belly has a tattoo on the back that 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.030
 It was my first tattoo I did 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.130
 at 14 and I have a tattoo on the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.390
 Ankle also and for now 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.850
 whenever I think to make a new one 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.860
 Tattoo I think very well nowadays 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.020
 so end up giving up then 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.659
 while you have piercings 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.220
 Yes, I have a navel piercing and I 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.439
 I had an ear piercing until I recorded it. 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.750
 a blog only that it was hurting a lot 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.240
 so did not rise much and last three 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.369
 weeks and had made a ball so I 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.979
 I picked up and decided to take the piercing and I think 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.780
 that the hole closed and I think I have 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.540
 what to do back because I was already 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.729
 cool has a little time here too the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.310
 lack of return to favorite band 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.380
 I do not have any favorite bands nor 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.460
 a favorite tv series no actor 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.250
 Favorite then I have no sign 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.319
 I'm Capricorn and I'm a typical 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.300
 Ukrainian house I already said that before 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.670
 much of my sign has 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.770
 with me not all like this but I believe 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.020
 many of these signs I think 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.360
 Someone tell you the second one of you. 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.650
 Can you define who you are born on the day 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.240
 January 16 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.520
 qualities needed in a companion 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.640
 I think he has to be a companion. 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.680
 first of all a person who knows 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.050
 What do you want from life that goes behind? 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.360
 Anyway, I think these qualities are good. 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.120
 legal and bring good person is also 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.950
 of course how long you take in the shower 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.900
 Good if I do not wash the hair slow 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.330
 now about ten minutes to wash the 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.520
 hair moisturize hair make a 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.800
 evaluation in the body and such 25 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.610
 minutes the meaning of your name in the 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.630
 youtube 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.580
 I think I already told this story 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.590
 that before I'm sure I've already counted 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.210
 this story that before I only saw the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.940
 videos of gringas then accompanied 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:03.180
 much the blair speaks that is to adjust or 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.370
 they serve and I saw her once telling 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.770
 she had created her channel because of 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.050
 a brand and such and that it was something that 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.060
 she liked when it came to creating the 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.820
 channel as it was a joke so not 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.370
 was nothing that had any pretension I 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.830
 I decided to think of something I liked and 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.420
 As I only saw the gringa channel I decided 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.770
 to create an English name 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.750
 then one thing that I liked 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.910
 manila vanilla 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.130
 Then I ended up getting a good vanilla. 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.020
 level the last person you talked to 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.630
 with a person I talked to 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.850
 thiago and what is its relation to a 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.580
 The person who sent you a message is 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.600
 bride but we call her boyfriend in the 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.220
 true, right? 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.920
 in the last message he sent me 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.050
 he sent me now saying that he 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.550
 woke up and such that he is trying 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:54.380
 lift favorite sweet black chocolate 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.380
 I'm sure I'm recording videos. 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.170
 practice some good sport sport 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.120
 sport for now but not me 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.150
 I did the academy many years ago, I already said that. 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.310
 before it's easy truck seven years I think 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.920
 which proves that those who go to the gym at 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.420
 that will not get gt pumping and such that 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.769
 There are a lot of people who use the excuse 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.780
 Dad does not do gym that does not want to stay. 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.700
 with the male body has nothing to do 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.100
 This is because it makes trucks seven years I 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.840
 I'm small then but I want to start 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.550
 do yoga and my team this year yet 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.470
 do because I'm always going to do more 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.990
 type our honored 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.560
 how old you are in the unit 20 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.970
 huh 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.000
 but my ID card says 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.490
 that I'm 26 but I stopped 20 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.919
 so I can see myself with 20 but with 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.320
 certainty would not change the experience of 26 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.780
 years I think it's not a type I accept 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.350
 who has 26 understood but I look 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.380
 I do not see myself at 26 with certainty 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.169
 and who should answer those 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.750
 questions do not vote for anyone I think 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.120
 whoever likes the questions will visit 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.940
 guided and answer if you want me 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.830
 I'll leave 50 questions there on the blog then 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.360
 You'll know what the 50's are. 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.490
 questions that I did not answer 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.100
 So that's how much you had. 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.680
 I like to know a little better 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.450
 Thank marcela and she is 15 years old was 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.550

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:20.860
