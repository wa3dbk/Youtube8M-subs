 that is a training for pilots who lives in Amsterdam 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.029

 Preses School is based on the thought that Stijnen and 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.620
 Flevoland finds appropriate 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.969
 That say there is a confluence to people who have a ticket 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.140
 we all work together 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.960
 and for me it is all very much to my feeling as my feeling 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.960
 I also blame it on the fertility rate 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.890
 the distribution does not 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.590
 the nobody here together

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.610
 not to say 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.990
 a lot of very big shock or great measure 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.060
 but on the contrary 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.030
 taste 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.760
 and that the plant really good food and 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.230
 has matured 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.230
 really a lot of value I think that personally 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.860
 those in the past that also play the one game that you do 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.110
 comfortable in your skin 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.400
 we searched 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.340
 to have 12 hours 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.150

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.389
 and dance afternoon practice but it is nevertheless in having surrendered 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.929
 chris afternoon immediately put into practice 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.059
 and also see if it is correct and thereby learn and what falls as well as what is good 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:18.769

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.809
 and they released walking around the orchard and then after ten weeks they too 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.609
 slaughter yourself and sell in it 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.769
 And that it was very nice that you learn how to become a business one 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.669
 set up all by myself and I didn't do a lot of mistakes and I did 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:38.669
