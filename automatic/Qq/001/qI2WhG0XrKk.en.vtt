00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
watch a video a while back where it

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.340 
watch a video a while back where it
shows<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.470> leaked<00:01:08.090> was<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> leak<00:01:09.450> file<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
shows the leaked was a leak file of the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.859 
shows the leaked was a leak file of the
packet<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.860> camera<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.490> was<00:01:11.670> before

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
packet on camera but this was before

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.750 
packet on camera but this was before
this<00:01:12.869> was<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> production<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:14.070> black<00:01:14.580> ops

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
this was in the production of black ops

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.850 
this was in the production of black ops
2<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.450> wild<00:01:15.900> before<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.290> was<00:01:16.439> actually

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
2 so this is wild before I was actually

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.399 
2 so this is wild before I was actually
like<00:01:17.189> being<00:01:17.460> released<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> game<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.930> that's<00:01:19.320> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
like being released the game so that's a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.109 
like being released the game so that's a
bit<00:01:19.560> weird<00:01:19.590> how<00:01:19.979> they've<00:01:20.159> actually<00:01:20.369> now<00:01:20.729> done

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
bit weird how they've actually now done

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.640 
bit weird how they've actually now done
it<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.420> I'm<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:21.810> sure<00:01:21.960> if<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.080> was<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
it and I'm not sure if that was the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.710 
it and I'm not sure if that was the
original<00:01:23.009> file<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.610> came<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.299> anyway

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
original file that it came in but anyway

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.679

think they should be a lot cheaper like
80<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.470> mean<00:02:41.830> we<00:02:42.760> as<00:02:43.030> gamers<00:02:43.360> do<00:02:43.720> pay<00:02:43.959> a<00:02:43.989> lot<00:02:44.349> for

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
80 I mean we as gamers do pay a lot for

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.100 
80 I mean we as gamers do pay a lot for
like<00:02:44.920> DLC<00:02:45.610> content<00:02:45.790> like<00:02:46.209> every<00:02:46.630> single<00:02:46.900> map

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
pack and as well as that they're now

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.530 
pack and as well as that they're now
doing<00:02:49.410> gun<00:02:50.410> skins<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.489> is<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:52.269> has<00:02:52.420> been

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
doing gun skins and is this has been

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.210 
doing gun skins and is this has been
done<00:02:52.720> before<00:02:52.900> just<00:02:53.380> leaves<00:02:53.560> like<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.920> second

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
done before just leaves like the second

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.710 
done before just leaves like the second
one<00:02:54.250> or<00:02:54.489> third<00:02:54.700> one<00:02:54.910> coming<00:02:55.150> out<00:02:55.269> because<00:02:55.390> the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
one or third one coming out because the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.750 
one or third one coming out because the
dragon<00:02:56.230> one<00:02:56.349> counts<00:02:56.890> as<00:02:56.980> sort<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.340> one<00:02:57.519> what<00:02:57.670> we

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
dragon one counts as sort of one what we

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.699 
dragon one counts as sort of one what we
voted<00:02:58.120> for<00:02:58.299> it<00:02:58.420> but<00:02:59.079> I<00:02:59.200> just<00:02:59.260> think<00:02:59.470> they

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
voted for it but I just think they

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.350 
voted for it but I just think they
should<00:02:59.739> make<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.519> lot<00:03:00.700> cheaper<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:01.239> it

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
should make it a lot cheaper and it

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.729 
should make it a lot cheaper and it
should<00:03:01.540> be<00:03:01.720> free<00:03:01.989> for<00:03:02.230> season<00:03:02.560> pass<00:03:02.709> holders

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
should be free for season pass holders

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.300 
should be free for season pass holders
because<00:03:03.250> they<00:03:03.970> pay<00:03:04.239> extra<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.019> it<00:03:05.860> should<00:03:06.160> be

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
because they pay extra and it should be

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.680 
because they pay extra and it should be
exclusive<00:03:06.849> to<00:03:06.879> them<00:03:07.120> well<00:03:07.420> not<00:03:07.540> exclusively

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
exclusive to them well not exclusively

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.199 
exclusive to them well not exclusively
well<00:03:08.379> we<00:03:08.709> should<00:03:08.860> be<00:03:09.010> able<00:03:09.099> to<00:03:09.340> buy<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.549> few

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
well we should be able to buy a few

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.390 
well we should be able to buy a few
tighter<00:03:10.450> few<00:03:10.840> months<00:03:11.140> later<00:03:11.260> but<00:03:11.709> still<00:03:12.370> I

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
tighter few months later but still I

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.640 
tighter few months later but still I
don't<00:03:12.579> think<00:03:12.790> it's<00:03:13.660> worth<00:03:13.959> buying<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.440> money

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
don't think it's worth buying the money

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.099 
don't think it's worth buying the money
but<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.220> might<00:03:15.610> just<00:03:15.879> go<00:03:16.030> in<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.269> go<00:03:16.720> ahead<00:03:16.930> and

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
but I might just go in and go ahead and

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.599 
but I might just go in and go ahead and
buy<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.230> pack<00:03:17.470> of<00:03:17.560> Butch<00:03:17.709> one<00:03:17.920> and<00:03:18.069> so<00:03:18.160> become

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
buy the pack of Butch one and so become

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.509 
buy the pack of Butch one and so become
a<00:03:18.639> naturalized<00:03:18.790> 23rd<00:03:19.569> on<00:03:19.690> xbox<00:03:20.019> 360<00:03:20.590> with<00:03:21.370> the

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
a naturalized 23rd on xbox 360 with the

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.660 
a naturalized 23rd on xbox 360 with the
update<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.989> think<00:03:23.350> I<00:03:23.410> presume<00:03:23.829> a<00:03:24.069> month

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
update and I think I presume a month
