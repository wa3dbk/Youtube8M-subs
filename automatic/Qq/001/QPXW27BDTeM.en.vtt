I<00:00:11.970> wish<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.110> had<00:00:13.230> some<00:00:13.349> pH<00:00:13.650> paper<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.190> test<00:00:14.400> the

I'm<00:00:15.809> sure<00:00:16.020> it's<00:00:16.170> acidic<00:00:16.650> but<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.550> lot<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.820> fungi

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
I'm sure it's acidic but a lot of fungi

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.320 
I'm sure it's acidic but a lot of fungi
per<00:00:18.270> surface<00:00:18.570> prefer<00:00:19.500> acidic<00:00:20.010> conditions<00:00:20.520> so

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
per surface prefer acidic conditions so

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:31.040 
per surface prefer acidic conditions so
I'm<00:00:21.420> gonna<00:00:21.540> dump<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:24.860> little<00:00:25.860> in<00:00:26.099> there<00:00:30.050> cover

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
I'm gonna dump a little in there cover

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:43.549 
I'm gonna dump a little in there cover
this<00:00:39.110> some<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.140> there<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.860> then<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> rest<00:00:42.559> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
this some in there and then the rest the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.990 
this some in there and then the rest the
sort<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.890> control<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.640> gonna<00:00:44.820> have

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
sort of control one is gonna have

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.180 
sort of control one is gonna have
everything<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:47.239> it's<00:00:48.239> enough<00:00:48.510> peels<00:00:49.190> so

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
everything in it it's enough peels so

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.819 
everything in it it's enough peels so
put<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.519> aside<00:00:51.949> put<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.100> aside<00:00:54.620> get<00:00:55.620> this

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
put this aside put this aside get this

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:10.849 
put this aside put this aside get this
out<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> way<00:00:59.929> so

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:10.859 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:13.050 

labeled<00:01:11.859> these<00:01:11.979> incorrectly<00:01:12.609> gonna<00:01:12.850> have<00:01:12.969> to

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
labeled these incorrectly gonna have to

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.539 
labeled these incorrectly gonna have to
switch<00:01:13.329> those<00:01:13.539> labels<00:01:14.049> around<00:01:14.409> I<00:01:14.679> poured<00:01:15.490> the

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
switch those labels around I poured the

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.600 
switch those labels around I poured the
ones<00:01:15.759> with<00:01:15.969> the<00:01:16.119> rinds<00:01:16.360> into<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:16.780> wrong<00:01:16.960> one

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
ones with the rinds into the wrong one

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:31.399 
ones with the rinds into the wrong one
but<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:20.320> aside<00:01:21.360> I'm<00:01:22.360> gonna<00:01:22.569> take<00:01:28.649> this<00:01:29.649> straw

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
but that aside I'm gonna take this straw

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.669 
but that aside I'm gonna take this straw
and<00:01:32.409> I've<00:01:32.530> cleared<00:01:33.039> a<00:01:33.159> spot<00:01:33.459> away<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.530> I'm

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
and I've cleared a spot away and I'm

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.649 
and I've cleared a spot away and I'm
gonna<00:01:35.829> try<00:01:36.219> and<00:01:36.399> take<00:01:36.670> sort<00:01:37.030> of<00:01:37.090> like<00:01:37.240> a<00:01:37.270> core

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
gonna try and take sort of like a core

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.679 
gonna try and take sort of like a core
sample<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:39.640> what's<00:01:39.939> inside<00:01:42.450> one<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.479> these

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
sample of what's inside one of these

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:53.819 
sample of what's inside one of these
pieces<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:49.289> I'm<00:01:50.289> gonna<00:01:50.470> put<00:01:50.679> that<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:53.500> this

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
pieces and I'm gonna put that in this

00:01:53.829 --> 00:02:06.779 
pieces and I'm gonna put that in this
one<00:02:00.810> cover<00:02:01.810> this<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:04.060> one<00:02:04.299> is<00:02:04.329> a<00:02:04.569> white<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:06.399> I

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
one cover this this one is a white so I

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:16.900 
one cover this this one is a white so I
have<00:02:07.239> some<00:02:09.209> toothpicks<00:02:10.209> for<00:02:10.420> that

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.740 

actually<00:02:17.910> going<00:02:18.180> outside<00:02:20.180> it's<00:02:21.180> hard<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.600> do

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
actually going outside it's hard to do

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:35.330 
actually going outside it's hard to do
with<00:02:21.900> one<00:02:22.110> hand

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.479 

so<00:02:35.970> we<00:02:36.180> got<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.360> little<00:02:36.660> bit<00:02:36.780> on<00:02:36.900> there<00:02:37.190> no<00:02:38.190> it's

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
so we got a little bit on there no it's

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.309 
so we got a little bit on there no it's
enough<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.790> start<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.150> culture<00:02:39.480> but<00:02:39.599> we'll<00:02:39.750> see

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:49.670 

get<00:02:43.319> that<00:02:43.530> off<00:02:43.830> in<00:02:44.099> there<00:02:47.420> cover<00:02:48.420> this<00:02:48.680> and

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
get that off in there cover this and

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.270 
get that off in there cover this and
then<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.950> last<00:02:50.160> one<00:02:50.459> we'll<00:02:51.300> just<00:02:51.330> let<00:02:51.780> grow

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
then the last one we'll just let grow

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.309 
then the last one we'll just let grow
alright<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.610> last<00:02:53.640> step<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.420> switch<00:02:55.110> the

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
alright the last step is to switch the

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.630 
alright the last step is to switch the
label<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:57.380> put<00:02:58.380> them<00:02:58.530> down<00:02:58.709> here<00:02:59.099> in<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.370> dark

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
label and put them down here in the dark

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.259 
label and put them down here in the dark
and<00:03:04.550> we'll<00:03:05.550> come<00:03:05.700> back<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.000> him<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.239> couple

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
and we'll come back to him in a couple

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.660 
and we'll come back to him in a couple
days
