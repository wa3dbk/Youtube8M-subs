aerial<00:01:48.270> ability<00:01:48.390> Hoshi<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
aerial ability Hoshi is not the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.460

him yourself and his aerial ability for
me<00:01:56.640> was<00:01:56.880> really<00:01:57.090> bad<00:01:57.420> if<00:01:57.630> he<00:01:57.659> did<00:01:57.930> get<00:01:58.170> into<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
me was really bad if he did get into the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.980 
me was really bad if he did get into the
position<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.340> maybe<00:01:59.850> try<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.479> win<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.810> ball

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
position to maybe try and win the ball

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.440 
position to maybe try and win the ball
via<00:02:01.259> header<00:02:01.619> he<00:02:02.310> would<00:02:02.490> not<00:02:02.700> even<00:02:02.850> jump<00:02:03.270> for<00:02:03.600> it

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
via header he would not even jump for it

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.300 
via header he would not even jump for it
and<00:02:04.540> if<00:02:05.110> he<00:02:05.229> did<00:02:05.409> manage<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.770> get<00:02:05.950> his<00:02:06.130> head

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
and if he did manage to get his head

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.699 
and if he did manage to get his head
onto<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:07.119> ball<00:02:07.390> then<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:07.990> accuracy<00:02:08.319> was

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
onto the ball then the accuracy was

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.440 
onto the ball then the accuracy was
horrible<00:02:09.160> behind<00:02:09.520> it<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:09.910> there<00:02:10.090> was<00:02:10.209> hardly

horrible behind it and there was hardly

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.830 
horrible behind it and there was hardly
any<00:02:10.780> power<00:02:11.230> behind<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.880> challenge<00:02:13.630> the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
any power behind it to challenge the

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
hadji is an insane ledger

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.789 
hadji is an insane ledger
this<00:04:14.790> year<00:04:15.030> very<00:04:15.510> very<00:04:15.870> similar<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.680> the

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
this year very very similar to the

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.610 
this year very very similar to the
Portuguese<00:04:17.310> legend<00:04:17.790> Rui<00:04:18.269> Costa<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:19.380> actually

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
Portuguese legend Rui Costa I actually

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.560 
Portuguese legend Rui Costa I actually
found<00:04:20.040> no<00:04:20.580> differences<00:04:21.120> they<00:04:21.299> were<00:04:21.390> pretty

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
found no differences they were pretty

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.810 
found no differences they were pretty
much<00:04:21.780> identical<00:04:22.100> how<00:04:23.100> they<00:04:23.250> performed<00:04:23.700> in

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
much identical how they performed in

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.420 
much identical how they performed in
game<00:04:24.060> I<00:04:24.090> enjoyed<00:04:24.510> them<00:04:24.720> just<00:04:25.080> as<00:04:25.230> much<00:04:25.470> and<00:04:26.340> I

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
game I enjoyed them just as much and I

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.760 
game I enjoyed them just as much and I
think<00:04:26.700> I<00:04:26.790> pretty<00:04:27.030> much<00:04:27.120> found<00:04:27.480> the<00:04:28.230> exact<00:04:28.560> same

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
think I pretty much found the exact same

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.220 
think I pretty much found the exact same
strengths<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.520> weaknesses<00:04:30.390> between<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:31.020> two

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
strengths and weaknesses between the two

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.680 
strengths and weaknesses between the two
but<00:04:31.920> I've<00:04:32.190> gotta<00:04:32.460> say<00:04:32.520> Hadji<00:04:33.000> is<00:04:33.150> not<00:04:33.450> worth

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
but I've gotta say Hadji is not worth

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.570 
but I've gotta say Hadji is not worth
the<00:04:33.870> coins<00:04:34.140> right<00:04:34.560> now<00:04:34.800> because<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.220> market

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
the coins right now because the market

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.820 
the coins right now because the market
is<00:04:35.640> a<00:04:35.700> bit<00:04:35.910> crazy<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.720> personally<00:04:37.680> recommend

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
is a bit crazy I personally recommend

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.950 
is a bit crazy I personally recommend
you<00:04:38.250> wait<00:04:38.400> for<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.610> market<00:04:38.970> to<00:04:39.000> settle<00:04:39.600> but

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
you wait for the market to settle but

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.540 
you wait for the market to settle but
then<00:04:40.140> again<00:04:40.260> saying<00:04:40.710> that<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:41.040> market<00:04:41.400> has

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
then again saying that the market has

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.760 
then again saying that the market has
been<00:04:41.790> crazy<00:04:42.240> for<00:04:42.480> quite<00:04:42.900> some<00:04:43.170> time<00:04:43.200> and<00:04:43.650> I'm

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
been crazy for quite some time and I'm

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.500 
been crazy for quite some time and I'm
honestly<00:04:44.100> not<00:04:44.430> sure<00:04:44.700> whether<00:04:45.030> or<00:04:45.150> not<00:04:45.270> the

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
honestly not sure whether or not the

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.440 
honestly not sure whether or not the
market<00:04:45.930> is<00:04:46.110> going<00:04:46.830> to<00:04:47.040> settle<00:04:47.340> so<00:04:48.090> whether<00:04:48.300> or

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
market is going to settle so whether or

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.150 
market is going to settle so whether or
not<00:04:48.570> you<00:04:48.720> want<00:04:48.900> to<00:04:48.990> spend<00:04:49.200> I<00:04:49.350> think<00:04:49.380> 2.5

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
not you want to spend I think 2.5

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.520 
not you want to spend I think 2.5
million<00:04:50.490> coins<00:04:50.880> on<00:04:51.180> him<00:04:51.420> is<00:04:51.630> your<00:04:51.930> decision

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
million coins on him is your decision

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.470 
million coins on him is your decision
personally<00:04:52.950> what<00:04:53.550> a<00:04:53.580> good<00:04:53.820> idea<00:04:53.850> and<00:04:54.210> I<00:04:54.270> think

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
personally what a good idea and I think

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.330 
personally what a good idea and I think
would<00:04:54.600> be<00:04:54.630> to<00:04:54.780> do<00:04:55.050> is<00:04:55.200> to<00:04:55.350> use<00:04:55.560> really<00:04:55.830> coaster

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
would be to do is to use really coaster

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.760 
would be to do is to use really coaster
instead<00:04:56.760> because<00:04:57.180> like<00:04:57.330> I<00:04:57.450> said<00:04:57.510> Ruby<00:04:58.320> coaster

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
instead because like I said Ruby coaster

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.950 
instead because like I said Ruby coaster
is<00:04:58.890> pretty<00:04:59.130> much<00:04:59.280> exactly<00:04:59.700> the<00:04:59.970> same<00:05:00.060> as<00:05:00.480> Hadji

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
is pretty much exactly the same as Hadji

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.800 
is pretty much exactly the same as Hadji
