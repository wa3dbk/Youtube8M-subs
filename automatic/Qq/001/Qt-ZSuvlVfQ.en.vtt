00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
in the game today I think at the time

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:16.450 
in the game today I think at the time
when<00:06:15.599> you're<00:06:15.750> in<00:06:15.870> the<00:06:15.960> heat<00:06:16.110> of<00:06:16.139> the<00:06:16.229> battle

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
when you're in the heat of the battle

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.770

it's<00:06:17.460> a<00:06:17.550> lot<00:06:17.729> more<00:06:17.909> about<00:06:18.180> the<00:06:18.300> scores<00:06:18.659> but

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
it's a lot more about the scores but

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.719 
it's a lot more about the scores but
when<00:06:19.080> you<00:06:19.139> get<00:06:19.289> older<00:06:19.590> and<00:06:19.770> you<00:06:20.009> coach<00:06:20.460> them

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
when you get older and you coach them

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:21.710 
when you get older and you coach them
and<00:06:20.759> you've<00:06:21.030> been<00:06:21.150> around<00:06:21.330> the<00:06:21.509> block<00:06:21.599> a

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
and you've been around the block a

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.510 
and you've been around the block a
little<00:06:22.020> bit<00:06:22.139> you<00:06:22.710> realize<00:06:23.009> that<00:06:23.039> what<00:06:23.400> really

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
little bit you realize that what really

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.029 
little bit you realize that what really
matters<00:06:23.699> is<00:06:24.240> not<00:06:24.449> so<00:06:24.630> much<00:06:24.780> what<00:06:25.680> you<00:06:25.710> shoot

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
matters is not so much what you shoot

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.010 
matters is not so much what you shoot
but<00:06:26.340> more<00:06:26.610> about<00:06:26.849> what<00:06:27.300> the<00:06:27.449> experience<00:06:27.930> was
