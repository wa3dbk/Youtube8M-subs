hey YouTube what's going on command a

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.350 
hey YouTube what's going on command a
cabal<00:00:02.129> here<00:00:02.310> and<00:00:02.550> today<00:00:02.700> I<00:00:02.850> want<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.270> be

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
cabal here and today I want to be

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.130 
cabal here and today I want to be
showing<00:00:03.510> new<00:00:03.720> version<00:00:04.200> two<00:00:04.560> of<00:00:04.589> my<00:00:06.140> vending

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
showing new version two of my vending

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.290 
showing new version two of my vending
machine<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.649> basically<00:00:08.370> my<00:00:08.490> first<00:00:08.849> one<00:00:09.090> was

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
machine and basically my first one was

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.419 
machine and basically my first one was
this<00:00:09.510> one<00:00:09.660> right<00:00:09.780> here<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.170> you<00:00:10.980> could<00:00:11.099> put<00:00:11.309> in

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
this one right here and you could put in

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.820 
this one right here and you could put in
one<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.090> can<00:00:12.120> only<00:00:12.330> get<00:00:12.570> out<00:00:12.750> one<00:00:12.960> version

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
one and you can only get out one version

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.050 
one and you can only get out one version
2<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:15.150> can<00:00:15.299> still<00:00:15.599> only<00:00:15.809> put<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.230> one<00:00:16.260> of

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
2 is you can still only put in one of

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.570 
2 is you can still only put in one of
the<00:00:18.060> currency<00:00:18.420> but<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.289> can<00:00:19.470> get<00:00:19.619> multiple<00:00:20.400> ah

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
the currency but you can get multiple ah

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.310 
the currency but you can get multiple ah
multiple<00:00:25.220> products<00:00:26.220> i<00:00:26.460> guess<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.970> i<00:00:27.720> also

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
multiple products i guess and i also

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.250 
multiple products i guess and i also
have<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> system<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:30.090> if<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.420> still<00:00:30.720> only<00:00:30.960> want

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
have a system for if you still only want

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.700 
have a system for if you still only want
one<00:00:31.500> product<00:00:32.040> per<00:00:32.550> item<00:00:33.090> then<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.530> build

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
one product per item then you can build

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.470 
one product per item then you can build
the<00:00:34.860> smaller<00:00:35.219> system<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.170> if<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.320> want<00:00:37.620> a

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
the smaller system and if you want a

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.139 
the smaller system and if you want a
more<00:00:39.980> than<00:00:40.980> one<00:00:41.160> then<00:00:41.430> you'd<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.969> build

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
more than one then you'd have to build

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.139 
more than one then you'd have to build
this<00:00:42.500> system<00:00:43.500> which<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:44.280> honestly<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> most

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
this system which is honestly the most

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.029 
this system which is honestly the most
compact<00:00:45.600> way<00:00:45.840> i<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:46.079> figure<00:00:46.500> out<00:00:46.649> how<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.920> make

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
compact way i can figure out how to make

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.970 
compact way i can figure out how to make
it<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.670> anyway<00:00:48.059> i'm<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.360> gonna<00:00:48.770> in<00:00:49.770> this

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
it but anyway i'm just gonna in this

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.740 
it but anyway i'm just gonna in this
video<00:00:50.160> i'll<00:00:50.460> upload<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.910> tutorial<00:00:51.270> once<00:00:51.629> i

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
video i'll upload a tutorial once i

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.500 
video i'll upload a tutorial once i
figure<00:00:51.989> out<00:00:52.110> how<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.320> put<00:00:53.219> multiple<00:00:53.730> stuff

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
figure out how to put multiple stuff

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.819 
figure out how to put multiple stuff
into<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.840> because<00:00:55.079> i<00:00:55.140> know<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.410> possible

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
into this because i know it's possible

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.889 
into this because i know it's possible
but<00:00:56.030> i<00:00:57.030> just<00:00:57.210> need<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.420> figure<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.690> out<00:00:57.750> and

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
but i just need to figure it out and

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.740 
but i just need to figure it out and
then<00:00:57.960> i'll<00:00:58.109> make<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.289> tutorial<00:00:58.649> on<00:00:59.539> every<00:01:00.539> one

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
then i'll make a tutorial on every one

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.369 
then i'll make a tutorial on every one
after<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.800> um<00:01:02.160> i<00:01:02.940> will<00:01:03.359> however<00:01:03.690> explain

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
after that so um i will however explain

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.230 
after that so um i will however explain
how<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.739> works<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.309> basically<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.000> first

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
how it works so basically on this first

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.039 
how it works so basically on this first
one<00:01:06.450> double<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.340> my<00:01:08.640> dad<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.030> vacuuming<00:01:09.570> so

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
one double the a my dad is vacuuming so

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.800 
one double the a my dad is vacuuming so
uh<00:01:10.850> hopefully<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.150> can't<00:01:12.360> hear<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.630> that

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
uh hopefully you can't hear that that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.030 
uh hopefully you can't hear that that
well<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.200> uh<00:01:13.820> anyway<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:17.310> orange<00:01:17.520> target<00:01:17.820> is

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
well but uh anyway the orange target is

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.960 
well but uh anyway the orange target is
what<00:01:20.040> detects<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:21.350> currency<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:23.759> red

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
what detects the currency and the red

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.740 
what detects the currency and the red
circuit<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.600> what<00:01:25.310> it's<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:27.450> what

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
circuit is what it's the it's what

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.940 
circuit is what it's the it's what
powers<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:29.090> it's<00:01:30.090> what<00:01:30.270> allows<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:31.110> circuit<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
powers the it's what allows a circuit to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.130 
powers the it's what allows a circuit to
go<00:01:32.070> through<00:01:32.400> from<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.640> buttons<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:33.990> this

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
go through from the buttons so if this

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.569 
go through from the buttons so if this
red<00:01:34.409> circuits<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:35.009> then<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:37.829> buttons<00:01:38.310> will

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
red circuits on then the buttons will

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.080 
red circuits on then the buttons will
work<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.479> green<00:01:39.750> circuit<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:41.700> circuit

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
work the green circuit is the circuit

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.780 
work the green circuit is the circuit
that<00:01:42.270> dispenses<00:01:42.960> an<00:01:43.110> item<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:44.640> blue

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
that dispenses an item and the blue

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.670 
that dispenses an item and the blue
circuit<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.659> reset<00:01:46.549> so<00:01:47.930> hopefully<00:01:48.930> if<00:01:49.500> I

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
circuit is the reset so hopefully if I

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.929 
circuit is the reset so hopefully if I
just<00:01:49.920> stare<00:01:50.159> out<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.340> little<00:01:50.579> bit<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.820> might

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
just stare out a little bit you might

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.789 
just stare out a little bit you might
understand<00:01:51.540> how<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.810> works<00:01:52.490> when<00:01:53.490> more<00:01:53.790> than

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
understand how it works when more than

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.039 
understand how it works when more than
22<00:01:55.799> are<00:01:56.040> put<00:01:56.219> into<00:01:56.340> here<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.180> pushes<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.750> over

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
22 are put into here it pushes this over

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.080 
22 are put into here it pushes this over
here<00:01:58.200> which<00:01:58.439> turns<00:01:58.770> these<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.430> which<00:01:59.759> allows

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
here which turns these on which allows

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.749 
here which turns these on which allows
the<00:02:01.020> button<00:02:01.409> signal<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.950> go<00:02:02.100> through<00:02:02.460> and

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
the button signal to go through and

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.240 
the button signal to go through and
whatever<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.899> goes<00:02:04.079> through<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.619> gets<00:02:04.770> reset

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
whatever it goes through it gets reset

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.069 
whatever it goes through it gets reset
that<00:02:05.700> means<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.180> only<00:02:06.299> use<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.600> once<00:02:06.780> i

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
that means you can only use it once i

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.350 
that means you can only use it once i
will<00:02:07.259> demonstrate<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:08.520> only<00:02:08.759> use<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.030> once

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
will demonstrate and only use this once

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.559 
will demonstrate and only use this once
i<00:02:09.750> will<00:02:10.379> even<00:02:10.739> here

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
i will even here

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.690 
i will even here
let<00:02:11.749> me<00:02:11.900> fill<00:02:12.319> up<00:02:12.499> this<00:02:13.069> is<00:02:13.280> something<00:02:13.579> we

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
let me fill up this is something we

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.220 
let me fill up this is something we
doesn't<00:02:14.120> necessarily<00:02:14.629> have<00:02:14.749> to<00:02:14.780> be<00:02:14.870> what's<00:02:15.109> on

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
doesn't necessarily have to be what's on

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.729 
doesn't necessarily have to be what's on
the<00:02:15.319> signs<00:02:15.560> but<00:02:16.359> they're<00:02:17.469> all<00:02:18.469> right<00:02:18.590> I<00:02:18.620> will

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
the signs but they're all right I will

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.500 
the signs but they're all right I will
try<00:02:19.099> to<00:02:19.159> click<00:02:19.370> both<00:02:19.549> of<00:02:19.760> them<00:02:19.879> as<00:02:19.939> fast<00:02:20.299> as

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
try to click both of them as fast as

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.170 
try to click both of them as fast as
possible<00:02:20.719> so<00:02:21.260> as<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:25.430> can<00:02:25.519> see<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:25.790> only<00:02:25.999> gave

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
possible so as you can see it only gave

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.849 
possible so as you can see it only gave
me<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.420> Apple<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.749> didn't<00:02:26.930> give<00:02:27.019> me<00:02:27.109> this<00:02:27.290> I'll

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:27.859 
me the Apple I didn't give me this I'll

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.670 
me the Apple I didn't give me this I'll
show<00:02:28.129> you<00:02:28.189> that<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:28.459> works<00:02:28.730> too<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.389> as<00:02:30.260> you

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
show you that this works too and as you

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.949 
show you that this works too and as you
can<00:02:30.799> see<00:02:30.829> I<00:02:31.250> can't<00:02:31.819> put<00:02:32.000> anything<00:02:32.389> else<00:02:32.780> in

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
can see I can't put anything else in

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.170 
can see I can't put anything else in
here<00:02:33.139> except<00:02:33.500> for<00:02:33.530> diamond<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.250> did<00:02:34.790> not<00:02:34.969> really

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
here except for diamond I did not really

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.520 
here except for diamond I did not really
explain<00:02:35.569> that<00:02:35.719> that<00:02:35.959> will<00:02:36.109> in<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.349> last

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
explain that that will in that last

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.280 
explain that that will in that last
video<00:02:36.739> but<00:02:37.540> anyway<00:02:38.540> i'll<00:02:38.719> just<00:02:38.900> show<00:02:39.049> you<00:02:39.079> that

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
video but anyway i'll just show you that

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.199 
video but anyway i'll just show you that
this<00:02:39.500> other<00:02:39.889> shot<00:02:40.219> works<00:02:40.280> also<00:02:40.700> so<00:02:41.090> i'll<00:02:41.180> click

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
this other shot works also so i'll click

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.800 
this other shot works also so i'll click
this<00:02:41.629> one<00:02:41.689> i<00:02:42.760> click<00:02:43.760> them<00:02:43.909> both<00:02:44.090> as<00:02:44.299> fast<00:02:44.540> as<00:02:44.719> i

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
this one i click them both as fast as i

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.860 
this one i click them both as fast as i
could<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.609> yeah<00:02:46.609> so<00:02:47.060> that's<00:02:47.450> how<00:02:47.569> it<00:02:47.659> works

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
could and yeah so that's how it works

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.429 
could and yeah so that's how it works
really<00:02:48.590> well<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:49.599> now<00:02:50.599> this<00:02:50.750> one<00:02:51.019> is<00:02:51.049> a<00:02:51.319> little

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:51.439 
really well and now this one is a little

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.339 
really well and now this one is a little
bit<00:02:51.739> more<00:02:51.889> complicated<00:02:52.629> but<00:02:53.629> i<00:02:53.900> can<00:02:54.109> try<00:02:54.290> to

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
bit more complicated but i can try to

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.559 
bit more complicated but i can try to
explain<00:02:54.620> it<00:02:54.769> to<00:02:54.889> you<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.159> basically<00:02:55.699> I'm<00:02:56.480> just

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
explain it to you so basically I'm just

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.339 
explain it to you so basically I'm just
going<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.810> get<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.959> stack<00:02:57.230> of<00:02:57.260> these<00:02:57.530> um

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
going to get a stack of these um

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.119 
going to get a stack of these um
basically<00:03:00.349> you<00:03:01.069> put<00:03:01.250> in<00:03:01.400> your<00:03:01.489> diamond<00:03:01.909> and<00:03:03.129> I

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
basically you put in your diamond and I

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:05.949 
basically you put in your diamond and I
might<00:03:04.430> have<00:03:04.819> a<00:03:04.849> circuit<00:03:05.359> yeah<00:03:05.599> I<00:03:05.629> have<00:03:05.930> a

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
might have a circuit yeah I have a

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.240 
might have a circuit yeah I have a
circuit<00:03:06.349> going<00:03:06.560> right<00:03:06.680> here<00:03:06.769> that<00:03:06.919> does<00:03:07.069> not

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
circuit going right here that does not

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.349 
circuit going right here that does not
work<00:03:07.489> I<00:03:08.079> will<00:03:09.079> have<00:03:09.199> to<00:03:09.609> try<00:03:10.609> this<00:03:10.669> again<00:03:11.000> later

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
work I will have to try this again later

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:13.720 
work I will have to try this again later
but<00:03:12.230> anyway<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.709> is<00:03:12.829> in<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.069> position<00:03:13.370> ready

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
but anyway it is in the position ready

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.990 
but anyway it is in the position ready
to<00:03:13.909> buy<00:03:14.030> something<00:03:14.329> so<00:03:14.959> i<00:03:15.290> go<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.400> i<00:03:16.579> can<00:03:16.879> get

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
to buy something so i go and i can get

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.879 
to buy something so i go and i can get
200<00:03:17.449> chest<00:03:19.959> as<00:03:20.959> you<00:03:21.019> can<00:03:21.229> see<00:03:21.319> i<00:03:21.379> just<00:03:21.560> got<00:03:21.680> to

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
200 chest as you can see i just got to

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:27.219 
200 chest as you can see i just got to
and<00:03:22.239> i<00:03:23.239> can't<00:03:23.840> get<00:03:23.989> anything<00:03:24.199> else<00:03:26.019> until<00:03:27.019> I

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:27.229 
and i can't get anything else until I

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:29.319 
and i can't get anything else until I
put<00:03:27.349> another<00:03:27.590> diamond<00:03:28.009> in<00:03:28.129> I'm<00:03:28.909> just<00:03:29.120> going<00:03:29.299> to

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
put another diamond in I'm just going to

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.539 
put another diamond in I'm just going to
show<00:03:29.419> you<00:03:29.599> that<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.139> I<00:03:30.409> guess<00:03:31.040> I'll<00:03:31.159> do<00:03:31.280> five

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
show you that the I guess I'll do five

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.670 
show you that the I guess I'll do five
so<00:03:32.299> now<00:03:32.329> I<00:03:32.479> want<00:03:32.750> five<00:03:32.930> in<00:03:33.109> your<00:03:33.229> pearls<00:03:35.680> but

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
so now I want five in your pearls but

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.860 
so now I want five in your pearls but
you<00:03:36.769> heard<00:03:36.919> the<00:03:37.099> five<00:03:37.250> clicks<00:03:37.669> but<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.359> didn't

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
you heard the five clicks but I didn't

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.509 
you heard the five clicks but I didn't
have<00:03:38.959> any<00:03:39.169> Interpol's<00:03:39.590> in<00:03:39.739> there<00:03:39.919> let's<00:03:40.310> see

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
have any Interpol's in there let's see

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:50.089 
have any Interpol's in there let's see
let's<00:03:40.790> do<00:03:40.909> it<00:03:41.000> again

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.300 

there<00:03:51.099> we<00:03:51.220> go<00:03:51.340> so<00:03:52.030> and<00:03:52.569> I'll<00:03:53.319> even<00:03:53.560> do<00:03:54.010> the

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
there we go so and I'll even do the

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.509 
there we go so and I'll even do the
potatoes<00:03:54.459> just<00:03:54.819> to<00:03:55.329> satisfy<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:58.150> guys<00:03:58.870> is

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
potatoes just to satisfy you guys is

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.630 
potatoes just to satisfy you guys is
curiosity<00:04:01.379> and<00:04:02.379> nothing's<00:04:02.950> coming<00:04:03.159> up<00:04:03.310> as<00:04:03.489> you

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
curiosity and nothing's coming up as you

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.280 
curiosity and nothing's coming up as you
can<00:04:03.730> see<00:04:03.879> it<00:04:04.030> is<00:04:04.209> going<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.599> go<00:04:04.690> seven<00:04:05.079> times

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
can see it is going to go seven times

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.619 
can see it is going to go seven times
and<00:04:05.620> I<00:04:06.430> will<00:04:06.700> explain<00:04:07.060> this<00:04:07.239> to<00:04:07.420> you<00:04:07.540> really

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
and I will explain this to you really

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.899 
and I will explain this to you really
quick<00:04:07.900> also<00:04:08.290> so<00:04:08.950> basically<00:04:09.280> we<00:04:09.459> got<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:09.670> same

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
quick also so basically we got the same

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:11.610 
quick also so basically we got the same
system<00:04:10.299> right<00:04:10.450> here<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.959> orange<00:04:11.230> circuit

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
system right here the orange circuit

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.039 
system right here the orange circuit
detects<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:12.609> currency<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.359> red<00:04:13.629> circuit

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
detects the currency the red circuit

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.259 
detects the currency the red circuit
powers<00:04:15.239> allows<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.660> circuits<00:04:17.109> from<00:04:17.769> the

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
powers allows the circuits from the

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.270 
powers allows the circuits from the
buttons<00:04:19.269> to<00:04:19.419> go<00:04:19.510> through<00:04:19.810> right<00:04:20.320> here<00:04:20.350> the

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
buttons to go through right here the

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.850 
buttons to go through right here the
yellow<00:04:21.699> and<00:04:21.729> pink<00:04:22.180> circuits<00:04:22.780> are<00:04:23.050> basically

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
yellow and pink circuits are basically

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.350 
yellow and pink circuits are basically
the<00:04:23.919> same<00:04:24.160> thing<00:04:24.220> it's<00:04:24.550> just<00:04:24.610> they<00:04:24.820> alternate

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
the same thing it's just they alternate

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.000 
the same thing it's just they alternate
between<00:04:25.449> one<00:04:25.930> block<00:04:26.970> so<00:04:27.990> basically<00:04:29.010> the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
between one block so basically the

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.040 
between one block so basically the
yellow<00:04:30.310> circuit<00:04:30.820> is<00:04:31.500> just<00:04:32.500> a<00:04:32.680> block<00:04:33.750> back<00:04:34.750> in

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
yellow circuit is just a block back in

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.830 
yellow circuit is just a block back in
the<00:04:35.199> pink<00:04:35.470> circuit<00:04:36.039> as<00:04:36.190> a<00:04:36.220> block<00:04:36.610> Ford<00:04:37.000> that<00:04:37.690> is

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
the pink circuit as a block Ford that is

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.140 
the pink circuit as a block Ford that is
so<00:04:38.050> that<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.530> Redstone<00:04:39.010> does<00:04:39.610> not<00:04:39.850> interfere

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
so that the Redstone does not interfere

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.140 
so that the Redstone does not interfere
with<00:04:40.539> each<00:04:40.570> other<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.500> basically<00:04:42.400> what<00:04:42.729> it<00:04:42.940> is

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
with each other and basically what it is

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.600 
with each other and basically what it is
it<00:04:43.389> is<00:04:43.570> this<00:04:44.110> is<00:04:44.350> right<00:04:44.710> here<00:04:44.889> is<00:04:44.979> an<00:04:45.070> RS<00:04:45.400> nor

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
it is this is right here is an RS nor

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.689 
it is this is right here is an RS nor
latch<00:04:46.110> and<00:04:47.110> whenever<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:48.010> button<00:04:48.340> goes

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
latch and whenever the button goes

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.420 
latch and whenever the button goes
through<00:04:49.000> this<00:04:49.990> turns<00:04:50.260> off<00:04:50.440> and<00:04:50.650> this<00:04:50.830> turns<00:04:51.039> on

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
through this turns off and this turns on

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.790 
through this turns off and this turns on
which<00:04:52.210> means<00:04:52.449> this<00:04:52.690> turns<00:04:52.960> on<00:04:53.199> which<00:04:53.590> means

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
which means this turns on which means

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.469 
which means this turns on which means
this<00:04:53.979> turns<00:04:54.220> off<00:04:54.430> which<00:04:54.639> means<00:04:54.669> this<00:04:54.970> turns<00:04:55.210> on

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
this turns off which means this turns on

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.870 
this turns off which means this turns on
and<00:04:55.990> whenever<00:04:56.470> this<00:04:56.680> turns<00:04:56.949> on<00:04:57.130> it<00:04:57.400> turns<00:04:57.669> into

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
and whenever this turns on it turns into

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.930 
and whenever this turns on it turns into
a<00:04:58.030> clock<00:04:58.479> and<00:04:58.810> that<00:04:59.650> clock<00:05:00.070> will<00:05:00.280> continue<00:05:00.789> to

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
a clock and that clock will continue to

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.650 
a clock and that clock will continue to
go<00:05:01.120> until<00:05:01.750> this<00:05:02.020> repeater<00:05:02.729> comes<00:05:03.729> all<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.030> way

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
go until this repeater comes all the way

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.240 
go until this repeater comes all the way
around<00:05:04.870> to<00:05:05.289> turn<00:05:05.650> this<00:05:05.889> back<00:05:06.280> on<00:05:07.740> so<00:05:08.740> let's<00:05:09.130> see

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
around to turn this back on so let's see

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.689 
around to turn this back on so let's see
if<00:05:09.370> I<00:05:09.460> can<00:05:09.490> explain<00:05:09.990> our<00:05:10.990> show<00:05:11.349> it<00:05:11.470> to<00:05:11.590> you<00:05:11.740> so

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
if I can explain our show it to you so

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.029 
if I can explain our show it to you so
I'm<00:05:12.940> gonna<00:05:13.120> put<00:05:14.050> this<00:05:14.110> in<00:05:14.410> here<00:05:14.560> I<00:05:14.620> can<00:05:14.860> even

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
I'm gonna put this in here I can even

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.529 
I'm gonna put this in here I can even
put<00:05:15.190> some<00:05:15.310> potatoes<00:05:15.460> in<00:05:15.880> here<00:05:16.090> and<00:05:17.400> then<00:05:18.400> so<00:05:19.120> I

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
put some potatoes in here and then so I

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:23.159 
put some potatoes in here and then so I
click<00:05:20.289> this<00:05:20.820> and<00:05:21.820> as<00:05:21.910> you<00:05:22.090> can<00:05:22.210> see<00:05:22.240> it<00:05:22.750> will

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
click this and as you can see it will

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.810 
click this and as you can see it will
keep<00:05:23.470> going<00:05:23.770> until<00:05:23.919> that<00:05:24.160> repeater<00:05:24.520> turns

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
keep going until that repeater turns

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.620 
keep going until that repeater turns
that<00:05:25.060> back<00:05:25.210> on<00:05:26.280> so<00:05:27.280> that's<00:05:28.090> how<00:05:28.300> it<00:05:28.449> works

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
that back on so that's how it works

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.450 
that back on so that's how it works
that's<00:05:28.840> that's<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:29.409> most<00:05:29.590> compact<00:05:30.039> I<00:05:30.280> could

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
that's that's the most compact I could

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.370 
that's that's the most compact I could
figure<00:05:30.610> out<00:05:30.760> how<00:05:30.880> to<00:05:30.940> get<00:05:31.150> it<00:05:31.300> it's<00:05:32.110> possible

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
figure out how to get it it's possible

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.890 
figure out how to get it it's possible
that<00:05:33.280> it<00:05:33.460> could<00:05:33.669> be<00:05:34.180> a<00:05:34.210> little<00:05:34.570> bit<00:05:34.780> more

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
that it could be a little bit more

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.110 
that it could be a little bit more
compact<00:05:35.289> but<00:05:35.919> it's<00:05:36.070> really<00:05:36.520> hard<00:05:36.669> to<00:05:36.760> get<00:05:36.880> a

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
compact but it's really hard to get a

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.219 
compact but it's really hard to get a
toggle<00:05:38.099> clock<00:05:39.099> into<00:05:39.520> a<00:05:40.120> tileable<00:05:40.570> formation

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
toggle clock into a tileable formation

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.820 
toggle clock into a tileable formation
like<00:05:41.380> this<00:05:41.590> so<00:05:42.430> yeah<00:05:43.180> and<00:05:43.510> I<00:05:43.870> also<00:05:44.080> just<00:05:44.320> for

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
like this so yeah and I also just for

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.390 
like this so yeah and I also just for
just<00:05:45.580> for<00:05:45.699> fun<00:05:46.030> I<00:05:46.270> I'm<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.830> reason<00:05:48.010> you<00:05:48.250> might

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
just for fun I I'm the reason you might

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.860 
just for fun I I'm the reason you might
want<00:05:48.639> one<00:05:48.760> of<00:05:48.820> these<00:05:48.970> to<00:05:49.270> put<00:05:49.479> into<00:05:49.720> your

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
want one of these to put into your

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.680 
want one of these to put into your
server<00:05:50.199> home

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.410 

or<00:05:54.690> just<00:05:55.470> put<00:05:55.770> in<00:05:55.860> your<00:05:55.890> server<00:05:56.400> for<00:05:56.670> it's<00:05:57.270> like

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.420 
or just put in your server for it's like

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.390 
or just put in your server for it's like
a<00:05:57.450> vanilla<00:05:57.780> plugin<00:05:58.380> basically<00:05:58.890> like<00:05:59.040> it's<00:05:59.280> a

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
a vanilla plugin basically like it's a

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.490 
a vanilla plugin basically like it's a
vanilla<00:05:59.790> store<00:06:00.210> you<00:06:00.480> can<00:06:00.630> use<00:06:00.780> it<00:06:00.900> as<00:06:01.020> a<00:06:01.050> story

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
vanilla store you can use it as a story

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.570 
vanilla store you can use it as a story
so<00:06:02.190> if<00:06:02.910> I<00:06:03.060> remember<00:06:03.450> the<00:06:03.540> code<00:06:05.750> yeah<00:06:06.750> so<00:06:07.170> Oh

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
so if I remember the code yeah so Oh

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.720 
so if I remember the code yeah so Oh
jambe<00:06:08.580> spawn<00:06:08.820> down<00:06:09.030> here<00:06:09.180> hello<00:06:09.840> and

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:10.730 
jambe spawn down here hello and

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.760 
jambe spawn down here hello and
basically<00:06:11.730> this<00:06:12.150> is<00:06:12.210> where<00:06:12.480> you<00:06:12.600> would

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
basically this is where you would

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.110 
basically this is where you would
collect<00:06:13.770> all<00:06:13.920> your<00:06:13.950> profits<00:06:14.250> from<00:06:14.730> the<00:06:14.880> store

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
collect all your profits from the store

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.210 
collect all your profits from the store
and<00:06:15.360> you<00:06:15.900> can<00:06:15.930> use<00:06:16.170> this<00:06:16.350> dub<00:06:16.620> sell<00:06:16.980> whatever

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
and you can use this dub sell whatever

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.940 
and you can use this dub sell whatever
you<00:06:17.490> don't<00:06:17.760> want<00:06:18.090> or<00:06:18.690> you<00:06:19.440> guys<00:06:19.560> get<00:06:19.800> the<00:06:19.920> idea

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950 
you don't want or you guys get the idea

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.630 
you don't want or you guys get the idea
you<00:06:20.790> may<00:06:21.000> want<00:06:21.330> to<00:06:21.390> however<00:06:21.690> just<00:06:22.170> like<00:06:22.520> if<00:06:23.520> you

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
you may want to however just like if you

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.060 
you may want to however just like if you
have<00:06:23.760> a<00:06:23.820> protection<00:06:24.480> plugin<00:06:25.020> because<00:06:25.770> people

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
have a protection plugin because people

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.650 
have a protection plugin because people
can<00:06:26.340> obviously<00:06:26.700> just<00:06:27.060> break<00:06:27.240> through<00:06:27.510> this

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
can obviously just break through this

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.930 
can obviously just break through this
and<00:06:27.900> get<00:06:28.470> to<00:06:28.620> the<00:06:28.650> dispenser<00:06:29.520> if<00:06:29.580> they<00:06:29.700> wanted

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
and get to the dispenser if they wanted

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.070 
and get to the dispenser if they wanted
to<00:06:30.120> but<00:06:30.360> that's<00:06:31.170> the<00:06:31.290> only<00:06:32.720> thing<00:06:33.720> I<00:06:33.870> can<00:06:33.930> think

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
to but that's the only thing I can think

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.570 
to but that's the only thing I can think
of<00:06:34.410> that<00:06:34.560> would<00:06:34.650> be<00:06:34.890> bad<00:06:35.070> you<00:06:35.220> might<00:06:35.340> want<00:06:35.520> to
