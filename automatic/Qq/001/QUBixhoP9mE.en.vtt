00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.720
 all right 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.210
 but we started from a lot of images and 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.630
 of the tastes of the three partners for 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.070
 put our aesthetics in common 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.380
 and good when the place that was the 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.000
 man or we start to see we have a 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.160
 limited budget to see what we could 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.780
 do how could we organize it 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.090
 with the help of the architect we had to 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.469
 help some journalists and us that 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.899
 We have a lot of criteria and we are very 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.390
 get back all and well put it started 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.519
 to emerge the fence we will reuse the 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.140
 this is going to leave us cheaper we are going to 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:43.640
 try to do this we do not like the 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.010
 new things we will like to do with 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:52.850
 Solera with a little bit of life 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:54.649
 and with stories we reuse things that 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.789
 had that was on the premises has 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.339
 put a question of what is a 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.899
 budget constraint on a hillside 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.549
 little bit because of things then sometimes 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.350
 we get it as cheap as you can 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:04.640
 imagine you well find a gate 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.060
 that we liked we have turned it into 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.340
 a mirror we keep beams thinking of 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.869
 reuse the no then no no no 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.280
 we use for nothing but then the 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.039
 we took to the street and someone found 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.550
 for his house and he made a table and good 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.440
 is it 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.710
 return to using things no longer what 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.710
 they have 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.640
 with many things we are in the 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.500
 street there we found a software you're 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.890
 on the wooden street they were making a 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.119
 building and we took them the open that a 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.590
 ask what we want with that but good 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.900
 we understood that they did not want them because 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.640
 they were pulled we brought them in full sun 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.680
 that then the doors have turned 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.399
 from the kitchen there are lamps that come 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.869
 from a French port there are some doors 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.369
 for the wonderful French also 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.840
 who work on other vehicles with 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:58.690
 most expensive point the shutters that 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.009
 we were lent by a neighbor who said I think 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.929
 that you have many doors and some 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.240
 of those contra windows super brand and 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.070
 well that the column bothered us 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.539
 it was an element that we did not know that 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.970
 we had the shutters because still 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.890
 we have a lot of material in the warehouse that 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.519
 we are looking for a use and we are going 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.519
 patching 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.860
 the structure of the bathroom that bothered us 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.840
 we have also covered whole with with 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.709
 doors windows and we have remained then to 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.090
 final is like a kind of 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.090
 sculpture that is phenomenal 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.230
 the idea was to assemble doors 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.420
 different doors windows materials 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.569
 recovered things that we found in the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.150
 street and make a montage here in the bathroom 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.340
 for original us and the time that 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.110
 doors leave from all the sites 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.750
 possible some windows that 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.860
 we found here on the street next 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.920
 there is a door that leads us down 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.340
 neighbor that was doing work the idea 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.769
 capable age door to door that we 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.390
 it took quite some time because this is the 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.990
 balcony for example we put after 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.590
 mirrors 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.590
 I shower 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.940
 please
