00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
but then thanks to them first of all the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.900 
but then thanks to them first of all the
engine<00:03:18.930> has<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.350> total<00:03:19.650> before<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.160> DBT<00:03:20.550> that

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
engine has a total before the DBT that

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.199 
engine has a total before the DBT that
when<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.180> go<00:03:21.360> low<00:03:21.900> change<00:03:22.740> the<00:03:23.190> overlap<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.120> it
