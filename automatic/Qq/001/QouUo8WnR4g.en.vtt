you do damage you fill up your own fire
which<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.439> right<00:02:04.590> there<00:02:04.619> next<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.219> health

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
which is right there next to the health

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.960 
which is right there next to the health
I<00:02:06.390> quickly<00:02:06.960> fire<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.439> band<00:02:07.680> melter<00:02:08.039> oh<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.520> love

I quickly fire the band melter oh I love
playing<00:02:09.179> with<00:02:09.239> balls<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.690> was<00:02:09.869> also<00:02:10.080> nice

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
playing with balls this was also nice

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.229 
playing with balls this was also nice
clip<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.039> yeah<00:02:11.190> as<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.640> can<00:02:11.760> see<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:11.970> can<00:02:12.120> do

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
clip so yeah as you can see you can do

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.670 
clip so yeah as you can see you can do
quite<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.599> bit<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.930> damage<00:02:12.959> already

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
quite a bit of damage already

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.349 
quite a bit of damage already
instead<00:02:14.189> of<00:02:14.310> shooting<00:02:14.579> fire<00:02:14.879> advised<00:02:15.329> that

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:15.359 
instead of shooting fire advised that

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:17.059 
instead of shooting fire advised that
sort<00:02:15.719> of<00:02:15.750> laser<00:02:15.989> beam<00:02:16.230> type<00:02:16.500> thing<00:02:16.739> which<00:02:16.920> is

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
sort of laser beam type thing which is

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.490 
sort of laser beam type thing which is
pretty<00:02:17.640> cool<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:18.959> what<00:02:19.109> happens<00:02:19.409> when

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
pretty cool this is what happens when

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.410 
pretty cool this is what happens when
you<00:02:19.739> activate<00:02:20.310> your<00:02:20.340> own<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:21.030> actually<00:02:21.329> have

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
you activate your own you actually have

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.449 
you activate your own you actually have
to<00:02:21.540> do<00:02:21.629> a<00:02:21.659> little<00:02:21.840> taunt<00:02:22.200> 45<00:02:22.769> seconds<00:02:23.280> which

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
to do a little taunt 45 seconds which

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.280 
to do a little taunt 45 seconds which
makes<00:02:23.760> sense<00:02:23.969> but<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.659> quite<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.959> bit<00:02:25.049> more

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
makes sense but you quite a bit more

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.789 
makes sense but you quite a bit more
damage<00:02:25.620> as<00:02:25.769> you<00:02:26.069> will<00:02:26.159> see<00:02:26.219> right<00:02:26.909> now<00:02:27.799> that's

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
damage as you will see right now that's

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.190 
damage as you will see right now that's
true<00:02:29.010> soldiers<00:02:29.549> and<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.969> medic<00:02:30.299> right<00:02:30.450> there<00:02:30.719> so

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
true soldiers and a medic right there so

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.809 
true soldiers and a medic right there so
it<00:02:31.379> can<00:02:31.409> do<00:02:31.769> quite<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.129> lot<00:02:32.219> of<00:02:32.340> damage<00:02:32.489> but<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
it can do quite a lot of damage but the

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.949 
it can do quite a lot of damage but the
problem<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.269> that<00:02:33.299> you<00:02:33.510> don't<00:02:33.659> have<00:02:33.840> an

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
problem is is that you don't have an

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.629 
problem is is that you don't have an
air-blast<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.620> don't<00:02:34.829> have<00:02:35.040> random<00:02:35.459> critical

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:35.639 
air-blast and don't have random critical

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.179 
air-blast and don't have random critical
hits<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.420> actually<00:02:37.319> will<00:02:37.500> refill<00:02:37.859> your<00:02:38.010> health

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
hits it actually will refill your health

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.429 
hits it actually will refill your health
as<00:02:38.340> well<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:38.639> here<00:02:39.030> i<00:02:39.060> am<00:02:39.180> at<00:02:39.420> 54<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.049> i<00:02:40.109> go<00:02:40.230> all

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
as well so here i am at 54 and i go all

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.050 
as well so here i am at 54 and i go all
the<00:02:40.709> way<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.859> full<00:02:41.189> health<00:02:41.250> when<00:02:41.670> i<00:02:41.700> activate

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
the way to full health when i activate

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.000 
the way to full health when i activate
it<00:02:42.090> i'm<00:02:42.389> pretty<00:02:43.019> sure<00:02:43.170> it'll<00:02:43.590> do<00:02:43.769> it<00:02:43.889> when

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
it i'm pretty sure it'll do it when

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.800 
it i'm pretty sure it'll do it when
you're<00:02:44.099> like<00:02:44.310> at<00:02:44.579> one<00:02:44.939> but<00:02:45.239> i'm<00:02:45.329> not<00:02:45.569> too<00:02:45.780> sure

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:49.169 
to be honest again another taun and then

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.890 
to be honest again another taun and then
i<00:02:49.260> get<00:02:49.409> ubered<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:51.060> do<00:02:51.239> quite<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.569> lot<00:02:51.689> of

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
i get ubered and so I do quite a lot of

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.659 
i get ubered and so I do quite a lot of
damage<00:02:52.049> here<00:02:52.379> so<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.769> was<00:02:52.950> pretty<00:02:53.129> fun<00:02:53.430> and

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
then I go into the spawn for a bit and

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.559 
then I go into the spawn for a bit and
do<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.340> bit<00:02:56.489> more<00:02:56.519> killing<00:02:56.970> it's<00:02:57.239> pretty<00:02:57.419> fun

ZX<00:03:01.319> which<00:03:02.129> is<00:03:02.400> pretty<00:03:03.209> slow<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.840> fire<00:03:04.319> as

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
ZX which is pretty slow to fire as

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.550 
ZX which is pretty slow to fire as
you'll<00:03:04.799> see<00:03:05.099> free<00:03:05.939> soon<00:03:06.419> yeah<00:03:06.719> see<00:03:07.019> that's<00:03:07.200> how

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
you'll see free soon yeah see that's how

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.770 
you'll see free soon yeah see that's how
it<00:03:07.739> looks<00:03:07.919> when<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.129> fire<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.629> looks<00:03:09.629> pretty

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
it looks when you fire it looks pretty

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.170 
it looks when you fire it looks pretty
cool<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.409> yeah<00:03:10.560> here<00:03:11.129> is<00:03:11.280> me<00:03:11.400> holding<00:03:11.730> down<00:03:12.000> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
cool so yeah here is me holding down the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.670 
cool so yeah here is me holding down the
mouse<00:03:12.209> button<00:03:12.569> actually<00:03:13.319> holding<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.650> down

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
mouse button actually holding it down

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.009 
mouse button actually holding it down
I'm<00:03:13.950> not<00:03:14.159> like<00:03:14.370> delaying<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.359> that's<00:03:15.599> how<00:03:15.780> fast

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
I'm not like delaying it that's how fast

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.259 
I'm not like delaying it that's how fast
files<00:03:16.439> if<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:17.370> right-click<00:03:17.609> you<00:03:17.970> get<00:03:18.150> that

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
files if you right-click you get that

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.330
