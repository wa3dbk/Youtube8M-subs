because<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.530> earth<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.800> rotating<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.430> other

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
because the earth is rotating the other

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.320 
because the earth is rotating the other
way<00:02:12.730> well<00:02:13.420> that<00:02:13.570> stings<00:02:13.900> power<00:02:14.230> supply<00:02:14.680> plant

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
way well that stings power supply plant

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.490 
way well that stings power supply plant
now<00:02:16.330> we're<00:02:16.510> swinging<00:02:16.900> down<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.230> getting<00:02:17.380> a

now we're swinging down and getting a

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.440 
now we're swinging down and getting a
look<00:02:17.650> at<00:02:17.800> telluride<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:18.700> is<00:02:18.820> just<00:02:19.030> opposite

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
look at telluride this is just opposite

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.180 
look at telluride this is just opposite
of<00:02:19.570> that<00:02:19.690> picture<00:02:20.050> that<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.380> use<00:02:20.710> is<00:02:20.890> for<00:02:21.070> my

eight foot four miles long straight he's

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.070 
eight foot four miles long straight he's
pretty<00:02:38.650> much<00:02:42.030> that's<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.150> whirligig<00:02:43.540> I<00:02:43.900> don't

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
pretty much that's a whirligig I don't

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.300 
pretty much that's a whirligig I don't
know<00:02:44.140> if<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.290> can<00:02:44.410> really<00:02:44.560> see<00:02:44.800> how<00:02:44.950> much<00:02:45.130> it's

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
know if you can really see how much it's

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.700 
know if you can really see how much it's
moving<00:02:45.670> but<00:02:45.700> it's<00:02:45.970> doing<00:02:46.960> all<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.170> whirligig

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
moving but it's doing all the whirligig

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:54.000 
moving but it's doing all the whirligig
can<00:02:47.890> do<00:02:50.130> there's<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.220> compass<00:02:52.140> that's<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.890> can

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
can do there's a compass that's you can

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.650 
can do there's a compass that's you can
see<00:02:54.190> Wes<00:02:54.430> pretty<00:02:54.730> good<00:02:54.940> west<00:02:55.240> is<00:02:55.420> straight

am I All Things Considered there this is
how<00:03:15.459> far<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.850> Meldrum<00:03:16.180> tunnel<00:03:16.510> runs<00:03:16.720> east<00:03:16.930> to

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
how far the Meldrum tunnel runs east to

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.920 
how far the Meldrum tunnel runs east to
west<00:03:17.290> this<00:03:18.100> is<00:03:18.280> telluride<00:03:18.910> right<00:03:19.180> over<00:03:19.450> here

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
west this is telluride right over here

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.990 
west this is telluride right over here
this<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:20.920> tunnel<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.760> down<00:03:22.750> this<00:03:23.050> way<00:03:23.350> is

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
this is the tunnel and down this way is

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.640 
this is the tunnel and down this way is
sillerton<00:03:25.000> there<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.630> silver<00:03:26.230> comes<00:03:26.410> down

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
sillerton there it is silver comes down

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.460 
sillerton there it is silver comes down
there<00:03:26.890> so<00:03:27.700> you<00:03:27.760> can<00:03:28.120> get<00:03:28.330> a<00:03:28.360> map<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:28.959> see<00:03:29.350> how

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
there so you can get a map and see how

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:57.050 
there so you can get a map and see how
far<00:03:29.500> this<00:03:29.950> stretches<00:03:30.459> it's<00:03:30.610> about<00:03:30.820> four<00:03:31.120> miles

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.270 

Matt<00:03:58.060> compass<00:03:58.840> next<00:03:59.740> I<00:03:59.800> think<00:04:00.010> I'm<00:04:00.100> going<00:04:00.190> to

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
Matt compass next I think I'm going to

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:08.940 
Matt compass next I think I'm going to
be<00:04:00.340> showing<00:04:00.520> you<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.850> globe<00:04:05.040> yeah<00:04:07.650> that's<00:04:08.650> the

the globe now that's actually how the

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.810 
the globe now that's actually how the
earth<00:04:13.750> is<00:04:14.020> like<00:04:14.110> the<00:04:14.650> North<00:04:14.860> Pole<00:04:15.100> is<00:04:15.340> up<00:04:15.580> that

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
earth is like the North Pole is up that

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.610 
earth is like the North Pole is up that
way<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.210> South<00:04:16.420> Pole<00:04:16.660> is<00:04:16.930> down<00:04:17.230> that<00:04:17.260> way<00:04:17.470> I'm

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
way the South Pole is down that way I'm

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.320 
way the South Pole is down that way I'm
going<00:04:17.739> to<00:04:17.830> point<00:04:18.070> south<00:04:18.430> here<00:04:18.730> in<00:04:18.850> a<00:04:18.910> second<00:04:19.270> to

going to point south here in a second to

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.240 
going to point south here in a second to
show<00:04:19.480> that<00:04:19.720> self<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.710> tunnel<00:04:24.010> is<00:04:24.040> aimed

we're riding around on that globe and we
got<00:04:28.510> that<00:04:28.690> big<00:04:28.900> of<00:04:28.990> a<00:04:29.080> hole<00:04:29.230> in<00:04:29.470> the<00:04:29.530> ground<00:04:29.710> out

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
got that big of a hole in the ground out

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.540 
got that big of a hole in the ground out
ahead<00:04:30.130> of<00:04:30.370> us<00:04:31.530> that's<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.710> whirligig<00:04:33.160> bit<00:04:33.340> see

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
ahead of us that's the whirligig bit see
