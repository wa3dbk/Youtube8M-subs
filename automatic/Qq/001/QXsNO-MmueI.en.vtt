00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.920
 first of all we enter this page 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:21.070
 and we download the virtual box once 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.170
 downloaded we installed it the way 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.510
 install is very easy we just give in 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.190
 next following until the end no 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.160
 has nothing complicated to install 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.439
 virtualbox then we enter this other 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.680
 page and download the windows iso 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.680
 10 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:47.120
 we choose the language in Spanish 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.770
 we can download the iso of 64 or 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.830
 for 86 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.990
 how are we going to install windows 10 in 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.110
 virtual box to prove it I prefer 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.140
 more for the one of 86 that corresponds to 32 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.239
 bits 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.580
 once downloaded and virtual box 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.659
 installed we start installing windows 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.659
 10 in the virtual machine 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.500
 we give in new 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.719
 we put windows 8.1 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.189
 we choose 32 bits and we give in following 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.700
 here it is advisable to leave a gb of 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.700
 ram we give in following 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.670
 here the capacity of the hard disk what 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.270
 we can leave by default or we can 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.270
 put more 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.009
 we give in creating 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.110
 Once the virtual machine is created we give 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.110
 to start 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.350
 we look for the windows 10 iso and the 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.350
 we select 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.070
 I saved it in the partition once 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.840
 selected we start and start 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.840
 the installation of windows 10 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.380
 we leave the language in Spanish and we give in 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.380
 following 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.230
 we give in install 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.099
 We accept the license terms and 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.099
 we give in following 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.650
 We give in the option of customized by 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.350
 defect we see the disc where it 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.510
 will install windows we give in next 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.440
 here we only hope that the 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.440
 installation process 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.750
 we choose quick configuration 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.900
 in this step it is better not to be 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.790
 connected to the internet so we do not 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.790
 will force to put an email account 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.459
 we will give it a name and we give in 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.459
 Finalize 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.900
 once installed windows 10 we give in 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.710
 insert the cd image 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.810
 this program is necessary to install 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.940
 if after a few seconds it does not run 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.479
 we go to the team and execute it 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.479
 From there 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.030
 finished to install we reset 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:15.559
 finished the installation we already have 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.800
 windows 10 ready to test it how much 

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:17.800
 we want 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.810
 good friends up here another tutorial 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:31.770
 more than lost in their bids farewell pc
