 hello welcome again to my channel no 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.500
 I'm not mortician I'm not andrea much 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.240
 welcome to this space where 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.520
 Today I am going to talk to you about 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.740
 products that I determined and what was 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.330
 my final verdict if I liked them very much 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.130
 little bit more and less and if I would 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.259
 buy hello today 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.080
 start with facial care products 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.660
 and here I have this one that is from clinique the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.580
 arnés solutions claro and find loser is the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.769
 tonic and you see that it has and manages this 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.530
 wave of the three steps cleaning the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.060
 toner and after moisturizing good to me 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.309
 all the accessories products me 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.199
 they worked super well while not 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.879
 stop using I go away and stop it 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.039
 use obvious no but then I stopped them from 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.440
 use a period like 2 months and when 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.660
 I wanted to go back and they did not serve me the same 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.430
 I know why it is that despite being very 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.809
 good and that at the time they served me 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.609
 I would not buy them again 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.320
 just for that reason because of 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.910
 soon they did not work for me, I do not know what 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.949
 happened there are people who complain that 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.559
 they contain a lot of alcohol and others to me the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.269
 truth is that I never irritate good at 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.720
 principle knows the whole package of the 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.670
 solution 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.230
 my skin was very dry but it was 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.970
 it started me how to balance with the step of 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.440
 the weeks but the truth is that I 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.080
 they worked very well during their time 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.490
 I'm not going to buy it and it's only because 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.460
 the reason that suddenly I no longer 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.230
 they worked more than facial care and now 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.090
 I have several to see that if we are 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.520
 has been saving are the creams of 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.530
 eyes the moisturizing diamond cell phone 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.410
 ory flame this has been my favorite 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.450
 for a good time before this 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.270
 I had used the eye contour cream 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.010
 of clinique also of fear that is a 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.690
 Spanish brand that my mom is 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.100
 cosmetologist and she manages that brand 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.380
 I also really liked the cream of 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.869
 terror but of all the ones that I have tried 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.150
 even the whole sre and frame is for me 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.890
 It has been the best feel super 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.960
 emollient but it does not leave me feeling 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.430
 the oilier suddenly in 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.290
 laceros for eyes may have 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.940
 gel consistency and I feel like I 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.800
 lack I lack I lack hydration or 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.660
 can be very or grinding and I feel like 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.700
 that the fat the fat the fat I think 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.979
 you are in the middle point apart from the 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.770
 price if you're not a member bari plane I think 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.130
 that the price is like 299 is not very 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.560
 cheap 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.690
 you can say that there are cheaper and 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.860
 good but when you're doing inflame de 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.040
 see what makes you a very discount 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.980
 special then I think that I pay as 190 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.870
 for each one and lasts approximately 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.280
 two or three months considering that I am 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.170
 very constant that I always use 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.489
 we would burn in the morning and always use 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.160
 eye cream at night and that is it 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.830
 a product that I definitely have 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.660
 to buy back of course 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.230
 Moving to make my own thing 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.300
 mine 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.819
 you know are the masks of 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.410
 lashes I do not know I have an obsession 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.000
 I do not have many open at the same time 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.190
 I must confess that I am not so crazy 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.540
 good a law of bad wave but I do not have 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.340
 many open because if they dry very 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.569
 fast I think it's not worth it but if 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.940
 I'm like that in the constant search 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.700
 of the mascara that I have left 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.810
 lashes like more beautiful longer 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.519
 etcetera etcetera 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.400
 so I'm going to start with these two 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.079
 I like them very much but they have 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.460
 super different characteristics between 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.650
 yes the flame that is 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.720
 when I keep I have seen I think 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.310
 that in many of my videos has this 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.200
 kind of brush that if you look at the 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.180
 top part has the long cells 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.460
 and the bottom part has the bristles 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.170
 short has his jokes of rhymes me 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.480
 when I bought it said is well Chaco 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.790
 I wish but then I learned to use it with 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.040
 the small bristles you apply product 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.660
 like the square if we put it with 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.150
 some name and then with the cells 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.880
 Longer separates the lashes result 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.620
 final lashes of very good length no 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.770
 I can say that over the years but very 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:40.210
 good long and very separated which gives them 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.530
 It makes it look extremely natural and besides I 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.060
 truth is that every afternoon I miss 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.250
 a little nap like two or three 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.340
 thanks to get in a little while and the truth 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.340
 is that this is the only mask or rhymes 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:54.580
 of lashes the only one I've tried and 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.560
 that does not weaken with my nap we go 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.330
 I do not mean to run, I have other 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.900
 so many that do not run I've tried other 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.079
 so many that they do not run when I 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.810
 but I know that the volume or the 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.579
 length if they look different this is not 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.500
 It varies in nothing, it looks exactly the same 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.909
 of beautiful when he applied it to me 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.340
 just as beautiful in the night that I go 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.530
 to remove my full makeup and the 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.900
 truth is that not any product 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.049
 access through the tabs on the other hand the 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.480
 volumes of the carbon black de l'oréal 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.030
 I love the brush 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.620
 It is a more traditional brush 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.170
 services like I do not know how to be 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.360
 I do not know what material it is but they are 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.850
 more traditional is more brush than 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.280
 votes more than silicon is the formula is 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.350
 very good I left a lot of eyelashes 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.930
 long by his method they look like a thousand 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.480
 and they look like super black I love 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.690
 I know for a long time it's over and 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.370
 I made the mistake of buying it from it 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.600
 anga that is also de l'oréal and also 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.010
 it was bulky lines but I did not 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.530
 liked it like that I have practiced it in 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.790
 another video but the truth is that yes 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.320
 I would buy it again because this 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.360
 love it day because I love it 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.460
 night now I have another one of my favorites 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.150
 which is the colossal merino and the pampa 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.860
 which is the pink container but as 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.240
 I want those I still like a lot 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.650
 I do not know if you happen to them but also 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.270
 I'm looking forward to very long businessmen and 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.640
 I want to think a lot 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.350
 and another day I have the super eyelashes 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.420
 voluminous 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.180
 I do not know then I love it has like two 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.070
 or three open masks because I just 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.530
 I feel like one and others from another and if 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.060
 he would both buy them again 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.580
 we come to the powder 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.290
 I'm a mac and study tics sorry 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.480
 mac is a town that definitely 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.520
 I would buy again, I explain, because I 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.050
 I am very enamored with albéniz from my 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.960
 point of view and in a video I said it 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.430
 for me it is a very similar formula 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.590
 I can say that identical because the 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.710
 truth is that the maxime lasts a lot 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.570
 much more but the look is much much 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.620
 cheaper I like it a lot but I think 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.090
 that it would be a town that 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.460
 definitely the greatest makeup in 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.320
 dust that I would buy again because I 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.360
 I really like the tone is very yellow and 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.610
 I like that very much and struggled with that 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.340
 you see that suddenly the makeup 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.690
 here in Mexico they are very pink and not at all 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.600
 the world you favor the term has 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.919
 kind of tone or structure not cold like 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.290
 so that I go seeing with base of rose 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:14.110
 so this study fix if what 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.590
 I would buy this again from ory flame no 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.690
 I'm going to buy it for a while, it does it a lot 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.910
 I do not know if because the only one I had did not 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.200
 agreement but go I finish it is not my 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.030
 favorite the truth is that if I go to 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.920
 buy a home powder to start 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.890
 would be 

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.780
 to replace my artist studio which is 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.280
 the smallest army and the dust 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.920
 white white white white which is the 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.170
 I use to seal my corrector me 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.200
 like more I find it much more versatile 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:42.750
 to make a loose powder is very but 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.100
 very finite I do not know really is not that 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.260
 I liked it but I know 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.660
 better products and you are not worth the 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.940
 pity to go back to invest in this way 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.580
 is that this way we finished my video of my 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.780
 exhausted products count and you what 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.880
 products have been endured and 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.410
 they would definitely buy again 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.880
 we all have a product from which 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.290
 we are in love and I would like 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.240
 very much to hear what is the product 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.160
 that you always come back for the 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.160
 again see you in the next video 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.950
 If you liked my makeup, it's that 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.800
 I just recorded a celebrity look 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.420
