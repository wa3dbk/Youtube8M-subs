00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.310
 I saw these mushrooms here, big ones 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.460
 here is what we see here now 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.680
 just mature mature we see that they are 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.560
 of agaricus but now it is necessary 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.670
 see what they are 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.170
 then from the hat which is very clear 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.350
 should be seen that we are here in 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.950
 a grassy area or maybe with shoes 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.500
 street 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.320
 let us first see how long you see it is 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.190
 already mature that there is in the average brown 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.830
 dark brown 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.440
 this is already beautiful mature you have to see 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.630
 because he agaricus here that I am 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.220
 edibles 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.380
 the important thing is that they are not the saint 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.300
 those of mattei who have the basis of 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.430
 stem that by cutting the inter wins 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.980
 let's see immediately for you 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.310
 it seems of course not remains 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.130
 remains white so he is not a saint for 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.390
 matteo is not a bloody man there 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.150
 they are also the inedible qualities and 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.820
 it is not even a Romanesi because the Roma 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.040
 year of the cole era at the base 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.800
 of the legs this does not have them 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.470
 so this one should be one 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.710
 tender bran plague so then there are the 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:44.000
 variety nature we try to cut it 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:48.740
 let's see if we have any coloring 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.520
 here it is, as you can see, it has not has not a 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:57.220
 toning the meat I see a slight one 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:01.450
 slight toning here on the pale yellow man 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.590
 but I don't think he is a saint of the matteo 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.600
 therefore the perfume 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.369
 in the meantime it is a sweet sweet smell 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.050
 fungino therefore has no particular smell 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.690
 then in my opinion saw those who 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.970
 we are among others but since 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:22.540
 so beautiful and large testicle veins 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.010
 then also in the group also in the group 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.080
 and this how you see the slats 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.140
 look at the coloring that makes you clear 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.390
 because it is not yet mature anyway 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.270
 typical is naturally also in the group 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.760
 There are varieties of garics campestris 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.720
 depending on the color of the hat 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:44.620
 I remember the taxable pino salus who knows 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:48.020
 which has streaks a little more 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.390
 brownish prop iusp urine 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.980
 but we are in this Naples and therefore not 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.550
 there must be a place here is a good one 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.110
 future we don't put them in the basket here 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.420
 there is another look at that war 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.099
 are watched are not really 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.500
 these are freshly caught that August 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.590
 it comes out a little later but it's still like 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:13.480
 writes you see are fresh fresh 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.660
 let's put it this way for some 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.660
 time 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.020
 here I also looked at the ring that you see 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.170
 well the ring instead attacked a mother 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.050
 who was eating the one who this here 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.060
 it's the simple ring because if it had 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.470
 the double ring 1 ie of robberies are 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.150
 turn down 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.130
 if we have in the group of di thor chris 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.700
 which however grows on the hardest soils e 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:44.160
 this is a nice agaricus here 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:46.319
 campestris then we put them on 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.560
 quickly down the sun down 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.010
 so let's make a nice one 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.030
 overview to show precisely 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.769
 here you see this big meeting e 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.870
 these here that there are various degrees of 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.269
 practically ripening 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.950
 more whose mature as you see this 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.280
 framework go the slats as on a 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.280
 dye 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.519
 good on the white field too 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.489
 this is just right the beautiful one 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:23.970
 and the right ripening the beautiful stem 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.970
 white therefore they are various fresh
