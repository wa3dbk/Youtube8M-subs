a<00:00:55.940> squared<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> first<00:00:57.390> world<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
a squared is the first world with the

a squared is the first world with the
player<00:00:58.290> visits<00:00:58.710> after<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.489> events<00:00:59.790> of<00:00:59.850> lambda

mall<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.809> environment<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.320> square<00:01:01.650> is<00:01:02.150> kind<00:01:03.150> of

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
mall the environment a square is kind of

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.010 
mall the environment a square is kind of
like<00:01:03.420> medieval<00:01:04.320> simulation<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.880> but<00:01:06.300> it

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
like medieval simulation really but it

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.850 
like medieval simulation really but it
is<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.560> countryside<00:01:09.409> going<00:01:10.409> out<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
is a countryside going out of the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.800 
is a countryside going out of the
chessboard<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.550> well<00:01:12.090> eight<00:01:12.120> squared<00:01:12.630> is

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
chessboard and well eight squared is

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.850 
chessboard and well eight squared is
smaller<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.979> countryside<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:16.320> we<00:01:16.470> really

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
smaller the countryside and so we really

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.620 
smaller the countryside and so we really
made<00:01:17.070> our<00:01:17.310> focus<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.060> people<00:01:18.240> living

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
made our focus on the people living

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.380 
made our focus on the people living
there<00:01:18.930> we<00:01:19.290> try<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.530> make<00:01:20.220> them<00:01:20.430> alive<00:01:20.940> and<00:01:21.299> our

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
there we try to make them alive and our

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.090 
there we try to make them alive and our
genic<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.229> one<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> unique<00:01:22.710> things<00:01:22.770> about

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
genic so one of the unique things about

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.250 
genic so one of the unique things about
the<00:01:23.490> other<00:01:23.640> line<00:01:23.820> mm<00:01:24.120> oh<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.659> NPC's

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
the other line mm oh is that the NPC's

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.930 
the other line mm oh is that the NPC's
have<00:01:25.560> what<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:25.770> call<00:01:25.950> life<00:01:26.130> cycle<00:01:26.550> behavior

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
have what we call life cycle behavior

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.540 
have what we call life cycle behavior
they<00:01:27.510> go<00:01:27.660> around<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.020> they<00:01:28.080> do<00:01:28.140> things<00:01:28.620> that<00:01:29.280> a

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
they go around and they do things that a

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.850 
they go around and they do things that a
normal<00:01:29.730> person<00:01:30.600> would<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:30.840> real<00:01:31.110> life<00:01:31.170> all

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
normal person would do in real life all

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.410 
normal person would do in real life all
right<00:01:31.980> like<00:01:32.190> a<00:01:32.220> fisherman<00:01:32.520> he<00:01:32.880> might<00:01:33.030> go<00:01:33.180> fish

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
right like a fisherman he might go fish

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.240 
right like a fisherman he might go fish
and<00:01:33.690> then<00:01:34.050> who<00:01:34.200> might<00:01:34.350> take<00:01:34.530> his<00:01:34.680> fish<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
and then who might take his fish to the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.240 
and then who might take his fish to the
market<00:01:35.720> now<00:01:36.720> we<00:01:36.810> also<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:37.200> other<00:01:37.380> NPCs<00:01:37.920> that

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
market now we also have other NPCs that

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.820 
market now we also have other NPCs that
would<00:01:38.370> be<00:01:38.550> your<00:01:39.120> vendors<00:01:39.630> your<00:01:40.080> quest<00:01:40.380> givers

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
would be your vendors your quest givers

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.150 
would be your vendors your quest givers
your<00:01:41.160> enemies<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:42.060> course<00:01:42.590> but<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.650> think<00:01:43.890> those

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
your enemies of course but I think those

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.880 
your enemies of course but I think those
are<00:01:44.190> things<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.930> every<00:01:45.930> game<00:01:46.140> has<00:01:46.350> whereas

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
are things that every game has whereas

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.190 
are things that every game has whereas
the<00:01:47.430> other<00:01:47.460> line<00:01:47.850> game<00:01:48.150> we<00:01:48.570> have<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.840> pcs<00:01:49.170> that

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the other line game we have in pcs that

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.230 
the other line game we have in pcs that
act<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:49.860> normal<00:01:49.980> people<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:51.000> cool<00:01:51.210> thing

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
act like normal people the cool thing

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.690 
act like normal people the cool thing
about<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.690> life<00:01:51.840> cycle<00:01:51.950> our<00:01:52.950> life<00:01:53.280> cycle<00:01:53.550> of<00:01:53.580> a

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
what is going on at first so you'll

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.770 
what is going on at first so you'll
think<00:02:42.740> that<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.160> Red<00:02:43.340> Army<00:02:43.460> is<00:02:43.760> evil<00:02:44.120> the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
think that the Red Army is evil the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.020 
think that the Red Army is evil the
White<00:02:44.960> Army<00:02:45.320> is<00:02:45.380> pure<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.830> good<00:02:45.860> but<00:02:46.250> things

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
White Army is pure and good but things

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.490

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
game there are definite rules of warfare

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.770

quests but there's definitely something

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.880 
quests but there's definitely something
wrong<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.850> mean<00:03:56.840> with<00:03:57.200> is<00:03:57.350> great<00:03:57.530> what<00:03:57.650> we<00:03:57.709> want

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
wrong I mean with is great what we want

wrong I mean with is great what we want
to<00:03:57.950> do<00:03:58.070> is<00:03:58.220> offer<00:03:58.430> a<00:03:58.610> fresh<00:03:58.940> perspective<00:03:59.320> just

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
to do is offer a fresh perspective just

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.020 
to do is offer a fresh perspective just
as<00:04:00.440> Ted<00:04:00.620> Williams<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:01.010> don't<00:04:01.220> know<00:04:01.400> novel<00:04:01.760> where

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
as Ted Williams I don't know novel where

as Ted Williams I don't know novel where
we<00:04:02.240> were<00:04:02.330> very<00:04:02.450> inspired<00:04:02.840> by<00:04:03.020> the<00:04:03.170> story<00:04:03.350> you

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
we were very inspired by the story you

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.980 
we were very inspired by the story you
know<00:04:03.830> what<00:04:04.040> if<00:04:04.160> this<00:04:04.400> virtual<00:04:04.910> reality<00:04:05.840> that

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
know what if this virtual reality that

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.440 
know what if this virtual reality that
you're<00:04:06.110> immersing<00:04:06.530> yourself<00:04:06.560> in<00:04:07.270> started<00:04:08.270> to
