00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:11.430
 go today to make you see a 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.100
 good video bowl because there is not bad 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.150
 of pieces that I was waiting to receive I 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.410
 wanted to show behind right away 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.600
 there are some purchases too that I have 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.310
 performed recently I confess then I 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.800
 started with what I received during 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.420
 from China side so I received a very 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.360
 nice Basque tapas because you have 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.940
 already strong henry thomas basque who is from 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.860
 white color like these here it is 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.809
 very nice by cons I have a thing to 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.340
 to blame us is that he is very 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.660
 transparent and suddenly I'll have the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.450
 door is sytematically with a 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.010
 strapless a small tank top sleeveless 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.120
 it does not matter in itself but I 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.910
 still expected to wear everything 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.500
 only agent blow the matter she really 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.210
 very fine and I was not expecting 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.010
 actually to receive something 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.480
 also light even though I'm sure he 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.329
 will be very pretty wore or would wear 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.770
 you will not enter what it gives 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.870
 so I also received a debate again 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.160
 tank top a blazer that I had asked 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.600
 at super long time he had had a 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.360
 confusion about what I had 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.909
 asked and I finally got my blazer 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.469
 pastel yellow 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.900
 it is really very beautiful against it 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:11.760
 took the most with me regarding the 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.930
 form et cetera it's really very 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.490
 beautiful blazers because I already had 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.470
 1 for a very long time 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.180
 vva for a very long time have not 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.189
 very long it was a little while 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.070
 I put it and this one is really very 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.640
 nice and it's up to I think three 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.140
 quarters have had the arms not even he is 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.100
 almost at the wrist or but one 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.180
 can say they three quarters in 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.320
 party or 4a games I'm positive and he 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.360
 is really doing the stuffing 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.159
 frankly I highly recommend 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.740
 blazers that are a little arm thrill 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.360
 in singles actually on the coup I 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.670
 also another blazer is to place 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.470
 much thicker that will make very very 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.670
 well do it I now find the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.140
 gives pink given that one is a 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.170
 little bit between two seasons on it 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.060
 it's very very hot and it's a 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.319
 gorgeous tuxedo jacket is a lot 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.399
 heavier by cons than the other 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.700
 because the other one actually was the 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.229
 spring collection it seems and he 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.060
 is really beautiful 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.130
 he has small and colette inside 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.789
 hidden tiny nothing to do with my 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.649
 other blazers with epaulets but he is 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.110
 really very very beautiful and he has a 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.340
 cut a very cowboy cowboy friend that 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.200
 I like it a lot and in any case 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.480
 I highly recommend scope 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.040
 blazers hundred sheep ie 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.870
 not closed otherwise it's not very pretty 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.290
 and this one by cons it is actually 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.910
 sleeve three quarters or two thirds the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.010
 relou he is really very very good 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.010
 really brought by dj look a lot 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.160
 so now we go to shopping 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.590
 at saravah i want to start because 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.260
 I wear it is a fluid job that 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.290
 I buy at saravah 9 euros 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.120
 it has a really golden closure 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.010
 chic crazy the color in the drugs 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.079
 she is beautiful it is really a 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.510
 color that I love to wear especially in 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.040
 Brittany and autumn winter I like 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.420
 enormously what kind of color that 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.620
 change a lot I find of what we have 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.440
 the habit of seeing and I forgot 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.349
 show the leather bag very very pretty 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.420
 I received from China that's it I think 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.340
 you remember but there are some 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.560
 years that maybe even one in 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.629
 these beds the bags out like that and 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.920
 it is she and brushac to the rote that 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.470
 nobody could afford because 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.090
 it's relatively expensive like that 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.250
 bags smiling charming smile 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.840
 called parallelogram in a like 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.640
 you want you understood with the 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.159
 principle and I find really very beautiful 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.790
 the material is really really great 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.569
 I love them a lot 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.930
 I like that side that on this side 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:34.599
 strangely then we come back to the top of 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.739
 at zara because I really cracked 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.540
 on the docks 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.459
 I found this plan says I still 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.340
 I stopped because my credit card 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.690
 did not allow me to splurge 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.359
 where more fake says because I already have 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.690
 the knife and suddenly I took this little 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:51.909
 man share i find too cute a 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.859
 little transparent sleeveless top 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.370
 bring one more time with a 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.780
 longshoreman 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.180
 so suddenly I bought a tank top 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.709
 white that goes with that at zara they 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.109
 are very practical and tank top I have the 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.150
 white and black the really but that's 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.380
 a pass everywhere and make sure that they are 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.669
 very very very handy because there is 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.780
 a lot of clothes today that 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.959
 are a little openwork or 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.400
 transparent and this shirt she is 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.200
 all simply magnificent 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.190
 so there as chance local does not want 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:21.459
 not going out must absolutely the door 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.110
 I found them home the collar he has to 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.090
 very beautiful details it's small 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.880
 embroidered beads of small pearls with 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.639
 a fairly original form I like a lot 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.020
 it's very very very nice I find 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.310
 with a simple outfit that brings 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.410
 really the little touch that makes any 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.080
 the difference and that's the other 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.260
 so there the other one on the other hand is the 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.770
 viking 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.150
 I loved him enormously giant 905 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.620
 what tastes it is also a 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:53.340
 day and long sleeves very very very 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.950
 fluid everywhere with but really that 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.430
 it's beautiful rhinestones that are 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:02.600
 sewn but that are very very beautiful and 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.130
 on the back is up to date and way tears 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.360
 my god it's beautiful and I like 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.280
 many colors actually you have 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.330
 fishing with turquoises with 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.430
 the basic silver rhinestone that has a lot 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.600
 of struth effects of them can 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.190
 never normally this kind of high 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.270
 because it allows you not to have 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.370
 to put big accessories 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.410
 systematically and I find that it's 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.880
 chic really helping is top 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.010
 fluid 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.660
 I am absolutely a fan so here I believe 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.700
 we're almost done we're coming to the end 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.020
 it's my order from mango athletes 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.340
 I 'm fed up with you and last time 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.740
 as being a good plan because for 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.000
 me it is the ideal is to say that it is 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.220
 products from mango I like 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.780
 many the the mango mark in good standing 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.550
 general and this site actually they 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.570
 propose or seasonal signs where 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.120
 which in my opinion destock and it's up to 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.340
 lowest cost cheapest at the earliest 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.960
 at sale prices anyway and I was able to 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.220
 buy me super nice boots and to 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.360
 the naval sir buy the boots 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.680
 leather this time it's boots in 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.840
 leather I dreamed of since super 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.780
 for a long time I wanted to have 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.700
 real nice flat boots of this 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.890
 color there pushed me down finds them 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.360
 sublime and much lower than in more 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.340
 on the picture is on the site 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.250
 I'm just a fan I ordered them 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.780
 Sunday I received them on Thursday so they 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.330
 are really fast they are 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.880
 beautiful 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.740
 what do I like? 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.580
 have not tried it right yet that I 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.259
 do it because yes I come you 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.300
 receive and I threw myself 120 cameras 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:28.039
 to show you them and in short I try 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.780
 at the level of flying because I have when 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.819
 even very big calves every time 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.389
 that's what comes next to the goal 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:36.860
 it's wanting because it looks good 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.810
 not like that but really I come to 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.840
 the air with rolls and you seem like 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.770
 these are really very good and I 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.090
 believe we're finished today 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.770
 with other words flying 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.599
 I hope you have enjoyed this little paul 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.490
 I make you novices and you 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:50.960
 wait for my next see also because 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.909
 that I should receive small 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.190
 wedge sneakers or order and 

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:57.620
 I really hope they are like I 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:00.680
 think they are I think it's 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.969
 French is actually it's names I 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.860
 have to tell you because as much as I'm going 

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:05.900
 to be as disappointed as if you do it better at this 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.699
 which was awful so we will wait 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.590
 with sneakers to think the whole 

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:12.580
 rest makes you big kisses and thursday 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.580
