 then we leave immediately yes let's start with 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.580
 salad that I first said before cooked 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.229
 then I put it in a tray 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.090
 made to cool the hotel bar and da 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.680
 students are rehearsed or in the pan or al 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.650
 oven to dry it a little 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.930
 otherwise it would absorb too much hillcoat 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.030
 inept in short must absorb in a 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.890
 excessive way in spain is always 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.660
 another thing you brought in 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.520
 water collection then issued by 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.200
 polenta flour cultured people 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.600
 obviously we are meeting of 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.310
 gluten-free cooking we get the flour 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.110
 working so she pulled her made 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.120
 in a pan in the pan so 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.730
 that was even a rectangle 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.920
 then when it is equipped 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.720
 I cut it but just cubes and I have it 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.430
 made to dry in the oven or otherwise in 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.820
 time pan that gets a little bit 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.340
 externally crunchy only this feel 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.100
 I see so many ingredients and all 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.709
 however vegetarian is in the first 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:37.480
 classified I know you are also third 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:40.780
 classes classes ok so you have a passion 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.910
 he would have Italian plus something else they are 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.130
 vegan read themselves vegan food 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.459
 absolutely so it is a cooking site 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.390
 his sign an act in the flat point it 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.190
 where to do all the dishes 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.549
 yes absolutely all the crimes explain 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.320
 all dishes fly and even in 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.090
 gluten-free recipes like this 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.340
 case two recipes are presented 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.290
 that I am the first a sticker was born 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.870
 absolutely fine in the meantime that you 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.190
 go on I would introduce stephen to 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.560
 you want to talk some way that is 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.390
 assuring so far there are so many 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.550
 ingredients to talk about I would say it is 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.430
 a vegan recipe but to which 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.840
 however there is not not really missing 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.530
 anything 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.110
 and let's talk about beans for a while 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.480
 they were once considered the flesh of the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.129
 poor prince food of the diet 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.620
 Mediterranean 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.209
 therefore rich in proteins that are not 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.849
 noble like those of meat but that 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.160
 however with a cereal they go well together 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.319
 and have the same have the same 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.650
 nutritional properties of a dish of 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:47.450
 meat mineral salts such as iron phosphorus 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.709
 calcium vitamin b so they should be 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.360
 we should introduce them into ours 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.790
 power supply at least 2 3 times the 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.959
 week 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.879
 let's remember that some people say 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.549
 who then have problems with swelling 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.590
 first of all if they are not passed 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.569
 they give no type of this one 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.450
 they do not give problems and then they never have to 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.910
 be associated with an animal protein 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.170
 in the same meal in this way not 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.739
 we don't even have problems with 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.919
 configurations to all I go to them 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.079
 develop when I want to indulge 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.680
 even in a pastry without eggs with 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.599
 cannellino flour the past and shoot down 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:31.349
 a dough for a raviolo anyway one 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:33.960
 noodle two words on celery celery 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:37.230
 excellent very rich in salt water 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.080
 minerals mainly of potassium and 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.560
 so we say that it is important to serve 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.390
 to rehydrate and rich in fiber therefore 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.760
 also great for munching it from 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.910
 alone or as a snack in diets 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.280
 low calorie good amount of examination 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.910
 wake also of beta carotene and di 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:02.550
 flavonoids that ultimately gave birth to 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:04.590
 olives olives polyunsaturated fatty acids in 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.830
 particular linoleic and oleic 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.380
 antioxidant vitamin and polyphenols 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:14.150
 the only attention that actually 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:17.130
 olives are kcal 100 g they bring about 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.810
 260 kg calories and therefore must be 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.960
 considered to all intents and purposes a 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:26.969
 food and not a snack as we are 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:29.189
 used to do with with olives because 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:30.959
 in short, they are included in aperitifs 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:33.419
 attention only to this but room is 

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:35.999
 was very good at the balance sheets and facts and 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.309
 I see that you have been very fast and therefore 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:41.099
 basically just cut some 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:45.869
 carrots and celery onions 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:49.469
 such is the case of boiled tomato beans 

00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:55.849
 so fast and also a very fast 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:55.849
 then only one eats this yes 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.090
 I make double role fantina ration 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.970
 I prepare myself with forks 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:28.410
 a little oil maybe pressure is not 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.810
 correct exposure is also nice a 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.300
 seeing yourself very tempting would not be 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.500
 everything is very colorful with era 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.900
 tired out 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:40.160
 ok but we take them off on the concept 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:43.490
 of the even better not being cameras 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.490
 family status 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.870
 absolutely 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.870
 does not mount 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:02.600
 the spain is then passed 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.990
 really extraordinary family thanks 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:16.210
 one thousand 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.210
 definitely making my life die
