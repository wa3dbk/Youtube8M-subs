00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
I think that's like the mixer that you

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.780 
I think that's like the mixer that you
riding<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.550> ride<00:04:17.920> if<00:04:18.920> you<00:04:19.130> like<00:04:19.310> more<00:04:19.459> likely

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.860 
riding a ride if you like more likely
offer<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.360> ride<00:04:20.660> camera<00:04:21.470> like<00:04:22.450> helicopter<00:04:23.450> over

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
offer a ride camera like helicopter over

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.140 
offer a ride camera like helicopter over
the<00:04:24.020> coaster<00:04:24.620> like<00:04:24.770> in<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.900> video<00:04:26.900> today<00:04:28.150> so

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
the coaster like in the video today so

another<00:04:29.570> much<00:04:29.810> to<00:04:29.990> look<00:04:30.140> at<00:04:30.260> from<00:04:30.410> here<00:04:30.800> I<00:04:30.830> was

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
another much to look at from here I was

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.740 
another much to look at from here I was
hopefully<00:04:31.400> see<00:04:31.580> some<00:04:31.760> red<00:04:31.940> track<00:04:32.240> down<00:04:32.510> there

alright<00:04:54.190> we're<00:04:54.310> down<00:04:54.580> if<00:04:54.729> you're<00:04:54.849> going<00:04:54.940> to

alright we're down if you're going to

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.270 
alright we're down if you're going to
Conda<00:04:55.470> checking<00:04:56.470> out<00:04:56.560> construction<00:04:57.039> there<00:04:57.190> is

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
Conda checking out construction there is

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.249 
Conda checking out construction there is
a<00:04:57.400> lot<00:04:57.729> of<00:04:57.759> standing<00:04:58.360> water<00:04:58.419> you<00:04:58.900> can<00:04:59.080> see

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
a lot of standing water you can see

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:04.200 
a lot of standing water you can see
right<00:04:59.289> there<00:05:00.300> right<00:05:01.300> there<00:05:02.729> it<00:05:03.729> also<00:05:03.909> looks

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
right there right there it also looks

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.879 
right there right there it also looks
like<00:05:04.270> they<00:05:04.479> got<00:05:04.509> the<00:05:04.780> foundation<00:05:05.560> for<00:05:05.590> the

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
like they got the foundation for the

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.730 
like they got the foundation for the
station<00:05:06.370> complete<00:05:07.409> just<00:05:08.409> got<00:05:08.530> off<00:05:08.560> the

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
station complete just got off the

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.029 
station complete just got off the
anaconda<00:05:09.520> there<00:05:09.879> is<00:05:10.090> a<00:05:10.360> ton<00:05:10.780> of<00:05:10.810> water<00:05:11.199> where

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 
anaconda there is a ton of water where

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.589 
anaconda there is a ton of water where
I'm<00:05:12.129> guessing<00:05:12.460> that's<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.759> first<00:05:13.060> lift<00:05:13.360> Hill

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:13.599 
I'm guessing that's the first lift Hill

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.960 
I'm guessing that's the first lift Hill
support<00:05:14.139> so<00:05:14.800> there's<00:05:15.009> two<00:05:15.159> main<00:05:15.340> supports<00:05:15.789> for

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
support so there's two main supports for

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.990 
support so there's two main supports for
the<00:05:16.000> lift<00:05:16.180> Hill<00:05:16.300> I<00:05:16.860> mean<00:05:17.860> when<00:05:18.039> I<00:05:18.069> say<00:05:18.370> tons<00:05:18.669> I'm

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
the lift Hill I mean when I say tons I'm

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.119 
the lift Hill I mean when I say tons I'm
guessing<00:05:19.599> that<00:05:19.810> it<00:05:20.050> could<00:05:20.199> possibly<00:05:20.349> be<00:05:20.740> up<00:05:21.009> to

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
guessing that it could possibly be up to

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.350 
guessing that it could possibly be up to
10<00:05:21.370> feet<00:05:21.639> deep<00:05:21.699> it<00:05:22.300> is<00:05:22.990> just<00:05:23.199> a<00:05:23.380> huge<00:05:23.830> Lake

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
10 feet deep it is just a huge Lake

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.129 
10 feet deep it is just a huge Lake
inside<00:05:25.360> that<00:05:25.599> foundation<00:05:26.400> so<00:05:27.400> I<00:05:27.970> look<00:05:28.960> like

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
inside that foundation so I look like

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.040 
inside that foundation so I look like
they're<00:05:29.289> trying<00:05:29.560> to<00:05:29.590> do<00:05:29.830> some<00:05:30.009> company<00:05:31.050> that's

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
they're trying to do some company that's

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.620 
they're trying to do some company that's
not<00:05:32.409> that<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.710> ladder<00:05:33.090> look<00:05:34.090> like<00:05:34.270> oh<00:05:34.419> yeah

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
not that the ladder look like oh yeah

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.629 
not that the ladder look like oh yeah
there's<00:05:35.229> the<00:05:35.349> hose<00:05:35.530> looks<00:05:36.340> like<00:05:36.520> you're

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
there's the hose looks like you're

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.040 
there's the hose looks like you're
trying<00:05:36.789> to<00:05:36.909> pump<00:05:37.060> out<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.240> water<00:05:37.389> out<00:05:37.720> of<00:05:37.900> it

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
trying to pump out the water out of it

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.059 
trying to pump out the water out of it
but<00:05:38.680> that<00:05:38.860> pretty<00:05:39.099> much<00:05:39.250> has<00:05:39.280> out<00:05:39.669> of<00:05:39.789> the<00:05:39.849> same

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:41.069 
but that pretty much has out of the same

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.909 
but that pretty much has out of the same
their<00:05:42.069> reports<00:05:42.490> are<00:05:42.669> those<00:05:43.409> those<00:05:44.409> pieces<00:05:44.710> of

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
their reports are those those pieces of

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.550 
their reports are those those pieces of
Steel<00:05:45.190> there<00:05:45.599> the<00:05:46.599> other<00:05:46.780> piece<00:05:46.930> is<00:05:46.990> feeling

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
Steel there the other piece is feeling

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.409 
Steel there the other piece is feeling

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
four pieces in place just like that

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.540
