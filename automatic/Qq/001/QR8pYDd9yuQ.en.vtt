 24 hour moisturizer in texture g for 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.000

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.899
 commented my great companion Maria is a 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.089
 line to treat fats or with 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.860
 Acneic tendency comments who is 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.899
 the typical line for fats 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.180
 girls but it's a little bit more 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.190
 focused on those people that we already have 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.019
 a little bit older we have a 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.629
 problem the excess of fat or of 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.060
 acne but we need something that really 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.759
 we hydrate the skin and both of us and 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.190
 thickened skin fluffiness and that we 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.440
 leave and leave us well then as well 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.539
 I said Maria we have what it is 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.960
 hydration two products that are 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:22.560
 practically the same 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.310
 worth the two products are in cream and in 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.729
 gel cream would exercise for more skin 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.170
 fat and the one that will show you the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.650
 texture look at your hand a little 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.650
 Mary 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.790
 it's a texture completely 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.110
 transparent matte very fat even what 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.570

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.460

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.310

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.580

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.640
 just for daily hygiene take out 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.100

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.459
 of problem but not as much as for 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.130
 use treatments we could combine 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.950
 what is cleaning with another kind of 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.010

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.690
 agreement something more than anyone and marÃ­a then 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.849

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.160
 use in the body for those granites 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.349
 that appear on the back and that sometimes 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.130
 we do not know how to treat would be a product 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:43.080

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.820
