00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
arms so you're going to wrap your poi up

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.210 
arms so you're going to wrap your poi up
and<00:00:16.170> hold<00:00:16.289> them<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.470> your<00:00:16.500> hands<00:00:16.710> for<00:00:16.920> now<00:00:17.010> and

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
I simply want you to make some big

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.890 
I simply want you to make some big
circles<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.670> really<00:00:21.359> on<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> wall<00:00:21.869> in

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
circles like this really on a wall in

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.470 
circles like this really on a wall in
front<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.590> an<00:00:22.740> imaginary<00:00:23.160> wall<00:00:23.400> your<00:00:24.269> arms

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
front of you an imaginary wall your arms

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.990 
front of you an imaginary wall your arms
completely<00:00:24.630> overlap<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.590> one<00:00:26.279> arm<00:00:26.609> has<00:00:26.849> to

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
completely overlap in one arm has to

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.960 
completely overlap in one arm has to
come<00:00:27.210> down<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.599> top<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.320> other<00:00:28.760> so<00:00:29.760> notice

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
come down on top of the other so notice

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.460 
come down on top of the other so notice
how<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.119> can<00:00:30.269> even<00:00:30.359> switch<00:00:30.750> right<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> top

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
how you can even switch right on the top

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.930 
how you can even switch right on the top
left<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.399> top<00:00:32.669> right<00:00:33.120> on<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.450> top<00:00:33.630> left<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.260> top

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
left on top right on the top left on top

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.790 
left on top right on the top left on top
and<00:00:35.940> as<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.510> do<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.170> can<00:00:37.290> make<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.500> circle

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
and as you do it you can make the circle

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.709 
and as you do it you can make the circle
smaller<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.610> smaller<00:00:38.940> until<00:00:39.149> maybe<00:00:39.540> it's

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
smaller and smaller until maybe it's

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.270 
smaller and smaller until maybe it's
just<00:00:39.809> from<00:00:39.960> your<00:00:40.140> elbows<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:40.800> you're<00:00:40.950> still

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
just from your elbows but you're still

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.510 
just from your elbows but you're still
letting<00:00:41.969> them<00:00:42.210> completely<00:00:42.719> overlap<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.520> don't

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
letting them completely overlap I don't

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.139 
letting them completely overlap I don't
do<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.789> let<00:00:45.239> them<00:00:45.360> completely<00:00:46.610> switch<00:00:47.610> right

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
do this let them completely switch right

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:58.790 
do this let them completely switch right
on<00:00:48.300> top<00:00:48.570> left<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.680> top<00:00:49.920> right<00:00:50.850> on<00:00:50.879> top<00:00:57.649> right<00:00:58.649> in

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
on top left on top right on top right in

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.700 
on top left on top right on top right in
here<00:00:59.039> again<00:01:01.579> just<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.730> case<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.270> wind<00:01:03.710> making

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
here again just in case the wind making

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.890 
here again just in case the wind making
that<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> nice<00:01:06.890> so<00:01:08.060> how's<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.630> i<00:01:09.720> want

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
that a nice so how's you do it i want

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.039 
that a nice so how's you do it i want
you<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.020> notice<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.470> put<00:01:10.830> your<00:01:11.720> whatever<00:01:12.720> hands

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
you to notice a put your whatever hands

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.539 
you to notice a put your whatever hands
on<00:01:13.140> top<00:01:13.350> like<00:01:13.530> if<00:01:13.650> you're<00:01:13.799> right<00:01:14.280> hands<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.880> top

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
on top like if you're right hands on top

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.219 
on top like if you're right hands on top
at<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> top<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.420> circle<00:01:18.600> its<00:01:18.840> passing

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
at the top of the circle its passing

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.050 
at the top of the circle its passing
inside<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> bottom<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.580> circle<00:01:20.909> it's

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
inside and the bottom of the circle it's

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.590 
inside and the bottom of the circle it's
outside<00:01:22.369> notice<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.549> just<00:01:23.820> look<00:01:24.420> at<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
outside notice that just look at the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.050 
outside notice that just look at the
hand<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.470> passing<00:01:25.979> closer<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.820> at<00:01:26.939> the

top circle and further from you at the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.429 
top circle and further from you at the
bottom<00:01:30.439> closer<00:01:31.759> further<00:01:33.020> that's<00:01:34.020> why<00:01:34.259> they're

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
bottom closer further that's why they're

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.910 
bottom closer further that's why they're
not<00:01:34.470> crashing<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.930> vice<00:01:37.259> versa<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.619> your<00:01:37.740> left

nice and big and I want you to let your

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.130 
nice and big and I want you to let your
poi<00:01:57.659> out<00:01:57.740> just<00:01:58.740> really<00:01:59.100> short<00:01:59.340> poi<00:01:59.520> like<00:01:59.700> this

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
poi out just really short poi like this

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.490 
poi out just really short poi like this
so<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.130> make<00:02:02.280> some<00:02:02.430> big<00:02:02.610> circles<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.409> if<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
so you make some big circles and if the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.660 
so you make some big circles and if the
ploy<00:02:04.680> are<00:02:04.830> really<00:02:05.040> short<00:02:05.250> they<00:02:05.460> probably

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
ploy are really short they probably

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.100 
ploy are really short they probably
aren't<00:02:05.940> hitting<00:02:06.270> your<00:02:06.510> arms<00:02:06.750> aren't<00:02:06.900> hitting

the play won't be hitting the player
short<00:02:08.429> enough<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.690> you're<00:02:09.899> slowly<00:02:10.350> going<00:02:10.649> to

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
short enough and you're slowly going to

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.070 
short enough and you're slowly going to
make<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.160> circle<00:02:11.550> smaller<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.360> smaller<00:02:12.690> and

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
make the circle smaller and smaller and

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.750 
make the circle smaller and smaller and
smaller<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.650> smaller<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.280> hopefully<00:02:14.670> you

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
smaller and smaller and hopefully you

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.730 
smaller and smaller and hopefully you
get<00:02:14.850> there<00:02:14.970> at<00:02:15.060> around<00:02:15.209> this<00:02:15.510> big<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:16.530> player
