you<00:03:05.310> get<00:03:05.550> your<00:03:05.700> first<00:03:05.970> point<00:03:06.270> street<00:03:06.630> so<00:03:07.200> that

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
you get your first point street so that

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.500 
you get your first point street so that
basically<00:03:07.440> means<00:03:07.709> you<00:03:08.100> get<00:03:08.220> plus<00:03:08.580> 50<00:03:09.120> for<00:03:09.270> the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
basically means you get plus 50 for the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.229 
basically means you get plus 50 for the
kill<00:03:09.750> if<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.770> pick<00:03:10.950> up<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.160> tag<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:12.030> and

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
kill if you pick up the tag of that and

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.000 
kill if you pick up the tag of that and
kill<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.380> reason<00:03:13.500> why<00:03:13.650> using<00:03:13.800> the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
kill this is the reason why using the

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.070 
kill this is the reason why using the
submission<00:03:14.520> or<00:03:14.760> shotgun<00:03:15.270> because<00:03:15.780> if<00:03:15.989> you

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
submission or shotgun because if you

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.270 
submission or shotgun because if you
kill<00:03:16.230> them<00:03:16.290> up<00:03:16.440> close<00:03:16.560> range<00:03:16.920> be<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.130> lot<00:03:17.250> easier

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
kill them up close range be a lot easier

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.920 
kill them up close range be a lot easier
to<00:03:17.520> get<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.700> tag<00:03:17.910> rather<00:03:18.420> than<00:03:18.600> killing<00:03:18.810> them

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
to get the tag rather than killing them

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.150 
to get the tag rather than killing them
across<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.140> maps<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.650> got<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.799> run<00:03:19.950> all

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
across the maps and you got to run all

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.680 
across the maps and you got to run all
the<00:03:20.459> way<00:03:20.489> across<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.760> map<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.180> may<00:03:21.299> die

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
the way across the map and you may die

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.720 
the way across the map and you may die
or<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.530> make<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.799> denies<00:03:23.100> that's<00:03:23.430> why<00:03:23.610> it's

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
or and make it denies that's why it's

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.550 
or and make it denies that's why it's
very<00:03:23.790> important<00:03:24.269> using<00:03:24.540> only<00:03:24.720> submachine<00:03:25.440> gun

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
very important using only submachine gun

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.140 
very important using only submachine gun
and<00:03:25.860> sought<00:03:26.130> rifles<00:03:26.519> and<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.790> vast<00:03:27.060> majority

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
and sought rifles and the vast majority

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.030 
and sought rifles and the vast majority
of<00:03:27.570> this<00:03:27.690> at<00:03:28.200> least<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.470> way<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:28.590> like<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:28.860> play

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
of this at least the way I like to play

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.880 
of this at least the way I like to play

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
team deathmatch sort of points and then

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.370 
team deathmatch sort of points and then
till<00:04:06.239> now<00:04:06.269> as<00:04:06.480> you<00:04:06.570> get<00:04:06.690> more<00:04:06.840> points<00:04:07.049> and

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
till now as you get more points and

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.110 
till now as you get more points and
let's<00:04:07.980> say<00:04:08.070> domination<00:04:08.580> domination<00:04:09.000> yeah

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
let's say domination domination yeah

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.500 
let's say domination domination yeah
plus<00:04:09.330> 50<00:04:09.780> if<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.950> flag<00:04:11.790> captures<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.329> killed

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
plus 50 if the flag captures and killed

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.020 
plus 50 if the flag captures and killed
so<00:04:13.140> that<00:04:13.500> basically<00:04:13.620> means<00:04:13.829> when<00:04:14.700> using<00:04:14.970> a

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
so that basically means when using a

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.940 
so that basically means when using a
shotgun<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.780> should<00:04:16.229> be<00:04:16.410> pretty<00:04:16.590> much<00:04:16.709> always

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
shotgun you should be pretty much always

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.440 
shotgun you should be pretty much always
be<00:04:17.190> able<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.459> guess<00:04:17.700> or<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.120> chakra

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
be able to guess or the chakra

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.279 
be able to guess or the chakra
specialist<00:04:18.989> especially<00:04:19.950> purely<00:04:20.430> because<00:04:21.289> if

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
you do kill them they're going to be

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.070 
you do kill them they're going to be
very<00:04:23.789> very<00:04:23.940> close<00:04:24.300> to<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:24.510> should<00:04:24.780> be<00:04:24.870> as<00:04:24.960> good

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
very very close to you should be as good

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
attack the vast majority of the time

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.260 
attack the vast majority of the time
apart

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
apart

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.430 
apart
when<00:04:27.360> he<00:04:27.449> was<00:04:27.599> right<00:04:27.870> about<00:04:28.050> that<00:04:28.110> which<00:04:28.410> is

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
when he was right about that which is

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.529 
when he was right about that which is
kind<00:04:28.710> of<00:04:28.770> stupid<00:04:28.949> I<00:04:29.160> was<00:04:29.340> jumping<00:04:30.060> across<00:04:30.360> the

the killstreak and the tag as plus 150

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.999 
the killstreak and the tag as plus 150
and<00:04:39.720> there<00:04:39.840> wasn't<00:04:39.960> really<00:04:40.139> any<00:04:40.440> game<00:04:40.800> mode

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
and there wasn't really any game mode

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.350 
and there wasn't really any game mode
that<00:04:41.159> really<00:04:41.400> offers<00:04:41.639> that<00:04:41.759> over<00:04:42.000> than<00:04:42.150> Search

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
that really offers that over than Search

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.869 
that really offers that over than Search
and<00:04:42.509> Destroy<00:04:42.539> which<00:04:43.020> is<00:04:43.259> and<00:04:43.560> it<00:04:44.490> probably<00:04:44.639> is

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:44.879 
and Destroy which is and it probably is

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:46.339 
and Destroy which is and it probably is
the<00:04:45.120> fastest<00:04:45.449> way<00:04:45.479> to<00:04:45.629> rank<00:04:45.840> up<00:04:46.020> if<00:04:46.199> you're

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
the fastest way to rank up if you're

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.559 
the fastest way to rank up if you're
like<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:47.069> super<00:04:47.610> elite<00:04:47.819> player<00:04:48.060> who<00:04:48.270> knows<00:04:48.419> the

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
PlayStation story but in my opinion it's

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:51.800 
PlayStation story but in my opinion it's
