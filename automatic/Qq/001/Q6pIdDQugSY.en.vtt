00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.470
 I would like to eat people 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.910
 apologize for that in the video 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.780
 you see the monster 's hair 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.070
 everything is broken off at the end is no 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.570
 I do not know how to find one hangs straight 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.140
 somewhere else 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:26.820
 ok it hail still dry but then 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.270
 It looks just like the skin 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:36.929
 But you see the difference 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:38.850
 So much smoother so if so 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:40.379
 Take another video and it's dry 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.719
 it's quite dry 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.579
 okay but this is in this video 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:52.499
 mainly to keep my mother 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:01:00.050
 Although sees a mouse because they know 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:01:03.539
 So prinz make-up drove black eyes 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.439
 only black or red and red eyes 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.500
 but here in the future, such a speaker 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:15.350
 if you can do that hair black 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.939
 nose piece nose lips blue chain 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.899
 this is not money but green 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.180
 is it so light green 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:28.200
 that 's the green no idea though 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.579
 somehow it looks like if now 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.049
 here from the camera but that is 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.149
 really green had that is one 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:43.679
 greenish stifters expertise can as well 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:47.820
 venus hundreds green black white green 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:51.600
 and knows a little bit further 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.000
 drafts still has a struggle here 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.070
 and two chains a black one in 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:03.179
 a fat green one criticized 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:06.179
 he will have them there, then 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:09.840
 again, however, a dark blue side 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:13.099
 Cat a dark green chain one two 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.440

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:21.720

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:25.610
 the heartiest ground with plateau here and 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.610
 is a bit daring 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.209
 I think they follow 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:36.450
 maybe he reached again 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:39.599

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.909

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:53.430
 Spoken mouse or old what man 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:55.319
 for example, when you mouse into files 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.540
 what can that mean if we are now 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.640
 For example, give field mouse then 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.110
 namely that, for example, write me 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:08.370
