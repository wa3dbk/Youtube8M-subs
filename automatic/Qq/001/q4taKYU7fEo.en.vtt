00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.799
 hi to all and I handed 2 neither sotware 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.590
 today a small presentation of 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.790
 camtasia studio 8 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.880
 so this is a software that will help you 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.910
 allow to save your screen 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.860
 computer as I do now 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.020
 so as you can see on the school 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.329
 here so I do not have to stop him but 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.469
 so I'll be able to move it 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.130
 see here and you can do several 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:42.830
 stuff so 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:45.620
 like to record your voice so the shf 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.630
 boldly signed by against so is that 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.640
 works very well if not there and there is 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.080
 also so it's a shame that I can not 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.270
 to stop because there I'm trying 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.590
 happens to save it so saved 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.870
 so I can not stop 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.780
 I'm sorry, but I'm sorry 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.310
 will post a video here where I am 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.190
 not or a small video 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.760
 0.8 pattern presentations so for 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.710
 which is the original two 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.369
 ex-miss the creator of kenta this 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.000
 picture 8 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:17.330
 so you can also register 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.580
 your head with your webcam also more 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.200
 early we recorded in your screen and the 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.410
 are so it's really the best 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:29.090
 software to record your your 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:31.490
 office here then I tell you everything from 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.490
 suite if for the gamer actually under 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.670
 software will not allow to look 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.740
 no to record videos for them 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.840
 video games no you will not be able to 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.630
 can only for your office so 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.060
 all that is I you will not be able 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:51.640
 it will not work for that it will take 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.869
 just other software there are plenty 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.460
 so after you can look in 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.490
 my tutorial normally I already did 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.250
 several software tutorials 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.259
 which saves your screen 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.450
 for video games but this one is not going 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.840
 not allow you to register your judges 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.910
 to video games this will only be for your 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.040
 office but otherwise it will work on all 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.800
 the other tabs and all at all 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.410
 other files except pretty girls 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.670
 So here you are 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.620
 download from the official website so there 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.150
 not found on logitech is not 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.930
 present no who is present only on 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:34.030
 technical and so that's a it's a 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.030
 English software so 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.060
 there are versions that are in French 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:41.930
 but not the 8 so the new version 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.120
 will only be in English and other 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.370
 still but not French like you 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.530
 can read it if we regret 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.990
 well, but at worst we do not care 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:56.580
 finally if you really have zero 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:58.080
 in France and not in English bah voila I 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.370
 I'm sorry for you but the version 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.460
 after version 7 French kim and some 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.810
 the a8 which is not in french good after 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.180
 there will be updates so you 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.800
 maybe it'll come French 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.850
 maybe because it's not very 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.110
 a long time I know more when she is 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.670
 exit the a89 I'm not so then 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.900
 I will make a small presentation of 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.360
 eraser out of eight 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.519
 this software is not free so I 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.799
 will buy you can try it before 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.260
 as I do so so you can do 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:33.590
 a free trial of surely 30 days or 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.090
 40 years old 30 normally and so as one 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.780
 could read records you can 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.939
 save screen content 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.439
 the monte for besides a video of 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:44.269
 screenshot worthy of a professional 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.859
 it is true that it is really easy 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.549
 fitting right after I have other 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.390
 more professional software but that 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.519
 is largely sufficient 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.470
 with camtasia you can even do 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.730
 very good moodagent after you 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.700
 can share it 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.260
 so on youtube all that from the 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.389
 software 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.069
 that's cool too here and you 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.840
 can do some very good stuff 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.189
 quality since me there for example there I 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.970
 filmed in full hd 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:12.409
 you can ferrand as could 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.609
 really change all the settings 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.470
 so I show you that right now we 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.849
 appear on it so you can 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.739
 do it download a version 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:23.650
 30-day trial I advise you 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:27.289
 before buying it for you to be 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:31.340
 so that's it so we'll try then 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:32.330
 Normally I can so that's it 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.220
 what I had done before 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.860
 so you see that we can mount a 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.870
 little cut so will be in English 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.219
 it's not very far not very serious so 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.409
 the copy cut deleted two 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:47.979
 bookstores so library 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:50.550
 after speeding up a cervid offered a 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.800
 slow motion cut the video 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.560
 so yeah we can do a ton of 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.560
 things and finally so you can too 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.539
 obviously make settings on the one 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.159
 So here I have to make adjustments 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:08.500
 before to pluck crazy time there so I 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:12.699
 after you can obviously edit 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.250
 its masters all full hd and you can 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.650
 make eric ott screen 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.779
 here and bring media you see 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.930
 here at the bookstore so there are several 

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:25.090
 little admiration 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.490
 after you can add small 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:31.470
 bubbles the little arrows edit 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:37.030
 the screen so hop the wii that got 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:40.930
 modified and finally the audio ci could 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:43.630
 sometimes even change the sounds bc1 the 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.250
 frequency and you go so I'm fine and 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.080
 I will quickly go around 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.699
 otherwise we can spend hours on it 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.680
 there are really a lot of things I do you 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.060
 strongly advise 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.639
 after what are you here 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:59.009
 small effects for the images too 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:02.320
 at here you can hide the cursor 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:06.280
 what are we seeing there are plenty of 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:09.789
 things close that's it if you do like 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.009
 me video montages I get it to you 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:14.949
 advises 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:17.800
 So here I have done a little 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:19.060
 tutorial on this software by what I have 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.870
 seen in the comments that I had 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:25.389
 asked several times that she is one 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.430
 software to record your screen and 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:28.930
 Well here it is this one as small 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.330
 asia studio 8 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.889
 the new version surely that there 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.919
 will have a work and updates 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:38.320
 so here I am finished for this 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.430
 little presentation of this software and I 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.300
 tell you more for a neighbor 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.300
 hi tutorial
