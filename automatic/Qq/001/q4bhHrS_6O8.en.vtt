00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.710
 bringing another video gameplay 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.059
 commented to you 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.280
 and today I'm bringing a 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.490
 video of destiny plus one and for the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.970
 channel and in this video here I wanted to ask 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.310
 that you do not curse me there because I'm going 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.760
 bring walt of colleges here on the channel 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.769
 because there are a lot of people that still 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.109
 did not take one of mine right that I'm 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.660
 using it and in the background gameplay, right? 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.210
 the destination is high and there are a lot of people 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.820
 is also having difficulty in this 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.530
 part of the radio where it falls so I 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.969
 I wanted to bring some tips to 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.100
 You, because I know there are a lot of people. 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.680
 Because it helped a lot of people in the goal is 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.200
 yeah to catch her trying to pick it up at the time 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.480
 I can not and I will not say that everything 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.100
 world catches because it is difficult to know 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.739
 how is df luch 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.899
 but then I wanted to ask you 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.910
 because there are people who will think that 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.100
 presence bringing video and old radio 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.020
 I do not know what it is but it's because there's a lot 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.000
 people who still have to do this here 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.450
 I know you may be watching there. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.189
 already did have herald of fate but I 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.470
 I'm bringing you here, but for the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.299
 people, of course you can watch 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.189
 da luz em See what it is but it is I am 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.820
 bringing you more here to give you tips for 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.880
 the people who still can not catch 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.830
 understood then come on and that's what we 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.259
 does the strategy 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.420
 We're going to get everyone from the 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.090
 squadron will be up there in the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.040
 stone where you even have a little 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.710
 one to destroy the oracles I think that all 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.450
 world must know why, because here the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.390
 Templar every time he does ritual 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.060
 of denial he will call two oracles 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.920
 or every time he destroyed the dark he was not 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.140
 people mark every time another shield 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.780
 it but in fact it is a ritual of 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.579
 denial and calls the oracles then 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.270
 people will destroy only the oracles 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.969
 of the fund in case I leave there a person 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.570
 the squadron will go down will pick up 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.850
 relic and stay is with the two oracles 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.270
 the bottom but then what happens will 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.709
 appear several archives there several even 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.060
 so what you make you stay 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.860
 alternating between right and left 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.690
 alternating rights that gay rights 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.270
 right to die for the 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.550
 harpies is killing the apis tries to kill 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.380
 as much as you can 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.120
 and you will catch the oracle both from 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.500
 the bottom of the right 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.390
 left sometimes you can even 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.610
 get to catch your brothers 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.000
 some more time ahead 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.130
 but they are exceptions only a few times 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.870
 You 'll need it because the Templar 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.099
 he's ahead he can not hit 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.569
 and such but it is this is how you are going to stay 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.760
 jumping between left and right and 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.819
 killing the harpies until their super fills 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.810
 now the tip for who shovels with the relic 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.720
 that I give 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.440
 are two tips so that will help 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.060
 very 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.350
 beyond that to stay running between 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.200
 left and right to not die 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.030
 to draw pizzi to catch the oracles 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.360
 The first tip I want to bring to 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.480
 You're very careful with the Templar. 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.150
 Why are you going to have the time that he's going to watch? 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.459
 You 're going to start shooting. 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.670
 Our lady, it's going to take a lot of life. 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:19.090
 of you will kill our lot right take 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:23.790
 very careful with the Templar and the other 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.790
 The tip I want to bring to you is that 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:32.519
 you when it's time for you to destroy 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:35.230
 ooo Templar Shield with Relic 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.579
 You're going to have to break sometimes. 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.980
 appear around to fade with the 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.750
 relic and you in case you will have to 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.680
 break because you if you leave 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.959
 inside of you you die what happens 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.209
 It's time you go to break it. 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.630
 tighten it 's river to hit with the relic 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:54.760
 No, in the shield you end up going straight. 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.389
 Wow, how many times I die because of 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.459
 of this 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:00.700
 and what is the tip then when the 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.920
 Shield you go to the tip of the shield 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.660
 is right at one end of the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.329
 It 's because I actually escudÃ© 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.760
 It's circular it has no tip but you get it 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.549
 well and get close to the end of the shell 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.430
 and from there you turn to the other end 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.410
 which is more distant and tightening r 1 than 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.750
 You're sure to break because 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.450
 you will not break in case you will not 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.409
 get out of the inside of the shell then you 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.180
 no longer dies 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.650
 This is very good and this is a tip. 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.990
 essential that you will die 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.960
 much and he take care to contemplate 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.630
 in this video the inace background gameplay 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.910
 I have an hour and the Templar hill 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.320
 but it was pure racism because I gave it 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.199
 even I was in the middle of the hill 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.000
 harpy and joined the Templar and 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.669
 Do you think anything happens to you? 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.830
 and you have the fourth equal I'm there and 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.080
 You have a glow when you 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.050
 To die, you 're going to revive. 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.180
 back in the center where renic appears 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.850
 there on time it will start because it 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.130
 Going back there, understood then. 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.490
 was the two main tips is the other 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:06.760
 Tip also a hint jean but good and 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.020
 you do is that sometimes you are going 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.610
 something happens, you're not going to 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.690
 destroy the oracles of the background 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.520
 with relic 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.440
 So what's the point you let go of? 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.810
 relic can jump relic rapidion 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.430
 take a heavy weapon a machine gun 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.130
 heavy, preferably because if you 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:25.320
 very close to that of the oracle and 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:29.830
 shoot with a rally or shoot with a 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.630
 carla is roni any such bazooka 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.669
 It will explode very close to you and 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.440
 You asked the question, did you die with the impact? 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.620
 so what is that for a machine gun 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.389
 heavy and it bites bullet but it is very difficult 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.070
 happen think this once with me 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:45.370
 the oracle're wanting to die 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.550
 relic but then I managed was 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.760
 suspended and but it's very difficult, it's really just 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.349
 You're careful because you have 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.970
 that destroy the oracle because if not all 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.740
 world that is up there will die for 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.050
 cause of the denial ritual I will not stay 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.729
 marked by the oracle and for you purifies 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.210
 to them only with the relic 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.620
 So it's hard, but this is it. 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.389
 it was the video that I wanted to bring 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.130
 I hope the tips have helped 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.380
 still can not catch 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.550
 It's the herald of the let's face advice. 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.479
 because to see you 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:19.539
 she is better is better than the karam rudder 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:21.639
 forever ours is very good and not bad pv 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:24.039
 has Croatian word that is better than 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.889
 that every word of crotone loses 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:29.409
 thousand easy zero and stop to play 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:31.750
 I even said too much is better in the game. 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:33.820
 it is clear that it provides penalties are other 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.380
 five hundred but then we can do 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.710
 even a video talking to the best 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:41.290
 weapons to use in pv penalty who knows 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:43.480
 So that's it, I'm staying for 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:46.180
 here thank you very much to everyone who 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.800
 watched if liked and is not extinct 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.540
 channel subscribes 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.250
 let me share in your networks 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:59.080
 is I already defined it probably goes 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:01.360
 have a video there where I'll bring the 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.070
 how can I say I'll bring it as it is 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.330
 that will stay the channel frequency 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.840
 because I've already defined how the 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.160
 frequency my channel and probably even 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.440
 The weekend should be going away. 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:18.030
 So thanks a lot to those who 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:18.030
 A big hug to everyone and thanks.
