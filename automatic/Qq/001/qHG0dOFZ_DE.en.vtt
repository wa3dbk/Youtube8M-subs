his late teens so anyway we John's
version<00:02:15.770> very<00:02:16.250> simple

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.880 

at<00:02:25.500> 5:00<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:27.030> back<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.959> one<00:02:28.140> there<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.739> have

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
at 5:00 and back to one there you have

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.289 
at 5:00 and back to one there you have
the<00:02:29.040> chord<00:02:29.250> progression<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.819> will<00:02:29.970> analyze<00:02:30.090> a

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
the chord progression I will analyze a

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.899 
the chord progression I will analyze a
little<00:02:30.599> bit<00:02:30.690> more<00:02:30.840> coming<00:02:31.170> up<00:02:31.260> but<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.760> can

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
little bit more coming up but you can

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.940 
little bit more coming up but you can
play<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.060> very<00:02:33.390> simple<00:02:33.810> version<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.290> just<00:02:34.709> by

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
play a very simple version of it just by

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.619 
play a very simple version of it just by
doing<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.150> can<00:02:36.269> play<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:36.569> any

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
doing that and you can play it in any

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.360 
doing that and you can play it in any
key<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.930> want<00:02:37.170> we've<00:02:37.470> got<00:02:37.500> an<00:02:37.860> eighth<00:02:38.129> measure

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
key you want we've got an eighth measure

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.140 
key you want we've got an eighth measure
progression<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:40.459> again<00:02:41.459> they're<00:02:41.910> just

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
progression that is again they're just

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.270 
progression that is again they're just
typical<00:02:42.299> of<00:02:42.780> what<00:02:43.349> we<00:02:43.440> heard<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.920> 50s

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
typical of what we heard in the 50s

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.300 
typical of what we heard in the 50s
great<00:02:45.030> melody<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.739> everything<00:02:46.739> else<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.069> come

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
great melody and everything else so come

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.860 
great melody and everything else so come
up<00:02:47.340> we'll<00:02:47.610> talk<00:02:47.730> about<00:02:47.849> chord<00:02:48.450> progression

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
up we'll talk about chord progression

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.319 
up we'll talk about chord progression
different<00:02:49.379> keys<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.940> particularly<00:02:50.940> fun<00:02:51.180> get

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
different keys and particularly fun get

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.819 
different keys and particularly fun get
the<00:02:51.390> bass<00:02:51.540> line<00:02:51.810> in<00:02:51.989> there<00:02:52.140> what<00:02:52.440> some<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.739> the

the bass line in there what some of the

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.100 
the bass line in there what some of the
options<00:02:53.160> are<00:02:53.310> as<00:02:53.579> far<00:02:53.940> as<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.540> best<00:02:54.690> keys<00:02:54.930> to

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
options are as far as the best keys to

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.110 
options are as far as the best keys to
do<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.409> in<00:02:55.730> okay<00:02:56.730> stand<00:02:57.540> by<00:02:57.720> me<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.970> was<00:03:00.060> the

works in other keys and some keys that

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.110 
works in other keys and some keys that
works<00:03:22.739> really<00:03:22.890> well<00:03:23.010> in<00:03:23.340> other<00:03:23.489> keys<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.940> just

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
works really well in other keys it just

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.150 
works really well in other keys it just
doesn't<00:03:24.420> happen<00:03:24.569> very<00:03:24.840> well<00:03:24.959> so<00:03:25.739> if<00:03:26.040> you'd
