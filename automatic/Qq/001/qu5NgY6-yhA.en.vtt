channel that i really want to get back
into<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:00.459> because<00:03:00.579> I've<00:03:00.760> got<00:03:00.880> so<00:03:01.120> much<00:03:01.299> time<00:03:01.599> at

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
into it because I've got so much time at

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.630 
into it because I've got so much time at
the<00:03:01.930> moment<00:03:02.049> I'm<00:03:02.319> finished<00:03:02.680> shooting<00:03:02.769> I<00:03:03.099> don't

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
the moment I'm finished shooting I don't

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.180 
the moment I'm finished shooting I don't
have<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:04.269> much<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.720> do<00:03:04.900> through<00:03:05.110> fair<00:03:05.349> and<00:03:05.560> I

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.250

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
think bringing my second channel back

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.690 
think bringing my second channel back
from<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.650> dead<00:03:08.829> would<00:03:08.950> be<00:03:09.040> quite<00:03:09.220> fun<00:03:09.430> if<00:03:09.610> you

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.400 
from the dead would be quite fun if you
