00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.510
 what it says on has been transfer stories for some time 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.359
 checkered yellow to red 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:10.439
 on the articles 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:13.569
 what about June, the room will be explained that way 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:15.920
 yes and who can talk about losing 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.650
 also a lot of concrete interest has been for a number of boys but 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.060
 that was established and see no reason to cross it 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.159
 discussion 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.539
 and that our choice is wonderful to keep this core together as much as possible 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.589
 form is no reason to get bored with those people 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.910
 because the amounts currently on the remote nonsense 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.110
 don't be tempted to do that because we think these guys are still here 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.450
 have a sporting future and that they also finance nice deals 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.380
 have made it late last season 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.440
 and we'll see if it's going to change in the future but ahead of the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.750
 first line very clear 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.290
 from which angle channel offers have been 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.030
 yes i did teach her that 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.530
 both premier league health 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.240
 the Italian competition is his 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.730
 dozens of questions we have been from a different angle into a concrete one 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.470
 especially the shows is the stock the premier league and the 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.730
 council elections how big is the chance that we will be boys next season 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.230
 want to play four other Belgian clubs from the core of today 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.940
 yes there I can only have a basin and still have a child that club itself after 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.970
 be worth money with the expo are not new bulb and then go out 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.390
 I must say that the newspaper 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.010
 In the end I am very proud of being born 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.120
 we were already shocked to the newspaper that a number of construction errors had been set up 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.670
 to become 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.080
 people who are sold but has not been stopped for a year or two 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.750
 how they are to find the timing for that 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.660
 yes but even then the amounts offered will be a 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.660
 have to learn the substantial role that had taken place at the moment 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.670
 This is of course I see us in states but also only more pressing 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.080
 corresponded with the kids we think those guys can be worth 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.070
 in those clubs 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.760
 but also a few guys who run a sort of mattson rental base here 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.600
 moving day the second room 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.159
 yes, instead of the funnel, the entire project is given 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.770
 we we have a possibility to highlight the option that we will also pure 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.270
 sponsor stays with us 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.520
 on the other hand find the man that was an appointment for india but show up 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:11.899
 have an appointment with liverpool 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:14.689
 not only to talk about Chris but also to a number of other players 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.329
 so this became 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.519
 experiments with crisis more than successful I would say and will 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.549
 see if we can get even more players there 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.529
 maybe the cable will get the number of five players believing it will be the recipient 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.659
 with the project us five players in the council 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.469
 concrete for that is the tukkers 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.099
 then it is still an attempted story from 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.219
 But Thomas Buffalo's contract runs to late also with him a recent one 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:40.999
 talk about that 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:42.579
 have this week 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.889
 another date 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.889
 this should of course not last indefinitely in the short term 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:50.399
 or come to an agreement 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.860
 the coach is generally aware that there is an interest in it 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.140
 for big players 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.140
 how do they actually deal with that when the big names come knocking on the door 

00:02:58.149 --> 00:03:01.309
 we believe that very pleasant I meant who will not be there 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.919
 As a reception on the spot it turned out to be possibly sporty and financial 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:06.170
 system 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.139
 the twitter 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.149
 Everyone will be flattered by the interest from abroad 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.519
 so probably continue to play 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.159
 who qualify for it 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.559
 unless realistic enough to realize what is a very big step for some 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:19.639
 could go 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.399
 yes most value I think they are very aware of the fact that they give me that 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:24.239
 she something 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.580
 have realized beautifully that should confirm and that 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:32.919
 yes another competition at a different level of course and therefore a step 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.919
 So for that matter you don't think there is much 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:39.119
 for a lot written on the contrary 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:43.649
 mary everything on the side improving the financial sporting euri is of course possible 

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:48.259
 and very important for the further career or for the further life through 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:51.419
 in that if it will be limited in the coming period 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.529
 between the players involved from last night's great fire to the 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:55.659
 next week too 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.129
 what comes out of the group will gradually move to next year 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.909
 what is possible is to have realized something item and second was 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.769
 already have the ambition to 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.610
 or because I would say maybe not to match and that is always the ambition 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:08.870
 but leave us 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.989
 remain modest 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.149
 but they still win 

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:16.919
 yes certain collateral hearing what is going to happen with this game 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.109
 the brand is about the rush hour 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.620
 happening during the trial was the intention of the club 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.160
 is that in tie also have a lot of ambition ambition that she wants to drive the car 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.129
 have confirmed that 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:28.689
 and now there is will and 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:30.330
 see ladies again 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.419
 we start from the season inside 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.639
 in previous interviews everyone says they are not concerned with the title viewed 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:36.849
 match per match 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.809
 but inside the rooms it was also different to what happened 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:41.409
 is with the premiums 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:45.319
 yes but that is not think and to be strong wind with a certain 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:46.129
 wording 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.620
 that prevents the focus and I put everything in it 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.719
 but 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:54.759
 they have not forgotten that they had to land a tree the week before and that 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:59.789
 is also what there would already be so this one with the title also in its ambition seat 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.189
 but more 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:04.229
 from the moment that that was also agreed, that board 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.830
 I am happy to sing best because for the premiums most important reason 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.860
 premiums the reward 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.599
 just before solid and done in terms of price 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.069
 yes but to spread a bit now it was the first second third set too 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:17.150
 everyone rob prince 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.809
 how was it to stop financing for the club somewhere 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:24.490
 but they do have one that sets the bar very high and of course one 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.559
 the ultimate premium the questioned 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:30.490
 to drop the rest 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.789
 in the annual appointment for the 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:35.389
 next season all the team mates armstrong that must be terrible 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.710
 trouble because you do not know what you want and have another 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.750
 no that is secondary and local law so there are one 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.400
 some nice characters that are clear there are barely an hour off 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.880
 You rarely see you ask for more game minutes to have one 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.419
 excellent something else 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.900
 but for the rest of all the coffee because there are many more in the 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.189
 socialite quoting the concert that most think 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:59.019
 There are a number of old negotiations under way with the extension of 

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:01.719
 contracts or not and then you are on the bike of having to make decisions 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:05.659
 in that respect, if the gentlemen 8 played a part 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:08.059
 instead of the second time on hold 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:11.199
 there are also five songs that come back next season 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:14.879
 yes, because in the first instance it would not be possible to open the count 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:19.270
 only do our duties and did it on such a must 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.900
 she was suffering from it so we will play back in the game 

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:25.610
 that will see through 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.850
 to stop we are winning a contract with rkc and we have to return that sp 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:33.250
 nice to see we don't count on it next to last year's title but the points 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.990
 you immediately went back to work to talk to them 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.689
 sell the holiday shelter 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:40.259
 and it comes to an end, it will certainly be fine 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:42.229
 before the election of the family 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:45.479
 after the release not yet fixed, death is that 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:48.819
 we do have a free hear, we have to fill it in 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:51.630
 the location child not the renting 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.120
 michel is stuck but that will come from first to a square with the 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.050
 thirtieth 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.060
 so what by finishing the works and tiendalli around his strict as much as possible 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.350
 left beginning very quickly back again yes you know that now all mclaren or 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:07.229
 must all be ready ball international trains orphans 

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:08.669
 the programs of the day 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:13.580
 how the fork and then it was so slightly shorter because we were still there 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.680
 a few days for the twentieth time some people there but then it 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.759
 is that they are again 

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:20.499
 from the first to the fifteenth will efkes 

00:07:20.499 --> 00:07:20.959
 stop
