00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
going to go for a wall in into a very

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.040 
going to go for a wall in into a very
fast<00:01:48.590> command<00:01:49.070> center<00:01:49.429> but<00:01:50.149> of<00:01:50.270> course<00:01:50.600> the

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
fast command center but of course the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.859 
fast command center but of course the
expansion<00:01:51.890> will<00:01:52.130> be<00:01:52.280> faster<00:01:52.850> for<00:01:52.880> hero<00:01:53.509> and

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
expansion will be faster for hero and

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.320 
expansion will be faster for hero and
he's<00:01:54.710> 11<00:01:55.100> with<00:01:55.280> that<00:01:55.430> right<00:01:55.610> now<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:55.909> these<00:01:56.030> two

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
he's 11 with that right now so these two

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.969 
he's 11 with that right now so these two
pretty<00:01:56.840> even<00:01:57.229> going<00:01:57.560> into<00:01:57.799> this<00:01:59.409> so<00:02:00.409> we<00:02:00.770> have

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
pretty even going into this so we have
