in<00:00:00.870> this<00:00:01.079> video<00:00:01.469> we<00:00:02.100> want<00:00:02.220> to<00:00:02.340> take<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.639> look<00:00:02.970> at

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
in this video we want to take a look at

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.230 
in this video we want to take a look at
the<00:00:03.840> six<00:00:04.110> prepositions<00:00:05.009> which<00:00:05.700> govern<00:00:06.120> the

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
the six prepositions which govern the

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.919 
the six prepositions which govern the
instrumental<00:00:06.899> case<00:00:07.910> these<00:00:08.910> are<00:00:08.970> words<00:00:09.389> which

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
instrumental case these are words which

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.440 
instrumental case these are words which
should<00:00:10.230> be<00:00:10.380> somewhat<00:00:10.830> familiar<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:11.790> from

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
should be somewhat familiar to you from

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.860 
should be somewhat familiar to you from
basic<00:00:12.929> Russian<00:00:13.410> grammar<00:00:13.679> studies<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.870> this

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
basic Russian grammar studies and this

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.040 
basic Russian grammar studies and this
will<00:00:16.080> be<00:00:16.230> simply<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:17.070> short<00:00:17.609> review<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.449> those

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
will be simply a short review of those

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.300 
will be simply a short review of those
prepositions<00:00:21.199> these<00:00:22.199> are<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> prepositions

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
prepositions these are the prepositions

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.779 
prepositions these are the prepositions
that<00:00:23.970> govern<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.689> instrumental<00:00:25.439> case<00:00:26.660> not<00:00:28.789> me

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
that govern the instrumental case not me

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:39.560 
that govern the instrumental case not me

discussion<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.350> these<00:00:40.500> prepositions<00:00:41.480> can<00:00:42.480> be

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
discussion of these prepositions can be

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.290 
discussion of these prepositions can be
complicated<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.620> little<00:00:43.980> bit<00:00:44.160> by<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.910> fact

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
complicated a little bit by the fact

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.080 
complicated a little bit by the fact
that<00:00:45.600> some<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> prepositions<00:00:47.090> govern

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
that some of the prepositions govern

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.700 
that some of the prepositions govern
other<00:00:48.539> cases<00:00:48.930> besides<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:50.070> instrumental

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
other cases besides the instrumental

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.819 
other cases besides the instrumental
although<00:00:52.710> I'll<00:00:52.890> comment<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:54.030> fact<00:00:54.360> I

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
although I'll comment on that fact I

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.560 
although I'll comment on that fact I
won't<00:00:55.829> try<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.250> establish<00:00:56.610> precise

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
won't try to establish precise

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.529 
won't try to establish precise
definitions<00:00:58.469> for<00:00:59.250> these<00:00:59.399> prepositions<00:00:59.760> in

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
definitions for these prepositions in

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.799 
definitions for these prepositions in
other<00:01:01.170> cases<00:01:01.530> but<00:01:02.129> we'll<00:01:02.370> focus<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.570> use

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
other cases but we'll focus on the use

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.670 
other cases but we'll focus on the use
in<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.260> instrumental<00:01:04.979> case<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:07.290> first<00:01:07.560> thing

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
in the instrumental case the first thing

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.570 
in the instrumental case the first thing
that<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.549> should<00:01:08.580> notice<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.409> all<00:01:10.890> of

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
that we should notice is that all of

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.780 
that we should notice is that all of
these<00:01:11.729> prepositions<00:01:12.799> involve<00:01:13.799> some<00:01:14.220> sort<00:01:14.610> of

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
these prepositions involve some sort of

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.649 
these prepositions involve some sort of
position<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.950> fact<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.369> instrumental<00:01:18.180> case

position in fact the instrumental case

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.730 
position in fact the instrumental case
in<00:01:19.130> this<00:01:20.130> use<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:21.180> really<00:01:21.509> be<00:01:21.720> thought<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.350> as

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
in this use can really be thought of as

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.719 
in this use can really be thought of as
a<00:01:23.189> positional<00:01:23.909> case<00:01:24.590> above<00:01:25.850> between<00:01:27.500> behind
