 greet you dear friends of course 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.189
 same most interesting and important for 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.260
 last week right now today we 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.090
 We learn that already van plunges already 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.340
 will get female characters 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.220
 new metal gear solid details 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.950
 online dota 2 as a third person shooter 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.230
 and much more like dota 2 in 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.059
 like a third-person shooter would like to 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.129
 you play such a creation to all 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.719
 fans of the game dota 2 who cares 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.030
 look at how you might look 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.680
 game be it a little more action new 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.350
 worth remembering the name of the mod 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.510
 action dota this mod turns the game into 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.910
 third-person shooter development 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.070
 engaged by the famous moder benze dota 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.190
 equipping her design with the appropriate 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.469
 control and even sound effects 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.899
 of course not so good show Rawat 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.090
 Yes, and in general it looks very unimportant yes 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.010
 according to take 2 dota it is only 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.470
 experiment in basic functionality 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.100
 gameplay is therefore ahead of the mass 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.560
 work 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.900
 Unfortunately until the release is not planned and 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.240
 respectively, and no one and release date 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.009
 heard nothing can only be seen 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.049
 on the gameplay of the video that you are 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.909
 can find in the description if you think 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.280
 what is developing a new island parse 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.020
 ron is engaged in studio days which means 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.360
 that in the game we are waiting for a bunch of explosions 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.630
 destruction and other things in the spirit of battlefield 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.579
 3 or 4 hurry to disappoint you a little earlier 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.560
 official channel electronics rts star 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.420
 wars twitter reported destructible 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.880
 the same bowfront will however only 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.070
 such which makes sense in quotes 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.780
 it turned out that this does not mean that 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.899
 she will be at the level of the last games 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.850
 battlefield in an interview with engaged patrick 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.710
 bach days general manager informed 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.619
 that destructible battlefield like 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.090
 will not be authentic for a star game 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.780
 wars 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.270
 how can 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.010
 don't get shit in people's ears why not 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.920
 just admits we are missing 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.209
 time we do not have enough money we got 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.319
 do not care what to say and 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.790
 cinematic when 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.480
 technological progress has gone far 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.819
 forward buys better not to call 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.459
 distracted quoting the star universe itself 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.600
 wars forms what we do so 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.209
 we will not include 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.989
 excessive destructibility simply because 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.600
 can nobody can do it comes down 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.150
 to a simple formula what should we do 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.459
 what we want to do and if 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.840
 compare battlefield and battle frunta 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.090
 says patrick 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:46.950
 so it is so but why not a 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.510
 chicken john smith and head jungle campari 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.260
 formerly known as sony online 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.060
 entertainment 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.610
 but sold by sony a private investment 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.440
 companies announced on twitter that team 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.420
 already finishing work on women 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.580
 character models for h van shutter 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.440
 intending to inflict their network zombies 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.600
 Survival in the coming weeks 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.670
 so the developers perform 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.380
 earlier promise that customization 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.579
 will rise one more level 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.470
 mud from sleep under created 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.450
 the game is still in deep 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.079
 early access but progress is pretty 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.269
 alive 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.519
 pace precisely higher than the Desi wait 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.290
 whom many are frankly tired 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.290
 Does anyone else even play near 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.060
 let's talk a little bit more boron 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.859
 front as it became known last 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.400
 a week after the first show of star wars 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.170
 bowfront 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.359
 new game studio up to of will include 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.280
 character customization however not worth it 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.950
 expect that such customization will be 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.040
 limitless yes you can not paint 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.510
 Darth Vader in pink color a pity 21 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.880
 april producer gary star wars 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.130
 battlefront jasper nelson explained 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.230
 why visual customization is not 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.140
 allow you to turn darth vader into 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.700
 Darth Vader with his cloak May Little Pony 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.200
 I quote we will share the details 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.109
 regarding the possibility of customization 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.299
 later but now I can say 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.890
 The following is of course good to provide. 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.380
 players the ability to customize their 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.920
 appearance but work in star wars 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.080
 imagine how much player 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.380
 will be disappointed if you start 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.269
 destroy the centuries canon trabla 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.310
 that the developers themselves allow 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.709
 drive themselves into the framework of the publisher and they 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.010
 supposedly must follow clear rules 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.560
 to receive funding unless the matter 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.800
 in money the pupil was distracted again 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.960
 there is a huge amount of passionate 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.480
 fans who will gaze at 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.300
 The smallest details and can direct 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.520
 his criticism even if we move a little 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.280
 from the original universe just because 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.620
 that we want to do something different we 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.320
 want the battlefield was very 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.720
 authentic posture wars game and we 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.360
 should have taken this into account when creating 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.400
 reasonable customization system and by the way 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.810
 star wars boba front will be a Jedi and in 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.720
 buffet and jango fett 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.940
 and by the way or it will take place on November 17th 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.780
 years on a personal computer 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.780
 playstation 2 and xbox one 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.060
 during the session answers to questions 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.710
 metal gear development team online 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.630
 network component metal gir solid 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.520
 five shared some details 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.940
 regarding gameplay 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.410
 so what do we have developers 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.419
 are considering adding 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.419
 other characters besides snake and 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.520
 ocelot that is basically expected in the game 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.070
 there will be thematic equipment like 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.090
 slam metal gear rex during matches 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.090
 will fall out 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.070
 ammunition however the drop system 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.260
 recycle for multiplayer will be 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.100
 own progress system but for now 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.350
 without details 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.960
 Likely hero online this in the first 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:48.229
 foremost tactics and unique world of metal 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.600
 gear multiplayer will be different from 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.789
 similar modes in other games he will 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.210
 available to beginners but rather complicated 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:58.729
 something will be for pro gamers 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:01.220
 maps in quotes are relatively extensive 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:03.830
 so in theory more thoughtful 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:07.100
 use of non-lethal methods 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.370
 will have the advantage more details 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.050
 in May, the benefit is not long to wait 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.330
 people do not support online 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.990
 playstation move this way release 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.150

 delayed until mid-September of course 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.790
 where do without it let us slow down 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:34.580
 more advanced platform bitter sake 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:36.200

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.970
