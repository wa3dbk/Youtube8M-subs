Candida<00:00:02.340> training<00:00:02.669> HQ<00:00:03.210> today<00:00:03.840> I<00:00:03.870> have<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.170> quick

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
Candida training HQ today I have a quick

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.470 
Candida training HQ today I have a quick
tip<00:00:04.680> top<00:00:04.859> you<00:00:05.069> increase<00:00:05.460> your<00:00:05.640> bench<00:00:05.879> press<00:00:06.000> a

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
tip top you increase your bench press a

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.240 
tip top you increase your bench press a
common<00:00:06.990> problem<00:00:07.290> with<00:00:07.410> benching<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.010> that

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
common problem with benching is that

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.459 
common problem with benching is that
people<00:00:08.550> have<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.940> proper<00:00:09.330> set<00:00:09.599> up<00:00:09.780> but<00:00:10.290> when

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
people have the proper set up but when

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.870 
people have the proper set up but when
it<00:00:10.559> comes<00:00:10.769> down<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:10.980> bringing<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.490> bar<00:00:11.670> down

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
it comes down to bringing the bar down

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.060 
it comes down to bringing the bar down
before<00:00:12.360> they<00:00:12.509> touch<00:00:12.719> their<00:00:12.990> chest<00:00:13.290> they<00:00:13.769> lose

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
before they touch their chest they lose

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.950 
before they touch their chest they lose
tightness<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.820> see<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.150> bar<00:00:15.330> accelerate

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
tightness and you see the bar accelerate

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.960 
tightness and you see the bar accelerate
as<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.379> touches<00:00:16.560> their<00:00:16.859> chest<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.760> they

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
as it touches their chest and they

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.580 
as it touches their chest and they
aren't<00:00:18.119> necessarily<00:00:18.570> trying<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.050> bounce<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
aren't necessarily trying to bounce the

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.590 
aren't necessarily trying to bounce the
weight<00:00:19.740> up<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.699> they<00:00:20.970> do<00:00:21.029> lose<00:00:21.390> that

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
weight up but they do lose that

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.509 
weight up but they do lose that
tightness<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.230> what<00:00:22.619> often<00:00:22.769> happens<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.310> then

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
tightness and what often happens is then

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.980 
tightness and what often happens is then
you<00:00:23.640> miss<00:00:23.820> groove<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.240> weight<00:00:24.420> because

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
you miss groove the weight because

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.240 
you miss groove the weight because
you're<00:00:25.109> not<00:00:25.199> actually<00:00:25.380> controlling<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
you're not actually controlling the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.070 
you're not actually controlling the
weight<00:00:26.400> down<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.970> often<00:00:27.480> you'll<00:00:27.630> see<00:00:27.689> people

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
weight down and often you'll see people

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.779 
weight down and often you'll see people
try<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.289> fix<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.740> issue<00:00:28.920> by<00:00:29.220> doing<00:00:29.519> paused

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
try to fix this issue by doing paused

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.910 
try to fix this issue by doing paused
reps<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.990> will<00:00:31.140> necessarily<00:00:31.740> always

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
reps and that will necessarily always

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.069 
reps and that will necessarily always
work<00:00:32.309> because<00:00:32.940> when<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.270> are<00:00:33.420> pausing<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.960> on

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
work because when you are pausing it on

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.610 
work because when you are pausing it on
your<00:00:34.230> chest

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
your chest

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.990 
your chest
you're<00:00:34.890> still<00:00:35.160> not<00:00:35.280> ensuring<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.760> you're

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
you're still not ensuring that you're

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.580 
you're still not ensuring that you're
controlling<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.690> weight<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> way<00:00:37.260> down

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
controlling the weight on the way down

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.920 
controlling the weight on the way down
so<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> lot<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.550> times<00:00:38.790> people<00:00:39.000> will<00:00:39.390> solve<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
so a lot of times people will solve the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.510 
so a lot of times people will solve the
problem<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.290> using<00:00:40.649> momentum<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.340> get<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
problem of using momentum to get the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.310 
problem of using momentum to get the
weight<00:00:41.730> up<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.660> they<00:00:42.870> still<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.200> that

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
weight up but they still have that

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.869 
weight up but they still have that
problem<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.739> losing<00:00:43.890> tightness<00:00:44.460> bringing<00:00:44.820> it

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
problem of losing tightness bringing it

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.580 
problem of losing tightness bringing it
down<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.239> their<00:00:45.360> chest<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> solution<00:00:46.559> for

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
down to their chest so the solution for

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.500 
down to their chest so the solution for
this<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.640> actually<00:00:47.789> bring<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> bar<00:00:48.480> down

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
this is to actually bring the bar down

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.420 
this is to actually bring the bar down
one<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.079> two<00:00:49.230> inches<00:00:49.530> from<00:00:49.739> your<00:00:49.920> chest<00:00:50.250> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
one to two inches from your chest and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.490 
one to two inches from your chest and
then<00:00:50.910> pause<00:00:51.210> without<00:00:51.690> touching<00:00:51.960> your<00:00:52.199> chest

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
then pause without touching your chest

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.619 
then pause without touching your chest
and<00:00:52.680> then<00:00:53.250> power<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.760> weight<00:00:53.910> up<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.239> this

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
and then power the weight up and this

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.630 
and then power the weight up and this
will<00:00:54.809> make<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:54.989> much<00:00:55.350> harder<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.460> one

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
will make it much harder and this one

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.040 
will make it much harder and this one
sure<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.120> you're<00:00:57.239> keeping<00:00:57.449> tight<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
sure that you're keeping tight and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.720 
sure that you're keeping tight and
really<00:00:58.199> controlling<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> weight<00:00:59.160> now<00:00:59.579> when

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
really controlling the weight now when

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.369 
really controlling the weight now when
it<00:00:59.820> comes<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.149> implementing<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.870> into<00:01:01.199> your

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
it comes to implementing this into your

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.470 
it comes to implementing this into your
routine<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:02.219> could<00:01:02.399> use<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:02.879> an<00:01:03.030> accessory

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
routine you could use it as an accessory

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.109 
routine you could use it as an accessory
exercise<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.220> could<00:01:05.400> be<00:01:05.519> difficult<00:01:05.729> if

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
exercise but that could be difficult if

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.060 
exercise but that could be difficult if
your<00:01:06.270> bench<00:01:06.450> pressing<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> high<00:01:07.170> volume<00:01:07.409> so

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
your bench pressing at a high volume so

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.800 
your bench pressing at a high volume so
what<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.250> actually<00:01:08.490> suggest<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.299> giving<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.750> a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
what I actually suggest is giving it a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.810 
what I actually suggest is giving it a
separate<00:01:10.260> day<00:01:10.470> having<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.010> heavy<00:01:11.189> bench<00:01:11.549> press

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
separate day having a heavy bench press

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.850 
separate day having a heavy bench press
day<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.270> then<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.810> your<00:01:12.960> lighter<00:01:13.200> day<00:01:13.500> doing

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
day and then on your lighter day doing

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.590 
day and then on your lighter day doing
this<00:01:13.979> exercise<00:01:14.520> instead<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> bench<00:01:15.420> press

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
this exercise instead of the bench press

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.660 
this exercise instead of the bench press
as<00:01:15.930> far<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> specific<00:01:16.890> parameters<00:01:17.100> for

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
as far as the specific parameters for

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.240 
as far as the specific parameters for
this<00:01:17.850> exercise<00:01:18.360> what<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.560> six<00:01:19.860> sets<00:01:20.100> of

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
this exercise what I do is six sets of

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.340 
this exercise what I do is six sets of
four<00:01:20.520> reps<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.600> reason<00:01:21.869> why<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.020> stick

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
four reps and the reason why I stick

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.380 
four reps and the reason why I stick
with<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> lower<00:01:22.799> rep<00:01:23.100> range<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.610> because

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
with the lower rep range is because

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.570 
with the lower rep range is because
you're<00:01:24.600> already<00:01:24.810> pausing<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.830> pausing<00:01:26.460> at

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
you're already pausing and pausing at

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.890 
you're already pausing and pausing at
one<00:01:26.729> or<00:01:26.820> two<00:01:26.880> inches<00:01:27.060> off<00:01:27.299> your<00:01:27.330> chest<00:01:27.689> so
