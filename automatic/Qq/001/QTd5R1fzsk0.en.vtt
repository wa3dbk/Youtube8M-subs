they're straight and you want to put
tape<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.889> a<00:03:15.040> circular<00:03:15.459> motion<00:03:15.900> like<00:03:16.900> this<00:03:17.909> why

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
tape and a circular motion like this why

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.610 
tape and a circular motion like this why
I<00:03:18.939> mean<00:03:19.239> a<00:03:19.299> circle<00:03:19.659> no<00:03:20.139> sir<00:03:20.290> you're<00:03:20.409> mostly

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
I mean a circle no sir you're mostly

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.509 
I mean a circle no sir you're mostly
that's<00:03:20.859> kinda<00:03:21.040> nerdy<00:03:21.159> but<00:03:21.700> uh<00:03:22.889> see<00:03:23.889> make<00:03:24.370> sure

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
that's kinda nerdy but uh see make sure

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.979 
that's kinda nerdy but uh see make sure
you<00:03:24.639> get<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:24.819> straight<00:03:25.060> by<00:03:25.299> looking<00:03:25.599> down<00:03:25.780> it

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
you get it straight by looking down it

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.339 
you get it straight by looking down it
so<00:03:26.889> as<00:03:27.419> you<00:03:28.419> can<00:03:28.510> see<00:03:28.750> it's<00:03:28.959> pretty<00:03:29.169> straight

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
so as you can see it's pretty straight

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:38.699 
so as you can see it's pretty straight
fix<00:03:32.349> it<00:03:32.530> it's<00:03:33.250> pretty<00:03:33.489> straight<00:03:33.730> think<00:03:37.709> that's

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
fix it it's pretty straight think that's

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.140 
fix it it's pretty straight think that's
for<00:03:38.859> sure<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.299> then<00:03:40.299> you<00:03:40.329> want<00:03:40.599> to<00:03:41.909> tape<00:03:42.909> it

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
for sure and then you want to tape it

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.099 
for sure and then you want to tape it
till<00:03:43.510> it's<00:03:43.629> sturdy<00:03:43.989> I<00:03:45.479> tape<00:03:46.479> it<00:03:46.629> long<00:03:47.079> ways

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
till it's sturdy I tape it long ways

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:57.240 
till it's sturdy I tape it long ways
like<00:03:47.859> that<00:03:49.769> so<00:03:50.769> it's<00:03:50.919> like<00:03:51.129> even<00:03:55.919> this<00:03:56.919> shotgun

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
like that so it's like even this shotgun

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.000 
like that so it's like even this shotgun
doesn't<00:03:57.609> have<00:03:57.699> to<00:03:57.790> be<00:03:57.940> really<00:03:58.180> perfect

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
doesn't have to be really perfect

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.530 
doesn't have to be really perfect
because<00:04:00.010> it's<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.549> barrel<00:04:00.849> has<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.239> be<00:04:01.329> pretty

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
because it's the barrel has to be pretty

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.300 
because it's the barrel has to be pretty
good<00:04:01.780> look<00:04:01.989> good<00:04:02.199> but<00:04:02.650> they<00:04:02.799> are<00:04:02.919> outside

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
good look good but they are outside

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.699 
good look good but they are outside
stuff<00:04:03.549> doesn't<00:04:03.729> have<00:04:03.879> to<00:04:03.940> be<00:04:04.060> very<00:04:04.120> good<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:05.680> I

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
stuff doesn't have to be very good so I

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:14.210 
stuff doesn't have to be very good so I
think<00:04:05.949> that's<00:04:07.739> good<00:04:09.930> see<00:04:10.930> it's<00:04:11.169> like<00:04:11.400> straight

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
think that's good see it's like straight

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.969 
think that's good see it's like straight
you<00:04:15.220> can<00:04:15.370> see<00:04:16.260> now<00:04:17.260> we're<00:04:17.530> going<00:04:17.680> to<00:04:17.859> make

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
you can see now we're going to make

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.080 
you can see now we're going to make
another<00:04:18.930> two<00:04:19.930> sheets<00:04:20.260> a<00:04:20.530> two<00:04:21.159> tubes<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:21.699> we're

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
another two sheets a two tubes and we're

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.180 
another two sheets a two tubes and we're
gonna<00:04:22.180> make<00:04:22.330> them<00:04:22.419> smaller<00:04:22.810> this<00:04:23.050> time<00:04:23.110> do<00:04:24.099> it

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
gonna make them smaller this time do it

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.800 
gonna make them smaller this time do it
the<00:04:24.280> short<00:04:24.550> way<00:04:24.669> because<00:04:25.389> then<00:04:25.510> you're<00:04:25.630> gonna

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
the short way because then you're gonna

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.469 
the short way because then you're gonna
have<00:04:25.930> to<00:04:26.020> waste<00:04:26.229> paper<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:28.000> then<00:04:28.150> so<00:04:28.449> you

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
have to waste paper and then so you

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.860 
have to waste paper and then so you
wanna<00:04:28.750> make<00:04:28.810> I'm<00:04:29.020> Slon<00:04:29.409> that<00:04:30.570> it's<00:04:31.570> gonna<00:04:31.750> be

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
wanna make I'm Slon that it's gonna be

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:40.420 
wanna make I'm Slon that it's gonna be
the<00:04:31.900> bottom<00:04:33.659> so

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.310 

Xabi<00:04:41.430> pretty<00:04:41.760> good<00:04:41.940> and<00:04:42.780> make<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:42.960> little<00:04:43.140> bit

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
Xabi pretty good and make a little bit

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.730 
Xabi pretty good and make a little bit
bigger<00:04:43.850> there<00:04:44.850> you<00:04:44.940> go<00:04:45.060> sure<00:04:48.380> maybe<00:04:49.380> they

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
bigger there you go sure maybe they

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.530 
bigger there you go sure maybe they
should<00:04:49.920> be<00:04:49.950> like<00:04:50.190> bigger<00:04:50.610> enough<00:04:50.910> to<00:04:51.300> fit

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
should be like bigger enough to fit

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.770 
should be like bigger enough to fit
inside<00:04:51.810> of<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:52.190> so<00:04:55.910> by<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:56.970> way<00:04:57.090> this<00:04:57.330> will<00:04:57.600> not

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
inside of it so by the way this will not

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.590 
inside of it so by the way this will not
like<00:04:58.310> you<00:04:59.310> can<00:04:59.490> make<00:04:59.670> it<00:04:59.820> you<00:05:00.030> can<00:05:00.060> modify<00:05:00.420> it

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
like you can make it you can modify it

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.460 
like you can make it you can modify it
to<00:05:00.720> shoot<00:05:01.010> but<00:05:03.080> that's<00:05:04.080> what<00:05:04.170> I<00:05:04.230> think<00:05:04.410> I

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
to shoot but that's what I think I

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.980 
to shoot but that's what I think I
should<00:05:04.620> call<00:05:04.740> um<00:05:05.100> pate<00:05:05.340> custom<00:05:05.820> because<00:05:06.480> you

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
should call um pate custom because you

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.490 
should call um pate custom because you
can<00:05:07.140> like<00:05:08.150> probably<00:05:09.150> maybe<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:09.930> can<00:05:10.080> modify

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
can like probably maybe you can modify

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.210 
can like probably maybe you can modify
it<00:05:10.620> to<00:05:10.800> shoot<00:05:11.720> it<00:05:12.720> doesn't<00:05:12.990> just<00:05:13.650> just<00:05:14.130> a

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
it to shoot it doesn't just just a

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.930 
it to shoot it doesn't just just a
show-off<00:05:14.490> then<00:05:15.950> or<00:05:16.950> if<00:05:17.460> you<00:05:17.520> can<00:05:17.730> subscribe

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
show-off then or if you can subscribe

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
show-off then or if you can subscribe
and<00:05:18.540> make<00:05:19.290> me<00:05:19.530> and<00:05:19.890> make<00:05:20.370> I<00:05:20.670> can<00:05:21.090> make<00:05:21.630> a<00:05:21.660> bold

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
and make me and make I can make a bold

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.290 
and make me and make I can make a bold
action<00:05:22.260> rifle<00:05:22.560> that<00:05:23.520> will<00:05:23.700> actually<00:05:23.880> shoot

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
action rifle that will actually shoot

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.590 
action rifle that will actually shoot
but<00:05:25.790> how<00:05:26.790> would<00:05:26.850> you<00:05:26.940> start<00:05:27.090> making<00:05:27.330> that<00:05:27.450> one

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
but how would you start making that one

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.360 
but how would you start making that one
now<00:05:27.750> so<00:05:28.200> we'll<00:05:28.770> walk<00:05:28.890> and<00:05:29.070> rifle<00:05:29.370> stub<00:05:30.150> barrel

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
now so we'll walk and rifle stub barrel
