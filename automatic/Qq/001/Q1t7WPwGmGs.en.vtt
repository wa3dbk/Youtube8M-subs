out two months ago of that so to me I
feel<00:03:34.709> that's<00:03:34.890> way<00:03:35.130> too<00:03:35.160> new<00:03:35.550> for<00:03:35.580> me<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:36.000> start

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
feel that's way too new for me to start

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.979 
feel that's way too new for me to start
doing<00:03:36.569> a<00:03:36.690> full<00:03:37.050> 100%<00:03:37.830> playthrough<00:03:38.610> of<00:03:38.640> it<00:03:38.989> like

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
doing a full 100% playthrough of it like

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.770 
doing a full 100% playthrough of it like
I<00:03:40.110> did<00:03:40.319> this<00:03:40.470> game<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:42.209> there's<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.450> lot<00:03:42.600> more

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
I did this game and there's a lot more

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.300 
I did this game and there's a lot more
stuff<00:03:43.079> in<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.410> game<00:03:43.650> in<00:03:43.860> yadda<00:03:44.100> yadda<00:03:44.220> but

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
stuff in that game in yadda yadda but

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.100 
stuff in that game in yadda yadda but
mostly<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.430> just<00:03:47.549> think<00:03:48.000> it's<00:03:48.180> too<00:03:48.480> new<00:03:48.720> for<00:03:48.750> me

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.660 
mostly I just think it's too new for me
a<00:03:49.140> star<00:03:49.380> player<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:52.459> right<00:03:53.459> now<00:03:53.610> you
