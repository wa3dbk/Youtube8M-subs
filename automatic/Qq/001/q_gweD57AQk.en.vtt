00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.510 

hi<00:00:15.510> it's<00:00:15.840> Russ<00:00:16.139> from<00:00:16.470> CEO<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:16.920> expert<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.340> want

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
hi it's Russ from CEO and expert I want

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.130 
hi it's Russ from CEO and expert I want
to<00:00:17.580> talk<00:00:17.730> about<00:00:17.850> getting<00:00:18.270> Hardware

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
to talk about getting Hardware

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.410 
to talk about getting Hardware
integrated<00:00:19.890> into<00:00:20.190> a<00:00:20.220> session<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.820> studio<00:00:21.150> one

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
integrated into a session in studio one

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.480 
integrated into a session in studio one
if<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.840> own<00:00:22.080> hardware<00:00:22.680> at<00:00:22.770> home<00:00:23.010> or<00:00:23.279> you're

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
if you own hardware at home or you're

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.800 
if you own hardware at home or you're
running<00:00:23.610> a<00:00:23.790> big<00:00:24.029> studio<00:00:24.450> and<00:00:24.630> you've<00:00:24.720> got

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
running a big studio and you've got

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.350 
running a big studio and you've got
racks<00:00:25.110> full<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.439> gear<00:00:25.890> then<00:00:26.070> I've<00:00:26.220> never<00:00:27.150> found

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
racks full of gear then I've never found

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.480 
racks full of gear then I've never found
a<00:00:27.570> door<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.960> does<00:00:28.200> it<00:00:28.320> as<00:00:28.490> straightforward

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
a door that does it as straightforward

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.210 
a door that does it as straightforward
and<00:00:29.640> as<00:00:29.910> elegantly<00:00:30.480> as<00:00:30.779> studio<00:00:31.410> one<00:00:31.800> does<00:00:32.070> it

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
and as elegantly as studio one does it

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.310 
and as elegantly as studio one does it
and<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.610> uses<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.030> feature<00:00:33.360> called<00:00:33.600> pipeline

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
and it uses a feature called pipeline

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.280 
and it uses a feature called pipeline
and<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.100> very<00:00:35.670> nifty<00:00:36.180> way<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.840> getting

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
and that is a very nifty way of getting

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.799 
and that is a very nifty way of getting
hardware<00:00:38.160> such<00:00:38.670> as<00:00:38.699> compressors<00:00:39.510> I've<00:00:39.629> got

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
hardware such as compressors I've got

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.880 
hardware such as compressors I've got
dbx<00:00:40.199> 160<00:00:40.500> but<00:00:41.460> 1176<00:00:42.269> from<00:00:42.480> ua<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.989> all<00:00:43.680> those

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
dbx 160 but 1176 from ua and all those

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.799 
dbx 160 but 1176 from ua and all those
other<00:00:44.129> kind<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.400> things<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.150> out<00:00:45.420> of

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
other kind of things in and out of

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.560 
other kind of things in and out of
Studio<00:00:46.800> One<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.149> I'm<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.360> show<00:00:48.510> you

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
Studio One and so I'm going to show you

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.060 
Studio One and so I'm going to show you
how<00:00:48.630> to<00:00:48.690> use<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.050> when<00:00:49.170> what's<00:00:49.350> really<00:00:49.739> cool

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
how to use it when what's really cool

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.790 
how to use it when what's really cool
about<00:00:50.130> it<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.149> actually<00:00:51.270> use<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.870> like

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
about it is you can actually use it like

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.430 
about it is you can actually use it like
a<00:00:52.829> plugin<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.540> I<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:55.140> for<00:00:55.410> example

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
a plugin and so if I have for example

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.590 
a plugin and so if I have for example
got<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.860> bass<00:00:56.100> sub<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.670> bass<00:00:56.879> loop<00:00:57.390> here

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
got this bass sub this bass loop here

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.329 
got this bass sub this bass loop here
and<00:01:02.840> I<00:01:03.840> want<00:01:04.020> to<00:01:04.080> set<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:04.470> some<00:01:04.680> hardware<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.250> it

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
and I want to set up some hardware on it

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.130 
and I want to set up some hardware on it
then<00:01:05.520> it's<00:01:05.670> pretty<00:01:05.880> straightforward<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:07.080> I

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
then it's pretty straightforward all I

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.230 
then it's pretty straightforward all I
need<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.680> do<00:01:07.800> is<00:01:08.009> to<00:01:08.130> come<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.369> pipeline<00:01:09.000> and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
need to do is to come to pipeline and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.870 
need to do is to come to pipeline and
drag<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.720> here<00:01:10.340> make<00:01:11.340> sure<00:01:11.490> I'm<00:01:11.550> using<00:01:11.610> it

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
drag it in here make sure I'm using it

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.070 
drag it in here make sure I'm using it
in<00:01:11.940> mono<00:01:12.149> in<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.479> case<00:01:12.690> I'll<00:01:12.869> bring<00:01:12.990> this

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
in mono in this case I'll bring this

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.290 
in mono in this case I'll bring this
across<00:01:13.440> at<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.250> moment<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.580> says<00:01:14.700> unnamed

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
across at the moment it says unnamed

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.850 
across at the moment it says unnamed
device<00:01:15.660> and<00:01:15.960> all<00:01:16.050> I<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.289> do<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.560> create<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
device and all I have to do is create a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.850 
device and all I have to do is create a
send<00:01:17.190> I'm<00:01:18.030> using<00:01:18.299> an<00:01:18.450> Apogee<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.960> Ensemble

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
send I'm using an Apogee and Ensemble

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.460 
send I'm using an Apogee and Ensemble
thunderbolt<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.790> return<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:22.110> then<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
thunderbolt and a return and then the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.770 
thunderbolt and a return and then the
really<00:01:22.650> cool<00:01:22.920> bit<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.760> way<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.210> works<00:01:24.450> in

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
really cool bit is the way it works in

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.230 
really cool bit is the way it works in
terms<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.320> setting<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.130> up<00:01:26.280> for<00:01:26.340> things<00:01:27.119> like

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
terms of setting it up for things like

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.380 
terms of setting it up for things like
at<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.040> phase<00:01:29.040> problem<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> latency<00:01:30.360> of

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
at the phase problem with the latency of

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.990 
at the phase problem with the latency of
going<00:01:30.659> out<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.140> door<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.650> back<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.130> now

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
going out to the door and back in now

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.820 
going out to the door and back in now
the<00:01:33.090> cool<00:01:33.330> thing<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.570> that's<00:01:33.869> all<00:01:34.049> set<00:01:34.500> up<00:01:34.650> in

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
the cool thing is that's all set up in

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.560 
the cool thing is that's all set up in
here<00:01:35.159> let<00:01:35.400> me<00:01:35.430> show<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.670> how<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.909> works

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
here let me show you how that works

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.240 
here let me show you how that works
so<00:01:36.930> I'll<00:01:37.049> load<00:01:37.200> in<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.500> my<00:01:37.619> presets<00:01:38.100> for<00:01:38.159> a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
so I'll load in one of my presets for a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.929 
so I'll load in one of my presets for a
second<00:01:38.520> eyelid<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.759> my<00:01:38.820> dbx<00:01:39.180> 160<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:41.189> that's

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
second eyelid in my dbx 160 and that's

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.539 
second eyelid in my dbx 160 and that's
going<00:01:42.330> out<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.659> sub<00:01:42.930> 3<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.470> back<00:01:43.710> into<00:01:44.250> input

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
going out of sub 3 and back into input

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.359 
going out of sub 3 and back into input
13<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.150> already<00:01:45.630> set<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.130> see<00:01:47.310> in

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
13 so it's already set and if you see in

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.140 
13 so it's already set and if you see in
the<00:01:47.430> middle<00:01:47.640> here<00:01:47.759> there's<00:01:47.909> one<00:01:48.030> called

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
the middle here there's one called

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.270 
the middle here there's one called
offset<00:01:48.420> 9<00:01:48.930> samples<00:01:49.350> now<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.650> ping<00:01:49.979> this

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
offset 9 samples now if I ping this

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.140 
offset 9 samples now if I ping this
you'll<00:01:50.610> see<00:01:50.850> ascend<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:52.500> return<00:01:52.890> done<00:01:53.880> here

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
you'll see ascend and a return done here

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.300 
you'll see ascend and a return done here
the<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.320> them<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:55.799> apt<00:01:55.950> or<00:01:56.100> one<00:01:56.220> of

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
the one of them is the apt or one of

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.310 
the one of them is the apt or one of
them<00:01:56.400> is<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.909> now<00:01:57.240> when<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> start<00:01:57.869> this

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
them is the in now when I start this

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.399 
them is the in now when I start this
starts<00:01:58.710> at<00:01:58.829> zero<00:01:59.159> and<00:02:00.079> then<00:02:01.079> you'll<00:02:01.200> see

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
starts at zero and then you'll see

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.630 
starts at zero and then you'll see
there's<00:02:01.619> an<00:02:01.680> offset<00:02:02.040> there<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.430> that's

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
there's an offset there and that's

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.730 
there's an offset there and that's
telling<00:02:02.909> me<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> latency<00:02:03.600> has<00:02:03.990> been<00:02:04.259> induced

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
telling me a latency has been induced

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.469 
telling me a latency has been induced
and<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.220> I<00:02:05.250> just<00:02:05.460> need<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.670> push<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.030> up<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.270> bit

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
and so I just need to push this up a bit

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.080 
and so I just need to push this up a bit
until<00:02:07.020> those<00:02:07.549> images<00:02:09.170> get<00:02:10.170> as<00:02:10.229> close<00:02:10.590> as<00:02:11.090> they

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
until those images get as close as they

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.400 
until those images get as close as they
can<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:13.350> nine<00:02:13.799> samples<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.370> what<00:02:14.489> I<00:02:14.519> got<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.790> to

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
can so nine samples is what I got it to

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.199 
can so nine samples is what I got it to
setting<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.500> up<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.799> then<00:02:17.579> of<00:02:17.670> course<00:02:17.700> if<00:02:18.120> you

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
setting it up and then of course if you

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.620 
setting it up and then of course if you
take<00:02:18.450> turn<00:02:18.989> it<00:02:19.110> up<00:02:19.350> in<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.970> send<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.180> return

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
take turn it up in the send and return

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.890 
take turn it up in the send and return
down<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.620> is<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.890> send<00:02:23.099> out<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.370> device

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
down this is to send out to the device

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.069 
down this is to send out to the device
is<00:02:25.019> a<00:02:25.049> return<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.860> can<00:02:26.069> then<00:02:26.870> get<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:27.989> all

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
is a return you can then get it all

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.649 
is a return you can then get it all
matched<00:02:28.319> that<00:02:28.650> way<00:02:28.890> as<00:02:29.040> well<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.700> it's<00:02:30.390> very

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
matched that way as well so it's very

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.110 
matched that way as well so it's very
nifty<00:02:31.019> like<00:02:31.379> that<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:32.340> once<00:02:32.909> you've<00:02:33.090> done

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
nifty like that and once you've done

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.030 
nifty like that and once you've done
that<00:02:33.390> then<00:02:33.810> it's<00:02:34.049> very<00:02:34.230> cool<00:02:34.620> because<00:02:34.799> what

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
that then it's very cool because what

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.030 
that then it's very cool because what
you<00:02:35.159> can<00:02:35.310> do<00:02:35.519> is<00:02:35.870> if<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:37.019> just<00:02:37.200> remove<00:02:37.379> that<00:02:37.650> now

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
you can do is if I just remove that now

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.300 
you can do is if I just remove that now
from<00:02:38.400> second<00:02:38.879> I've<00:02:39.590> got<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.680> here<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.099> if<00:02:41.220> I

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
from second I've got it here so if I

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.490 
from second I've got it here so if I
only<00:02:41.370> use<00:02:41.549> a<00:02:41.579> dbx<00:02:41.970> 160<00:02:42.180> on<00:02:42.720> my<00:02:42.840> base<00:02:43.109> I<00:02:43.319> just

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
only use a dbx 160 on my base I just

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.199 
only use a dbx 160 on my base I just
literally<00:02:43.799> drag<00:02:44.129> it<00:02:44.250> across<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.819> it's<00:02:45.030> like

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
literally drag it across and it's like

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:52.640 
literally drag it across and it's like
using<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.659> plug-in<00:02:50.989> another<00:02:51.989> nice<00:02:52.170> features<00:02:52.560> if

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
using a plug-in another nice features if

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.930 
using a plug-in another nice features if
I<00:02:52.739> expend<00:02:53.129> this<00:02:53.280> app<00:02:53.459> I'm<00:02:54.209> going<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.599> mix

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
I expend this app I'm going to mix

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:04.149 
I expend this app I'm going to mix
there's<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.150> original<00:02:59.420> as<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:01.200> dbx

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.220 

of<00:03:05.159> course<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.579> can<00:03:05.700> use<00:03:05.879> in<00:03:06.030> parallel<00:03:06.480> mix<00:03:07.109> the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
of course I can use in parallel mix the

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:16.640 
of course I can use in parallel mix the
two<00:03:07.379> together<00:03:14.780> because<00:03:15.780> I've<00:03:16.079> already<00:03:16.230> set<00:03:16.620> up

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
two together because I've already set up

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.160 
two together because I've already set up
a<00:03:16.829> dbx<00:03:17.189> 1/16<00:03:17.760> also<00:03:18.060> set<00:03:18.239> up<00:03:18.269> in<00:03:18.420> 1170<00:03:18.959> now

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
a dbx 1/16 also set up in 1170 now

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.140 
a dbx 1/16 also set up in 1170 now
control<00:03:19.470> 1176<00:03:20.250> on<00:03:20.370> instead<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:20.849> I've<00:03:20.939> got<00:03:21.060> my

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
control 1176 on instead so I've got my

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:33.670 
control 1176 on instead so I've got my
11:36<00:03:21.750> hardware

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.960 

you<00:03:34.680> can<00:03:34.770> also<00:03:34.890> name<00:03:35.130> that<00:03:35.340> device<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:35.820> can

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
you can also name that device so I can

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.510 
you can also name that device so I can
go<00:03:36.120> dbx<00:03:36.510> 160<00:03:36.750> in<00:03:37.560> there<00:03:39.230> up<00:03:40.370> replace<00:03:41.370> the

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
go dbx 160 in there up replace the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.910 
go dbx 160 in there up replace the
preset<00:03:41.910> so<00:03:42.090> now<00:03:42.330> I<00:03:42.390> can<00:03:43.020> see<00:03:43.230> every<00:03:43.410> time<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.590> use

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
preset so now I can see every time I use

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.460 
preset so now I can see every time I use
it<00:03:43.950> there's<00:03:44.850> an<00:03:44.940> eleven<00:03:45.180> seven<00:03:45.360> six<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:47.210> again

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.780 

parallel<00:03:52.470> compression<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:55.260> no<00:03:56.250> chorusing

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
parallel compression and no chorusing

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.060 
parallel compression and no chorusing
which<00:03:57.270> would<00:03:57.450> be<00:03:57.630> there<00:03:58.110> if<00:03:58.230> you<00:03:58.350> have<00:03:58.770> phase

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
which would be there if you have phase

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.720 
which would be there if you have phase
issues<00:04:00.260> it's<00:04:01.260> as<00:04:01.620> simple<00:04:01.890> as<00:04:02.130> that<00:04:02.190> but<00:04:02.610> as<00:04:02.700> I

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
issues it's as simple as that but as I

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.370 
issues it's as simple as that but as I
say<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.120> great<00:04:03.300> thing<00:04:03.510> is<00:04:03.540> just<00:04:04.110> being<00:04:04.290> able

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
say the great thing is just being able

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.870 
say the great thing is just being able
to<00:04:04.470> drag<00:04:04.770> that<00:04:04.920> on<00:04:05.070> there<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.520> use<00:04:05.610> it<00:04:05.640> like<00:04:05.820> a

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
to drag that on there and use it like a

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.880 
to drag that on there and use it like a
pre<00:04:06.180> at<00:04:06.360> like<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.570> plugin<00:04:06.930> is<00:04:07.200> brilliant<00:04:07.680> it's

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
pre at like a plugin is brilliant it's

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.770 
pre at like a plugin is brilliant it's
kind<00:04:08.100> of<00:04:08.130> like<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.940> benefit<00:04:09.360> of<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.510> plug-in

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
kind of like the benefit of a plug-in

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.430 
kind of like the benefit of a plug-in
but<00:04:10.050> the<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.550> joy<00:04:11.820> of<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.210> analog<00:04:12.780> hardware

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
but the the joy of the analog hardware

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.310 
but the the joy of the analog hardware
so<00:04:14.010> there<00:04:14.190> we<00:04:14.280> go<00:04:14.310> that's<00:04:14.760> how<00:04:15.230> to<00:04:16.230> use

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
so there we go that's how to use

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.920 
so there we go that's how to use
hardware<00:04:16.650> like<00:04:17.160> plugins<00:04:17.610> in<00:04:17.790> Studio<00:04:18.510> One

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
hardware like plugins in Studio One

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.060 
hardware like plugins in Studio One
thanks<00:04:19.200> for<00:04:19.320> watching<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.770> I'll<00:04:19.860> see<00:04:19.890> you
