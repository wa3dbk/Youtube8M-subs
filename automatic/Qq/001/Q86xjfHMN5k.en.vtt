going to be able to do it to be honest
not<00:03:20.730> enough<00:03:21.030> time<00:03:21.270> if<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:21.630> had<00:03:21.810> some<00:03:22.050> more

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
not enough time if I had some more

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.110 
not enough time if I had some more
wizards<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.830> think<00:03:23.400> we<00:03:23.520> would<00:03:23.640> have<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.970> and

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
wizards I think we would have that and

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.770 
wizards I think we would have that and
if<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.330> golden<00:03:24.600> kicked<00:03:24.780> through<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.020> wall

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
if that golden kicked through the wall

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.700 
if that golden kicked through the wall
yeah<00:03:27.780> they're<00:03:28.020> just<00:03:28.110> not<00:03:28.290> going<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.470> be<00:03:28.530> it

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
yeah they're just not going to be it

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.170 
yeah they're just not going to be it
they're<00:03:29.070> not<00:03:29.190> gonna<00:03:29.310> have<00:03:29.460> enough<00:03:29.490> power<00:03:29.790> we

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
they're not gonna have enough power we

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.550 
they're not gonna have enough power we
would<00:03:30.390> do<00:03:30.540> this<00:03:30.720> if<00:03:30.900> they<00:03:31.080> had<00:03:31.230> more<00:03:31.410> power

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
would do this if they had more power

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.400 
would do this if they had more power
we'll<00:03:32.490> see<00:03:32.700> though<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.990> don't<00:03:34.170> have<00:03:34.260> any
