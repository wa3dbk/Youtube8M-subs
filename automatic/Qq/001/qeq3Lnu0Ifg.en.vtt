water and that the motors and everything
and<00:02:30.160> pumps<00:02:30.700> in<00:02:30.790> my<00:02:30.910> pool<00:02:31.180> or<00:02:31.599> tuxie<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.230> be

and pumps in my pool or tuxie to be
running<00:02:32.650> much<00:02:32.830> smoother<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.459> quieter<00:02:33.640> and

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
running much smoother and quieter and

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.910 
running much smoother and quieter and
will<00:02:34.239> run<00:02:34.420> near<00:02:34.660> as<00:02:34.750> long<00:02:34.989> and<00:02:35.349> seem<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.800> be

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
will run near as long and seem to be

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.330 
will run near as long and seem to be
more<00:02:36.840> efficient

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
more efficient

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.290 
more efficient
that's<00:02:39.700> one<00:02:40.000> big<00:02:40.450> thing<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.840> found<00:02:41.050> is<00:02:41.349> that

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
that's one big thing I found is that

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.960 
that's one big thing I found is that
that<00:02:43.450> left<00:02:43.720> water<00:02:43.930> clear<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:45.730> seemed

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
that left water clear and it seemed

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.060 
that left water clear and it seemed
easier<00:02:46.420> on<00:02:46.600> my<00:02:46.720> Jets<00:02:49.500> doesn't<00:02:50.500> have<00:02:50.620> any<00:02:50.800> odor

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
easier on my Jets doesn't have any odor

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.370 
easier on my Jets doesn't have any odor
and<00:02:51.790> it's<00:02:52.600> a<00:02:52.750> very<00:02:52.780> sporadic<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.800> use<00:02:54.840> my<00:02:55.840> first

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
and it's a very sporadic to use my first

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.500 
and it's a very sporadic to use my first
experience<00:02:56.980> with<00:02:57.160> it<00:02:57.370> i<00:02:57.520> took<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.060> chemical

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
experience with it i took the chemical

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.710 
experience with it i took the chemical
and<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:58.870> left<00:02:59.020> for<00:02:59.320> seven<00:02:59.680> months<00:02:59.800> and<00:03:00.720> before

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
and and left for seven months and before

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.220 
and and left for seven months and before
needing<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:03.010> add<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.580> again<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:03.910> just<00:03:04.330> chopped

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
needing to add it again I just chopped

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.380 
needing to add it again I just chopped
my<00:03:05.440> hot<00:03:05.650> tub<00:03:05.890> with<00:03:05.950> water<00:03:06.190> as<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:06.880> needed<00:03:07.120> it

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
my hot tub with water as it needed it

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.080 
my hot tub with water as it needed it
and<00:03:07.690> then<00:03:08.020> added<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.560> new<00:03:08.680> ball<00:03:08.920> was<00:03:09.130> great

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
and then added a new ball was great

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.820 
and then added a new ball was great
because<00:03:10.270> you<00:03:10.450> don't<00:03:10.750> have<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.080> keep<00:03:11.410> using

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
because you don't have to keep using

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.520 
because you don't have to keep using
test<00:03:12.100> scripts<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:12.670> you've<00:03:12.790> seen<00:03:13.030> if<00:03:13.270> your

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
test scripts and you've seen if your

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.940 
test scripts and you've seen if your
horine<00:03:14.530> levels<00:03:14.980> are<00:03:15.160> ok<00:03:15.490> kids<00:03:15.880> water<00:03:16.180> clear

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
horine levels are ok kids water clear

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.380 
horine levels are ok kids water clear
you<00:03:17.950> haven't<00:03:18.160> had<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.400> cover<00:03:18.700> off<00:03:18.910> in<00:03:19.090> over<00:03:19.360> a

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
you haven't had a cover off in over a

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.270 
you haven't had a cover off in over a
week<00:03:19.570> open<00:03:20.020> it<00:03:20.140> up<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.440> it's<00:03:20.650> it's<00:03:20.980> spotless

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
week open it up and it's it's spotless

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.660 
week open it up and it's it's spotless
it's<00:03:21.760> crystal<00:03:22.630> so<00:03:22.930> this<00:03:23.200> one<00:03:23.440> it's<00:03:24.040> much

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
it's crystal so this one it's much

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.850 
it's crystal so this one it's much
easier<00:03:24.700> than<00:03:25.120> that

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
easier than that

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.370 
easier than that
I<00:03:26.490> like<00:03:26.850> that<00:03:27.030> we<00:03:27.150> don't<00:03:27.330> get<00:03:27.510> all<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.870> foaming

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
I like that we don't get all the foaming

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.230 
I like that we don't get all the foaming
and<00:03:28.560> bubbles<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:29.250> like<00:03:29.490> that<00:03:29.640> we<00:03:29.760> don't<00:03:29.880> get<00:03:30.090> the

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
and bubbles I like that we don't get the

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.370 
and bubbles I like that we don't get the
