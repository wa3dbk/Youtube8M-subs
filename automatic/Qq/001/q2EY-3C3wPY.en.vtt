00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.189
 This is hardcore long beer 901b 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.579
 marat 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:22.880
 Called long 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.269
 Mino 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.109
 Death of the so-called long tail Mino 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.109
 Well, something is amazing in the early spring 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.420
 Active 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.710
 10mm body on the Fernandez deck 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.520
 Naturally Big Lake 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.550
 Strong appeal in 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.430
 but 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.430
 What is it personally 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.450
 Also the size of the data 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.390
 At the time of growing up 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.390
 If you put in place of crank meter 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.320
 Can fish well 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.970
 There was time 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.210
 From that time only so-called long building unpaid trees in early spring 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.720
 Not 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.400
 Autumn match 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.440
 Banshu over 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.780
 Just rotate the franks 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.730
 It's just after throwing and winding 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.980
 Using Keiko 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.060
 An example of a beginner who can catch fish is a long tail Japanese 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.610
 I do not understand fishing well 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.360
 I think many people think 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.590
 It's autumn, if the size of data editing is getting bigger 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.380
 Instead of trunc β 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.160
 For example, if it is a 消 block 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.520
 Just put the seeds in the place recommended to Murota 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.360
 is 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.540
 By itself 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.790
 Can fish well 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.990
 long 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.230
 It looks like a long and thin skin 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.570
 Intentional usage in crank 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.570
 I highly recommend it 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.120
 Anyway 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.120
 Very well in a large area for the time being 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.370
 I want to explore a wide range 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.980
 2 being very effective and avoiding obstacles after 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.179
 Because the ability is very high 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:12.699
 inside 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.349
 Like Oi relaxation 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.699
 Block area 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:19.909
 Knit cap 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.649
 It is so in the same area later 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:24.289
 Such a place 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:25.879
 It is hard to take 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.949
 So I am quite bullish 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:29.299
 I can understand 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.109
 It is a lure
