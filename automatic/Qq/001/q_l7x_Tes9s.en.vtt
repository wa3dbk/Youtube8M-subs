 Has observed a magnitude 5 in Ibaraki Prefecture, northern magnitude 5 Ibaraki Prefecture, northern seismic intensity of 5 lower and southern Ibaraki Prefecture 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.150
 is 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:42.100
 We are investigating about the epicenter now by the Japan Meteorological Agency, but there is a risk of tsunami if the epicenter is revised 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:42.100
 Be wary of tsunamis near the coast or river mouth that was strong 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:55.500

 It has been observed in the danger southern tied the seismic intensity of 5 lower 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:30.120
 Currently, the Japan Meteorological Agency is examining the New Year, but there is a risk of tsunami if the epicenter is revised. 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.120
 Watch out for tsunamis near coasts and river mouths where the tremors are strong 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:45.930
 There was a strong earthquake in the previous 6 pm 56 minutes around the Kanto region so that you have to tell 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:49.079
 I felt the sideways swing even in this Tokyo Shibuya nhk studio 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:54.120
 We are observing a seismic intensity of 5 or more in northern Ibaraki Prefecture 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:58.980
 Currently, the Japan Meteorological Agency is examining the epicenter, but there is a risk of tsunami if the epicenter is revised. 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.310
 Please be cautious of tsunamis near the coast or river mouth area where it was easy to put in 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.310
 Aren't 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:17.050

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:09.010
 You can see how the camera placed at a high place shakes widely 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:14.300
 In the northern part of Ibaraki prefecture, the seismic intensity is 5 high and 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.980

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.530
 Miyagi Prefecture 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:27.610
 The earthquake about 6516 minutes with new information now
