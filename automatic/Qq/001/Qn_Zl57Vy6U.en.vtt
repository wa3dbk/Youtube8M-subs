00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.449 
way yeah very much so it's about giving
them<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.230> focus<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.890> something<00:03:17.190> they<00:03:17.310> can

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
them a focus and something they can

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.880 
them a focus and something they can
achieve<00:03:17.549> so<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.870> aim<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.230> program<00:03:19.410> is<00:03:19.799> to

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
achieve so the aim of the program is to

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.020 
achieve so the aim of the program is to
take<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.190> mass<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.549> environment<00:03:20.970> that

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
take the mass of the environment that

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.490 
take the mass of the environment that
they<00:03:21.120> used<00:03:21.330> to<00:03:21.450> being<00:03:21.660> in<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.080> put<00:03:22.200> them<00:03:22.320> in<00:03:22.410> an

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
they used to being in and put them in an

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.259 
they used to being in and put them in an
environment<00:03:23.040> where<00:03:23.160> every<00:03:23.730> single<00:03:24.090> one<00:03:24.239> of

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
environment where every single one of

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.180 
environment where every single one of
them<00:03:24.570> can<00:03:25.080> feel<00:03:25.380> they've<00:03:25.620> achieved<00:03:25.739> something

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
them can feel they've achieved something

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.310 
them can feel they've achieved something
at<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.340> end<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.640> day<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:27.140> regardless<00:03:28.140> of

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
at the end of the day so regardless of

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.720 
at the end of the day so regardless of
their<00:03:28.440> physical<00:03:28.860> stature<00:03:29.070> whether<00:03:29.519> the

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
scenes and that's our aim and I think

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.550 
scenes and that's our aim and I think
you<00:05:37.300> know<00:05:37.330> we've<00:05:37.539> got<00:05:37.659> some<00:05:37.870> incredible

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
you know we've got some incredible

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.409 
you know we've got some incredible
natural<00:05:39.130> athletes<00:05:39.699> and<00:05:39.849> amongst<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.240> group

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
natural athletes and amongst the group

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.570 
natural athletes and amongst the group
and<00:05:40.720> despite<00:05:41.409> the<00:05:41.440> fact<00:05:41.710> the<00:05:41.830> majority<00:05:42.159> the

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
and despite the fact the majority the

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.830 
and despite the fact the majority the
boys<00:05:42.699> have<00:05:42.880> never<00:05:43.030> played<00:05:43.180> before<00:05:43.389> I<00:05:43.599> think

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
boys have never played before I think

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
boys have never played before I think
we'll<00:05:43.930> have<00:05:43.990> a<00:05:44.050> good<00:05:44.260> side<00:05:44.500> and<00:05:44.710> it'll

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630

for<00:06:23.259> me<00:06:23.409> like<00:06:23.680> some<00:06:24.280> of<00:06:24.340> the<00:06:24.400> guys<00:06:24.610> I<00:06:24.789> was

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:24.849 
for me like some of the guys I was

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:25.950 
for me like some of the guys I was
working<00:06:25.150> with<00:06:25.210> some<00:06:25.389> of<00:06:25.419> the<00:06:25.539> guys<00:06:25.659> you<00:06:25.720> could

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
working with some of the guys you could

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.740 
working with some of the guys you could
just<00:06:26.110> see<00:06:26.349> where<00:06:26.979> they're<00:06:27.310> the

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
just see where they're the

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
just see where they're the
differentiated<00:06:28.750> learning<00:06:28.779> some<00:06:29.529> guys<00:06:29.740> just

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
differentiated learning some guys just

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.260 
differentiated learning some guys just
don't<00:06:30.010> know<00:06:30.250> how<00:06:30.310> to<00:06:30.340> channel<00:06:30.729> their<00:06:31.000> selves

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
don't know how to channel their selves

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.250 
don't know how to channel their selves
so<00:06:31.300> they<00:06:31.450> become<00:06:31.599> bored

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.260 
so they become bored

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.870 
so they become bored
therefore<00:06:32.890> their<00:06:33.040> behavior<00:06:33.400> becomes<00:06:33.700> the

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
therefore their behavior becomes the

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.940 
therefore their behavior becomes the
seam<00:06:34.090> disruptive<00:06:34.810> but<00:06:35.260> it's<00:06:35.440> not<00:06:35.590> address

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:35.950 
seam disruptive but it's not address

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.410 
seam disruptive but it's not address
they<00:06:36.130> just<00:06:36.340> need<00:06:36.520> their<00:06:36.700> boundaries<00:06:37.090> pushed

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:37.420 
they just need their boundaries pushed

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.990 
they just need their boundaries pushed
