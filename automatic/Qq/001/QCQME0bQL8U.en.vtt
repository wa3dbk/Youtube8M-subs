to record it on servers like on oops
there's<00:00:31.120> lava<00:00:31.390> right<00:00:31.600> there<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:33.360> lbsg<00:00:34.360> and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
there's lava right there on lbsg and

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.579 
there's lava right there on lbsg and
spleef<00:00:36.730> and<00:00:37.089> all<00:00:37.239> that<00:00:37.510> but<00:00:37.839> it<00:00:38.019> was<00:00:38.140> so<00:00:38.379> like

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.589 
spleef and all that but it was so like

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:44.160 
spleef and all that but it was so like
not<00:00:38.800> that<00:00:38.949> lbsg<00:00:39.550> was<00:00:39.789> good<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.969> spleef<00:00:43.170> it

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
not that lbsg was good but the spleef it

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.229 
not that lbsg was good but the spleef it
was<00:00:44.589> it<00:00:44.890> was<00:00:45.010> crazy<00:00:45.159> I<00:00:45.399> don't<00:00:45.760> even<00:00:45.850> know<00:00:46.059> it's

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
was it was crazy I don't even know it's

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.689 
was it was crazy I don't even know it's
lagging<00:00:46.449> everywhere<00:00:47.079> so<00:00:47.739> hopefully<00:00:47.949> the<00:00:48.399> lag

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
lagging everywhere so hopefully the lag

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.529 
lagging everywhere so hopefully the lag

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
but really I just can't wait for it it's

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.810 
but really I just can't wait for it it's
gonna<00:01:45.940> be<00:01:46.120> awesome<00:01:46.300> but<00:01:46.930> um<00:01:47.230> the<00:01:48.220> wither<00:01:48.460> is

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
gonna be awesome but um the wither is

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.150 
gonna be awesome but um the wither is
not<00:01:49.000> in<00:01:49.210> it<00:01:49.390> and<00:01:49.600> like<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.380> boss<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:50.950> that's

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
not in it and like the boss and that's

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.340 
not in it and like the boss and that's
just<00:01:51.370> something<00:01:51.550> that<00:01:52.080> was<00:01:53.080> kind<00:01:53.290> of

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
just something that was kind of

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.780 
just something that was kind of
disappointing<00:01:53.920> but<00:01:53.950> I<00:01:54.340> mean<00:01:54.460> they're<00:01:54.580> trying

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
disappointing but I mean they're trying

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.220 
disappointing but I mean they're trying
their<00:01:54.910> hardest<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.300> put<00:01:55.420> mobs<00:01:55.720> in<00:01:55.990> but

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
their hardest to put mobs in but

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.460 
their hardest to put mobs in but
hopefully<00:01:56.410> we<00:01:56.950> get<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.280> wither<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.780> that<00:01:59.230> um

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
hopefully we get the wither that that um

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.120 
hopefully we get the wither that that um
is<00:01:59.980> what<00:02:00.190> excites<00:02:00.550> me<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.730> most<00:02:00.820> about<00:02:02.130> well

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
is what excites me the most about well

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.950 
is what excites me the most about well
it's<00:02:03.280> not<00:02:03.400> even<00:02:03.520> an<00:02:03.700> update<00:02:04.060> but<00:02:04.240> if<00:02:04.360> it<00:02:04.510> was<00:02:04.720> it

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
it's not even an update but if it was it

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.690 
it's not even an update but if it was it
would<00:02:05.050> be<00:02:05.080> snow<00:02:05.620> don't<00:02:06.010> make<00:02:06.190> it<00:02:06.370> that<00:02:06.670> much

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
would be snow don't make it that much

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.869 
would be snow don't make it that much
better<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.420> um<00:02:07.840> I<00:02:08.140> can't<00:02:08.920> get<00:02:09.069> this<00:02:09.250> iron<00:02:09.519> or

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
bunch of armor it's really hard to fight

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.619 
bunch of armor it's really hard to fight
it<00:02:43.439> but<00:02:44.439> when<00:02:44.920> we<00:02:45.189> do<00:02:45.430> see<00:02:45.609> that<00:02:45.640> an<00:02:45.909> MCP<00:02:46.269> will

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629

pretty much everyone I mean I know I'm
excited<00:02:54.340> about<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:54.909> like<00:02:55.260> 0.13<00:02:56.260> or<00:02:56.709> something

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
excited about it like 0.13 or something

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.960 
excited about it like 0.13 or something
like<00:02:57.310> that<00:02:57.370> after<00:02:58.030> 0.12<00:02:59.310> will<00:03:00.310> have<00:03:00.549> it<00:03:00.819> as

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
with the end we'll probably see that in

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.220 
with the end we'll probably see that in
like<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.170> update<00:03:08.849> 0.13<00:03:09.849> or<00:03:09.970> 0.14<00:03:10.750> if<00:03:10.870> they<00:03:11.019> go

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
like a update 0.13 or 0.14 if they go

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.179 
like a update 0.13 or 0.14 if they go
that<00:03:11.470> far<00:03:11.769> into<00:03:13.290> making<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:14.620> I<00:03:14.650> know<00:03:14.829> a<00:03:14.920> lot<00:03:15.099> of

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189 
that far into making it I know a lot of

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.819 
that far into making it I know a lot of
people<00:03:15.400> are<00:03:15.489> talking<00:03:15.790> about<00:03:15.909> like<00:03:16.269> a<00:03:16.560> 1.0<00:03:17.560> and

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
with 0.13 or 1.0 but we'll see we'll see
