00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
 hello to all here we are so with the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.080
 number 67 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:13.139
 a number that will offer us the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:18.470
 fitting the inner cheeks back so 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:23.720
 a montage which must not present any 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.699
 worries and it feels good after 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.029
 some numbers still enough 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.250
 complicated always has with respect to 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.800
 the alignment of the doors when I see this 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.670
 image type I still have a small 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.720
 little fear for the future 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.089
 finally we will see well say so badly 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.400
 deliverables so it's both cheeks 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:46.239
 of her with grooves the con we 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.909
 see a lack of painting here 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.369
 painting that I do not like compared to 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:54.290
 may compared to my satin black hand 

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:56.900
 so I'm not going to panic that and 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.189
 burrs and because again to 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.619
 some liberal places governed 

00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:02.360
 especially needed on this piece there 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:03.189
 which is the feed chute 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.650
 gasoline 

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:10.220
 she is plastic this one is 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.930
 there is still a need to review a 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.000
 little bit of all because at the level 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.630
 rural urban it's really very very 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.320
 very limits 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.250
 and then I will take back 100 black pro 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.820
 satin black is added the necklaces 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:31.750
 and then a book aja deliverables of flanges 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:36.010
 and then big bets and fm sm 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.380
 so at the level of editing 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.160
 the chute good I repainted in black 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:46.510
 Satin the ds19 and I added bar 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:49.570
 metal to simulate the two packages and I 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.650
 will not go further because it is 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:57.280
 really look on 71 cars 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:02.950
 72 at the color level so there I managed 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:06.670
 by the inside of her cheek in 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.490
 satin is consistent with my color of 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.490
 chassis and I find that the finish and 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.870
 the best so our plans but on 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.220
 the right cheek a sending of one sees the r 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.100
 so there these famous reduce the cover 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.720
 selling well for it can be used 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.970
 so I had old it's finally 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.520
 simili I bought for the ds 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.510
 their manufacture 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.750
 so I had seen it I had in 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.480
 stock and if I did not use on the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.510
 true goddess I will use it on these 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.480
 laws an eighth to simulate the 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:45.130
 trunk upholstery since miley did 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:48.459
 not represented by parenthesis so 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.010
 a fairly simple operation I stuck to 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.120
 the liquid glue simply or at 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.550
 level of the cuts they would make a 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.370
 little attention but it's done well 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.650
 the only problem is 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.069
 that actually to hide his 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.560
 famous grooves so to see 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:10.269
 so that's what that's what we have 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.700
 pondu altaÃ¯ about it but the rendering 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.829
 is really interesting once a 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.650
 not fair since the imitation was of 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:21.670
 light color then it was 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.310
 simply from montella the chute I 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.510
 believe it was vice fm this time 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.480
 so 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:35.630
 there no no worries it is done without 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:39.050
 no problem and we render it is is 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.610
 rather interesting even though he still has some 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.510
 job 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.310
 gasoline does not arrive yet tank 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.410
 it's a pity these big screws there that he 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.290
 y at each bridge then you have to 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.100
 put it all on the chassis and there I 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.530
 a little fright because 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.350
 indeed asking the right cheek 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.760
 when we were we were a little bit far 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.830
 of the structure so I'm riding them 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.900
 like that I have upside down I found that 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:11.560
 it was easier to face any 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:15.850
 it's big screw sm so here too 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:19.430
 tapping that as usual preventative 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.040
 prior to the final face 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:26.450
 and finally when we slip 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.930
 this jodel the structure on the water in 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.180
 place but that's what it gives 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.700
 once mounted for the right cheek 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.940
 so I'm happy with them I'm 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:41.390
 pleased with the aspect with always this 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.190
 famous dumpling still lacks 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.640
 elements then for kisses and the 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.400
 dozen 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.530
 it is better to remove this 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.510
 reinforcement bar that I put all of 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.730
 suite right after and for the 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:57.650
 face is still significantly more 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:05:00.530
 simple so here we are on the left cheek 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.639
 and no more problem on that side 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.469
 than 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:07.669
 that on the right side except that maybe there 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:11.810
 at the level of the structure I had no 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:13.669
 shift is still problems 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.669
 adjustment was immediately all of 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:23.710
 good continuation then to these four screws with ceret 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:25.759
 and then I row and reinforce 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.520
 good I do not know if it's still a lot 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:29.719
 of utility but I prefer to leave them 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.870
 any case for now the pieces are 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:34.789
 stored a little bit haphazardly 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.099
 So luck so I'm sure it 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:40.380
 it does not move and the final result my faith I 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:44.160
 am I am quite happy 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.970
 to follow so for mounting this 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.120
 structure 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.710
 and then he will stay as usual with 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.430
 altedia there are always small and 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.770
 So little things most passers 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.360
 easy assembly months but what's the point 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.290
 these grooves one wonders well 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.120
 after each one is free to leave him the 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.650
 pieces as they are but I 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.670
 wanted to put this small age capital 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.670
 see you soon
