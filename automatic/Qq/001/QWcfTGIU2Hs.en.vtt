I was working in the laboratory and one

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.830 
I was working in the laboratory and one
of<00:02:49.780> my<00:02:50.019> young<00:02:50.640> students<00:02:51.640> came<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.269> see<00:02:52.450> me<00:02:52.569> and

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
of my young students came to see me and

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.099 
of my young students came to see me and
then<00:02:53.079> he<00:02:53.260> asked<00:02:53.650> me<00:02:53.769> now<00:02:54.700> why<00:02:55.269> do<00:02:55.329> you<00:02:55.510> do<00:02:55.810> that

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
then he asked me now why do you do that

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.710 
then he asked me now why do you do that
i<00:02:57.000> interested<00:02:58.000> in<00:02:58.060> morphing<00:02:58.629> and<00:02:58.930> things<00:02:59.739> why

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
i interested in morphing and things why

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.509 
i interested in morphing and things why
obviously<00:03:01.720> we<00:03:02.170> all<00:03:02.290> know<00:03:02.530> something<00:03:02.890> about<00:03:03.129> it

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
obviously we all know something about it

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.990 
obviously we all know something about it
I<00:03:04.440> hesitated<00:03:05.440> I<00:03:05.709> didn't<00:03:06.159> want<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.549> say<00:03:06.760> what<00:03:06.970> I

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
I hesitated I didn't want to say what I

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.390 
I hesitated I didn't want to say what I
really<00:03:07.420> thought<00:03:07.659> but<00:03:07.900> this<00:03:08.379> young<00:03:08.650> man<00:03:08.890> forced

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
really thought but this young man forced

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.699 
really thought but this young man forced
me<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:09.879> I<00:03:10.000> said<00:03:10.239> well<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.599> know<00:03:10.720> if<00:03:11.319> you<00:03:11.470> keep

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
me and I said well you know if you keep

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.490 
me and I said well you know if you keep
it<00:03:11.829> to<00:03:11.920> yourself<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.640> don't<00:03:12.879> tell<00:03:13.090> anybody

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
it to yourself and don't tell anybody

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.860 
it to yourself and don't tell anybody
then<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:14.950> have<00:03:15.670> a<00:03:15.819> suspicion<00:03:16.450> there<00:03:16.690> may<00:03:16.840> be

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
then I have a suspicion there may be

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.220 
then I have a suspicion there may be

more feellike substance in environment

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.920 
more feellike substance in environment
now<00:03:21.099> that<00:03:21.340> was<00:03:21.639> in<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.450> early<00:03:22.599> sixties<00:03:23.109> and<00:03:23.730> in

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
now that was in the early sixties and in

1972 Hans coaster let's found his
natural<00:03:29.019> morphine<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:30.280> was<00:03:30.430> an<00:03:30.519> incredibly

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
natural morphine it was an incredibly

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.599 
natural morphine it was an incredibly
simple<00:03:31.480> experiment<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.470> simply<00:03:32.919> involved<00:03:33.489> a

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
simple experiment it simply involved a

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.240 
simple experiment it simply involved a
strip<00:03:34.120> of<00:03:34.239> muscle<00:03:34.660> The<00:03:35.109> effect<00:03:35.200> of<00:03:35.620> an<00:03:35.739> extract

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
strip of muscle The effect of an extract

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.580 
strip of muscle The effect of an extract
of<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.609> brain<00:03:36.930> changing<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.230> way<00:03:38.410> that

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
of the brain changing the way that

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.069 
of the brain changing the way that
muscle<00:03:39.040> contracted<00:03:39.730> but<00:03:40.299> it<00:03:40.419> really<00:03:40.629> wasn't

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
muscle contracted but it really wasn't

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.960 
muscle contracted but it really wasn't
so<00:03:41.379> simple<00:03:41.620> because<00:03:42.069> it<00:03:42.310> was<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.459> totally

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
so simple because it was a totally

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.330 
so simple because it was a totally
prepared<00:03:43.419> mind<00:03:43.840> it<00:03:44.290> was<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.500> lifetime<00:03:44.949> of

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
prepared mind it was a lifetime of

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.050 
prepared mind it was a lifetime of
effort<00:03:46.349> the<00:03:47.349> substance<00:03:47.919> produced<00:03:48.370> naturally

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
effort the substance produced naturally

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.300 
effort the substance produced naturally
in<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.359> brain<00:03:49.709> affected<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.859> strips<00:03:51.160> of

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
in the brain affected the strips of

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.809 
in the brain affected the strips of
muscle<00:03:51.819> just<00:03:52.449> as<00:03:52.569> heroin<00:03:53.079> had

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:08.490 

the<00:03:59.689> brains<00:03:59.989> on<00:04:00.290> morphine

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.500 

heroin<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:10.220> molecules<00:04:10.760> had<00:04:11.060> identical

heroin the molecules had identical
recognition<00:04:12.440> sites<00:04:15.519> so<00:04:16.519> that's<00:04:16.760> why<00:04:16.970> it

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
recognition sites so that's why it

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.689 
recognition sites so that's why it
