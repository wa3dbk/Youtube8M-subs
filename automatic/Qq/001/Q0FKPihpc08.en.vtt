00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.710
 logo of 5 and here is an owl 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.310
 designed already cooked with the filling 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.460
 inside the machine with a betis that 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:40.090
 it is allowed to use this machine only 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.600
 for girls 6 years old and older and I see myself 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.630
 you can use it and here we can see that 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.449
 There is the complete picture of our 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.030
 circle here in this corner in this 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.370
 part of here we can see that there is a 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.550
 cupcake made with machinery too 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.949
 stuffed and there is a bag that can be 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.159

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.040
 small steam and is very small is a 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.650
 through the new type of fives we can 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.570
 see the steps that you can have 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.210
 what to do to 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.220
 Well, to start designing in our 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.680
 things here we can see that there is the 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.520
 image of a girl with pretty eyes on 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.330
