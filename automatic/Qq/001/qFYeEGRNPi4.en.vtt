lucid<00:02:57.489> so<00:02:58.450> he<00:02:59.020> imagined<00:02:59.590> himself<00:02:59.739> flying<00:03:00.459> and

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
lucid so he imagined himself flying and

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.150 
lucid so he imagined himself flying and
began<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.510> gently<00:03:01.840> float<00:03:02.230> above<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.590> ground

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
began to gently float above the ground

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.540 
began to gently float above the ground
okay<00:03:03.540> then<00:03:04.540> he<00:03:04.959> imagined<00:03:05.530> himself<00:03:05.680> soaring

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
okay then he imagined himself soaring

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.910 
okay then he imagined himself soaring
through<00:03:06.760> space<00:03:07.209> on<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.540> magical<00:03:08.230> star<00:03:08.560> field

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
through space on a magical star field

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.570 
through space on a magical star field
and<00:03:09.340> it<00:03:09.610> too<00:03:09.910> appeared<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:10.660> was<00:03:11.050> so<00:03:11.410> much<00:03:11.770> fun

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
and it too appeared it was so much fun

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.850 
and it too appeared it was so much fun
and<00:03:12.670> Stan<00:03:13.270> marveled<00:03:13.989> that<00:03:14.200> he<00:03:14.440> had<00:03:14.530> still<00:03:14.830> not

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
and Stan marveled that he had still not

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
and Stan marveled that he had still not
woken<00:03:15.250> up

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
woken up

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.170 
woken up
how<00:03:16.420> was<00:03:16.690> he<00:03:16.840> remaining<00:03:17.410> so<00:03:17.650> lucid<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:18.910> then

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
how was he remaining so lucid and then

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.240 
how was he remaining so lucid and then
perhaps<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.870> strangest<00:03:20.200> question<00:03:20.980> of<00:03:21.100> them

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
perhaps the strangest question of them

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.970 
perhaps the strangest question of them
all<00:03:21.400> entered<00:03:22.120> Stanley's<00:03:22.630> head<00:03:22.870> one<00:03:23.620> he<00:03:23.860> was

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
all entered Stanley's head one he was

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.190 
all entered Stanley's head one he was
amazed<00:03:24.459> he<00:03:24.700> hadn't<00:03:25.000> asked<00:03:25.360> himself<00:03:25.480> sooner

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
amazed he hadn't asked himself sooner

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.070 
amazed he hadn't asked himself sooner
why<00:03:27.160> is<00:03:27.519> there<00:03:27.850> a<00:03:27.880> voice<00:03:28.239> in<00:03:28.510> my<00:03:28.660> head

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
why is there a voice in my head

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.440 
why is there a voice in my head
dictating<00:03:30.040> everything<00:03:30.549> that<00:03:30.850> I'm<00:03:31.000> doing<00:03:31.030> and

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
dictating everything that I'm doing and

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.410 
dictating everything that I'm doing and
thinking<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:33.160> her<00:03:33.310> voice<00:03:33.640> was<00:03:33.880> describing

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
thinking the her voice was describing

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.840 
thinking the her voice was describing
itself<00:03:34.959> being<00:03:35.230> considered<00:03:35.799> by<00:03:35.950> Stanley<00:03:36.489> who

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
itself being considered by Stanley who

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.150 
itself being considered by Stanley who
found<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.239> particularly<00:03:37.780> strange<00:03:38.380> I'm

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
found it particularly strange I'm

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.789 
found it particularly strange I'm
dreaming<00:03:39.850> about<00:03:39.940> a<00:03:40.120> voice<00:03:40.560> describing<00:03:41.560> me

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
dreaming about a voice describing me

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.190 
dreaming about a voice describing me
thinking<00:03:42.670> about<00:03:42.910> how<00:03:43.180> it's<00:03:43.360> describing<00:03:44.019> my

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
thinking about how it's describing my

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.130 
thinking about how it's describing my
thoughts<00:03:44.590> he<00:03:45.070> thought<00:03:45.540> Amani<00:03:46.540> thought<00:03:46.900> it<00:03:47.019> all

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
thoughts he thought Amani thought it all

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.140 
thoughts he thought Amani thought it all
very<00:03:47.500> odd<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:48.250> wondered<00:03:48.610> if<00:03:48.670> this<00:03:48.880> voice

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
very odd and wondered if this voice

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.539 
very odd and wondered if this voice
spoke<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.720> all<00:03:49.870> people<00:03:50.320> in<00:03:50.380> their<00:03:50.590> dreams<00:03:50.920> the

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
spoke to all people in their dreams the

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.940 
spoke to all people in their dreams the
truth<00:03:51.790> was<00:03:52.030> that<00:03:52.060> of<00:03:52.360> course<00:03:52.570> this<00:03:53.500> was<00:03:53.739> not<00:03:53.920> a

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
truth was that of course this was not a

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.880 
truth was that of course this was not a
dream<00:03:54.250> how<00:03:55.060> could<00:03:55.329> it<00:03:55.420> be<00:03:55.600> what<00:03:56.380> Stan<00:03:56.680> is

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
dream how could it be what Stan is

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.069 
dream how could it be what Stan is
simply<00:03:57.220> deceiving<00:03:57.700> himself<00:03:57.959> believing<00:03:58.959> that

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
simply deceiving himself believing that

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.840 
simply deceiving himself believing that
if<00:03:59.230> he's<00:03:59.530> asleep<00:03:59.860> he<00:04:00.160> doesn't<00:04:00.459> have<00:04:00.579> to<00:04:00.700> take
