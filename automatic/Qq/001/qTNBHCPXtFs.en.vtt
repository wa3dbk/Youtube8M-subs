 of destroying this diary yes that 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.670
 Height is even lazy to finish the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.190
 cycle normal way doe and makes you 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.829
 do what she should have done and not 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.930
 did she really smart people? 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.760
 unlike the daily district in this 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.070
 book you will not have the book 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.870
 No way are you going to follow missions. 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.690
 which are present in each of the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.129
 Web pages account that in the synopsis in the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.409
 Book early one day I was 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.270
 returning from a prosthetic she noticed 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.670
 one of the park benches and realized that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.549
 On top of him were several 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.049
 several super mysterious sheets that she 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.320
 said he got everything running, he took it to 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.060
 home and made the book want to sit there 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.369
 I think if I was really 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.049
 happened the leaves would actually be 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.960
 a bed of a beggar and when she 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.450
 she was going to get out of there with rain 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.430
 because in order to happen in the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.150
 real life a reality shock to 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.560
 you 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.020
 The book is divided into four categories 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.729
 being the first training of 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.130
 espionage for you to be a spy 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.390
 methods of documentation and observation 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.280
 for you to be called homes chips games 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.780
 champs the examination procedure of 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.000
 artifacts I do not know what it's for 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.680
 and the latter is an instruction manual on 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.750
 you can not skip any of the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.670
 categories even if you can not do 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.020
 because this book was created to help 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.070
 people to solve their 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.450
 problems of creative form of course 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.520
 for example if you want to know if your 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.860
 girlfriend you have there you take this disguise 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.450
 paste in the face and go after it because 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.039
 She'll never know you. 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.899
 Let's solve our problem in a way 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.220
 creative so I'll start showing 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.720
 How do you work? 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.400
 Look, on the first page it's already a 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.769
 battle or the line as it should be called 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.620
 that I can understand training of 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.840
 espionage of being his side and 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.500
 apply to the face using a method that 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.530
 to judge there they 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.200
 Looked like a pedophile, that's right. 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.810
 error and htc 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.760
 it has now fallen will work their 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.920
 ability to identify details 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.930
 look at the photo next to it and describe the maximum 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.970
 of things you can observe 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.489
 in her I remember that there were two ladies 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.209
 in a forest sitting with dress 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.739
 weird 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.750
 two ladies are doing 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.910
 sitting in a forest right people have two 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.130
 options or are there casino was to do 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.380
 hats snow or she is not smoking 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.599
 crack and taking into account that they dressed 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.160
 three of them I am sure is not the 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.049
 first choice is good 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.290
 Look, just look at this naughty face. 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.150
 look here is to put our lady who 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.340
 is doing with your life 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.069

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.620

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.630
 leaves your trunk and your branches can 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.170
 identify what kind of tree is the 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.690
 touch senses with your eyes closed 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.730
 part of the leaves and I smell it listen 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.389
 the noises she makes are named after the 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.579
 tree 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:29.609
 if she were the spirit as she would be 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.250
 personality is the last I go 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.889
 do is drawing photography called in which 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.389

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.489
 all your life 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:42.170
