00:03:35.599 --> 00:04:05.480 

let's<00:03:36.599> go<00:03:36.719> 54<00:03:37.260> 1044<00:03:38.359> 10:34<00:03:39.359> 20

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.570 

that's<00:04:06.060> good<00:04:06.890> we're<00:04:07.890> gonna<00:04:08.010> move<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.340> rear

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
that's good we're gonna move to rear

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.640 
that's good we're gonna move to rear
delts<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.360> since<00:04:09.630> it's<00:04:09.780> such<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:09.960> small<00:04:10.320> muscle

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
delts and since it's such a small muscle

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.070 
delts and since it's such a small muscle
you<00:04:11.520> know<00:04:11.610> it's<00:04:11.730> only<00:04:11.820> a<00:04:11.940> muscle<00:04:12.270> this<00:04:12.390> big<00:04:12.660> we

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
you know it's only a muscle this big we

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.050 
you know it's only a muscle this big we
don't<00:04:13.110> really<00:04:13.410> want<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.710> go<00:04:13.800> too<00:04:13.860> heavy<00:04:14.130> so
