00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
murder for God of War to me I think that

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.260 
murder for God of War to me I think that
God<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.560> War<00:01:16.680> one<00:01:16.920> was<00:01:16.950> probably<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.790> best<00:01:18.030> god

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
God of War one was probably the best god

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.999 
God of War one was probably the best god
of<00:01:18.390> war<00:01:18.540> at<00:01:18.689> least<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.080> terms<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.500> storyline

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
of war at least in terms of storyline

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.020 
of war at least in terms of storyline
anyway<00:01:20.600> it<00:01:21.600> was<00:01:21.720> kind<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:21.990> like<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> perfect

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
anyway it was kind of like the perfect

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.929 
anyway it was kind of like the perfect
you<00:01:24.030> know<00:01:24.119> Greek<00:01:24.420> tragedy<00:01:25.049> sort<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.409> thing

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
you know Greek tragedy sort of thing

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.700 
you know Greek tragedy sort of thing
yeah<00:01:26.939> because<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.540> Greek<00:01:27.720> stories<00:01:28.140> they<00:01:28.650> were

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
yeah because the Greek stories they were

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.859 
yeah because the Greek stories they were
a<00:01:28.799> very<00:01:29.040> violent<00:01:29.729> they<00:01:29.880> were<00:01:30.000> very<00:01:30.119> tragic<00:01:30.720> all

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
a very violent they were very tragic all

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.100 
a very violent they were very tragic all
the<00:01:30.990> time<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.150> think<00:01:33.270> they<00:01:33.509> really<00:01:33.540> captured

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the time so I think they really captured

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.580 
the time so I think they really captured
that<00:01:34.229> well<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.770> think<00:01:35.869> you<00:01:36.869> know<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.200> sequels

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
that well I think you know the sequels

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.100 
that well I think you know the sequels
why<00:01:38.280> still<00:01:38.640> enjoy<00:01:38.939> them<00:01:39.240> were<00:01:39.750> probably

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
why still enjoy them were probably

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.780 
why still enjoy them were probably
unnecessary<00:01:40.380> story<00:01:41.220> wise<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.380> yeah<00:01:43.790> let's

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
unnecessary story wise and yeah let's

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.539 
unnecessary story wise and yeah let's
just<00:01:44.970> read<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.740> but<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.979> back<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:47.340> have

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
just read it so but on the back we have

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.300 
just read it so but on the back we have
this<00:01:48.060> great<00:01:48.299> kind<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.840> aesthetic<00:01:49.310> we've

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
this great kind of aesthetic we've

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.149 
this great kind of aesthetic we've
behaved<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> burnt<00:01:51.420> parchment<00:01:52.049> or<00:01:52.229> or<00:01:52.829> actually

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
this is kind of much more like what you

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.569 
this is kind of much more like what you
would<00:04:00.669> find<00:04:00.849> in<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.030> Super<00:04:01.299> Nintendo<00:04:01.419> era<00:04:01.989> and

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
would find in the Super Nintendo era and

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.009 
would find in the Super Nintendo era and
you<00:04:03.579> know<00:04:03.970> it's<00:04:04.359> great<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.599> say<00:04:04.810> that<00:04:04.930> they

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
you know it's great to say that they

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.580 
you know it's great to say that they
still<00:04:05.260> kept<00:04:05.500> this<00:04:05.590> up<00:04:05.799> as<00:04:06.069> late<00:04:06.280> as<00:04:06.340> 2005<00:04:07.470> if<00:04:08.470> I

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
still kept this up as late as 2005 if I

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.839 
still kept this up as late as 2005 if I
remember<00:04:08.859> correctly<00:04:09.099> the<00:04:09.250> God<00:04:09.370> of<00:04:09.400> War<00:04:09.579> free

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
remember correctly the God of War free

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.400 
remember correctly the God of War free
manual<00:04:10.239> was<00:04:10.359> just<00:04:10.599> just<00:04:10.810> standard<00:04:11.169> black<00:04:11.380> and

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
manual was just just standard black and

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.280 
manual was just just standard black and
white<00:04:11.680> boring<00:04:12.250> affair<00:04:12.549> but<00:04:12.849> I<00:04:13.599> know<00:04:14.019> think

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
white boring affair but I know think

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.930 
white boring affair but I know think
with<00:04:14.380> PSP<00:04:14.739> game<00:04:14.919> manuals<00:04:15.340> without<00:04:15.519> exciting

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
with PSP game manuals without exciting

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.320 
with PSP game manuals without exciting
either<00:04:16.060> but<00:04:16.479> you<00:04:17.169> know<00:04:17.200> this<00:04:17.620> stuff<00:04:17.919> is<00:04:18.070> great

00:04:58.619 --> 00:04:58.629

manuals<00:04:59.080> but<00:04:59.319> I<00:04:59.379> would<00:04:59.560> say<00:04:59.860> you<00:05:00.370> know<00:05:00.460> I<00:05:01.120> mean

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
manuals but I would say you know I mean

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:02.850 
manuals but I would say you know I mean
most<00:05:01.569> people<00:05:01.870> I<00:05:01.930> imagine<00:05:02.259> have<00:05:02.379> God<00:05:02.560> of<00:05:02.680> War

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
most people I imagine have God of War

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.890 
most people I imagine have God of War
but<00:05:03.430> they<00:05:03.520> may<00:05:03.669> have<00:05:03.699> like<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.240> collection<00:05:04.569> on

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
but they may have like the collection on

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.540 
but they may have like the collection on
ps3<00:05:05.169> or<00:05:05.469> not<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:05.860> I'm<00:05:05.919> not<00:05:05.979> sure<00:05:06.250> if<00:05:06.370> it<00:05:06.430> has

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
ps3 or not and I'm not sure if it has

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.040 
ps3 or not and I'm not sure if it has
all<00:05:06.699> this<00:05:06.819> great<00:05:06.969> stuff<00:05:07.330> I<00:05:07.569> would<00:05:07.930> probably

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
all this great stuff I would probably

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.769 
all this great stuff I would probably
doubt<00:05:08.349> it<00:05:08.879> so<00:05:09.879> this<00:05:10.090> is<00:05:10.180> kind<00:05:10.389> of<00:05:10.449> one<00:05:10.569> of<00:05:10.599> those

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:10.779 
doubt it so this is kind of one of those

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:12.540 
doubt it so this is kind of one of those
games<00:05:11.020> where<00:05:11.139> it's<00:05:11.349> worth<00:05:11.500> tracking<00:05:11.740> down<00:05:11.919> you

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
and more so that probably would have

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.029 
and more so that probably would have
been<00:05:31.569> a<00:05:31.689> new<00:05:31.870> idea<00:05:32.229> at<00:05:32.319> the<00:05:32.409> time<00:05:32.589> I<00:05:32.740> imagine
