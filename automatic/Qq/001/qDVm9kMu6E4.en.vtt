using a stock cube you don't have to go

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.230 
using a stock cube you don't have to go
making<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:48.710> fresh<00:03:48.920> stock<00:03:49.160> for<00:03:49.340> this<00:03:49.430> at<00:03:49.580> all<00:03:49.670> it

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
making a fresh stock for this at all it

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.790 
making a fresh stock for this at all it
makes<00:03:50.390> it<00:03:50.510> quick<00:03:50.720> and<00:03:50.750> easy<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.350> if<00:03:51.680> that's

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
makes it quick and easy and if that's

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.220 
makes it quick and easy and if that's
the<00:03:51.980> case<00:03:52.100> you'll<00:03:52.340> cook<00:03:52.520> it<00:03:52.700> more<00:03:52.850> often<00:03:53.030> so<00:03:53.900> in

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
the case you'll cook it more often so in

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.220 
the case you'll cook it more often so in
with<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.560> stock<00:03:55.570> this<00:03:56.570> is<00:03:56.720> actually<00:03:56.960> chicken

with the stock this is actually chicken

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.150 
with the stock this is actually chicken
stock<00:03:58.090> because<00:03:59.710> it's<00:04:00.710> pretty<00:04:00.830> much<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.130> only

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
stock because it's pretty much the only
