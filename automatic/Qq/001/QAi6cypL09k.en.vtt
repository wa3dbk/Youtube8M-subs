00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.089 
absolutely cannot the industry standard
is<00:03:39.239> to<00:03:39.359> use<00:03:39.390> aluminum<00:03:40.049> at<00:03:40.140> this<00:03:40.290> point<00:03:40.530> but

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
is to use aluminum at this point but

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.130 
is to use aluminum at this point but
these<00:03:41.459> guys<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.909> use<00:03:42.090> cheaper<00:03:42.480> soft<00:03:42.780> metals

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
these guys to use cheaper soft metals

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.929 
these guys to use cheaper soft metals
and<00:03:43.319> that's<00:03:43.769> ultimately<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.280> reason<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:44.730> stop

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:44.939 
and that's ultimately the reason to stop

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:46.910 
and that's ultimately the reason to stop
working<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:46.079> piece<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.439> holds<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.769> hammer

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
working the piece that holds the hammer

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.039 
working the piece that holds the hammer
in<00:03:47.099> place<00:03:47.280> has<00:03:47.459> worn<00:03:47.730> down<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.900> hammer

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
in place has worn down so the hammer

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.390 
in place has worn down so the hammer
will<00:03:49.260> no<00:03:49.379> longer<00:03:49.650> stay<00:03:49.890> cocked

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
will no longer stay cocked

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.009 
will no longer stay cocked
this<00:03:50.760> also<00:03:50.939> leads<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.269> other<00:03:51.450> issues<00:03:51.750> like<00:03:51.780> the

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
this also leads to other issues like the

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.599 
this also leads to other issues like the
