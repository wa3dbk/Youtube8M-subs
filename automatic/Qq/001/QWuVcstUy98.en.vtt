to our NPN type transistors I am sorry I
am<00:02:16.860> going<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.520> describe<00:02:17.820> about<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.390> working

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
am going to describe about the working

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.410 
am going to describe about the working
of<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:18.990> system<00:02:19.440> first<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.640> have<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.850> connect

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
of this system first you have to connect

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.030 
of this system first you have to connect
the<00:02:21.540> battery<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.320> folder<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:25.050> red<00:02:25.800> curve

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
the battery of the folder the red curve

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.620 
the battery of the folder the red curve
whereas<00:02:26.640> meant<00:02:27.000> for<00:02:27.300> positive<00:02:28.230> terminal<00:02:28.740> so<00:02:29.630> I

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
whereas meant for positive terminal so I

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.280 
whereas meant for positive terminal so I
am<00:02:30.780> connecting<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.709> red<00:02:31.980> wire<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:33.290> the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
am connecting it to the red wire and the

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.390 
am connecting it to the red wire and the
black<00:02:34.470> wire<00:02:34.800> is<00:02:35.459> meant<00:02:35.910> for<00:02:37.040> needed<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.190> also

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
black wire is meant for needed and also

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.500 
black wire is meant for needed and also
I'm<00:02:38.670> connecting<00:02:39.150> it

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.589 

this<00:02:46.020> is<00:02:46.170> LDR<00:02:46.650> if<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.310> light<00:02:47.490> falls<00:02:47.910> on<00:02:48.120> LDR

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
this is LDR if the light falls on LDR

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.190 
this is LDR if the light falls on LDR
the<00:02:49.200> LED<00:02:49.560> will<00:02:49.709> not<00:02:49.920> glow<00:02:50.250> if<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:51.390> is<00:02:51.630> dark<00:02:51.930> or

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
the LED will not glow if it is dark or

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.600 
the LED will not glow if it is dark or
during<00:02:52.980> night<00:02:53.160> time<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:54.390> LED<00:02:54.660> will<00:02:54.870> glow<00:02:55.610> you

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
during night time the LED will glow you

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:04.550 
during night time the LED will glow you
can<00:02:56.790> see<00:02:57.000> it<00:03:02.270> it<00:03:03.270> is<00:03:03.330> eco-friendly<00:03:04.290> because

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
can see it it is eco-friendly because

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.949 
can see it it is eco-friendly because
only<00:03:05.550> during<00:03:05.850> night<00:03:06.060> time<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.600> power<00:03:06.780> is

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
only during night time the power is

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.850 
only during night time the power is
