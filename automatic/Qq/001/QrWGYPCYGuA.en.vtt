who do that oh that is like juice
there's<00:00:14.150> nice<00:00:14.530> so<00:00:15.530> John<00:00:16.000> why<00:00:17.000> don't<00:00:17.240> why<00:00:17.900> they

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
there's nice so John why don't why they

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.100 
there's nice so John why don't why they
ha<00:00:19.040> why<00:00:19.670> anything<00:00:20.000> quietly<00:00:20.660> put<00:00:20.900> wine<00:00:21.080> in

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
ha why anything quietly put wine in

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.810 
ha why anything quietly put wine in
barrels<00:00:21.560> wine<00:00:21.830> rose<00:00:22.100> they<00:00:22.310> use<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:22.610> oak

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
barrels wine rose they use the oak

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.810 
barrels wine rose they use the oak
because<00:00:23.060> it<00:00:23.300> lets<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:23.750> oxygen<00:00:24.470> in<00:00:24.820> slightly

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
because it lets the oxygen in slightly

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.420 
because it lets the oxygen in slightly
so<00:00:26.450> that<00:00:26.480> it's<00:00:27.050> just<00:00:27.440> enough<00:00:27.680> for<00:00:27.710> the<00:00:27.950> wine<00:00:28.130> to

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
so that it's just enough for the wine to

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.350 
so that it's just enough for the wine to
really<00:00:28.790> farm<00:00:29.450> into<00:00:29.960> its<00:00:30.110> own<00:00:30.320> self

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
really farm into its own self

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.150 
really farm into its own self
why<00:00:32.360> do<00:00:32.419> you<00:00:32.719> swirl<00:00:33.019> the<00:00:33.170> wine<00:00:33.379> around<00:00:33.679> in<00:00:34.039> the

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
why do you swirl the wine around in the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.520 
why do you swirl the wine around in the
glass<00:00:34.250> it<00:00:35.120> releases<00:00:35.449> the<00:00:35.750> smells<00:00:36.079> out<00:00:36.289> of<00:00:36.350> the

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
glass it releases the smells out of the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.239 
glass it releases the smells out of the
wine<00:00:36.710> don't<00:00:37.160> start<00:00:38.589> another<00:00:39.589> questions<00:00:40.070> bring
