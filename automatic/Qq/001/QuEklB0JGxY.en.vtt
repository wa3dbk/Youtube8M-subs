maybe you guys would want to see it

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.590 
maybe you guys would want to see it
because<00:01:52.310> everyone<00:01:53.310> knows<00:01:53.490> watching<00:01:54.270> someone

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
enough like that now put a fence gate

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.620 
enough like that now put a fence gate
then<00:02:01.049> build<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.619> wood<00:02:01.920> plank<00:02:02.310> sort<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.420> thing

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
then build this wood plank sort of thing

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.950 
then build this wood plank sort of thing
around<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.469> supposed<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.829> be<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.490> bar

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960

just thought it gave it more of a just a

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.929 
just thought it gave it more of a just a
cool<00:02:34.900> scenery<00:02:35.200> just<00:02:35.560> not<00:02:35.709> using<00:02:36.040> like<00:02:36.670> making

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
cool scenery just not using like making

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.190 
cool scenery just not using like making
it<00:02:37.060> look<00:02:37.150> kind<00:02:37.359> of<00:02:37.389> like<00:02:37.450> not<00:02:37.750> obviously<00:02:38.139> not

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
it look kind of like not obviously not

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.530 
it look kind of like not obviously not
natural<00:02:38.799> but<00:02:39.159> you<00:02:39.280> know<00:02:39.400> just<00:02:39.639> just<00:02:40.269> a<00:02:40.329> cool

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
natural but you know just just a cool

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.910 
natural but you know just just a cool
little<00:02:40.689> look<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.439> then<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.620> add<00:02:41.799> this

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
little look and then I add this

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.679 
little look and then I add this
glowstone<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.459> just<00:02:42.819> has<00:02:42.939> some<00:02:43.120> design<00:02:43.420> and

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
glowstone and just has some design and

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:44.879 
glowstone and just has some design and
so<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:43.900> illuminates<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:44.439> area<00:02:44.709> because<00:02:44.859> I

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
so it illuminates the area because I

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.339 
so it illuminates the area because I
only<00:02:45.220> wanted<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.639> torches<00:02:46.120> on<00:02:46.329> the<00:02:46.870> outside

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
only wanted the torches on the outside

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.890 
only wanted the torches on the outside
area<00:02:47.769> so<00:02:48.189> I<00:02:48.220> thought<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:48.609> looked<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:49.720> looked

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
area so I thought it looked it looked

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.259 
area so I thought it looked it looked
really<00:02:50.049> cool<00:02:50.169> because<00:02:50.709> once<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.700> finish<00:02:51.970> the

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
really cool because once you finish the

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.759 
really cool because once you finish the
roof<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.780> don't<00:02:52.930> really<00:02:53.019> see<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.590> clothes

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
roof you don't really see the clothes

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:54.960 
roof you don't really see the clothes
and<00:02:53.950> all<00:02:54.010> that<00:02:54.099> much<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.489> it<00:02:54.549> just<00:02:54.579> looks<00:02:54.849> kind

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
and all that much and it just looks kind

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.539 
and all that much and it just looks kind
of<00:02:55.120> cool<00:02:55.439> so<00:02:56.439> you<00:02:56.889> have<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.099> glowstone<00:02:57.430> all

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
of cool so you have the glowstone all

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.220 
of cool so you have the glowstone all
set<00:02:57.730> up<00:02:57.819> like<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.389> you're<00:02:58.930> gonna<00:02:59.019> take

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
set up like that and you're gonna take

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.979

some<00:02:59.409> wood<00:02:59.590> slabs<00:02:59.889> and<00:03:00.489> you're<00:03:00.669> just<00:03:00.760> gonna<00:03:00.989> do

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
some wood slabs and you're just gonna do

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.339 
some wood slabs and you're just gonna do
like<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.260> complete<00:03:02.680> outline<00:03:03.000> around<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.349> like

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
like a complete outline around the like

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.399 
like a complete outline around the like
the<00:03:05.500> first<00:03:05.769> set<00:03:06.069> of<00:03:06.359> grassy<00:03:07.359> glowstone<00:03:07.959> thingy

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
the first set of grassy glowstone thingy

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.159 
the first set of grassy glowstone thingy
and<00:03:09.310> then<00:03:09.400> go<00:03:10.000> up<00:03:10.090> here<00:03:10.359> and<00:03:10.599> go<00:03:10.719> around<00:03:10.840> that

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:11.169 
and then go up here and go around that

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:12.720 
and then go up here and go around that
so<00:03:11.379> it<00:03:11.469> kind<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.709> covers<00:03:12.069> it<00:03:12.250> but<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.519> still

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730
