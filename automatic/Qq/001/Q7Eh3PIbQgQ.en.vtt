right now so let's go to arm CNN com and
let<00:02:05.399> me<00:02:05.490> make<00:02:05.640> sure<00:02:05.700> let's<00:02:06.479> see<00:02:06.689> where<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
let me make sure let's see where the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.100 
let me make sure let's see where the
pre-loading<00:02:07.530> sends<00:02:08.009> right<00:02:08.190> now<00:02:08.599> so<00:02:09.599> bandwidth

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
pre-loading sends right now so bandwidth

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.070 
pre-loading sends right now so bandwidth
management<00:02:10.910> preload<00:02:11.910> pages<00:02:12.390> is

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
management preload pages is

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.490 
management preload pages is
on<00:02:13.370> okay<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:15.150> we're<00:02:15.420> going<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.630> do<00:02:15.810> CNN<00:02:16.710> com

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
on okay so we're going to do CNN com

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.590 
on okay so we're going to do CNN com
alright<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:19.680> let's<00:02:19.860> start<00:02:20.100> this<00:02:20.280> test<00:02:21.770> go<00:02:23.600> okay

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
alright so let's start this test go okay

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.000 
alright so let's start this test go okay
as<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.960> can<00:02:24.990> see<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.410> was<00:02:25.560> much<00:02:25.770> quicker

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
as you can see that was much quicker

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:40.030 
as you can see that was much quicker
okay<00:02:27.000> then<00:02:27.210> we're<00:02:27.360> going<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.570> do<00:02:27.750> amazon<00:02:28.380> com

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.600 

and<00:02:41.040> we're<00:02:42.000> going<00:02:42.210> to<00:02:42.270> press<00:02:42.600> enter<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:44.400> same

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
and we're going to press enter the same

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.720 
and we're going to press enter the same
time<00:02:44.900> again<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.020> was<00:02:46.230> faster<00:02:46.440> now<00:02:47.400> what<00:02:47.610> I'm

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
time again this was faster now what I'm

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.800 
time again this was faster now what I'm
going<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:47.880> do<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.090> I'm<00:02:48.180> going<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.390> turn<00:02:48.510> off<00:02:48.690> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
going to do is I'm going to turn off the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.960 
going to do is I'm going to turn off the
pre-loading<00:02:49.730> function<00:02:52.459> your<00:02:53.459> bandwidth

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
pre-loading function your bandwidth

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.930 
pre-loading function your bandwidth
management<00:02:54.560> turn<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.680> off<00:02:55.830> and<00:02:56.100> now<00:02:56.700> we're

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
management turn it off and now we're

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.199 
management turn it off and now we're
going<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.090> do<00:02:57.300> two<00:02:57.840> more<00:02:58.110> websites<00:02:58.620> on<00:02:59.209> with

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
going to do two more websites on with

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.730 
going to do two more websites on with
that<00:03:00.390> setting<00:03:01.050> disabled<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.550> let's<00:03:02.820> all<00:03:03.060> go<00:03:03.270> to

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
that setting disabled so let's all go to

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:14.770 
that setting disabled so let's all go to
gamespot<00:03:04.740> com<00:03:05.840> that's<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.990> heavy<00:03:07.200> duty<00:03:07.380> website

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.050

tap on these guys so that is not going
to<00:03:53.250> that's<00:03:54.150> going<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.360> be<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.570> same<00:03:54.780> as

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
to that's going to be the same as

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.630 
to that's going to be the same as
running<00:03:55.019> a<00:03:55.230> test<00:03:55.440> browser<00:03:55.890> test<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:56.430> let's

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
running a test browser test so let's

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:04.009 
running a test browser test so let's
click<00:03:56.760> this<00:03:56.970> both<00:03:57.320> there<00:03:58.320> you<00:03:58.440> go<00:04:02.840> okay<00:04:03.840> that

click this both there you go okay that

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.180 
click this both there you go okay that
didn't<00:04:04.290> work<00:04:04.320> let's<00:04:04.620> do<00:04:04.739> something<00:04:05.160> different

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190

the<00:04:21.120> ipad<00:04:21.660> is<00:04:21.690> quicker<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.710> load<00:04:23.270> without<00:04:24.270> the

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
the ipad is quicker to load without the

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.800 
the ipad is quicker to load without the
pre-loading<00:04:25.140> function<00:04:25.770> turned<00:04:26.250> on<00:04:26.550> on<00:04:27.510> the

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
pre-loading function turned on on the

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.020 
pre-loading function turned on on the
Nexus<00:04:28.200> 7<00:04:28.530> if<00:04:28.950> you<00:04:29.100> have<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.370> nexus<00:04:29.700> Evans

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
Nexus 7 if you have the nexus Evans

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.240 
Nexus 7 if you have the nexus Evans
pre-loading<00:04:30.570> function<00:04:30.990> turned<00:04:31.260> on<00:04:31.440> it's<00:04:31.920> much

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
pre-loading function turned on it's much

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.030 
pre-loading function turned on it's much
faster<00:04:32.550> because<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:33.270> web<00:04:33.690> page<00:04:33.930> loads<00:04:34.410> in<00:04:34.680> the

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
faster because the web page loads in the

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.760 
faster because the web page loads in the
background<00:04:35.520> so<00:04:36.150> let's<00:04:36.390> do<00:04:36.570> one<00:04:36.930> more<00:04:36.960> let's
