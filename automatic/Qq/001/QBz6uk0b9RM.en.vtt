we're<00:00:05.640> about<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.970> talk<00:00:06.120> about<00:00:06.180> one<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:06.629> the

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
we're about to talk about one of the

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.890 
we're about to talk about one of the
most<00:00:06.930> common<00:00:07.500> wilderness<00:00:08.250> medicine<00:00:08.900> issues

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
most common wilderness medicine issues

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.280 
most common wilderness medicine issues
and<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.800> shoulder<00:00:11.790> dislocations<00:00:12.420> if<00:00:13.139> you

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
and that is shoulder dislocations if you

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.320 
and that is shoulder dislocations if you
spend<00:00:13.590> enough<00:00:13.650> time<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.190> wilderness<00:00:14.370> as<00:00:14.849> a

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
spend enough time in the wilderness as a

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.320 
spend enough time in the wilderness as a
guide<00:00:15.660> or<00:00:16.619> as<00:00:16.740> an<00:00:16.859> adventurer<00:00:17.310> at<00:00:17.820> some<00:00:18.090> point

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
guide or as an adventurer at some point

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.080 
guide or as an adventurer at some point
you<00:00:18.990> will<00:00:19.199> need<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.560> deal<00:00:19.770> with<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.400> dislocated

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
you will need to deal with a dislocated

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.630 
you will need to deal with a dislocated
children<00:00:21.480> most<00:00:22.230> shoulder<00:00:22.680> dislocations<00:00:23.369> are

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
children most shoulder dislocations are

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.330 
children most shoulder dislocations are
anterior<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.740> shoulder<00:00:25.740> dislocations

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
anterior and the shoulder dislocations

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.710 
anterior and the shoulder dislocations
you'll<00:00:26.490> probably<00:00:26.670> see<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.539> wilderness

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
you'll probably see in the wilderness

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.870 
you'll probably see in the wilderness
will<00:00:28.170> be<00:00:28.289> an<00:00:28.410> anterior<00:00:28.800> shoulder<00:00:28.980> dislocation

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
will be an anterior shoulder dislocation

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.479 
will be an anterior shoulder dislocation
so<00:00:30.420> let's<00:00:30.599> talk<00:00:30.810> about<00:00:30.869> how<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.320> recognize<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
so let's talk about how to recognize the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.450 
so let's talk about how to recognize the
dislocation<00:00:33.210> as<00:00:33.390> well<00:00:33.989> as<00:00:34.200> how<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.770> manage<00:00:35.309> it

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
dislocation as well as how to manage it

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.970 
dislocation as well as how to manage it
in<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.180> backcountry<00:00:36.590> one<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.739> first

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
in the backcountry one of the first

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.510 
in the backcountry one of the first
things<00:00:38.190> I'll<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.270> patient<00:00:40.020> is

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
things I'll do with a patient is

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.619 
things I'll do with a patient is
especially<00:00:41.520> you're<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.760> kayak<00:00:42.030> you're

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
especially you're in a kayak you're

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.810 
especially you're in a kayak you're
trying<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> make<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.350> very<00:00:43.770> rapid<00:00:44.579> evaluation

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
trying to make a very rapid evaluation

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.639 
trying to make a very rapid evaluation
and<00:00:45.539> determine<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.170> patient's<00:00:46.559> really

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
and determine if the patient's really

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.970 
and determine if the patient's really
dislocated<00:00:47.340> my<00:00:48.059> shoulder<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.870> I'll<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:49.860> ask

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
dislocated my shoulder is I'll just ask

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.920 
dislocated my shoulder is I'll just ask
the<00:00:50.129> patient<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:51.000> touch<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.510> opposite

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the patient to touch the opposite

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:52.459 
the patient to touch the opposite
shoulder

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
shoulder

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.680 
shoulder
so<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:52.980> touch<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.969> shoulder<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.360> for

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
so can you touch that shoulder and for

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.270 
so can you touch that shoulder and for
the<00:00:54.750> purposes<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.350> let's<00:00:55.920> pretend<00:00:56.190> you

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the purposes of this let's pretend you

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.209 
the purposes of this let's pretend you
can't<00:00:56.539> okay<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> patient<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:58.890> touch

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
can't okay so a patient that can touch

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.939 
can't okay so a patient that can touch
her<00:00:59.670> shoulder<00:00:59.850> go<00:01:00.149> ahead<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.480> touch<00:01:00.660> it

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
her shoulder go ahead and just touch it

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.100 
her shoulder go ahead and just touch it
she's<00:01:01.949> not<00:01:02.520> dislocated<00:01:03.270> when<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> patient<00:01:03.989> is

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
she's not dislocated when a patient is

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.590 
she's not dislocated when a patient is
able<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.769> touch<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.250> opposite<00:01:05.729> shoulder<00:01:05.939> you

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
able to touch the opposite shoulder you

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.940 
able to touch the opposite shoulder you
can<00:01:06.720> pretty<00:01:06.900> much<00:01:06.960> assume<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> field<00:01:07.770> that

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
can pretty much assume in the field that

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.980 
can pretty much assume in the field that
she's<00:01:08.159> not<00:01:08.340> dislocated<00:01:09.000> patients<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.900> are

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
she's not dislocated patients that are

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.260 
she's not dislocated patients that are
dislocated<00:01:10.260> won't<00:01:10.740> be<00:01:10.860> able<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
dislocated won't be able to do that the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.580 
dislocated won't be able to do that the
first<00:01:12.479> thing<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.720> noticed<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.140> patient

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
first thing I noticed on a patient

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.530 
first thing I noticed on a patient
typically<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.340> their<00:01:14.520> general<00:01:14.820> anatomy

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
typically is just their general anatomy

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.810 
typically is just their general anatomy
and<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.200> easiest<00:01:16.470> way<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.369> get<00:01:17.700> as

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
and the easiest way to do that is get as

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.160 
and the easiest way to do that is get as
much<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.180> patient's<00:01:18.570> clothing<00:01:18.900> off<00:01:19.020> as

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
much of the patient's clothing off as

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.440 
much of the patient's clothing off as
you<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.320> today<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.460> cold<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.060> rainy<00:01:21.210> we're

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
you can today it's cold and rainy we're

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.810 
you can today it's cold and rainy we're
not<00:01:21.570> going<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.840> do<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.189> compared

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
not going to do that and I just compared

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.300 
not going to do that and I just compared
the<00:01:24.240> uninjured<00:01:24.570> side<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> injured<00:01:26.130> side

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the uninjured side to the injured side

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.850 
the uninjured side to the injured side
now<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.520> notice<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.090> Denise's<00:01:27.860> uninjured

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
now you notice on Denise's uninjured

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.569 
now you notice on Denise's uninjured
side<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.939> have<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> nice<00:01:30.590> rounded<00:01:31.590> deltoid

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
side we have a nice rounded deltoid

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.149 
side we have a nice rounded deltoid
contour<00:01:33.270> where<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> deltoid<00:01:34.200> muscle<00:01:34.619> moves

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
contour where the deltoid muscle moves

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.789 
contour where the deltoid muscle moves
over<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> normal<00:01:35.790> anatomy<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:37.290> proximal

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
over the normal anatomy of the proximal

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.450 
over the normal anatomy of the proximal
humerus<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:39.210> shoulder<00:01:39.600> on<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.890> affected

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
humerus and the shoulder on the affected

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.870 
humerus and the shoulder on the affected
side<00:01:41.659> you<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.020> acromion<00:01:43.560> process<00:01:43.880> which

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
side you have the acromion process which

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.550 
side you have the acromion process which
is<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.390> portion<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> shoulder<00:01:46.229> blade

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
is this portion of the shoulder blade

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.280 
is this portion of the shoulder blade
and<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.700> literally<00:01:48.210> steps<00:01:48.689> off<00:01:48.930> into

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
and it just literally steps off into

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.490 
and it just literally steps off into
nothingness<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:50.009> get<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:50.549> sort<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.850> hideous

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
nothingness you get this sort of hideous

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.499 
nothingness you get this sort of hideous
concavity<00:01:52.500> where<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:54.030> steps<00:01:54.329> off

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
concavity where it just steps off

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.090 
concavity where it just steps off
because<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.110> humeral<00:01:55.500> head<00:01:55.710> which<00:01:55.950> is

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
because the humeral head which is
