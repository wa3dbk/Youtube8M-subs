00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.570
 christian bale batman now he is moses 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:16.580
 in ridley scotts exodus you say 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.580
 would not have caused all this 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.199
 You say it's not his fault 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.380
 then we will see who better of us 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.380
 killing 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:36.970
 you or me times 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.970
 set 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.050
 I still see them in both of you 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.320
 two little boys in common 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.320
 grew up 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.230
 to be as close as brothers 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.420
 and I tell you 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.420
 something will come 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.840
 whereas I am powerless 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.090
 really an interesting first 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.640
 trailer of course only on mood 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.590
 is designed and in exodus gods and 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.030
 Kings the 120th century fox 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.160
 expected from the 25th 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.660
 december 2014 in German cinemas 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.700
 will bring in the story of 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.190
 Moses tells and be his fighting dog 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.780
 order of god the israelites from the 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.370
 slavery 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.720
 Egypt to free that partly with 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.670
 wonder and with big epic 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.990
 you can already see monumental scenes 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.730
 in this trailer here in the reason only 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.440
 mood is currently with what for 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.330
 a look on here waiting for you 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.980
 a Christian Behl main actor has 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.780
 the one when anybody a 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.130
 maybe entrusted with such a big role 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.200
 still in the whole circle of 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.640
 can count chosen which the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.990
 somehow on the camera like canvas 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.430
 but you also have to completely ban 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.990
 honestly say stuff like moses 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.520
 as well as a passion christi 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.960
 or noah are always movies 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.790
 especially many of us 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.860
 Like religious groups controversial 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.540
 then you discussed stripes on the 25th 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.090
 december at christmas time to read 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.130
 is already such a very own story 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.930
 Anyway, I find that once 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.970
 as a otto normal kinogÃ¤nger that the look 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.680
 from the trailer is pretty good after 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.030
 big budget novy looks like there I am 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.860
 curious if you have the great 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.900
 cast in the kristen bell are people like 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.310
 servers kingsley up sigourney weaver 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.500
 john tutor and many other well-known 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.090
 faces in front of the camera also united 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.170
 really well on the canvas can banishes 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.970
 and that I hope you have a lot 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.530
 not too much in monumental battles 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.330
 but also loses storytelling 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.850
 in the foreground a second move 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.230
 trailer and then the even 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.970
 would probably show you once 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.920
 to see the first moving images on 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.630
 extra dunno exodus there we have 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.430
 many fans are waiting for it and christian 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.440
 Bale is always a feast for the eyes 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.360
 on the canvas this man can become 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.340
 just about any figure will accept 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.840
 and that's why I'm looking forward to the 25th 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.970
 december but that is still a whole 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.500
 nice big story you try 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.330
 here for me somehow to hunt and there 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.830
 I'm curious and let's go 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.209
 a second trailer to come on us 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.590
 soon, okay, what are you doing there ? 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.660
 Trailer likes to write the comments 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.880
 then I'm going through my check too 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.530
 the first trailer too extra load 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.880
 like a dam there if this video 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.040
 let it stay if not 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.360
 otherwise that you know there is still one 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.220
 couple left and me around and tomorrow around 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.910
 15 clock, of course, at the latest, a new one 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.380
 Video 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.320
 and then i hope here for weeks 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.980
 again with it 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.980
 of course on the 3rd
