fresh<00:01:30.009> nimbleness<00:01:30.579> cutting<00:01:31.000> abilities<00:01:31.390> they

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
fresh nimbleness cutting abilities they

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.200 
fresh nimbleness cutting abilities they
are<00:01:32.200> virtually<00:01:32.680> identical

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210

cks<00:01:34.500> well<00:01:35.500> doesn't<00:01:35.890> quite<00:01:36.219> get<00:01:36.549> his<00:01:36.729> sharpest

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
cks well doesn't quite get his sharpest

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.550 
cks well doesn't quite get his sharpest
and<00:01:37.360> yeah<00:01:37.539> I<00:01:37.780> mean<00:01:37.899> you<00:01:38.020> can<00:01:38.140> get<00:01:38.200> this<00:01:38.350> thing

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
and yeah I mean you can get this thing

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.260 
and yeah I mean you can get this thing
screaming<00:01:38.890> sharp<00:01:39.340> but<00:01:39.820> I<00:01:39.850> think<00:01:40.060> he<00:01:40.119> can<00:01:40.210> get

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
screaming sharp but I think he can get

the Miyagi just a hairshirt

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.139 
the Miyagi just a hairshirt
sharper<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.579> I<00:01:42.610> think<00:01:42.789> we're<00:01:42.880> just<00:01:42.909> splitting

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
sharper and I think we're just splitting

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.300 
sharper and I think we're just splitting
hairs<00:01:43.329> here<00:01:43.539> literally<00:01:44.020> they<00:01:44.679> both<00:01:44.890> get<00:01:45.009> super

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
hairs here literally they both get super

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.399 
hairs here literally they both get super
super<00:01:45.460> sharp<00:01:45.820> but<00:01:46.149> the<00:01:46.240> Yankee<00:01:46.570> also<00:01:46.960> has<00:01:47.380> a

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
super sharp but the Yankee also has a

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.859 
super sharp but the Yankee also has a
little<00:01:47.770> better<00:01:47.979> edge<00:01:48.250> retention<00:01:48.720> also<00:01:49.720> when

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
little better edge retention also when

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.320 
little better edge retention also when
I'm<00:01:49.960> sharpening<00:01:50.259> them

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
I'm sharpening them

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.820 
I'm sharpening them
they<00:01:51.870> feel<00:01:52.080> different<00:01:52.260> on<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> stones

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
they feel different on the stones

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.930 
they feel different on the stones
literally<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.240> Hanafi<00:01:55.310> feels<00:01:56.310> literally

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
literally the Hanafi feels literally

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.790 
literally the Hanafi feels literally
feels<00:01:57.240> higher<00:01:57.540> almost<00:01:57.810> glass<00:01:58.260> like<00:01:58.560> heaven

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
feels higher almost glass like heaven

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.900 
feels higher almost glass like heaven
stones<00:01:59.040> especially<00:01:59.190> when<00:01:59.550> to<00:01:59.640> get<00:01:59.760> to<00:01:59.820> the

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
stones especially when to get to the

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.550 
stones especially when to get to the
higher<00:02:00.030> crits<00:02:00.330> as<00:02:00.870> compared<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.500> one

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
higher crits as compared to this one

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.680 
higher crits as compared to this one
didn't<00:02:01.890> quite<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.220> same<00:02:02.490> feel<00:02:02.760> maybe<00:02:03.420> it

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
didn't quite have the same feel maybe it

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.840 
didn't quite have the same feel maybe it
has<00:02:03.840> something<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.140> do<00:02:04.260> with<00:02:04.290> why<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
has something to do with why the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.120 
has something to do with why the
only<00:02:05.060> question<00:02:05.300> is

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
only question is

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.890 
only question is
nimbleness<00:02:07.820> virtually<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.780> same<00:02:08.950> they<00:02:09.950> are

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900 
nimbleness virtually the same they are

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.350 
nimbleness virtually the same they are
