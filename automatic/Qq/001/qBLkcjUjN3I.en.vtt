00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.149 
go ahead and I mix this together really
good<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.880> somebody<00:01:18.869> asks<00:01:19.259> me<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:19.740> they<00:01:19.950> can

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
good and somebody asks me if they can

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.390 
good and somebody asks me if they can
mix<00:01:20.610> make<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.479> without<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.380> using<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> whey

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
mix make this without the using the whey

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.780 
mix make this without the using the whey
protein<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.930> haven't<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.250> find<00:01:26.640> that

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
protein but I haven't I just find that

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.499 
protein but I haven't I just find that
the<00:01:26.909> whey<00:01:27.360> protein<00:01:27.869> really<00:01:28.170> um<00:01:28.909> gives<00:01:29.909> some

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
the whey protein really um gives some

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.260 
the whey protein really um gives some
substance<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.229> mixture<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.909> makes

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
substance to the mixture in it it makes

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.980 
substance to the mixture in it it makes
it<00:01:33.390> taste<00:01:33.570> better

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
it taste better

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.679 
it taste better
I<00:01:34.590> did<00:01:34.979> try<00:01:35.220> making<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.670> revolutionary<00:01:36.360> rules

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
I did try making the revolutionary rules

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.170 
I did try making the revolutionary rules
without<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:38.970> way

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
without it and I just I like this way

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.450 
without it and I just I like this way
better<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.900> it's<00:01:40.619> really<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.890> matter<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.220> choice

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
better so it's really a matter of choice

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.280 
better so it's really a matter of choice
try<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.909> without<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.600> see<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.229> it

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
try it without and see if you like it

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.160 
try it without and see if you like it
but<00:01:43.909> trust<00:01:44.909> me<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.299> whey<00:01:45.420> protein<00:01:45.869> makes<00:01:46.049> a

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
but trust me the whey protein makes a

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.429 
but trust me the whey protein makes a
big<00:01:46.320> difference<00:01:47.060> okay<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.329> he<00:01:48.840> mix<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.259> until

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
big difference okay so he mix this until

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.810 
big difference okay so he mix this until
there's<00:01:49.829> no<00:01:49.979> more<00:01:50.009> lumps<00:01:50.430> or<00:01:50.729> cheese<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
there's no more lumps or cheese so the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.060 
there's no more lumps or cheese so the
egg<00:01:53.970> mix<00:01:54.299> here<00:01:54.540> sorry<00:01:54.810> about<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.470> then

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070

the egg whites and I have this done to
an<00:02:11.459> exact<00:02:11.849> science<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.750> from<00:02:13.110> start<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.530> finish

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
an exact science so from start to finish

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.130 
an exact science so from start to finish
should<00:02:13.980> take<00:02:14.130> about<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:15.030> takes<00:02:15.360> exactly<00:02:15.900> six

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
should take about it takes exactly six

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.350 
should take about it takes exactly six
minutes<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:16.650> me<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.800> get<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:18.030> stiff

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
minutes for me to get it to the stiff

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.000 
minutes for me to get it to the stiff
peak<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:19.440> need<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.190> make<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.490> buns<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:21.420> um

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
peak that I need to make the buns so um

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.440 
peak that I need to make the buns so um
hopefully<00:02:23.010> that'll<00:02:23.520> help<00:02:23.700> someone<00:02:24.060> out<00:02:24.090> there

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
hopefully that'll help someone out there

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.570 
hopefully that'll help someone out there
so<00:02:25.230> I'm<00:02:25.620> going<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.890> go<00:02:26.010> ahead<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.370> start

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
so I'm going to go ahead and start

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.240 
so I'm going to go ahead and start
mixing<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:27.540> then<00:02:27.800> I'll<00:02:28.800> be<00:02:28.920> back<00:02:28.950> in<00:02:29.100> six

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
mixing this and then I'll be back in six

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:38.360 
mixing this and then I'll be back in six
minutes

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.380 

so<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:38.819> been<00:02:39.060> about<00:02:39.180> um<00:02:39.750> I'm<00:02:40.470> screaming<00:02:41.390> it's

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
nice and fluffy and um the it's stiff so

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.309 
nice and fluffy and um the it's stiff so
let's<00:02:50.790> do<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.090> text<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.569> see<00:02:51.780> if<00:02:51.959> it's<00:02:52.170> done

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
let's do the text to see if it's done

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.009 
let's do the text to see if it's done
okay<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.220> scooped<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.090> oh<00:02:54.239> it's<00:02:54.480> really<00:02:54.660> stiff

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
okay I scooped it oh it's really stiff

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.350 
okay I scooped it oh it's really stiff
and<00:02:55.290> then<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.650> go<00:02:55.830> like<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.489> look<00:02:57.150> it

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
and then I go like this and look it
