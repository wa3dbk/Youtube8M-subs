00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
alright guys we're almost done last

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.210 
alright guys we're almost done last
thing<00:00:03.659> we<00:00:03.780> need<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:03.959> do<00:00:04.140> is<00:00:04.350> solder<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.890> plug

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
thing we need to do is solder the plug

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.980 
thing we need to do is solder the plug
on<00:00:06.290> to<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.429> brushless<00:00:08.700> motor<00:00:09.090> so<00:00:09.960> that

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
on to the to the brushless motor so that

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.270 
on to the to the brushless motor so that
we<00:00:10.170> can<00:00:10.320> plug<00:00:10.559> it<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:11.000> to<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.120> ESC<00:00:13.190> we're<00:00:14.190> gonna

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
we can plug it in to the ESC we're gonna

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.829 
we can plug it in to the ESC we're gonna
go<00:00:14.429> ahead<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.580> solder<00:00:14.880> it<00:00:15.000> on<00:00:15.179> there<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.630> then

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
go ahead and solder it on there and then

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.870 
go ahead and solder it on there and then
we're<00:00:16.020> gonna<00:00:16.139> plug<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.680> battery<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.640> we're

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
we're gonna plug in a battery and we're

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.670 
we're gonna plug in a battery and we're
going<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.060> make<00:00:18.270> sure<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.410> motor

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
going to make sure that the the motor

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.779 
going to make sure that the the motor
spins<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.250> correct<00:00:20.550> direction<00:00:22.609> alright<00:00:23.609> guys

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
spins the correct direction alright guys

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.779 
spins the correct direction alright guys
so<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.150> soldered<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.920> motor<00:00:25.920> wire<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.670> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
so we soldered the motor wire on to the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.740 
so we soldered the motor wire on to the
plug<00:00:27.800> plugged<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.010> battery<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.640> powered<00:00:30.630> up

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
plug plugged in a battery and powered up

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.229 
plug plugged in a battery and powered up
the<00:00:31.019> motor<00:00:31.349> was<00:00:31.650> not<00:00:31.949> turning<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> correct

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the motor was not turning the correct

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.049 
the motor was not turning the correct
direction<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:34.320> we<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:34.739> as<00:00:35.309> per<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
direction so we just as per the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.270 
direction so we just as per the
instructions<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.840> switch<00:00:37.140> any<00:00:37.440> two<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
instructions you switch any two of the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.350 
instructions you switch any two of the
three<00:00:38.309> wires<00:00:39.020> just<00:00:40.020> switch<00:00:40.530> any<00:00:40.829> two<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:42.239> we

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
three wires just switch any two so we

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.690 
three wires just switch any two so we
did<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.500> powered<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.010> back<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.430> and

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
did that and we powered it back up and

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.750 
did that and we powered it back up and
it<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.000> running<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.350> running<00:00:46.890> now<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
it is running it is running now the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.450 
it is running it is running now the
correct<00:00:48.059> direction<00:00:48.530> still<00:00:49.530> not<00:00:49.800> figuring<00:00:50.280> out

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
correct direction still not figuring out

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.200 
correct direction still not figuring out
the<00:00:51.170> transmitter<00:00:52.170> settings<00:00:52.739> there's<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
the transmitter settings there's a

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.630 
the transmitter settings there's a
certain<00:00:54.210> way<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.690> arm<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.050> ESC

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
certain way you have to arm the ESC

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.970 
certain way you have to arm the ESC
still<00:00:56.640> working<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.719> I'm<00:00:58.710> gonna<00:00:58.800> go

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
still working on that but I'm gonna go

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.860 
still working on that but I'm gonna go
ahead<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.160> put<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.489> back<00:00:59.579> together<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.300> see

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
ahead and put it back together and see

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.840 
ahead and put it back together and see
what<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.199> figure<00:01:01.320> out<00:01:01.590> all<00:01:02.579> right<00:01:02.670> guys

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
what we can figure out all right guys

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.369 
what we can figure out all right guys

all I did was went in there and threw a

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.059 
all I did was went in there and threw a

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.449 
we'll see what happens here I don't
expect<00:02:10.539> it<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.780> fly<00:02:11.020> perfectly<00:02:11.350> because<00:02:11.980> it's

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
expect it to fly perfectly because it's

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.550 
expect it to fly perfectly because it's
not<00:02:12.730> set<00:02:13.060> correctly<00:02:13.240> but<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:14.110> just<00:02:14.319> want<00:02:14.500> to

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
not set correctly but I just want to

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.770 
not set correctly but I just want to
make<00:02:14.709> sure<00:02:14.860> everything<00:02:15.310> works<00:02:15.490> on<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:15.880> so

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
make sure everything works on it so

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.590 
make sure everything works on it so
we're<00:02:17.500> gonna<00:02:17.590> plug<00:02:17.860> it<00:02:18.010> in<00:02:18.240> we're<00:02:19.240> gonna<00:02:19.330> wait

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
we're gonna plug it in we're gonna wait

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.190 
we're gonna plug it in we're gonna wait
for<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.840> solid<00:02:20.290> blue<00:02:20.530> LED<00:02:21.660> there<00:02:22.660> it<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.870> now

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
for the solid blue LED there it is now

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.559 
for the solid blue LED there it is now
we're<00:02:23.319> gonna<00:02:23.410> flip<00:02:23.650> throttle<00:02:24.100> hold<00:02:25.050> on<00:02:27.569> off

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
we're gonna flip throttle hold on off

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.809 
we're gonna flip throttle hold on off
again<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.940> then<00:02:31.870> I<00:02:32.290> think<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.370> was<00:02:33.550> right

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
again and then I think that was right

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.470 
again and then I think that was right
we'll<00:02:34.360> see<00:02:35.069> yeah<00:02:36.069> it<00:02:36.340> was<00:02:36.489> right<00:02:36.670> okay<00:02:37.420> so

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
we'll see yeah it was right okay so

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.380 
we'll see yeah it was right okay so
basically<00:02:38.380> you<00:02:38.739> just<00:02:38.770> let<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.340> once<00:02:40.150> you<00:02:40.239> turn

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
basically you just let the once you turn

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.240 
basically you just let the once you turn
transmitter<00:02:40.959> on<00:02:41.140> let<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.470> blue<00:02:41.680> light<00:02:42.010> go

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
transmitter on let the blue light go

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.470 
transmitter on let the blue light go
solid<00:02:42.780> I'm<00:02:43.780> sorry<00:02:44.670> well<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:45.820> make<00:02:46.150> sure<00:02:46.180> your

solid I'm sorry well you make sure your
throttle<00:02:46.930> hold<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.260> on<00:02:47.500> when<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:47.890> plug<00:02:48.160> the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
throttle hold is on when you plug the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.910 
throttle hold is on when you plug the
battery<00:02:48.459> into<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.989> helicopter<00:02:49.989> then<00:02:50.560> flip

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
battery into the helicopter then flip

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.449 
battery into the helicopter then flip
throttle<00:02:51.430> Molde<00:02:52.620> throttle<00:02:53.620> hold<00:02:53.769> off<00:02:54.040> and

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
throttle Molde throttle hold off and

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.430 
throttle Molde throttle hold off and
then<00:02:54.550> back<00:02:54.760> on<00:02:54.820> again<00:02:55.690> on<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:55.870> all<00:02:56.320> right

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
then back on again on it all right

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.780 
then back on again on it all right
so<00:02:56.680> let's<00:02:56.860> put<00:02:56.920> on<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.160> ground<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.580> see<00:02:57.670> what

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
so let's put on the ground and see what

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:17.250 
so let's put on the ground and see what
happens

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.710 

all<00:03:17.860> right<00:03:17.980> well<00:03:18.099> it<00:03:18.189> was

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.570 

definitely<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.650> work<00:03:23.800> on<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.100> transmitter

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
definitely to work on the transmitter

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.200 
definitely to work on the transmitter
settings<00:03:25.090> but<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:26.850> everything<00:03:27.850> works<00:03:28.090> the
