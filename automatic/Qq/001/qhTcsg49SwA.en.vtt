00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.330
 you are 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:14.440
 luck 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.110
 things in life that happen here here 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.170
 I present a game that cool mallet hack the 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:24.440
 game many you will know is very old 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:27.560
 but I like I like it, I like it 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:31.060
 and I put my username I use 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.060
 always all life 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.030
 this is a video to teach you to 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.789
 play this damn game 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.149
 I also downloaded it two years ago 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:49.780
 and well I tried it but I did not have 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.780
 idea of using more or shits was that 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:58.380
 to see and how as a demon this was played 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.070
 well 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.680
 the trick of this game is to know 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.230
 conjugating that is easy you just have to 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.230
 know t 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:19.890
 with these accounts are 77 commands 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:21.900
 of point cdc point of cls cls no 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.360
 it's good for nothing is to clean the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.900
 screen in case you write many things 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.230
 here things things things and all those 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.860
 things then they are told that everything is deleted 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:39.470
 this is not foolish to follow him to 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.840
 then to save and that 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.050
 load heading 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.110
 also and good logical 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.450
 the dull are the only two commands 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.350
 that can only be used when 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.689
 you are on your own computer not 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.220
 Well, the garden is a game that 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.770
 try that you have to get into 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.770
 other people's computers and do things like that 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.660
 and there's always an uncle called ciao 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:17.170
 with any uncle who says then uncle 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:20.590
 hack the computer to this and well no 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.069
 I give nothing but but but you check and 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.800
 do not see 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:29.490
 What if I 'm not your friend? 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.490
 good 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.100
 here in the first mission you have to 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.400
 steal a file that is called by 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.550
 scanner in this text is helpful what 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.080
 I'll put in the description so you can 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.410
 use it also when 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.410
 you play 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:55.069
 and all that not and also below you get the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.069
 address or p you have to hack 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.810
 Well, the port of all that shit 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.800
 you do all this you copy it you go 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.800
 copying well master wife 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.480
 you copy it here 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.110
 and when you have copied it well 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.100
 and now you have to proceed 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.590
 first of all finger the ip of the 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:39.750
 user to hack you have to give him here 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.750
 where you ping it 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:50.280
 and wait when it had already been painted 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:52.030
 you give it to tenet or you read the ip and the 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.569
 port 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.569
 spa 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:03.189
 it connects and you have to enter the login 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:06.549
 what gives you there in the message 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:09.460
 master and password 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:13.200
 ay love my wife 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:15.480
 that is, one where day and password 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.959
 you get yourself on a remote computer 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.269
 Well you have to start using 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:25.130
 these 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:29.570
 of these commands you can not go 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:32.450
 cd point and point and between 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:36.020
 parenthesis your ip not the ones that you have to 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:40.820
 remove the pipe to leave to stop 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:44.100
 do list of things documents 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.860
 and of files that are here 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.820
 gives name to folder in this case 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.820
 hacking 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:58.130
 to get into a folder to go to 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.730
 see it again and now to download the 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:05.700
 file that asks you to give 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:10.630
 copies this you will get a state 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:14.170
 what will the game be wrong? 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.780
 the translation clear as it gives sacks 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.660
 where can you get one then it's the 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:22.460
 name here 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.460
 and you wait for it to be fully charged 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.100
 just before finishing a mission the most 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.810
 important of all is always to erase your 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:33.880
 trace your trail will not go out and do 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.790
 point to return to the folder 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.330
 makes two points and then you have to 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.330
 get into 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:48.160
 the footprint of posts is good 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.850
 in blogs 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:56.370
 and now live and now you have to be able 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:06:00.840
 of him and the pp that is always here 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:03.680
 19 2,168 point he 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:08.850
 what I will leave in the greater description 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:12.120
 then of letters and this is already and for 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:15.210
 discard you have to hit Hangu and 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.460
 I've had luck down here where he puts 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.190
 the trail means that it is 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.210
 and 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:29.310
 not the police that puts random numbers and 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:31.770
 when it's going right then it will be 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.500
 singing numbers until you find your ip and 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:38.310
 ccoo does not find triplet subtracting then 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:41.850
 the text of the video I hope that we have 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:45.150
 boring and that has been very simple like that 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:48.810
 to give it like to subscribe and then of course 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.520
 improved equal of the whole whole game 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.340
 is my being 1 to 11 which is the 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:07:06.960
 final not that goodbye 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:07:06.960
