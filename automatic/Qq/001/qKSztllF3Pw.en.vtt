00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
for example just like that and stop

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.710 
for example just like that and stop
squeezing<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.680> lifting<00:01:28.710> way<00:01:29.189> or<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.600> do

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
squeezing and lifting way or you can do

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.580 
squeezing and lifting way or you can do
a<00:01:30.750> rosette<00:01:32.509> which<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.689> just<00:01:33.930> piping<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.350> little

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
a rosette which is just piping a little

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.280 
a rosette which is just piping a little
circle<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.240> if<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.360> mess<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:36.990> just

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
circle and if you mess up you can just

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.109 
circle and if you mess up you can just
lift<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.619> off<00:01:37.740> because<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.280> frozen<00:01:38.460> solid<00:01:38.909> so

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
lift it off because it's frozen solid so

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.690 
lift it off because it's frozen solid so
it's<00:01:39.630> not<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.049> stick<00:01:40.290> I'll<00:01:41.159> do<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> couple
