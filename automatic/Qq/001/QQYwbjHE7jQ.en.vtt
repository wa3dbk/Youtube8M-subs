00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
yeah

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.360 
yeah
yeah<00:01:46.520> as<00:01:46.790> I<00:01:46.940> said<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.920> to<00:01:48.920> be<00:01:49.040> honest<00:01:49.250> the

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
yeah as I said the the to be honest the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.190 
yeah as I said the the to be honest the
worst<00:01:49.580> part<00:01:49.880> of<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.360> actual<00:01:50.660> body<00:01:50.840> is<00:01:50.990> the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
worst part of the the actual body is the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.340 
worst part of the the actual body is the
head<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:51.950> it<00:01:52.250> is<00:01:52.670> obviously<00:01:53.570> optional<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.140> have

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
head so it is obviously optional to have

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.180 
head so it is obviously optional to have
it<00:01:54.500> because<00:01:54.740> it's<00:01:54.890> not<00:01:55.040> a<00:01:55.070> great<00:01:55.430> spit<00:01:55.820> of<00:01:56.480> it

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
it because it's not a great spit of it

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.520 
it because it's not a great spit of it
so<00:01:58.190> now<00:01:58.340> we'll<00:01:58.550> go<00:01:58.820> to<00:01:58.880> chest<00:01:59.330> and<00:01:59.540> click<00:01:59.870> new

waste<00:02:11.720> on<00:02:11.930> this<00:02:12.050> one<00:02:12.200> cause<00:02:12.290> he<00:02:12.380> doesn't<00:02:12.620> wear

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
waste on this one cause he doesn't wear

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.580 
waste on this one cause he doesn't wear
pokes<00:02:12.950> it's<00:02:13.160> actually<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.460> one-piece<00:02:13.880> but<00:02:14.590> yeah

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
pokes it's actually a one-piece but yeah

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.930 
pokes it's actually a one-piece but yeah
you<00:02:15.920> can't<00:02:16.100> really<00:02:16.220> make<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.430> one-piece<00:02:16.790> on

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
you can't really make a one-piece on

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.640 
you can't really make a one-piece on
this<00:02:17.090> because<00:02:17.209> it's<00:02:17.420> slightly<00:02:17.600> difficult<00:02:17.900> and

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
this because it's slightly difficult and

the two color slim line and the boots

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.900 
the two color slim line and the boots
will<00:02:23.930> be<00:02:24.140> trim<00:02:25.010> cuffed<00:02:25.340> unfortunately

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
will be trim cuffed unfortunately

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.270 
will be trim cuffed unfortunately
couldn't<00:02:26.060> find<00:02:26.330> any<00:02:26.650> exact<00:02:27.650> look-alike<00:02:27.890> boots

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
couldn't find any exact look-alike boots

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.740 
couldn't find any exact look-alike boots
I<00:02:28.459> know<00:02:28.520> he<00:02:28.700> kind<00:02:28.880> of<00:02:28.940> works<00:02:29.060> whereas<00:02:29.510> working

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
I know he kind of works whereas working

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.220 
I know he kind of works whereas working
with<00:02:29.990> boots<00:02:30.200> but<00:02:30.740> yeah<00:02:31.459> the<00:02:31.580> best<00:02:31.820> of<00:02:31.940> again<00:02:32.230> so

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
with boots but yeah the best of again so

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.630 
with boots but yeah the best of again so
once<00:02:33.350> you've<00:02:33.470> got<00:02:33.560> all<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.739> basics<00:02:34.160> down<00:02:34.310> you

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
once you've got all the basics down you

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.190 
once you've got all the basics down you
look<00:02:34.850> like<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:35.090> so<00:02:35.480> you<00:02:35.570> kind<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:35.930> see<00:02:36.050> where

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
look like that so you kind of see where

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.580 
look like that so you kind of see where
this<00:02:36.260> is<00:02:36.380> going<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:37.310> go<00:02:37.940> back<00:02:38.120> go<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.140> colors

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
this is going so go back go to colors

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.550 
this is going so go back go to colors
and<00:02:40.300> gear<00:02:41.300> so<00:02:41.810> we'll<00:02:41.930> go<00:02:42.020> to<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.170> pallet<00:02:42.530> and

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
and gear so we'll go to the pallet and

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.010 
and gear so we'll go to the pallet and
sow<00:02:42.950> our<00:02:43.220> first<00:02:43.670> primary<00:02:44.000> color<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:44.780> of<00:02:44.870> course

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
sow our first primary color so of course

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.220 
sow our first primary color so of course
it<00:02:45.200> will<00:02:45.290> be<00:02:45.350> green<00:02:45.880> or<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.030> darker<00:02:47.900> greens

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
it will be green or the darker greens

00:02:48.230 --> 00:03:02.180 
it will be green or the darker greens
bit<00:02:48.590> hard<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:50.350> achieve

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.100 

all<00:03:02.730> right<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.090> looks<00:03:03.150> about<00:03:03.390> right<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:03.840> of

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
all right that looks about right and of

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:12.740 
all right that looks about right and of
course<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.620> yellowy<00:03:05.160> gold<00:03:05.610> color<00:03:11.480> so<00:03:12.480> at<00:03:12.660> the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
course a yellowy gold color so at the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.150 
course a yellowy gold color so at the
moment<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:12.990> probably<00:03:13.110> think<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.830> we'll<00:03:13.980> just

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
moment you probably think and we'll just

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.410 
moment you probably think and we'll just
make<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:14.460> any<00:03:14.670> color<00:03:14.820> you<00:03:14.970> like<00:03:15.030> I'll<00:03:15.300> just

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
make this any color you like I'll just

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.940 
make this any color you like I'll just
go<00:03:15.540> with<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.720> base<00:03:15.900> white<00:03:16.140> just<00:03:16.440> in<00:03:16.560> case<00:03:16.740> it

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
go with the base white just in case it

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.100 
go with the base white just in case it
does<00:03:17.100> do<00:03:17.790> any<00:03:18.000> random<00:03:18.210> bits<00:03:18.540> so<00:03:18.990> you're

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
does do any random bits so you're

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.750 
does do any random bits so you're
probably<00:03:19.260> wondering<00:03:19.710> what<00:03:20.160> on<00:03:20.340> earth's<00:03:20.490> going

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
probably wondering what on earth's going

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.670 
probably wondering what on earth's going
on<00:03:20.940> now<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:21.510> if<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:21.720> go<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:21.870> customize<00:03:22.350> gear

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.520 
on now so if you go to customize gear
you<00:03:22.830> can<00:03:23.010> customize<00:03:23.430> each<00:03:23.550> individual<00:03:24.180> piece

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
you can customize each individual piece

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.480 
you can customize each individual piece
we're<00:03:25.530> gonna<00:03:25.590> leave<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:25.920> helmet<00:03:26.220> like<00:03:26.310> that
