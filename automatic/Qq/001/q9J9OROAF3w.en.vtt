from a Lisa song's channel where she

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.550

as<00:00:31.800> like<00:00:32.130> kind<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.320> moisturizing<00:00:34.320> face<00:00:34.800> mask

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
as like kind of a moisturizing face mask

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.900 
as like kind of a moisturizing face mask
at<00:00:35.550> nighttime<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.440> kind<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.649> felt<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.610> I

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
at nighttime I kind of felt like I

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.799 
at nighttime I kind of felt like I
should<00:00:39.210> give<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.600> go

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
should give it a go

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.440 
should give it a go
simply<00:00:40.710> because<00:00:40.860> before<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.610> watched<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
simply because before I watched the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.380 
simply because before I watched the
video<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.780> actually<00:00:43.170> already<00:00:43.820> knew<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.850> aloe

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
video I actually already knew that aloe

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.139 
video I actually already knew that aloe
vera<00:00:45.629> gel<00:00:46.020> was<00:00:46.680> beneficial<00:00:47.430> for<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.850> skin<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
vera gel was beneficial for the skin and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.479 
vera gel was beneficial for the skin and
it<00:00:48.390> was<00:00:48.539> really<00:00:48.809> hydrating<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.860> also<00:00:50.160> because

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
it was really hydrating and also because

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.279 
it was really hydrating and also because
your<00:00:50.640> skin<00:00:50.910> needs<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.360> lot<00:00:51.600> more<00:00:51.629> moisture

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
your skin needs a lot more moisture

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.439 
your skin needs a lot more moisture
during<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.739> night<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.160> for<00:00:53.520> aloe<00:00:53.850> vera<00:00:54.030> gel

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
during the night so for aloe vera gel

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.799 
during the night so for aloe vera gel
being<00:00:54.750> really<00:00:55.199> moisturizing<00:00:56.070> would<00:00:56.940> help

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
being really moisturizing would help

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.520 
being really moisturizing would help
replenish<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.629> lost<00:01:00.629> moisture<00:01:01.199> when<00:01:01.379> you

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
replenish the lost moisture when you

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.340 
replenish the lost moisture when you
sleep<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.100> because<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.449> gel<00:01:03.780> form<00:01:04.110> it's

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
sleep and because it's in gel form it's

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.130 
sleep and because it's in gel form it's
less<00:01:04.830> likely<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.519> make<00:01:05.880> my<00:01:06.030> skin<00:01:06.330> any<00:01:06.600> earlier

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
less likely to make my skin any earlier

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.740 
less likely to make my skin any earlier
now<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.799> one<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.159> use<00:01:08.580> here<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.030> Holland<00:01:09.510> and
