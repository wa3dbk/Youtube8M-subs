00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.160
 hello everyone today I bring you a trick of 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.960
 gta 5 good more than a trick is a fault 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.610
 It's a bad break 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.410
 worth of these that you can transfer 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.640
 some pairs of things of these and 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.430
 it's just in this house here 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.849
 we can go through one of the windows and 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.410
 we can fall below the map but good 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.780
 when falling below the map his thing is to have 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.510
 the parachute so that if you see it better 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.100
 and that's worth the place it's just in 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.570
 this point here you can mark it with 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.000
 the triangle you can make marks in the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.040
 map you already know 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.740
 Well, I do not have there marked and good 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.420
 he said that his thing is to have a parachute 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.100
 so you do not have to buy, you do it 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.650
 Parachute trick is worth with the code 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.150
 that secret and you already have it and 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.710
 Then, well, if you want to come by 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.330
 here and see what's below the map 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.310
 Well, good to come here 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.600
 you drop and it is already as simple as 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.190
 this count 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.650
 As you can see here I have the parachute and 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.970
 well it's just at the door in the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.390
 part of the right just in this 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.620
 piece here 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.970
 even if it looks solid it is not solid 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.470
 it is not transparent because we can see it 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.540
 but worth it if we can get through 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.190
 it's worth simply that there's no need to run 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.110
 although you do not have to run the baix 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.780
 quietly walking and you can 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.000
 to cross it we go as it is good then 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.720
 here is the parachute and well we can 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.640
 be planning a little around here 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.230
 when falling down completely when we get 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.510
 when we are losing 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.980
 height when we get down there we do not 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.900
 we die teleports us again 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.520
 within the map it is worth just at the point 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.740
 where we are now online 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.510
 straight up and it leaves us so if 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.430
 you are going to the sea wells of two 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.870
 teleport then to the sea if you 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.000
 you put in the part of the mountain because 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.620
 mountain vale is very simple very easy 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.360
 here as you see I did not have the parachute 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.890
 you will see what happens when you do not have 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.350
 parachute simply by sky if ya 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.610
 they are one you can not plan you can not 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.840
 see it well 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.760
 here is just now me 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.290
 teleports just on site 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.930
 where I am do not be straight line towards 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.670
 above 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.740
 right here they were already there and 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.170
 policemen there in nothingness is simply 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.750
 this one more fault there are quite a few others 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.840
 failures but good this one appeared to me 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.940
 I was very curious more than useful 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.620
 curiously enough, nothing is simply 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.000
 This I hope you liked and if you 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.470
 I liked to ride I like favorites and 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.680
 see you in the next video are the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.680
 used 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.640
 and good 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.670
 i 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.459
 yes 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.349
 here 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.200
