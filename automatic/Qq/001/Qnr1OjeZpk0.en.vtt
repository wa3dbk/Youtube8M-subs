discovered new radioactive isotope but

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.099 
discovered new radioactive isotope but
it<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.699> volatile<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.600> does<00:00:21.720> not<00:00:21.900> have

this<00:01:34.420> is<00:01:34.540> Gordon<00:01:34.900> Freeman<00:01:35.080> how<00:01:35.410> do<00:01:35.470> we<00:01:35.620> contain

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
this is Gordon Freeman how do we contain

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.250 
this is Gordon Freeman how do we contain
to<00:01:36.190> meltdown<00:01:36.610> I<00:01:36.880> know<00:01:36.940> and<00:01:37.390> to<00:01:37.479> use<00:01:37.630> portals<00:01:38.080> to

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
to meltdown I know and to use portals to

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.080 
to meltdown I know and to use portals to
push<00:01:38.440> an<00:01:38.560> enemy<00:01:38.860> headquarters<00:01:39.070> into<00:01:39.580> a<00:01:39.670> portal

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
push an enemy headquarters into a portal

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.030 
push an enemy headquarters into a portal
so<00:01:40.120> Dallas<00:01:40.660> wouldn't<00:01:41.020> meltdown<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:41.830> would

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
so Dallas wouldn't meltdown and would

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.920 
so Dallas wouldn't meltdown and would
only<00:01:42.130> go<00:01:42.400> off<00:01:42.430> farmers<00:01:42.970> in<00:01:43.120> Atlantic<00:01:43.570> Ocean

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
only go off farmers in Atlantic Ocean

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.050 
only go off farmers in Atlantic Ocean
