what's<00:00:13.980> up<00:00:14.130> guys<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.670> thrown<00:00:14.910> in<00:00:15.030> here

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
what's up guys this is thrown in here

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.810 
what's up guys this is thrown in here
this<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.630> notched<00:00:15.990> on<00:00:16.230> how<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.529> use<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:17.010> little

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
this is notched on how to use a little

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.210 
this is notched on how to use a little
program<00:00:18.150> called<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.510> compress<00:00:18.930> nega<00:00:19.199> 1.5<00:00:20.189> oh

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
program called the compress nega 1.5 oh

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.790 
program called the compress nega 1.5 oh
it<00:00:20.970> looks<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.359> bit<00:00:21.480> like<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.380> icon<00:00:22.769> a

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
it looks a bit like this so the icon a

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.029 
it looks a bit like this so the icon a
nap<00:00:23.039> but<00:00:23.279> um<00:00:24.019> what<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.109> does<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.470> converts

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
nap but um what it does is it converts

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:36.100 
nap but um what it does is it converts
dds<00:00:26.519> files<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:31.250> on<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.719> first<00:00:33.719> dds<00:00:34.140> files

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
dds files and on it first dds files

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.590 
dds files and on it first dds files
into<00:00:37.110> soar<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:37.739> BMP<00:00:38.399> normal<00:00:38.969> picture<00:00:39.390> file

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
into soar like BMP normal picture file

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.660 
into soar like BMP normal picture file
so<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:42.260> sort<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.559> nice<00:00:43.950> textures

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
so you can sort of have nice textures

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.330 
so you can sort of have nice textures
that<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:45.629> actually<00:00:46.170> load<00:00:46.379> into<00:00:46.710> cinema<00:00:47.070> 4d

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
that can actually load into cinema 4d

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.959 
that can actually load into cinema 4d
now<00:00:48.829> TGA<00:00:50.930> will<00:00:51.930> go<00:00:52.199> into<00:00:52.410> cinema<00:00:52.920> 4d<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.640> i

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
now TGA will go into cinema 4d but i

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.410 
now TGA will go into cinema 4d but i
will<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> demonstration<00:00:55.590> as<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.300> was<00:00:57.390> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
will do a demonstration as if it was a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.110 
will do a demonstration as if it was a
dds<00:00:57.899> okay<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.879> got<00:01:00.120> our<00:01:00.180> obj<00:01:01.020> model<00:01:02.120> that

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
dds okay so we got our obj model that

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.800 
dds okay so we got our obj model that
goes<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.479> dragon<00:01:06.479> fire<00:01:06.780> I

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
goes in and that is the dragon fire I

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.910 
goes in and that is the dragon fire I
think<00:01:07.170> I'm<00:01:07.320> not<00:01:07.439> sure<00:01:07.590> um<00:01:09.020> but<00:01:10.020> yeah<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.710> want

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
think I'm not sure um but yeah we want

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.330 
think I'm not sure um but yeah we want
the<00:01:11.040> textures<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:13.490> obj<00:01:14.490> obj<00:01:14.970> obj<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:16.409> we

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the textures so obj obj obj that we

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.210 
the textures so obj obj obj that we
don't<00:01:17.520> need<00:01:17.880> because<00:01:18.270> their<00:01:18.479> model<00:01:18.810> files<00:01:19.220> and

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
don't need because their model files and

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.870 
don't need because their model files and
these<00:01:20.400> are<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:20.670> TJ<00:01:21.600> files<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.170> want<00:01:25.880> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
these are all TJ files so we want the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.850 
these are all TJ files so we want the
normal<00:01:27.390> spectrum<00:01:27.720> not<00:01:28.049> okay<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.439> m<00:01:29.070> q<00:01:30.079> mq<00:01:31.079> s<00:01:31.500> mq

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
normal spectrum not okay so m q mq s mq

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.020 
normal spectrum not okay so m q mq s mq
spec<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.600> I'm<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.840> put<00:01:33.990> them<00:01:34.140> into<00:01:34.259> order<00:01:34.650> now

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
spec so I'm to put them into order now

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.340 
spec so I'm to put them into order now
mq<00:01:36.030> normal<00:01:36.920> okay<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.130> gun<00:01:38.340> spec<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.780> gun<00:01:40.020> and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
mq normal okay the gun spec the gun and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.580 
mq normal okay the gun spec the gun and
the<00:01:40.590> gun<00:01:40.619> normal<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.640> having<00:01:41.960> color<00:01:42.960> normal

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the gun normal so having color normal

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.080 
the gun normal so having color normal
and<00:01:43.799> spec<00:01:44.299> the<00:01:45.299> rotor<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:47.369> tan<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
and spec the rotor the tan and the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.450 
and spec the rotor the tan and the
digital<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.899> think<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.649> tannin<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> digit

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
digital so I think the tannin the digit

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.819 
digital so I think the tannin the digit
or<00:01:50.610> sort<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.890> what<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.009> call<00:01:53.189> them<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:55.470> model

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
or sort of what you call them the model

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.969 
or sort of what you call them the model
textures<00:01:56.369> like<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.790> skins<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.750> paints<00:01:58.649> but

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
textures like the skins the paints but

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.740 
textures like the skins the paints but
we'll<00:01:59.670> get<00:01:59.790> into<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.149> saying<00:02:00.329> run<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
we'll get into it saying run the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.359 
we'll get into it saying run the
compressed<00:02:01.079> nigga<00:02:01.290> as<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.100> see<00:02:02.280> you

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
compressed nigga as you can see you

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.780 
compressed nigga as you can see you
can't<00:02:02.640> actually<00:02:02.820> see<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:04.590> textures<00:02:05.340> itself

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
can't actually see the textures itself

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.819 
can't actually see the textures itself
to<00:02:06.240> imagine<00:02:06.570> these<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.719> dds<00:02:07.170> files<00:02:07.200> have

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
to imagine these a dds files have

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.070 
to imagine these a dds files have
exactly<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.489> same<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.000> what<00:02:09.810> we'll<00:02:09.929> do<00:02:10.050> is

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
exactly the same so what we'll do is

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.890 
exactly the same so what we'll do is
we'll<00:02:10.200> get<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.470> gun<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.860> we'll<00:02:11.489> import<00:02:11.940> all

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
we'll get the gun and we'll import all

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.980 
we'll get the gun and we'll import all
of<00:02:12.959> these

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
of these

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.900 
of these
and<00:02:14.710> we'll<00:02:14.830> do<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.040> you'll<00:02:15.160> click<00:02:15.460> on<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.730> top

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
and we'll do is you'll click on the top

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.110 
and we'll do is you'll click on the top
one<00:02:16.090> hit<00:02:16.630> ctrl<00:02:17.080> R<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.650> then<00:02:18.340> just<00:02:18.520> save<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:18.790> as

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
one hit ctrl R and then just save it as

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.820 
one hit ctrl R and then just save it as
a<00:02:19.150> BMP<00:02:19.510> texture<00:02:21.540> pretty<00:02:22.540> much<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.780> same<00:02:22.960> text

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
a BMP texture pretty much the same text

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.940 
a BMP texture pretty much the same text
if<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:24.040> won<00:02:24.190> then<00:02:25.030> close<00:02:25.240> it<00:02:25.300> down<00:02:25.450> click<00:02:26.170> ctrl

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
if you won then close it down click ctrl

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.370 
if you won then close it down click ctrl
R<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:28.270> save<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:28.990> just<00:02:29.200> save<00:02:29.920> those<00:02:30.420> three<00:02:31.420> and

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
R and save and just save those three and

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.440 
R and save and just save those three and
then<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.650> can<00:02:32.950> replace<00:02:33.250> them<00:02:33.520> you<00:02:34.060> can<00:02:34.270> get

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
then you can replace them you can get

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.710 
then you can replace them you can get
rid<00:02:34.600> of<00:02:34.630> them<00:02:34.810> ones<00:02:34.990> okay<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:37.360> we've<00:02:37.510> got<00:02:37.630> the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
rid of them ones okay so we've got the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.580 
rid of them ones okay so we've got the
gun<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.650> normal<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.520> spec<00:02:40.410> delete<00:02:41.410> that

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
gun the normal and the spec delete that

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.010 
gun the normal and the spec delete that
the<00:02:41.950> NQ<00:02:42.520> normal<00:02:43.090> aspect<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.570> don't<00:02:43.750> think<00:02:43.930> we

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
the NQ normal aspect I don't think we

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.260 
the NQ normal aspect I don't think we
need<00:02:44.140> them<00:02:44.380> actually<00:02:44.760> but<00:02:45.760> if<00:02:45.880> we<00:02:46.000> get<00:02:46.150> the

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
need them actually but if we get the

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.840 
need them actually but if we get the
rotor<00:02:46.980> control<00:02:47.980> our<00:02:48.870> get<00:02:49.870> that<00:02:50.850> rotor

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
rotor control our get that rotor

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.920 
rotor control our get that rotor
and<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.390> digital<00:02:54.540> save<00:02:57.570> and<00:02:58.570> I<00:02:58.630> think<00:02:58.840> it

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
and the digital save and I think it

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.240 
and the digital save and I think it
turns<00:02:59.170> just<00:02:59.500> another<00:03:01.140> another<00:03:02.140> texture<00:03:02.980> for

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
turns just another another texture for

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.950 
turns just another another texture for
it<00:03:03.340> but<00:03:03.460> if<00:03:03.550> we<00:03:03.700> just<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:04.540> basically<00:03:04.870> how

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
it but if we just that is basically how

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.200 
it but if we just that is basically how
to<00:03:05.080> convert<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.560> textures<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.100> then<00:03:06.820> you<00:03:07.060> can

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
to convert the textures and then you can

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.560 
to convert the textures and then you can
import<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.690> textures<00:03:08.020> in<00:03:08.170> so<00:03:08.850> we<00:03:09.850> know<00:03:10.120> that

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
import the textures in so we know that

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.450 
import the textures in so we know that
this<00:03:11.230> is<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.590> rotor<00:03:12.420> which<00:03:13.420> is<00:03:13.660> this<00:03:14.460> texture

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
this is a rotor which is this texture

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.870 
this is a rotor which is this texture
because<00:03:16.560> when<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.680> click<00:03:17.950> on<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.220> rotor<00:03:18.400> this

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
because when you click on the rotor this

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.010 
because when you click on the rotor this
one<00:03:19.150> appears<00:03:19.420> highlight<00:03:20.080> so<00:03:20.740> we<00:03:20.980> can<00:03:22.020> bring

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
one appears highlight so we can bring

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.590 
one appears highlight so we can bring
that<00:03:23.050> out<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:24.070> we<00:03:24.280> can<00:03:24.490> add<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.850> rotor<00:03:25.090> on<00:03:25.420> to

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
that out and we can add the rotor on to

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.240 
that out and we can add the rotor on to
the<00:03:25.690> color<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:27.120> remove<00:03:28.120> specular<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:29.590> we<00:03:30.070> got

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
the color and remove specular and we got

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.150 
the color and remove specular and we got
the<00:03:30.280> rotor<00:03:30.550> textures<00:03:31.000> on<00:03:31.240> that<00:03:32.250> now<00:03:33.250> again<00:03:35.160> may

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
the rotor textures on that now again may

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.220 
the rotor textures on that now again may
need<00:03:36.310> to<00:03:36.400> add<00:03:36.430> an<00:03:36.640> out<00:03:36.850> at<00:03:37.360> it<00:03:37.480> as<00:03:37.600> an<00:03:37.720> alpha<00:03:38.140> as

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
need to add an out at it as an alpha as

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.530 
need to add an out at it as an alpha as
well<00:03:38.380> so<00:03:38.620> check<00:03:39.040> alpha<00:03:39.550> and<00:03:40.350> add<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:41.470> rotor

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
well so check alpha and add the rotor

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.960 
well so check alpha and add the rotor
and<00:03:43.860> there<00:03:44.860> we<00:03:44.950> go<00:03:45.100> it's<00:03:45.280> like<00:03:45.550> the<00:03:45.700> spinny

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
and there we go it's like the spinny

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.710 
and there we go it's like the spinny
affects<00:03:46.330> you<00:03:47.670> now<00:03:48.670> this<00:03:48.850> is<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.330> main<00:03:49.510> body

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
affects you now this is the main body

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.800 
affects you now this is the main body
which<00:03:50.170> is<00:03:50.200> this<00:03:50.500> one<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.790> go<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.030> color<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:52.660> it

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
which is this one so go to color and it

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.050 
which is this one so go to color and it
will<00:03:52.930> be<00:03:53.140> digital<00:03:53.830> because<00:03:54.370> that<00:03:54.520> is<00:03:54.640> sort<00:03:55.000> of

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
will be digital because that is sort of

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.930 
will be digital because that is sort of
just<00:03:55.420> out<00:03:55.840> of<00:03:56.200> pure<00:03:57.070> knowledge<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.760> game

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
just out of pure knowledge of the game

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.910 
just out of pure knowledge of the game
that<00:03:58.240> would<00:03:59.140> be<00:03:59.320> digital<00:03:59.710> because<00:04:01.920> obviously

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
that would be digital because obviously

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.880 
that would be digital because obviously
yes<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:04.440> camo<00:04:05.760> in<00:04:06.760> like<00:04:07.450> mono<00:04:07.660> fair<00:04:07.900> two<00:04:08.080> guns<00:04:08.620> in

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
yes a camo in like mono fair two guns in

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.820 
yes a camo in like mono fair two guns in
it<00:04:09.040> like<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:11.250> how<00:04:12.250> you<00:04:12.310> can<00:04:12.640> fly<00:04:12.970> digital

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
it like the how you can fly digital

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.680 
it like the how you can fly digital
desert<00:04:14.850> woodland<00:04:15.850> or<00:04:16.239> like<00:04:16.270> that<00:04:16.390> so

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
desert woodland or like that so

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.150 
desert woodland or like that so
you'd<00:04:16.870> think<00:04:16.900> that<00:04:17.500> would<00:04:17.620> be<00:04:17.799> going<00:04:17.980> to<00:04:18.040> be<00:04:18.130> a

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
you'd think that would be going to be a

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.180 
you'd think that would be going to be a
camera<00:04:18.580> of<00:04:18.670> the<00:04:18.790> main<00:04:18.940> body<00:04:19.150> which<00:04:19.390> is<00:04:19.420> and

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
camera of the main body which is and

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.219 
camera of the main body which is and
here's<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.430> gun<00:04:21.670> so<00:04:22.000> which<00:04:22.750> will<00:04:22.900> be<00:04:22.960> last

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
here's the gun so which will be last

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.600 
here's the gun so which will be last
texture

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
texture

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.980 
texture
color<00:04:25.379> gun<00:04:26.379> go<00:04:27.219> to<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.490> normal<00:04:27.969> add<00:04:28.240> the

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
color gun go to the normal add the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.800 
color gun go to the normal add the
normal<00:04:29.439> in<00:04:29.590> and<00:04:30.210> then<00:04:31.210> we<00:04:31.330> want<00:04:31.479> to<00:04:31.539> add<00:04:31.659> the

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
normal in and then we want to add the

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.839 
normal in and then we want to add the
specular<00:04:32.530> get<00:04:33.009> in<00:04:33.099> so<00:04:33.219> you<00:04:33.280> get<00:04:33.370> a<00:04:33.400> specular

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
specular get in so you get a specular

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:39.149 
specular get in so you get a specular
color<00:04:33.969> and<00:04:34.270> add<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.400> specular<00:04:36.400> in<00:04:36.780> so<00:04:37.780> that<00:04:38.159> is

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:39.159 
color and add the specular in so that is

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.290 
color and add the specular in so that is
our<00:04:39.460> model<00:04:39.849> and<00:04:40.629> that's<00:04:41.080> a<00:04:41.169> nice<00:04:41.349> dragon<00:04:41.889> fire

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
our model and that's a nice dragon fire

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.170 
our model and that's a nice dragon fire
but<00:04:43.300> again<00:04:43.569> if<00:04:43.810> you<00:04:43.960> wanted<00:04:44.259> 10<00:04:45.000> which<00:04:46.000> is<00:04:46.030> a

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
but again if you wanted 10 which is a

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.240 
but again if you wanted 10 which is a
different<00:04:48.509> different<00:04:49.650> light<00:04:50.650> sort<00:04:50.979> of<00:04:51.039> camera

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
different different light sort of camera

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.360 
different different light sort of camera
all<00:04:51.520> together<00:04:51.699> to<00:04:52.569> replace<00:04:52.870> it<00:04:52.900> with<00:04:53.080> that

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
all together to replace it with that

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.679 
all together to replace it with that
where<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.639> digital<00:04:55.030> texture<00:04:55.389> is<00:04:55.479> just

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:55.689 
where the digital texture is just

00:04:55.689 --> 00:05:00.029 
where the digital texture is just
replace<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:56.199> with<00:04:56.379> tan<00:04:57.099> and<00:04:58.590> then<00:04:59.590> it<00:04:59.830> goes

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
replace that with tan and then it goes

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.719 
replace that with tan and then it goes
into<00:05:00.099> one<00:05:00.669> of<00:05:00.759> these<00:05:01.560> quite<00:05:02.560> nice<00:05:02.710> so<00:05:03.580> that's

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
into one of these quite nice so that's

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.129 
into one of these quite nice so that's
basically<00:05:03.879> how<00:05:04.180> to<00:05:04.300> use<00:05:04.449> a<00:05:04.479> compressed<00:05:04.930> nater

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
basically how to use a compressed nater

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.640 
basically how to use a compressed nater
so<00:05:05.469> it<00:05:06.039> converts<00:05:06.460> dds<00:05:07.240> files<00:05:07.270> which<00:05:07.870> can't<00:05:08.349> go

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
so it converts dds files which can't go

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.189 
so it converts dds files which can't go
into<00:05:08.770> cinema<00:05:09.129> 4d<00:05:09.370> into<00:05:10.029> a<00:05:10.060> BMP<00:05:10.389> file<00:05:10.719> which<00:05:10.930> can

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
into cinema 4d into a BMP file which can

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:17.339 
into cinema 4d into a BMP file which can
so<00:05:11.560> that<00:05:13.409> sort<00:05:14.409> of<00:05:14.469> helps<00:05:14.740> Peter<00:05:15.279> you<00:05:15.520> know<00:05:16.349> get

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
so that sort of helps Peter you know get

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.209 
so that sort of helps Peter you know get
a<00:05:17.379> few<00:05:17.590> models<00:05:17.979> from<00:05:18.279> 10<00:05:18.699> garry's<00:05:19.120> mod<00:05:19.949> 3ds<00:05:20.949> max

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:21.219 
a few models from 10 garry's mod 3ds max
