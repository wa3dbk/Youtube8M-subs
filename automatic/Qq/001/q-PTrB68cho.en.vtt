for a good dose of food to recover from
that<00:00:17.820> weather<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.570> gets<00:00:18.690> cooler<00:00:18.990> at<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.380> time

that weather it gets cooler at that time
of<00:00:19.770> year<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.460> turf<00:00:20.640> can<00:00:20.820> better<00:00:21.090> utilize

you'll find on a fertilizer bag the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.569 
you'll find on a fertilizer bag the
first<00:00:37.170> number<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.860> represents<00:00:37.920> the

first number it represents the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.360 
first number it represents the
percentage<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.300> nitrogen<00:00:39.739> second<00:00:40.739> number<00:00:41.070> is

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
percentage of nitrogen second number is

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.430 
percentage of nitrogen second number is
the<00:00:41.550> percentage<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.149> phosphorous<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.020> the

the percentage of phosphorous and the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.139 
the percentage of phosphorous and the
third<00:00:43.649> number<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.430> percentage<00:00:44.910> of

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
third number is the percentage of

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.900 
third number is the percentage of
potassium<00:00:46.050> by<00:00:46.649> weight<00:00:46.950> within<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.489> bag

most<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.450> our<00:00:48.539> soils<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:49.050> Kansas<00:00:49.500> have

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
most of our soils in Kansas have

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.439 
most of our soils in Kansas have
adequate<00:00:50.070> amounts<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.430> phosphorus<00:00:51.000> and

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
adequate amounts of phosphorus and

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.930 
adequate amounts of phosphorus and
potassium<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.440> nitrogen<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:53.010> usually<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.699> one

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
potassium so nitrogen is usually the one

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.959 
potassium so nitrogen is usually the one
that<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.539> most<00:00:55.289> readily<00:00:55.649> needed<00:00:56.160> by<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.370> turf

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
that is most readily needed by the turf

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.639 
that is most readily needed by the turf
so<00:00:57.300> when<00:00:57.480> we're<00:00:57.629> looking<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.140> fertilizer

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
so when we're looking for a fertilizer

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.040 
so when we're looking for a fertilizer
for<00:00:59.070> our<00:00:59.160> lawns<00:00:59.489> it's<00:01:00.059> important<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.570> go<00:01:00.719> for

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
for our lawns it's important to go for

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.979 
for our lawns it's important to go for
the<00:01:01.289> largest<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.949> first<00:01:02.460> number<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.059> smaller
