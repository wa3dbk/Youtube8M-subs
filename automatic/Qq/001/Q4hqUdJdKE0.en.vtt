Adwords<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:15.809> let's<00:00:16.080> get<00:00:16.440> started

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
Adwords so let's get started

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.310 
Adwords so let's get started
the<00:00:17.520> first<00:00:17.850> question<00:00:18.240> comes<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.660> from<00:00:18.960> lien

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
the first question comes in from lien

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.010 
the first question comes in from lien
forests<00:00:19.920> who<00:00:20.130> asks<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.820> would<00:00:21.330> like<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.630> analyze

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
forests who asks I would like to analyze

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.960 
forests who asks I would like to analyze
why<00:00:22.230> competing<00:00:22.740> ads<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.279> same<00:00:23.519> ad<00:00:23.760> group

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
why competing ads in the same ad group

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.730 
why competing ads in the same ad group
have<00:00:24.180> very<00:00:24.449> different<00:00:24.720> average<00:00:25.199> cost<00:00:25.529> per

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
have very different average cost per

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.370 
have very different average cost per
clicks<00:00:25.980> how<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.789> do<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.060> great<00:00:27.380> question

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
clicks how can I do this great question

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.160 
clicks how can I do this great question
so<00:00:28.710> there's<00:00:29.369> not<00:00:29.550> going<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.730> be<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.060> great<00:00:30.960> way

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
so there's not going to be a great way

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.260 
so there's not going to be a great way
to<00:00:31.199> actually<00:00:31.529> analyze<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.700> breakdown<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
to actually analyze and breakdown the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.270 
to actually analyze and breakdown the
data<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.840> specifically<00:00:34.410> say<00:00:34.680> why<00:00:34.860> but<00:00:35.100> here

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
data to specifically say why but here

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.680 
data to specifically say why but here
are<00:00:35.399> some<00:00:35.460> examples<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.120> what<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.360> could<00:00:36.540> be

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
are some examples of what it could be

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.600 
are some examples of what it could be
essentially<00:00:37.620> when<00:00:37.739> someone<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.520> know

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
essentially when someone you know

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.690 
essentially when someone you know
searches<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> type<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.450> query<00:00:39.899> into<00:00:40.350> Google<00:00:40.700> and

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
searches a type of query into Google and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.190 
searches a type of query into Google and
ad<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.120> gonna<00:00:42.270> be<00:00:42.360> matched<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.050> most

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
ad is gonna be matched to that the most

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.020 
ad is gonna be matched to that the most
relevant<00:00:43.410> ad<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.190> very<00:00:44.340> possible<00:00:44.670> that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
relevant ad so it's very possible that

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.240 
relevant ad so it's very possible that
some<00:00:45.750> ads<00:00:45.989> are<00:00:46.200> being<00:00:46.230> matched<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.829> keywords

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
some ads are being matched to keywords

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.279 
some ads are being matched to keywords
that<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.940> higher<00:00:48.090> competition<00:00:48.539> level<00:00:48.960> or

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
that have a higher competition level or

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.740 
that have a higher competition level or
a<00:00:49.320> lower<00:00:49.530> competition<00:00:49.920> level<00:00:50.309> or<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.940> higher<00:00:51.449> or

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
a lower competition level or a higher or

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.630 
a lower competition level or a higher or
lower<00:00:51.780> quality<00:00:52.440> score<00:00:52.739> that's<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> lead

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
lower quality score that's going to lead

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.100 
lower quality score that's going to lead
to<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.789> different<00:00:53.969> cost<00:00:54.329> per<00:00:54.480> click<00:00:54.690> depending

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
to a different cost per click depending

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.020 
to a different cost per click depending
on<00:00:55.199> which<00:00:55.410> F<00:00:55.590> show<00:00:55.829> yeah<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.550> mean<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
on which F show yeah I mean you have a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.360 
on which F show yeah I mean you have a
bunch<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.449> ads<00:00:58.050> or<00:00:58.379> multiple<00:00:58.739> ads<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.129> an<00:00:59.219> ad

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
bunch of ads or multiple ads and an ad

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.470 
bunch of ads or multiple ads and an ad
group<00:00:59.579> first<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.910> all<00:00:59.969> that's<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.239> great

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
group first of all that's a great

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.510 
group first of all that's a great
strategy<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.050> compare<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.710> contrast<00:01:01.800> what's

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
strategy to compare and contrast what's

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.950 
strategy to compare and contrast what's
what's<00:01:03.000> working<00:01:03.210> best<00:01:03.329> for<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> same

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
what's working best for the same

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.950 
what's working best for the same
keywords<00:01:04.470> um<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.460> costing<00:01:06.119> average<00:01:06.600> cost<00:01:06.840> per

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
keywords um the costing average cost per

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.359 
keywords um the costing average cost per
click<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.229> important<00:01:07.830> that's<00:01:07.950> something

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
click is important that's something

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.859 
click is important that's something
that's<00:01:08.520> good<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.820> analyze<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.479> would<00:01:09.630> also

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
that's good to analyze I would also

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.469 
that's good to analyze I would also
focus<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.880> click-through<00:01:12.119> rates

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
focus on the click-through rates

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.480 
focus on the click-through rates
juxtaposed<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.619> compare<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.070> click-through

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
juxtaposed and compare the click-through

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.609 
juxtaposed and compare the click-through
rates<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.909> also<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.600> conversion<00:01:16.170> rates<00:01:16.409> as

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
rates and also the conversion rates as

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.859 
rates and also the conversion rates as
well<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.640> then<00:01:17.759> take<00:01:17.939> action<00:01:18.420> right<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.720> if

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
well and then take action right so if

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.630 
well and then take action right so if
one<00:01:19.110> ad<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.650> getting<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.009> better<00:01:20.159> click-through

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
one ad is getting a better click-through

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.310 
one ad is getting a better click-through
rate<00:01:20.759> than<00:01:20.909> another<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> same<00:01:21.720> set<00:01:22.200> of

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
rate than another for the same set of

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.899 
rate than another for the same set of
keywords<00:01:22.500> instead<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.310> pausing<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> one

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
keywords instead of pausing the one

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.969 
keywords instead of pausing the one
that's<00:01:24.090> performing<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:25.110> know<00:01:25.259> worse<00:01:25.619> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that's performing you know worse and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:26.990 
that's performing you know worse and
then<00:01:26.070> trying<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> figure<00:01:26.490> out<00:01:26.640> what<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.880> it

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
then trying to figure out what is it

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.399 
then trying to figure out what is it
about<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.390> first<00:01:27.689> ad<00:01:27.930> that's<00:01:28.140> that's

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
about that first ad that's that's

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.440 
about that first ad that's that's
performing<00:01:28.860> better<00:01:29.090> but<00:01:30.090> yeah<00:01:30.240> great

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
performing better but yeah great

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.330 
performing better but yeah great
question<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.079> also<00:01:31.350> great<00:01:31.619> strategy<00:01:32.130> using

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
question and also great strategy using

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.700 
question and also great strategy using
multiple<00:01:32.850> ads<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.240> an<00:01:33.360> ad<00:01:33.509> group<00:01:33.710> next

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
multiple ads of an ad group next

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.310 
multiple ads of an ad group next
