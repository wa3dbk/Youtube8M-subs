00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
scorecards to draw I mean a lot of

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.720 
scorecards to draw I mean a lot of
people<00:02:33.660> really<00:02:34.650> concern<00:02:35.010> about<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.370> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
people really concern about that the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.970 
people really concern about that the
draw<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.510> then<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.780> course<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.350> overruled<00:02:37.860> by

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
draw and then of course the overruled by

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.660 
draw and then of course the overruled by
the<00:02:38.040> 115-113<00:02:38.700> twice<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.720> mean<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.590> think<00:02:41.310> all<00:02:41.640> of

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
the 115-113 twice I mean I think all of

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.100 
the 115-113 twice I mean I think all of
us<00:02:42.180> at<00:02:42.390> ringside<00:02:42.600> probably<00:02:43.350> had<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.680> won<00:02:45.110> 1:17

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
us at ringside probably had it won 1:17

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.110 
us at ringside probably had it won 1:17
you<00:02:47.010> know<00:02:47.190> or<00:02:47.820> maybe<00:02:48.170> 1:16<00:02:49.170> for<00:02:49.920> four<00:02:50.280> for

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
you know or maybe 1:16 for four for

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.170 
you know or maybe 1:16 for four for
Lucas<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.990> didn't<00:02:52.770> see<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:52.980> as<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.130> really<00:02:53.940> close

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
Lucas I didn't see it as a really close

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.800 
Lucas I didn't see it as a really close
fight<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.780> saw<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.470> as<00:02:55.560> an<00:02:55.770> exciting

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
fight I saw it as an exciting

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.210 
fight I saw it as an exciting
action-packed<00:02:57.810> fight<00:02:58.320> but<00:02:58.590> not<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:58.830> really

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
action-packed fight but not a really

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.220 
action-packed fight but not a really
close<00:02:59.580> fight<00:02:59.850> I<00:02:59.910> think<00:03:00.300> Lucas<00:03:00.720> did<00:03:01.050> his<00:03:01.200> job

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
close fight I think Lucas did his job

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.780 
close fight I think Lucas did his job
and<00:03:01.620> took<00:03:02.340> care<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.490> business

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
and took care of business

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.550 
and took care of business
