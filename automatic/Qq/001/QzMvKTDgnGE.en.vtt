00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
rollouts when you're in the game what

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.230 
rollouts when you're in the game what
was<00:00:42.829> the<00:00:42.950> decision<00:00:43.220> to<00:00:43.550> do<00:00:43.730> that<00:00:43.910> we<00:00:44.090> didn't

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.240 
was the decision to do that we didn't

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.660 
was the decision to do that we didn't
want<00:00:44.300> to<00:00:44.450> bring<00:00:44.810> you<00:00:44.870> to<00:00:45.110> a<00:00:45.140> garage<00:00:45.860> screen<00:00:46.310> or

want to bring you to a garage screen or
a<00:00:46.700> pause<00:00:47.030> screen<00:00:47.420> or<00:00:47.900> overuse<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:49.100> map<00:00:49.280> screen

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
a pause screen or overuse the map screen

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.760 
a pause screen or overuse the map screen
so<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.030> player<00:00:50.210> can<00:00:50.239> bring<00:00:50.630> this<00:00:50.810> easy<00:00:51.500> drive

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
so the player can bring this easy drive

system up at any time and the game is
still<00:00:54.170> running<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:54.860> when<00:00:55.579> they<00:00:55.670> get<00:00:55.760> skilled

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
still running so when they get skilled

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.460 
still running so when they get skilled
at<00:00:56.239> it<00:00:56.329> they<00:00:56.450> can<00:00:56.630> do<00:00:56.750> it<00:00:56.899> whilst<00:00:57.230> they're

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470

thought it'd be kind of cool to control
a<00:01:19.549> lot<00:01:19.789> of<00:01:19.819> the<00:01:19.969> aspects<00:01:20.359> of<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.600> car<00:01:20.810> with

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
your voice and Kinect just seemed to be

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.109 
your voice and Kinect just seemed to be
a<00:01:23.869> really<00:01:24.200> nice<00:01:24.649> way<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:24.950> do<00:01:25.219> that<00:01:25.459> do<00:01:25.850> you<00:01:25.909> want

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
a really nice way to do that do you want

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
to just talk us through how this works

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:30.550 
to just talk us through how this works
sure<00:01:28.179> when<00:01:29.179> we<00:01:29.299> were<00:01:29.450> picking<00:01:29.869> stuff<00:01:30.259> to<00:01:30.409> do

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560

car - reinforced chassis which makes me
tougher<00:03:19.100> against<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.430> cop<00:03:19.609> and<00:03:19.850> they're

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
tougher against the cop and they're

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.340 
tougher against the cop and they're
chasing<00:03:20.299> me<00:03:20.359> so<00:03:20.720> in<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:20.870> way<00:03:20.959> you<00:03:21.019> can<00:03:21.230> actually

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
chasing me so in a way you can actually

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.170 
chasing me so in a way you can actually
eliminate<00:03:21.590> submenus<00:03:22.310> as<00:03:22.430> well<00:03:22.609> so<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.030> don't

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
eliminate submenus as well so you don't

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.629 
eliminate submenus as well so you don't
have<00:03:23.329> to<00:03:23.480> go<00:03:23.600> get<00:03:23.840> easy<00:03:24.049> Drive<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.739> then<00:03:24.889> tires

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
have to go get easy Drive and then tires

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.460 
have to go get easy Drive and then tires
know<00:03:26.329> who's<00:03:26.569> that<00:03:26.720> you<00:03:26.900> could<00:03:27.049> do<00:03:27.230> that<00:03:27.350> you

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
know who's that you could do that you

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.120 
know who's that you could do that you
could<00:03:27.500> say<00:03:27.859> if<00:03:28.100> you<00:03:28.220> just<00:03:28.370> say<00:03:28.519> tires<00:03:28.790> tires

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
could say if you just say tires tires

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.879 
could say if you just say tires tires
and<00:03:31.130> up<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.180> comes<00:03:32.329> that's<00:03:32.930> cool<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:33.680> then<00:03:33.799> you

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
and up it comes that's cool so then you

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:35.349 
and up it comes that's cool so then you
can<00:03:34.010> pick<00:03:34.130> you<00:03:34.280> different<00:03:34.579> tire<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.120> then<00:03:35.209> you

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
can pick you different tire and then you

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.530 
can pick you different tire and then you
can<00:03:35.510> say<00:03:35.690> drive

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.630

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
Connect you have to be careful about

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.809 
Connect you have to be careful about
which<00:03:42.439> words<00:03:42.769> you<00:03:42.920> choose<00:03:43.189> and<00:03:43.549> did<00:03:43.700> that

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.729 
of terms that appear so when we bring a
easy<00:03:57.920> drive<00:03:58.959> we<00:03:59.959> have<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.139> look<00:04:00.319> our<00:04:00.469> little

have<00:04:05.989> connect<00:04:06.319> so<00:04:07.040> Chris<00:04:07.249> do<00:04:07.340> you<00:04:07.400> think<00:04:07.579> using

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
have connect so Chris do you think using

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.399 
have connect so Chris do you think using
connects<00:04:08.090> going<00:04:08.209> to<00:04:08.269> help<00:04:08.450> my<00:04:08.540> gameplay<00:04:08.900> yeah

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
connects going to help my gameplay yeah

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:10.839 
connects going to help my gameplay yeah
I<00:04:09.439> think<00:04:09.590> I<00:04:09.799> think<00:04:09.829> you'll<00:04:10.129> get<00:04:10.280> more<00:04:10.489> use<00:04:10.700> of

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
I think I think you'll get more use of

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.399 
I think I think you'll get more use of
using<00:04:11.030> easy<00:04:11.239> drive<00:04:11.569> and<00:04:11.840> then<00:04:12.079> that<00:04:12.260> will<00:04:12.379> help

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
using easy drive and then that will help

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.619 
using easy drive and then that will help
you<00:04:12.680> go<00:04:12.889> faster<00:04:13.129> jump<00:04:13.669> further<00:04:13.909> win<00:04:14.480> more

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
you go faster jump further win more

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.930 
you go faster jump further win more
races<00:04:15.019> set<00:04:15.290> faster<00:04:15.590> times<00:04:15.829> so<00:04:16.459> yeah<00:04:16.759> I<00:04:16.789> think

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
races set faster times so yeah I think

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.490 
races set faster times so yeah I think
generally<00:04:17.509> it<00:04:17.570> is<00:04:17.630> you<00:04:17.959> know<00:04:18.079> that<00:04:18.349> would

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
generally it is you know that would

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:29.979 
generally it is you know that would
connect<00:04:24.820> better<00:04:25.820> with<00:04:25.970> Kinect<00:04:26.479> for<00:04:26.690> Xbox<00:04:26.979> 360
