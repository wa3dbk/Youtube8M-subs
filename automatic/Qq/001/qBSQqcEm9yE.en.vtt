here you'll see why and as you analyze

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.730

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
store a variation you can choose it

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.100

with it and obviously if someone
analyzes<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.690> more<00:00:52.020> deeply<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.949> future<00:00:53.399> in

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
analyzes it more deeply in a future in

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.970 
analyzes it more deeply in a future in
the<00:00:53.940> future<00:00:53.969> then<00:00:54.809> their<00:00:55.140> name<00:00:55.379> will<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.739> put

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the future then their name will be put

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.580 
the future then their name will be put
in<00:00:56.280> your<00:00:56.489> place<00:00:56.899> you<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.050> see<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.260> three

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
in your place you can see that three

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.260 
in your place you can see that three
variations<00:00:58.980> are<00:00:59.370> possible<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.789> every

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
variations are possible for every

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.860 
variations are possible for every
position<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.430> whoever<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:03.120> analyze<00:01:03.600> that

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
position and whoever and as analyze that

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.539 
position and whoever and as analyze that
position<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.439> most<00:01:04.650> deeply<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.100> at<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> top

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
position the most deeply is at the top

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.870 
position the most deeply is at the top
then<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.390> get<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> next<00:01:06.990> two<00:01:07.170> after<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.880> you

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
then you get the next two after that you

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.520 
then you get the next two after that you
can<00:01:09.000> also<00:01:09.119> see<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.510> each<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:10.110> those<00:01:10.229> have

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
can also see that each of those have

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.109 
can also see that each of those have
been<00:01:10.650> awarded<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.310> certain<00:01:11.610> amount<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.880> points

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
been awarded a certain amount of points

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.660 
been awarded a certain amount of points
that's<00:01:13.080> dependent<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.860> how<00:01:14.220> deep<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that's dependent on how deep the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.149 
that's dependent on how deep the
analysis<00:01:15.119> has<00:01:15.299> been<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.840> how<00:01:16.680> fast<00:01:16.979> your

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
analysis has been so how fast your

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.039 
analysis has been so how fast your
machine<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.850> how<00:01:18.119> long<00:01:18.450> you've<00:01:18.689> let<00:01:18.900> it

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
machine is and how long you've let it

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.219 
machine is and how long you've let it
analyzed<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.090> but<00:01:21.090> there's<00:01:21.420> an<00:01:21.600> interesting

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
analyzed and but there's an interesting

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.010 
analyzed and but there's an interesting
feature<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.330> position<00:01:24.330> hasn't<00:01:24.689> been

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
feature if the position hasn't been

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.070 
feature if the position hasn't been
analyzed<00:01:25.560> yet<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.189> new<00:01:26.460> position<00:01:27.080> you

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
analyzed yet so it's a new position you

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.960 
analyzed yet so it's a new position you
analyze<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> reasonable<00:01:29.790> a

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
analyze it to to a reasonable a

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.870 
analyze it to to a reasonable a
reasonable<00:01:30.720> depth<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:32.220> server<00:01:32.610> will

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
reasonable depth the server will

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.749 
reasonable depth the server will
consider<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:34.049> basically

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
consider that you have basically

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.620 
consider that you have basically
discovered<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.180> position<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:38.240> which<00:01:39.240> means

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
discovered that position and which means

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.539 
discovered that position and which means
that<00:01:39.810> your<00:01:40.170> name<00:01:40.380> will<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.680> pretty<00:01:41.430> much

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
that your name will be pretty much

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.389 
that your name will be pretty much
associated<00:01:42.119> with<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.899> position<00:01:43.110> forever<00:01:43.649> so

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
associated with that position forever so

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.370 
associated with that position forever so
even<00:01:44.700> if<00:01:44.790> other<00:01:44.970> users<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.750> future<00:01:46.110> do

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
even if other users in the future do

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.630 
even if other users in the future do
make<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> deeper<00:01:47.040> analysis<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:49.399> like<00:01:50.399> here

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
make a deeper analysis and like here

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.429 
make a deeper analysis and like here
where<00:01:50.820> your<00:01:50.970> name<00:01:51.240> would<00:01:51.540> drop<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.200> off

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
where your name would drop on the off

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.929 
where your name would drop on the off
the<00:01:52.649> list<00:01:52.890> if<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.549> were<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> person

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the list if you were the person

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.520 
the list if you were the person
designated<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:55.049> discovered<00:01:55.380> that

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
designated to have discovered that

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.730 
designated to have discovered that
position<00:01:56.189> then<00:01:57.000> your<00:01:57.509> name<00:01:57.780> will<00:01:58.079> always<00:01:58.110> be

position then your name will always be

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.969 
position then your name will always be
associated<00:01:59.310> with<00:01:59.640> it<00:02:00.590> now<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.649> point<00:02:01.829> of

associated with it now the point of

this list the scores will be a lot
higher<00:02:33.420> as<00:02:33.750> more<00:02:34.650> people<00:02:34.860> at<00:02:35.100> analyzing

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
higher as more people at analyzing

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.430 
higher as more people at analyzing
they'll<00:02:35.760> get<00:02:35.940> more<00:02:36.150> points<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.720> they'll<00:02:37.350> be

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
they'll get more points and they'll be

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.979 
they'll get more points and they'll be
