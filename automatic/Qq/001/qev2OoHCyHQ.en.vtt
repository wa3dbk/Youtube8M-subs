originally<00:00:07.290> going<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.470> review<00:00:07.799> these

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
originally going to review these

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.280 
originally going to review these
separately<00:00:08.610> but<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.240> came<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.570> find<00:00:09.809> out<00:00:09.990> that

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
separately but I came to find out that

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.350 
separately but I came to find out that
they<00:00:10.469> actually<00:00:10.710> are<00:00:11.130> pretty<00:00:11.880> much<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.330> same

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
they actually are pretty much the same

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.680 
they actually are pretty much the same
thing<00:00:12.840> only<00:00:13.139> with<00:00:13.440> opposing<00:00:14.009> factions<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:15.299> I

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
thing only with opposing factions so I

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.180 
thing only with opposing factions so I
decided<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.199> bundle<00:00:16.590> this<00:00:16.710> review<00:00:17.070> together

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
decided to bundle this review together

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.560 
decided to bundle this review together
and<00:00:17.730> give<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.060> an<00:00:18.150> overall<00:00:18.390> score<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.869> both<00:00:19.230> so

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
and give you an overall score of both so

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.609 
and give you an overall score of both so
I'm<00:00:21.570> not<00:00:21.689> going<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.930> talk<00:00:22.140> about<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
I'm not going to talk about the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.380 
I'm not going to talk about the
presentation<00:00:23.400> because<00:00:23.640> that's<00:00:23.820> literally

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
presentation because that's literally

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.990 
presentation because that's literally
the<00:00:24.660> same<00:00:24.900> as<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.260> was<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:26.250> original<00:00:26.279> King

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the same as it was in the original King

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.060 
the same as it was in the original King
Arthur<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.269> role-playing<00:00:27.480> war<00:00:27.900> game<00:00:28.109> the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
Arthur the role-playing war game the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.890 
Arthur the role-playing war game the
difference<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.550> they<00:00:29.730> added<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.359> little<00:00:30.779> bit

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
difference is they added in a little bit

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.260 
difference is they added in a little bit
of<00:00:31.019> new<00:00:31.140> music<00:00:31.590> for<00:00:31.859> each<00:00:32.160> faction<00:00:32.880> but<00:00:33.090> it's

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
of new music for each faction but it's

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.590 
of new music for each faction but it's
really<00:00:33.480> nothing<00:00:34.230> that's<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.890> noteworthy<00:00:35.600> in

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
really nothing that's that noteworthy in

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.790 
really nothing that's that noteworthy in
fact<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.960> think<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.230> music<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.500> actually<00:00:37.770> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
fact I think the music is actually a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.459 
fact I think the music is actually a
little<00:00:38.010> worse<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.809> Druids<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
little worse and that the Druids and the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.200 
little worse and that the Druids and the
Saxons<00:00:40.980> than<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> original<00:00:41.820> game

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
Saxons than it is in the original game

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.990 
Saxons than it is in the original game
so<00:00:42.989> they<00:00:43.860> really<00:00:44.100> didn't<00:00:44.340> change<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.940> much

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
so they really didn't change that much

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.470 
so they really didn't change that much
but<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.440> terms<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> presentation<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:48.059> I'm

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
but in terms of the presentation so I'm

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.630 
but in terms of the presentation so I'm
just<00:00:48.629> gonna<00:00:48.750> go<00:00:48.899> straight<00:00:48.989> into<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> gameplay

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
just gonna go straight into the gameplay

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.889 
just gonna go straight into the gameplay
now<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.700> Saxons<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.390> Druids<00:00:51.600> are

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
now the Saxons and the Druids are

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.290 
now the Saxons and the Druids are
basically<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:52.920> adding<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.640> two<00:00:53.850> separate

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
basically just adding in two separate

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.119 
basically just adding in two separate
campaigns<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.680> kind<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
campaigns that really have kind of the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.939 
campaigns that really have kind of the
same<00:00:56.309> effect<00:00:56.899> they<00:00:57.899> added<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.379> ability<00:00:58.920> to

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
same effect they added in the ability to

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.830 
same effect they added in the ability to
select<00:00:59.370> your<00:00:59.579> own<00:00:59.640> victory<00:01:00.059> conditions<00:01:00.600> which

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
select your own victory conditions which

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.240 
select your own victory conditions which
is<00:01:01.050> basically<00:01:01.379> like<00:01:01.649> do<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.859> want<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.100> control

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
is basically like do you want to control

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.340 
is basically like do you want to control
this<00:01:02.460> many<00:01:02.699> fiefdom<00:01:03.000> 's<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.899> want<00:01:04.140> to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
this many fiefdom 's you want to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.469 
this many fiefdom 's you want to
annihilate<00:01:05.129> your<00:01:05.430> enemies<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:06.030> want<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.299> do

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
annihilate your enemies you want to do

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.240 
annihilate your enemies you want to do
this<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.229> other<00:01:07.290> thing<00:01:07.470> there<00:01:08.100> are

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
this that and the other thing there are

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.520 
this that and the other thing there are
actually<00:01:08.580> several<00:01:08.930> options<00:01:09.930> available<00:01:10.049> for

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
actually several options available for

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.080 
actually several options available for
your<00:01:10.650> victory<00:01:11.189> conditions<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:11.939> actually

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
your victory conditions so it's actually

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.969 
your victory conditions so it's actually
pretty<00:01:12.299> interesting<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.960> see<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.560> it

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
pretty interesting to see that and it

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.530 
pretty interesting to see that and it
does<00:01:14.130> provide<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.549> little<00:01:14.760> more<00:01:14.880> variety<00:01:15.119> than

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
does provide a little more variety than

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.570 
does provide a little more variety than
just<00:01:16.200> following<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> storyline<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.460> you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
just following the storyline like you

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.960 
just following the storyline like you
did<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.150> original<00:01:18.540> game<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.939> both<00:01:20.939> of

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
did in the original game and both of

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.390 
did in the original game and both of
these<00:01:21.180> expansions<00:01:21.990> do<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.950> difference

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
these expansions do that the difference

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.820 
these expansions do that the difference
between<00:01:23.549> them<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.180> with<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.350> Saxons

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
between them is that with the Saxons

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.800 
between them is that with the Saxons
obviously<00:01:26.400> you're<00:01:26.670> playing<00:01:26.939> as<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.360> Saxons

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
obviously you're playing as the Saxons

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.300 
obviously you're playing as the Saxons
and<00:01:27.930> with<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> Druids<00:01:28.770> you're<00:01:28.950> playing<00:01:29.159> as

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
and with the Druids you're playing as

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.710 
and with the Druids you're playing as
the<00:01:29.430> Druids<00:01:29.759> which<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.060> means<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.420> start<00:01:30.659> in

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
the Druids which it means you start in

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.069 
the Druids which it means you start in
Wales<00:01:31.759> so<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.150> start<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.930> two

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
Wales so and you start to the two

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.109 
Wales so and you start to the two
opposite<00:01:34.439> ends<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> map<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.280> depending

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
opposite ends of the map and depending

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.940 
opposite ends of the map and depending
on<00:01:36.210> which<00:01:36.420> one<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.659> choose<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.470> Saxons<00:01:37.799> will

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
on which one you choose the Saxons will

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.429 
on which one you choose the Saxons will
obviously<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.520> Christian<00:01:38.880> units<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.689> Druids

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
obviously the Christian units the Druids

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.810 
obviously the Christian units the Druids
are<00:01:40.530> obviously<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.040> old<00:01:41.250> faith<00:01:41.430> units<00:01:41.759> and

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
are obviously the old faith units and

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.249 
are obviously the old faith units and
they<00:01:44.820> added<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.299> couple<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.689> new<00:01:45.810> units

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
they added in a couple of new units

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.780 
they added in a couple of new units
maybe<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.590> couple<00:01:46.799> new<00:01:46.979> powers<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.549> such<00:01:47.670> like

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
maybe a couple new powers and such like

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.660 
maybe a couple new powers and such like
that<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.509> problem<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.140> had<00:01:49.560> with<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.040> was<00:01:50.189> that

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
that the problem I had with it was that

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.440 
that the problem I had with it was that
they<00:01:50.970> didn't<00:01:51.420> really<00:01:51.720> do<00:01:51.990> enough<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:54.149> sealy

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
they didn't really do enough the sealy

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.440 
they didn't really do enough the sealy
units<00:01:54.990> are<00:01:55.259> still<00:01:55.590> incredibly<00:01:56.490> weak<00:01:56.850> compared

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
units are still incredibly weak compared

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.340 
units are still incredibly weak compared
to<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.689> christian<00:01:58.079> units<00:01:58.409> at<00:01:58.890> least<00:01:59.189> the<00:02:00.350> say

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
to the christian units at least the say

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.319 
to the christian units at least the say
for<00:02:01.530> instance<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.950> send<00:02:02.790> your<00:02:02.880> army<00:02:03.210> of

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
for instance you send your army of

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.050 
for instance you send your army of
Saxons<00:02:03.840> out<00:02:04.049> they<00:02:04.680> will<00:02:04.829> steamroll<00:02:05.399> pretty

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
Saxons out they will steamroll pretty

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.410 
Saxons out they will steamroll pretty
much<00:02:06.270> everything

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
much everything

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.900 
much everything
um<00:02:07.869> fairly<00:02:08.500> early<00:02:08.649> on<00:02:08.830> even<00:02:09.160> I<00:02:09.399> mean<00:02:09.490> those

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
um fairly early on even I mean those

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.690 
um fairly early on even I mean those
units<00:02:10.270> are<00:02:10.560> ridiculously<00:02:11.560> powerful<00:02:11.800> whereas

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
units are ridiculously powerful whereas

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.699 
units are ridiculously powerful whereas
with<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.150> old<00:02:13.180> fate<00:02:13.660> units<00:02:14.020> you're<00:02:14.380> stuck

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
with the old fate units you're stuck

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.770 
with the old fate units you're stuck
with<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.130> really<00:02:15.459> crappy<00:02:15.790> stuff<00:02:16.209> until<00:02:16.630> you

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
with the really crappy stuff until you

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.370 
with the really crappy stuff until you
get<00:02:17.080> actually<00:02:17.709> see<00:02:18.280> Lee<00:02:18.489> or<00:02:18.670> uncie<00:02:19.180> li<00:02:19.380> units

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
get actually see Lee or uncie li units

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.140 
get actually see Lee or uncie li units
and<00:02:22.349> so<00:02:23.349> there's<00:02:23.770> still<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.040> massive<00:02:24.790> power

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
and so there's still that massive power

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.510 
and so there's still that massive power
gap<00:02:25.569> between<00:02:25.810> them<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.620> Saxons<00:02:27.069> are<00:02:27.160> still

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
gap between them the Saxons are still

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.699 
gap between them the Saxons are still
the<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.209> Christian<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.690> means<00:02:28.870> are<00:02:29.050> still

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
the the Christian that means are still

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.130 
the the Christian that means are still
ungodly<00:02:30.370> overpowered<00:02:31.060> compared<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.989> old

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
ungodly overpowered compared to the old

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.090 
ungodly overpowered compared to the old
faith<00:02:32.410> units<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:33.480> they<00:02:34.480> made<00:02:34.690> it

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
faith units so they made it

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.790 
faith units so they made it
unnecessarily<00:02:36.100> difficult<00:02:36.510> for<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.930> druids

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
unnecessarily difficult for the druids

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.000 
unnecessarily difficult for the druids
campaign<00:02:40.170> unless<00:02:41.170> you're<00:02:41.380> really<00:02:41.709> good<00:02:41.890> at

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
campaign unless you're really good at

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.620 
campaign unless you're really good at
playing<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.340> old<00:02:42.459> faith<00:02:42.700> which<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.120> pretty

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
playing the old faith which is pretty

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.280 
playing the old faith which is pretty
brutally<00:02:44.230> difficult<00:02:44.440> in<00:02:44.830> this<00:02:44.980> game<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.810> it's

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
brutally difficult in this game so it's

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.039 
brutally difficult in this game so it's
just<00:02:47.769> crazy<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.400> see<00:02:48.610> that<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.030> they<00:02:50.019> really

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
just crazy to see that the they really

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.259 
just crazy to see that the they really
didn't<00:02:50.620> fix<00:02:50.920> any<00:02:51.130> of<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.340> balancing<00:02:51.850> problems

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
didn't fix any of the balancing problems

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.550 
didn't fix any of the balancing problems
that<00:02:52.390> they<00:02:52.510> had<00:02:52.690> in<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.930> original<00:02:52.989> game<00:02:53.350> and

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
that they had in the original game and

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.059 
that they had in the original game and
that<00:02:54.040> just<00:02:54.220> bothered<00:02:54.640> me<00:02:54.819> and<00:02:56.069> especially

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
that just bothered me and especially

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.740 
that just bothered me and especially
since<00:02:57.489> that's<00:02:57.700> really<00:02:57.760> all<00:02:58.120> they<00:02:58.299> did<00:02:58.569> they

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
since that's really all they did they

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.330 
since that's really all they did they
added<00:02:59.140> in<00:02:59.260> new<00:02:59.410> units<00:02:59.799> they<00:02:59.950> added<00:03:00.220> in<00:03:00.280> a

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
added in new units they added in a

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.220 
added in new units they added in a
couple<00:03:00.580> new<00:03:00.670> powers<00:03:01.000> they<00:03:01.450> changed<00:03:02.140> the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
couple new powers they changed the

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.370 
couple new powers they changed the
victory<00:03:02.530> conditions<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.280> they<00:03:04.180> set<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.600> up<00:03:04.750> to

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
victory conditions and they set it up to

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.259 
victory conditions and they set it up to
play<00:03:06.010> as<00:03:06.190> either<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.489> Saxons<00:03:06.940> of<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.060> Druids

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
play as either the Saxons of the Druids

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.930 
play as either the Saxons of the Druids

up I'm just randomly they are different
for<00:03:12.609> each<00:03:12.670> faction<00:03:13.030> though<00:03:13.390> so<00:03:13.630> that's<00:03:13.810> nice

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
for each faction though so that's nice

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.190 
for each faction though so that's nice

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
you still get the semis storyline it's

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.509 
you still get the semis storyline it's
really<00:03:17.380> not<00:03:17.470> much<00:03:17.590> of<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:17.799> storyline<00:03:18.100> it's<00:03:18.340> kind

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
really not much of a storyline it's kind

problems from the original game so
unless<00:03:39.820> you<00:03:40.030> really<00:03:40.060> liked<00:03:41.070> King<00:03:42.070> Arthur<00:03:42.310> the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
unless you really liked King Arthur the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.800 
unless you really liked King Arthur the
role-playing<00:03:42.579> war<00:03:42.940> game<00:03:43.120> I<00:03:43.269> really<00:03:43.600> can't

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
role-playing war game I really can't

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.530 
role-playing war game I really can't
suggest<00:03:44.170> getting<00:03:44.410> these<00:03:44.850> that<00:03:45.850> they<00:03:46.000> really

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
suggest getting these that they really

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.449 
suggest getting these that they really
don't<00:03:46.750> add<00:03:46.989> much<00:03:47.320> to<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.680> game<00:03:47.829> in<00:03:48.070> fact<00:03:48.220> they

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
don't add much to the game in fact they

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.069 
don't add much to the game in fact they
almost<00:03:48.910> take<00:03:49.180> away<00:03:49.510> from<00:03:49.780> it

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
almost take away from it

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.699 
almost take away from it
by<00:03:50.530> saying<00:03:51.810> we're<00:03:52.810> gonna<00:03:52.900> charge<00:03:53.260> you<00:03:53.470> for

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
by saying we're gonna charge you for

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.009 
by saying we're gonna charge you for
this<00:03:53.829> extra<00:03:54.730> stuff<00:03:54.970> that<00:03:55.030> really<00:03:55.390> isn't<00:03:55.840> that

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
this extra stuff that really isn't that

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.900 
this extra stuff that really isn't that
extra<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:56.650> she<00:03:57.069> probably<00:03:57.280> should<00:03:57.640> have<00:03:57.730> been

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
extra and she probably should have been

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.160 
extra and she probably should have been
in<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.090> game<00:03:58.269> to<00:03:58.420> begin<00:03:58.540> with

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
in the game to begin with

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.340 
in the game to begin with
so<00:03:59.709> it's<00:04:00.640> a<00:04:00.760> little<00:04:01.000> just<00:04:01.510> depressing<00:04:02.079> to<00:04:02.170> play

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
so it's a little just depressing to play

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.879 
so it's a little just depressing to play
these<00:04:02.500> games<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.970> two<00:04:04.120> expansion<00:04:04.750> packs

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
these games the the two expansion packs

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.890 
these games the the two expansion packs
but<00:04:05.889> especially<00:04:06.850> compared<00:04:07.359> to<00:04:07.420> the<00:04:07.480> original

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
but especially compared to the original

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.720 
but especially compared to the original
game<00:04:08.049> which<00:04:08.230> they<00:04:08.950> clearly<00:04:09.190> put<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.489> lot<00:04:09.639> of

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
game which they clearly put a lot of

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.520 
game which they clearly put a lot of
effort<00:04:09.940> into<00:04:10.090> but<00:04:10.389> just<00:04:10.660> went<00:04:10.900> wrong<00:04:11.109> on<00:04:11.260> a<00:04:11.319> few

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
effort into but just went wrong on a few

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.680 
effort into but just went wrong on a few
places<00:04:11.799> and<00:04:12.069> they<00:04:12.579> could<00:04:12.790> have<00:04:12.910> really<00:04:13.269> fixed

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
places and they could have really fixed

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.509 
places and they could have really fixed
it<00:04:13.810> in<00:04:13.930> these<00:04:14.049> expansions<00:04:14.620> but<00:04:14.709> they<00:04:15.010> didn't

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
it in these expansions but they didn't

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.279 
it in these expansions but they didn't
and<00:04:15.700> that<00:04:16.150> was<00:04:16.299> my<00:04:16.450> main<00:04:16.630> problem<00:04:16.900> with<00:04:17.140> them

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
and that was my main problem with them

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.699 
and that was my main problem with them
they<00:04:17.470> didn't<00:04:17.859> fix<00:04:18.159> the<00:04:18.430> problems<00:04:18.849> that<00:04:18.940> I<00:04:19.060> had

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
they didn't fix the problems that I had

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.499 
they didn't fix the problems that I had
original<00:04:20.039> game<00:04:20.190> so<00:04:20.819> hopefully<00:04:21.209> they'll<00:04:21.389> do

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:21.509 
original game so hopefully they'll do

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:23.150 
original game so hopefully they'll do
that<00:04:21.630> in<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.840> sequel<00:04:22.229> that<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.650> really<00:04:22.919> can't

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
that in the sequel that I really can't

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.520 
that in the sequel that I really can't
recommend<00:04:23.430> these<00:04:23.850> expansion<00:04:24.810> packs<00:04:25.020> I<00:04:25.229> give

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
recommend these expansion packs I give

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.389 
recommend these expansion packs I give
them<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.740> 2<00:04:25.889> out<00:04:26.039> of<00:04:26.069> 5<00:04:26.190> thanks<00:04:26.910> for<00:04:27.090> watching
