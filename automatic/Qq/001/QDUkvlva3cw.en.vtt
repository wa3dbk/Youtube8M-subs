is going to be something a little bit

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.100 
is going to be something a little bit
different<00:00:08.760> it's<00:00:09.330> not<00:00:09.389> going<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.719> be<00:00:09.870> a

different it's not going to be a

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.140 
different it's not going to be a
difficult<00:00:10.559> dance<00:00:10.889> eternal<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.490> do<00:00:11.580> I

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
difficult dance eternal that I do I

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.709 
difficult dance eternal that I do I
thought<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.510> would<00:00:12.780> do<00:00:12.900> something<00:00:14.180> whatever<00:00:15.180> so

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719

we're<00:00:16.139> doing<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.950> moonwalk<00:00:17.490> by<00:00:18.090> Michael

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.150 
we're doing the moonwalk by Michael
Jackson<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.990> basic<00:00:19.410> how-to

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
Jackson it's a basic how-to

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.790 
Jackson it's a basic how-to
probably<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.240> most<00:00:21.420> simplest<00:00:22.050> basic<00:00:22.530> way<00:00:22.770> to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
probably the most simplest basic way to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.220 
probably the most simplest basic way to
teach<00:00:23.190> it<00:00:23.450> it's<00:00:24.450> really<00:00:24.750> not<00:00:24.870> that<00:00:24.930> difficult

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
teach it it's really not that difficult

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.910 
teach it it's really not that difficult
it's<00:00:25.680> more<00:00:26.040> and<00:00:26.310> how<00:00:26.520> you<00:00:26.580> execute<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.800> to<00:00:28.800> make

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
it's more and how you execute it to make

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.370 
it's more and how you execute it to make
it<00:00:29.070> really<00:00:29.280> smooth<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.110> Alban<00:00:31.110> Michael

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
it really smooth and Alban Michael

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.380 
it really smooth and Alban Michael
Jackson<00:00:31.680> touch<00:00:31.860> to<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.879> video<00:00:33.239> which

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
Jackson touch to it so this video which

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.600 
Jackson touch to it so this video which
is<00:00:33.450> going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.690> be<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.899> basic<00:00:34.410> how-to<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:35.399> how

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
is going to be the basic how-to of how

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.970 
is going to be the basic how-to of how
to<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.879> the<00:00:36.030> moonwalk<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.690> then<00:00:37.140> you're<00:00:37.950> on

to do front toe heel comes down back
foot<00:01:30.510> heel<00:01:31.290> comes<00:01:31.560> up<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.310> we're<00:01:32.430> switching

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
foot heel comes up so we're switching

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.020 
foot heel comes up so we're switching
now<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.830> where<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.159> get<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.520> little

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
now this is like where you get a little

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.200 
now this is like where you get a little
bit<00:01:36.270> confused<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.799> now<00:01:38.010> need<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.280> slide<00:01:38.670> your

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
bit confused you now need to slide your

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.679 
bit confused you now need to slide your
left<00:01:39.540> foot<00:01:39.720> your<00:01:40.680> foot<00:01:40.710> foot<00:01:41.280> back<00:01:42.060> behind<00:01:42.270> you

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
left foot your foot foot back behind you

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.510 
left foot your foot foot back behind you
so<00:01:43.320> you're<00:01:43.560> always<00:01:43.710> going<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.010> end<00:01:44.159> up<00:01:44.340> with<00:01:44.490> a

to drive it back we're going to do

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.289 
to drive it back we're going to do
switch<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.869> heel<00:02:01.439> comes<00:02:01.650> down<00:02:01.880> heel<00:02:02.880> comes<00:02:03.150> up

that foot back behind so basically it's

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.830 
that foot back behind so basically it's
just<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.349> series<00:02:10.769> of<00:02:10.799> popping<00:02:11.640> your<00:02:12.180> feet<00:02:12.569> and

that flip that flat or in front is
going<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.129> slide<00:02:17.370> back<00:02:17.959> so<00:02:19.159> one<00:02:20.159> more<00:02:20.340> time

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
going to slide back so one more time

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.009 
going to slide back so one more time
feet<00:02:21.450> together

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
feet together

now<00:02:26.580> we're<00:02:26.730> going<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:26.879> switch<00:02:27.590> slide<00:02:28.590> that

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
now we're going to switch slide that

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
slide switch slot now tip think about

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.500 
slide switch slot now tip think about
sliding<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:44.459> foot<00:02:44.730> back<00:02:44.940> would<00:02:45.209> think<00:02:45.420> about

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
sliding that foot back would think about

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.509 
sliding that foot back would think about
leading<00:02:46.079> with<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.769> back<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.129> your<00:02:47.280> feet<00:02:47.370> you

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
leading with the back of your feet you

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.690 
leading with the back of your feet you
almost<00:02:47.819> want<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.090> hyperextend<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.260> way

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
almost want to hyperextend that way

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.830 
almost want to hyperextend that way
because<00:02:50.700> that's<00:02:50.849> kind<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.209> how<00:02:51.269> Michael<00:02:51.660> did

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
because that's kind of how Michael did

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.110 
because that's kind of how Michael did
it<00:02:51.870> so<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.260> really<00:02:52.590> make<00:02:52.829> it<00:02:52.860> smooth

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
it so to really make it smooth

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.229 
it so to really make it smooth
think<00:02:55.019> about<00:02:55.230> leading<00:02:55.769> with<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.730> back<00:02:56.940> of

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
think about leading with the back of

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.140 
think about leading with the back of
your<00:02:57.480> knee<00:02:57.660> as<00:02:57.930> weird<00:02:58.680> as<00:02:58.769> that<00:02:58.799> sounds<00:02:59.160> really

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
your knee as weird as that sounds really

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.009 
your knee as weird as that sounds really
get<00:03:00.269> it<00:03:00.359> straight<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:02.150> now<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.599> just<00:03:03.750> need<00:03:03.810> to

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
get it straight and now you just need to

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.080 
get it straight and now you just need to
work<00:03:04.260> on<00:03:04.500> putting<00:03:05.160> all<00:03:05.340> together<00:03:05.459> so<00:03:05.849> this<00:03:05.970> is

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
work on putting all together so this is

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.030 
work on putting all together so this is
what<00:03:06.239> really<00:03:06.420> takes<00:03:06.750> time<00:03:06.989> is<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.739> make<00:03:07.769> it

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
what really takes time is to make it

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.720 
what really takes time is to make it
fluid<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:09.000> go<00:03:09.150> as<00:03:09.329> smooth<00:03:09.690> as<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:12.180> can<00:03:13.489> so<00:03:14.489> I

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
fluid and go as smooth as you can so I

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.729
