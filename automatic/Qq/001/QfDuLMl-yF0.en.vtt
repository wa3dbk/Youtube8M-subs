line<00:00:50.559> ends<00:00:51.100> up<00:00:51.219> right<00:00:51.579> on<00:00:51.850> the<00:00:52.000> fold<00:00:52.210> line<00:00:53.190> so

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
line ends up right on the fold line so

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.799 
line ends up right on the fold line so
you're<00:00:54.399> bringing<00:00:54.730> your<00:00:54.820> fabric<00:00:55.210> wrong<00:00:55.449> side

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
you're bringing your fabric wrong side

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.020 
you're bringing your fabric wrong side
to<00:00:55.989> wrong<00:00:56.230> side<00:00:56.500> underneath<00:00:57.039> and<00:00:57.340> you<00:00:57.640> can<00:00:57.820> see

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
to wrong side underneath and you can see

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.849 
to wrong side underneath and you can see
my<00:00:58.210> line<00:00:58.449> here<00:00:58.809> is<00:00:58.960> right<00:00:59.199> on<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.410> fold<00:00:59.649> line

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
my line here is right on the fold line

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.540 
my line here is right on the fold line
and<00:01:00.100> I'm<00:01:00.850> going<00:01:00.969> to<00:01:01.000> go<00:01:01.149> ahead<00:01:01.269> and<00:01:02.039> pin<00:01:03.039> this

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
and I'm going to go ahead and pin this

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.140 
and I'm going to go ahead and pin this
edge<00:01:04.560> for<00:01:05.560> this<00:01:05.710> I'm<00:01:05.920> doing<00:01:06.280> a<00:01:06.520> regular

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
edge for this I'm doing a regular

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.240 
edge for this I'm doing a regular
straight<00:01:07.600> stitch<00:01:07.660> so<00:01:08.470> it's<00:01:08.650> a<00:01:08.680> regular<00:01:08.979> length

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
straight stitch so it's a regular length

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.789 
straight stitch so it's a regular length
don't<00:01:09.520> forget<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:09.759> do<00:01:09.850> a<00:01:09.880> back<00:01:10.090> stitching<00:01:10.600> and

I'm<00:01:11.799> doing<00:01:12.159> it<00:01:12.310> about<00:01:12.490> an<00:01:12.970> eighth<00:01:13.180> of<00:01:13.360> an<00:01:13.479> inch

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
I'm doing it about an eighth of an inch

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.990 
I'm doing it about an eighth of an inch
away<00:01:13.810> from<00:01:14.110> the<00:01:14.619> fold<00:01:14.860> you<00:01:15.189> can<00:01:15.369> definitely<00:01:15.549> do

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
away from the fold you can definitely do

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.240 
away from the fold you can definitely do
it<00:01:16.030> smaller<00:01:16.689> than<00:01:17.020> that<00:01:17.229> Pentax<00:01:17.799> are<00:01:18.009> supposed

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
it smaller than that Pentax are supposed

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.929 
it smaller than that Pentax are supposed
to<00:01:18.340> be<00:01:18.460> very<00:01:18.700> delicate<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.450> very<00:01:19.689> narrow<00:01:20.939> if

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
to be very delicate and very narrow if

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:23.580 
to be very delicate and very narrow if
you<00:01:22.090> do<00:01:22.270> something<00:01:22.659> bigger<00:01:22.869> that's<00:01:23.200> totally

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
you do something bigger that's totally

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.219 
you do something bigger that's totally
up<00:01:23.770> to<00:01:23.799> you<00:01:24.310> then<00:01:24.759> it's<00:01:24.909> just<00:01:25.030> a<00:01:25.270> regular<00:01:25.659> tuck

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
up to you then it's just a regular tuck

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.310 
up to you then it's just a regular tuck
instead<00:01:27.009> of<00:01:27.130> a<00:01:27.220> pin<00:01:27.430> tuck<00:01:27.640> but<00:01:28.600> yeah<00:01:28.810> it's<00:01:29.049> your

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
instead of a pin tuck but yeah it's your

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.600 
instead of a pin tuck but yeah it's your
thing<00:01:29.560> so<00:01:29.799> you<00:01:29.860> definitely<00:01:30.040> have<00:01:30.400> some

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
thing so you definitely have some

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.640 
thing so you definitely have some
options<00:01:30.850> here<00:01:31.150> I'm<00:01:31.659> just<00:01:31.960> doing<00:01:32.170> mine<00:01:32.350> about

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
options here I'm just doing mine about

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.840 
options here I'm just doing mine about
an<00:01:32.799> eighth<00:01:32.920> of<00:01:33.070> an<00:01:33.189> inch<00:01:33.280> away<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.610> show

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
an eighth of an inch away just to show

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.179 
an eighth of an inch away just to show
you<00:01:36.909> the<00:01:37.240> difference<00:01:37.780> this<00:01:38.470> one<00:01:38.710> right<00:01:38.890> here

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
you the difference this one right here

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.210 
you the difference this one right here
is<00:01:39.399> the<00:01:39.909> 1/8<00:01:40.509> mark<00:01:40.869> and<00:01:41.110> this<00:01:41.320> is<00:01:41.530> half<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:41.770> so

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
is the 1/8 mark and this is half that so

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.030 
is the 1/8 mark and this is half that so
1/16<00:01:43.060> so<00:01:43.689> you<00:01:43.780> can<00:01:43.990> see<00:01:44.200> which<00:01:44.439> one<00:01:44.680> you<00:01:44.799> like

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
1/16 so you can see which one you like

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.080 
1/16 so you can see which one you like
better<00:01:45.280> I<00:01:45.399> like<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.970> smaller<00:01:46.270> one<00:01:46.570> better

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
better I like the smaller one better

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.700 
better I like the smaller one better
after<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:49.210> finish<00:01:49.509> sewing<00:01:49.810> all<00:01:50.229> your<00:01:50.439> tucks

you're then going to press them normally

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.090 
you're then going to press them normally
they're<00:01:52.840> press<00:01:53.110> flat<00:01:53.469> and<00:01:53.740> they're<00:01:53.950> all

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
they're press flat and they're all

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.370 
they're press flat and they're all
pressed<00:01:54.520> in<00:01:54.759> one<00:01:54.969> direction<00:01:55.180> so<00:01:55.750> I<00:01:55.780> pressed<00:01:56.170> on

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
pressed in one direction so I pressed on

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.240 
pressed in one direction so I pressed on

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
incorporate pin tucks into the garment

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.770 
incorporate pin tucks into the garment
that<00:02:02.469> you<00:02:02.740> are<00:02:02.979> sewing<00:02:03.520> there<00:02:04.420> are<00:02:04.570> a<00:02:04.630> couple

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
that you are sewing there are a couple

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.840 
that you are sewing there are a couple
of<00:02:04.930> different<00:02:05.229> options<00:02:05.590> you<00:02:05.680> can<00:02:05.890> do<00:02:06.219> the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
of different options you can do the

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.540 
of different options you can do the
first<00:02:07.060> option<00:02:07.600> is<00:02:07.750> if<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.410> want<00:02:08.770> to<00:02:08.860> have<00:02:09.160> pin

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
first option is if you want to have pin

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.460 
first option is if you want to have pin
tucks<00:02:09.850> throughout<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.600> whole<00:02:10.810> garment<00:02:11.290> so

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
tucks throughout the whole garment so

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.930 
tucks throughout the whole garment so
the<00:02:11.620> whole<00:02:11.770> garment<00:02:12.040> is<00:02:12.250> going<00:02:12.460> to<00:02:12.550> have<00:02:12.670> pin

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
the whole garment is going to have pin

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.300 
the whole garment is going to have pin
tucks<00:02:13.150> or<00:02:13.390> least<00:02:13.660> most<00:02:13.900> of<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.350> what<00:02:15.280> I

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
tucks or least most of it is what I

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.390 
tucks or least most of it is what I
recommend<00:02:15.910> doing<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:17.410> you

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
recommend doing is that you

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.490 
recommend doing is that you
tuck<00:02:18.610> your<00:02:19.030> fabric<00:02:19.510> before<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:20.049> cut<00:02:20.230> anything

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
tuck your fabric before you cut anything

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.289 
tuck your fabric before you cut anything
out<00:02:20.650> so<00:02:20.920> this<00:02:21.250> is<00:02:21.370> just<00:02:21.459> my<00:02:21.640> fabric<00:02:21.939> and<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.120> just

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
out so this is just my fabric and I just

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.229 
out so this is just my fabric and I just
pintuck<00:02:22.689> the<00:02:22.870> whole<00:02:23.019> thing<00:02:23.459> then<00:02:24.459> after<00:02:25.120> it's

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
pintuck the whole thing then after it's

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.660 
pintuck the whole thing then after it's
pintuck<00:02:25.629> I<00:02:25.900> take<00:02:26.409> my<00:02:26.560> pattern<00:02:26.860> pieces<00:02:27.069> I<00:02:27.430> can

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
pintuck I take my pattern pieces I can

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.720 
pintuck I take my pattern pieces I can
go<00:02:27.819> ahead<00:02:27.970> place<00:02:28.900> them<00:02:29.140> how<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.319> want<00:02:29.439> them<00:02:29.860> pin

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
go ahead place them how I want them pin

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.069 
go ahead place them how I want them pin
them<00:02:30.909> and<00:02:31.090> then<00:02:31.269> cut<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.510> out

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
them and then cut it out

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.690 
them and then cut it out
so<00:02:32.260> then<00:02:32.409> the<00:02:32.530> pintuck<00:02:32.920> has<00:02:33.129> already<00:02:33.579> been

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
so then the pintuck has already been

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.160 
so then the pintuck has already been
accounted<00:02:34.060> for<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.480> don't<00:02:34.659> have<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:34.989> fool

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
accounted for and you don't have to fool

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.699 
accounted for and you don't have to fool
with<00:02:35.379> your<00:02:35.500> pattern<00:02:35.890> at<00:02:36.010> all<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.959> next<00:02:38.260> option

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
with your pattern at all the next option

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.410 
with your pattern at all the next option
is<00:02:38.859> for<00:02:39.189> when<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.370> want<00:02:39.459> a<00:02:39.730> specific<00:02:40.269> number

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
is for when you want a specific number

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.599 
is for when you want a specific number
of<00:02:40.569> pin<00:02:40.870> tucks<00:02:41.079> in<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.500> certain<00:02:41.890> area<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.340> your

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
of pin tucks in a certain area of your

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.059 
of pin tucks in a certain area of your
garment<00:02:43.090> for<00:02:43.540> example<00:02:43.989> maybe<00:02:44.319> in<00:02:44.590> this<00:02:44.829> part

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
garment for example maybe in this part

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.649 
garment for example maybe in this part
of<00:02:45.129> my<00:02:45.189> garment<00:02:45.430> this<00:02:45.670> one<00:02:45.849> pattern<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:46.390> want

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
of my garment this one pattern I want

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.349 
of my garment this one pattern I want
one<00:02:46.930> pin<00:02:47.439> tuck<00:02:47.680> here<00:02:48.099> but<00:02:48.790> no<00:02:48.909> pin<00:02:49.150> tucks

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
one pin tuck here but no pin tucks

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.569 
one pin tuck here but no pin tucks
anywhere<00:02:49.870> else<00:02:50.140> so<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.129> first<00:02:51.340> thing<00:02:51.489> I'm

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
anywhere else so the first thing I'm

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.009 
anywhere else so the first thing I'm
going<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.730> do<00:02:51.879> is<00:02:52.000> I'm<00:02:52.209> going<00:02:52.359> to<00:02:52.420> draw<00:02:52.690> a<00:02:52.720> line

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
going to do is I'm going to draw a line

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.860 
going to do is I'm going to draw a line
wherever<00:02:53.829> I<00:02:53.980> want<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.459> pin<00:02:54.879> tuck<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.420> appear

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
wherever I want a pin tuck to appear

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.319 
wherever I want a pin tuck to appear
then<00:02:56.409> use<00:02:56.620> my<00:02:56.859> scissors<00:02:57.040> in<00:02:57.370> order<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.970> cut<00:02:58.180> the

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
then use my scissors in order to cut the

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.890 
then use my scissors in order to cut the
pattern<00:02:58.659> apart<00:03:00.030> tape<00:03:01.030> a<00:03:01.060> larger<00:03:01.569> sheet<00:03:01.780> of

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
pattern apart tape a larger sheet of

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.449 
pattern apart tape a larger sheet of
paper<00:03:02.049> underneath<00:03:02.620> your<00:03:02.980> pattern<00:03:03.340> that

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
paper underneath your pattern that

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.890 
paper underneath your pattern that
you're<00:03:03.579> going<00:03:03.849> to<00:03:03.939> be<00:03:04.030> adding<00:03:04.359> the<00:03:04.450> pin<00:03:04.659> tuck

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
you're going to be adding the pin tuck

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.679 
you're going to be adding the pin tuck
and<00:03:05.139> then<00:03:06.040> we're<00:03:06.280> just<00:03:06.310> going<00:03:06.819> to<00:03:07.000> measure<00:03:07.239> the

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
and then we're just going to measure the

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.899 
and then we're just going to measure the
separation<00:03:07.930> between<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:09.069> two<00:03:09.250> patterns<00:03:09.459> and

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
separation between the two patterns and

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.339 
separation between the two patterns and
this<00:03:10.030> is<00:03:10.150> based<00:03:10.359> on<00:03:10.569> how<00:03:10.780> big<00:03:10.810> you<00:03:11.139> want<00:03:11.230> to

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
this is based on how big you want to

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.449 
this is based on how big you want to
make<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.590> pin<00:03:11.769> tuck<00:03:11.980> so<00:03:12.159> you're<00:03:12.250> going<00:03:12.370> to

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
make the pin tuck so you're going to

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.250 
make the pin tuck so you're going to
double<00:03:12.879> whatever<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.540> seam<00:03:13.750> allowance<00:03:14.139> is

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
double whatever the seam allowance is

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.410 
double whatever the seam allowance is
that<00:03:14.530> you're<00:03:14.650> sewing<00:03:14.980> your<00:03:15.129> pin<00:03:15.370> tuck<00:03:15.579> at<00:03:15.790> if

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
that you're sewing your pin tuck at if

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.920 
that you're sewing your pin tuck at if
for<00:03:16.810> example<00:03:17.189> I'm<00:03:18.189> sewing<00:03:18.909> 1/8<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:19.659> an<00:03:19.810> inch

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
for example I'm sewing 1/8 of an inch

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.439 
for example I'm sewing 1/8 of an inch
from<00:03:20.470> my<00:03:20.500> folded<00:03:21.010> edge<00:03:21.159> of<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.430> pintuck<00:03:21.819> then

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.449 
from my folded edge of the pintuck then

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.629 
from my folded edge of the pintuck then
this<00:03:22.780> gap<00:03:23.049> is<00:03:23.620> going<00:03:23.799> to<00:03:23.859> be<00:03:23.949> twice<00:03:24.160> that<00:03:24.430> so

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
this gap is going to be twice that so

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.309 
this gap is going to be twice that so
that<00:03:24.760> means<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:25.299> going<00:03:25.419> to<00:03:25.480> be<00:03:25.569> a<00:03:25.660> quarter<00:03:26.230> of

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
that means it's going to be a quarter of

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.099 
that means it's going to be a quarter of
an<00:03:26.440> inch<00:03:26.560> if<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.730> want<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.090> even<00:03:28.299> smaller<00:03:28.690> one

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
an inch if I want to even smaller one

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.979 
an inch if I want to even smaller one
then<00:03:30.099> it's<00:03:30.340> going<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.519> be<00:03:30.730> 1/8<00:03:31.569> of<00:03:31.750> an<00:03:31.870> inch

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
then it's going to be 1/8 of an inch

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.830 
then it's going to be 1/8 of an inch
which<00:03:32.590> gives<00:03:32.859> me<00:03:33.069> one<00:03:33.579> sixteenth<00:03:34.269> seam

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
which gives me one sixteenth seam

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.140 
which gives me one sixteenth seam
