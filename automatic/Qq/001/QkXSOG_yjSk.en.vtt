00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.059
 here in the drawing 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.250
 Just the hair spray I was with 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.590
 fear because I went through a leaf and found 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.789
 very liquid even if you have a 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.279

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.869

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.250
 a force had here in the book packed 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.530
 nothing, I just put two sheets here 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.899
 underneath and one here 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.989

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:54.750

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:56.610

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.079

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.750
 temptation 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.489

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:09.140

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.140
 very strong smell 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.730
 he has a scent ascended from these genes 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.740
 What do we have that really matters? 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.170

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.710
 leaf necklace with the star wind 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.040
 then it is better to learn the same sheet the 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.670
 aspect it dries quickly is not 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.590
 shining little star shone too 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.560
 the varnished effect but I got the 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.280
 matte then paint off with the same 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.440

 I had another drawing here I do not know 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.660
 If you're going to be here, I'll wait when 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.160
 minutes to dry and then I take a 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.960

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.960
