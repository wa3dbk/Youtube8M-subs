00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
off a factory undercoating off the frame

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.490 
off a factory undercoating off the frame
I've<00:00:21.150> gone<00:00:21.359> back<00:00:21.570> in<00:00:21.779> there<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.050> kind<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.320> wire

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
I've gone back in there and kind of wire

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.929 
I've gone back in there and kind of wire
brushed<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.130> clean<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.430> up<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.640> little<00:00:23.730> bit

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
brushed it to clean it up a little bit

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.300 
brushed it to clean it up a little bit
and<00:00:24.150> then<00:00:24.269> under<00:00:25.199> coated<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.650> again<00:00:25.949> so

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
and then under coated it again so

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.300 
and then under coated it again so
outside<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.300> frame<00:00:27.510> looks<00:00:27.750> pretty<00:00:28.019> good

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
outside of the frame looks pretty good

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
outside of the frame looks pretty good
but<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.340> wanted<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.730> take<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> look<00:00:30.150> at<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
but I wanted to take a look at the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.420 
but I wanted to take a look at the
inside<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.840> frame

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
inside of the frame

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.910 
inside of the frame
recently<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.520> transmission<00:00:33.149> shop<00:00:33.920> couldn't

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
recently a transmission shop couldn't

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.500 
recently a transmission shop couldn't
get<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.280> skid<00:00:35.579> plate<00:00:35.760> off<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.149> had<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> have<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
get the skid plate off I had to have the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.729 
get the skid plate off I had to have the
transmission<00:00:36.870> rebuilt<00:00:37.290> they<00:00:37.410> couldn't<00:00:37.649> get

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
transmission rebuilt they couldn't get

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.139 
transmission rebuilt they couldn't get
the<00:00:37.800> skid<00:00:38.010> plate<00:00:38.129> off<00:00:38.370> because<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.700> nutsert

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the skid plate off because the nutsert

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.139 
the skid plate off because the nutsert
on<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> inside<00:00:40.020> were<00:00:40.260> spinning<00:00:40.760> so<00:00:41.760> they<00:00:41.879> cut

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
on the inside were spinning so they cut

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.080 
on the inside were spinning so they cut
holes<00:00:42.570> through<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.140> frame<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.820> I<00:00:44.820> wasn't

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
holes through the frame and I wasn't

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.670 
holes through the frame and I wasn't
crazy<00:00:45.390> about<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> way<00:00:45.960> they<00:00:46.110> fixed<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.530> I

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
crazy about the way they fixed it I

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.440 
crazy about the way they fixed it I
didn't<00:00:46.920> know<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.370> correct<00:00:47.610> repair<00:00:48.149> was

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
didn't know what the correct repair was

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.900 
didn't know what the correct repair was
and<00:00:48.899> they<00:00:49.860> obviously<00:00:49.980> didn't<00:00:50.520> know<00:00:50.550> either

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
and they obviously didn't know either

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.959 
and they obviously didn't know either
but<00:00:51.590> anyway<00:00:52.590> what<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.010> has<00:00:53.160> given<00:00:53.280> me<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:53.699> is

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
but anyway what this has given me now is

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.939 
but anyway what this has given me now is
the<00:00:54.600> opportunity<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.320> kind<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.559> flush<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
the opportunity to kind of flush the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.490 
the opportunity to kind of flush the
frame<00:00:56.190> out<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> little<00:00:56.579> bit<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.899> ran<00:00:58.289> an

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
frame out a little bit and I ran an

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.260 
frame out a little bit and I ran an
inspection<00:00:58.920> camera<00:00:59.219> up<00:00:59.489> here<00:00:59.730> inside<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
inspection camera up here inside the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.430 
inspection camera up here inside the
frame<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.690> we're<00:01:00.809> going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> take<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> look<00:01:01.379> at

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
frame so we're going to take a look at

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.670 
frame so we're going to take a look at
that<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.039> just<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.340> minute<00:01:02.460> okay<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:04.350> here

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
that here in just a minute okay so here

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.830 
that here in just a minute okay so here
we<00:01:04.799> are<00:01:04.830> with<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> inspection<00:01:05.909> camera<00:01:06.119> it

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
we are with the inspection camera it

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.630 
we are with the inspection camera it
doesn't<00:01:07.140> focus<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.619> stuff<00:01:07.979> that's<00:01:08.220> far<00:01:08.430> away

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
doesn't focus on stuff that's far away

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.010 
doesn't focus on stuff that's far away
very<00:01:08.820> well<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.420> looks<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.630> little<00:01:09.689> blurry

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
very well so it looks a little blurry

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.510 
very well so it looks a little blurry
here<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.439> once<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:10.710> get<00:01:10.830> inside<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> frame

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
here but once we get inside the frame

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.450 
here but once we get inside the frame
that<00:01:11.700> look<00:01:11.850> pretty<00:01:12.000> sharp<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.159> can<00:01:14.340> see

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
that look pretty sharp so you can see

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.859 
that look pretty sharp so you can see
I'm<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> go<00:01:14.850> through<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.360> rear<00:01:15.630> hole

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
I'm going to go through this rear hole

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:16.899 
I'm going to go through this rear hole
on<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.200> driver's<00:01:16.590> side

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
on the driver's side

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.640 
on the driver's side
this<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.060> above<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:18.659> where<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.409> way<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
this is above for where the the way the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.149 
this is above for where the the way the
skid<00:01:19.830> plates<00:01:20.040> bolted<00:01:20.430> into<00:01:20.580> my<00:01:20.759> frame<00:01:21.090> now<00:01:22.159> so

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
skid plates bolted into my frame now so

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.620 
skid plates bolted into my frame now so
we're<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.310> going<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.549> work<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.970> inspection

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
we're just going to work this inspection

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
of the frame now I just flushed out this

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.569 
of the frame now I just flushed out this
frame<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.350> some<00:01:34.560> water<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.040> compressed<00:01:35.130> air

that<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.290> could<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.790> inside<00:01:39.240> wall<00:01:39.509> here<00:01:39.750> which

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
that I could the inside wall here which

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.210 
that I could the inside wall here which
is<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> wall<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> left<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
is the wall on the left is the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.819 
is the wall on the left is the
concerning<00:01:41.790> wall<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.299> me<00:01:42.450> because<00:01:42.840> obviously

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
concerning wall to me because obviously

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.620 
concerning wall to me because obviously
the<00:01:44.189> steel<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.520> delaminating<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.299> rust<00:01:45.509> is

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the steel is delaminating the rust is

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.359 
the steel is delaminating the rust is
getting<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.020> there<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.500> pressing<00:01:47.100> out

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
getting in there and it's pressing out

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.719 
getting in there and it's pressing out
the<00:01:47.490> steel<00:01:47.729> that's<00:01:47.939> on<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.119> front<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:49.729> it's

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
the steel that's on the front and it's

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.389 
the steel that's on the front and it's
not<00:01:51.180> going<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.479> be<00:01:51.630> structurally<00:01:52.470> sound<00:01:52.979> much

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
not going to be structurally sound much

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.990 
not going to be structurally sound much
longer<00:01:54.560> just<00:01:55.560> lots<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.979> lots<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.640> pieces<00:01:56.969> of

longer just lots of lots of pieces of

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.219 
longer just lots of lots of pieces of
rust<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.450> here<00:01:57.780> and

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
rust in here and

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.170 
rust in here and
it's<00:02:00.040> not<00:02:00.220> looking<00:02:00.460> too<00:02:00.490> good<00:02:00.729> I'm<00:02:00.880> not<00:02:00.909> too

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
it's not looking too good I'm not too

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.149 
it's not looking too good I'm not too
worried<00:02:01.450> about<00:02:01.479> surface<00:02:01.960> for<00:02:02.110> us<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:02.920> can<00:02:03.009> see

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
worried about surface for us you can see

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.320 
worried about surface for us you can see
the<00:02:03.250> black<00:02:03.460> coating<00:02:03.850> up<00:02:03.939> there<00:02:04.119> on<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.299> top

the black coating up there on the top

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.560 
the black coating up there on the top
that<00:02:05.229> would<00:02:05.409> be<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.770> factory<00:02:06.280> coating<00:02:07.240> so

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
that would be the factory coating so

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.699 
that would be the factory coating so
there<00:02:07.720> was<00:02:07.840> a<00:02:07.869> factory<00:02:08.229> coating<00:02:08.530> on<00:02:08.619> the

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
there was a factory coating on the

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:09.900 
there was a factory coating on the
inside<00:02:08.739> of<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.160> frame<00:02:09.340> just<00:02:09.670> like<00:02:09.789> the

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
inside of the frame just like the

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.750 
inside of the frame just like the

doesn't<00:02:13.090> look<00:02:13.120> too<00:02:13.390> bad<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:15.280> this<00:02:15.730> inside

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.770 
through the frame in the rear this would
be<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.220> part<00:02:36.430> where<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.640> starts<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.000> go<00:02:37.150> up<00:02:37.180> you

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
be the part where it starts to go up you

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.620 
be the part where it starts to go up you
know<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:37.989> get<00:02:38.140> above<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.350> rear<00:02:38.620> axle<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:42.630> it's

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
know to get above the rear axle and it's

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.240 
know to get above the rear axle and it's
kind<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.900> cleaned<00:02:44.170> back<00:02:44.380> up<00:02:44.560> in<00:02:44.709> here<00:02:44.950> but<00:02:45.100> you

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
kind of cleaned back up in here but you

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.790 
kind of cleaned back up in here but you
can<00:02:45.400> tell<00:02:45.580> down<00:02:45.790> in<00:02:45.910> this<00:02:46.030> on<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.810> inside<00:02:47.230> not

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
can tell down in this on the inside not

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.979 
can tell down in this on the inside not
at<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.430> bottom<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.060> frame<00:02:49.330> rail<00:02:49.569> here<00:02:49.810> is

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
at the bottom of this frame rail here is

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.410 
at the bottom of this frame rail here is
just<00:02:50.200> for<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.380> lot<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.739> dirts<00:02:50.950> its<00:02:51.280> salts<00:02:52.180> it's

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
just for a lot of dirts its salts it's

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.620 
just for a lot of dirts its salts it's
and<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.319> just<00:02:53.500> tends<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:53.769> rust<00:02:54.040> out<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.310> frame

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
and it just tends to rust out the frame

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.720 
and it just tends to rust out the frame
that's<00:02:55.630> all<00:02:55.780> there<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:56.019> to<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.610> rusted<00:02:57.610> out

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
that's all there is to it rusted out

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.970 
that's all there is to it rusted out
from<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:57.970> inside<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.660> on<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.380> inside<00:02:59.769> part

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
from the inside and on the inside part

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.729 
from the inside and on the inside part
of<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:00.160> frame<00:03:00.370> here<00:03:00.610> too<00:03:01.110> so<00:03:02.110> I'm<00:03:02.380> going<00:03:02.650> to

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
of the frame here too so I'm going to

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.020 
of the frame here too so I'm going to
take<00:03:02.950> my<00:03:03.130> camera<00:03:03.190> out<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:04.530> I'm<00:03:05.530> going<00:03:05.799> to<00:03:06.030> try

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
take my camera out and I'm going to try

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.759 
take my camera out and I'm going to try
to<00:03:07.060> put<00:03:07.360> it<00:03:07.480> in<00:03:07.600> through<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.870> hole<00:03:08.079> here<00:03:08.410> above

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
to put it in through the hole here above

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.340 
to put it in through the hole here above
the<00:03:08.980> rear<00:03:09.540> well<00:03:10.540> right<00:03:10.780> next<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.170> rear

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
the rear well right next to the rear

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.890 
the rear well right next to the rear
wheel<00:03:11.730> there's<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.820> what<00:03:13.329> I<00:03:13.360> would<00:03:13.420> consider<00:03:13.630> to

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
wheel there's a what I would consider to

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.199 
wheel there's a what I would consider to
be<00:03:13.989> a<00:03:14.049> design<00:03:14.410> flaw<00:03:14.709> here<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:15.310> there's<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:16.030> hole

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
be a design flaw here and there's a hole

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.960 
be a design flaw here and there's a hole
right<00:03:16.239> next<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.019> rear<00:03:17.200> tire<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.970> there's

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
right next to the rear tire and there's

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.910 
right next to the rear tire and there's
nothing<00:03:19.329> that<00:03:19.540> blocks<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:20.049> so<00:03:20.590> just

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
nothing that blocks that so just

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.710 
nothing that blocks that so just
anything<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.549> get<00:03:21.790> from<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:22.120> road<00:03:22.299> can<00:03:22.600> go

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
anything you get from the road can go

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.069 
anything you get from the road can go
right<00:03:22.959> through<00:03:23.170> that<00:03:23.320> hole<00:03:24.420> so<00:03:25.420> we'll<00:03:25.870> see<00:03:26.019> if

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
right through that hole so we'll see if

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.170 
right through that hole so we'll see if
we<00:03:26.170> get<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:26.410> camera<00:03:26.680> in<00:03:26.859> here<00:03:27.190> it's<00:03:27.400> it's

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
we get this camera in here it's it's

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.729 
we get this camera in here it's it's
really<00:03:28.540> tight<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:29.049> get<00:03:29.170> it<00:03:29.320> in<00:03:29.440> there<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:29.620> should

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
really tight to get it in there I should

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.470 
really tight to get it in there I should
have<00:03:30.010> pulled<00:03:30.190> off<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.549> rear<00:03:30.700> tire<00:03:30.940> in<00:03:31.269> order

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
have pulled off the rear tire in order

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.270 
have pulled off the rear tire in order
to<00:03:31.600> get<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:32.410> be<00:03:32.530> able<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.769> go<00:03:32.829> through<00:03:33.010> here

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
to get it to be able to go through here

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.340 
to get it to be able to go through here
more<00:03:33.489> easily<00:03:33.790> but<00:03:34.630> you'll<00:03:34.750> be<00:03:34.870> able<00:03:34.959> to<00:03:35.109> see<00:03:35.320> a

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
more easily but you'll be able to see a

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.319 
more easily but you'll be able to see a
little<00:03:35.590> bit<00:03:35.799> now<00:03:36.310> on<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.609> inside<00:03:36.760> there's<00:03:37.180> not

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
little bit now on the inside there's not

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.940 
little bit now on the inside there's not
supposed<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.630> be<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.720> hole<00:03:37.930> but<00:03:38.590> there<00:03:38.769> is<00:03:38.920> a

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
supposed to be a hole but there is a

through<00:03:50.019> cleaning<00:03:50.530> through<00:03:50.739> you<00:03:50.890> can<00:03:51.010> see

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
through cleaning through you can see

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.440 
through cleaning through you can see
here<00:03:51.400> on<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:51.609> bottom<00:03:51.910> of<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.060> frame<00:03:52.239> rail

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
here on the bottom of the frame rail

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.819 
here on the bottom of the frame rail
there's<00:03:52.690> just<00:03:52.810> a<00:03:52.870> bunch<00:03:53.049> of<00:03:53.140> dirt<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.410> sand

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
there's just a bunch of dirt and sand

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.670 
there's just a bunch of dirt and sand
and<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.780> whatever<00:03:55.780> else<00:03:56.019> is<00:03:56.170> in<00:03:56.200> there<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:56.590> I

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
and and whatever else is in there and I

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.590 
and and whatever else is in there and I
did<00:03:57.069> flush<00:03:57.310> this<00:03:57.519> thing<00:03:57.579> out<00:03:57.940> so<00:03:58.209> this<00:03:58.359> is<00:03:58.480> just

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
did flush this thing out so this is just

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.250 
did flush this thing out so this is just
left<00:03:58.900> over<00:03:59.200> after<00:03:59.530> it<00:03:59.650> was<00:03:59.769> flushed<00:04:00.100> out<00:04:00.720> I<00:04:01.720> was

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
left over after it was flushed out I was

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.479 
left over after it was flushed out I was
thinking<00:04:02.590> about<00:04:02.680> going<00:04:02.920> through<00:04:03.220> here<00:04:03.400> and

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
thinking about going through here and

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.539 
thinking about going through here and
coating<00:04:03.850> it<00:04:04.260> with<00:04:05.260> something<00:04:05.980> on<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:06.130> inside

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
coating it with something on the inside

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.000 
coating it with something on the inside
to<00:04:06.940> prevent<00:04:07.510> any<00:04:07.810> more<00:04:08.019> rust<00:04:08.320> but<00:04:08.620> I<00:04:08.799> may<00:04:08.979> be

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
to prevent any more rust but I may be

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.200 
to prevent any more rust but I may be
beyond<00:04:09.519> that

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.210 
beyond that

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.390 
beyond that
this<00:04:10.330> frame<00:04:10.660> it's<00:04:11.440> difficult<00:04:11.920> back<00:04:12.100> in<00:04:12.280> this

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
this frame it's difficult back in this

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.770 
this frame it's difficult back in this
area<00:04:12.760> to<00:04:12.880> try<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:13.090> get<00:04:13.270> that<00:04:13.420> inspection

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
area to try to get that inspection

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.860 
area to try to get that inspection
camera<00:04:14.080> to<00:04:14.350> to<00:04:15.280> behave<00:04:15.880> with<00:04:16.150> that<00:04:16.360> wheel<00:04:16.570> on<00:04:16.840> I

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
camera to to behave with that wheel on I

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.330 
camera to to behave with that wheel on I
really<00:04:17.260> should<00:04:17.440> have<00:04:17.470> pulled<00:04:17.740> that<00:04:17.860> wheel<00:04:18.100> off

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
really should have pulled that wheel off

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.400 
really should have pulled that wheel off
here<00:04:18.610> but<00:04:18.700> you<00:04:18.790> can<00:04:18.940> see<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.390> rust<00:04:20.110> on<00:04:20.260> the

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
here but you can see the rust on the

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.980 
here but you can see the rust on the
wall<00:04:20.620> you<00:04:21.010> can<00:04:21.130> see<00:04:21.310> pretty<00:04:21.640> thick<00:04:22.390> chunks<00:04:22.840> of

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
wall you can see pretty thick chunks of

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.660 
wall you can see pretty thick chunks of
steel<00:04:23.350> and<00:04:23.500> rust<00:04:23.740> wanting<00:04:24.190> to<00:04:24.310> come<00:04:24.490> off<00:04:24.640> that

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
steel and rust wanting to come off that

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.720 
steel and rust wanting to come off that
wall<00:04:25.090> there<00:04:25.390> and<00:04:25.830> just<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:26.980> lot<00:04:27.220> of<00:04:27.430> junk

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
wall there and just a lot of junk

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:28.950 
wall there and just a lot of junk
sitting<00:04:28.090> down<00:04:28.240> here<00:04:28.420> on<00:04:28.480> the<00:04:28.540> bottom<00:04:28.690> of<00:04:28.870> the

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
sitting down here on the bottom of the

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.690 
sitting down here on the bottom of the
frame<00:04:29.200> and<00:04:29.530> it's<00:04:29.920> just<00:04:30.070> going<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.250> cause<00:04:30.460> it's

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
frame and it's just going to cause it's

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.980 
frame and it's just going to cause it's
going<00:04:30.790> to<00:04:30.850> hold<00:04:31.060> moisture<00:04:31.240> and<00:04:31.720> it's<00:04:31.840> just

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
going to hold moisture and it's just

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.040 
going to hold moisture and it's just
going<00:04:32.110> to<00:04:32.200> cause<00:04:32.380> it<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.620> rust<00:04:32.770> out<00:04:33.720> so<00:04:34.720> I

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
going to cause it to rust out so I

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.470 
going to cause it to rust out so I
encourage<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:35.950> to<00:04:36.160> flush<00:04:36.730> out<00:04:36.940> yours<00:04:37.210> if<00:04:37.390> you

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
encourage you to flush out yours if you

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.570 
encourage you to flush out yours if you
can<00:04:37.720> I<00:04:38.020> know<00:04:38.440> some<00:04:38.710> people<00:04:38.830> drilled<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.310> hole<00:04:39.340> in

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
can I know some people drilled a hole in

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.240 
can I know some people drilled a hole in
the<00:04:39.670> bottom<00:04:39.910> of<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.060> frame<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:40.390> flush<00:04:40.600> it<00:04:40.630> out

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
the bottom of the frame to flush it out

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.660 
the bottom of the frame to flush it out
but<00:04:42.250> I<00:04:42.750> think<00:04:43.750> this<00:04:44.350> one<00:04:44.590> it's<00:04:45.040> still<00:04:45.400> strong

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
but I think this one it's still strong

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.730 
but I think this one it's still strong
now<00:04:45.910> but<00:04:46.300> it's<00:04:46.720> not<00:04:46.870> going<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.050> be<00:04:47.200> strong<00:04:47.530> much

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
now but it's not going to be strong much

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.100 
now but it's not going to be strong much
longer
