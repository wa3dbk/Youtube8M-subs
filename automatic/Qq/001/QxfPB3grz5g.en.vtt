00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.840
 wait until the program loads and asks 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.189
 to restart your computer 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.189
 restart normally 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:34.750

 do the following steps 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.910
 I cut the video to not be too long 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.680
 after downloading and installing everything you should 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.840
 restart your computer 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.600
 will appear a warning that it is 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.020
 Carrying this is just a matter of waiting. 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.820
 install and if your pc restarts 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:15.220

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.550
