00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hey i'm jonas and in this video 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.290
 it's about the apple has been and around 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.510
 to be more specific about usage 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.910
 One week and there I want you 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.280
 Now give a small conclusion 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.289
 but what I find positive and negative 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:24.570
 you noticed that you learn how 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:27.210
 Always have fun after the motto 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.130
 First of all we want to wear tanja 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.970
 I like sport bracelet with you 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.099
 really good 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.149
 At first I thought that's one 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.790
 cheap bracelet like any other 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.620
 cheap but fast after a short time 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.290
 Really noticed that this bracelet 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.039
 high quality is good 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.800
 feels and really no problems 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.440
 with the name so there are with the poor 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.829
 have and so only when attaching the clock 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.050
 Do we have to leave the tab there? 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.910
 put it under the clock and there 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.719
 you get stuck and super hair and 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.969
 the skin 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.309
 but since the clock is not every ten 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.350
 Minutes decreases and turn it back on 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.490
 that's fine too 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.380
 I have not yet 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.570
 has found out the benefit in the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.150
 Everyday because in my opinion 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.860
 as with any other smartphones clear 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.020
 you look much less at his 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.540
 smartphone because you simply pointing to 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.930
 The clock looks then it looks important 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.610
 or not, but really use 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.200
 with many things you have to go anyway 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.799
 the smartphone back out of the bag 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.020
 to take 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.329
 and I ask myself, you need me 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.829
 really to the smartphone though 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.030
 then you have the apple watch 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.159
 can interact 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.829
 then that works really good too 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.630
 performance is genius of course 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.240
 At first a bit scared at the high 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.070
 display resolution and then yes, too 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.649
 on the internet reported that the 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.790
 performance pretty bad that it 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.829
 long loading times 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.799
 but in my opinion that is not 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.560
 so from the smart watch has the apple 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.270
 watch in my opinion the best 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.729
 performance was the scope 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.640
 functions can be added as well 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.090
 You can over significantly more things over 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.330
 the smart interact as it did at the 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.190
 devices 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.960
 case is also the display has me 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.480
 I would really like one 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.150
 Amoled display installed which mine 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.570
 opinion on the 38 mm version 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.730
 pretty small but the size goes in 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.640
 order you can do everything and it is 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.620
 not so i think no 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.780
 sure I can really nothing now 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.670
 but make a bigger display 4 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.060
 of course, but the beautiful have been 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.860
 the contrasts vote and the colors agree 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.050
 the amulet are colors too 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.150
 pretty strong is the black value 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.820
 perfect and he knows he will too 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.560
 a pretty high level 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.510
 something negative noticed me that 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.190
 one if you are in direct 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.470
 solar radiation on the display 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.630
 Look that there, the display 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.300
 could have been a bit lighter 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.160
 but well you can not do everything but 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.810
 it's not something you really do 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.030
 nothing sees and only looks the mirror 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.590
 but you can already see that the display 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.440
 is relatively dark 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.959
 but what helps in a high-resolution 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:13.170
 good display with good hardware of his 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.930
 great performance then only totally small 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.500
 learn and honestly thought at first 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.170
 I use the part of the after two 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.840
 It is empty for hours at all 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.040
 I do not have it on hand it has two days 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.110
 with the ur so out with a charge and 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.690
 I really would not have expected that 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.540
 the apple watch posed on smartphones 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.250
 in my opinion in the upper league 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.610
 the batteries with 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.930
 and that despite the high display resolution 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.330
 and in many functions 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.400
 I think that's really crass of course 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.800
 The battery life could be significantly better 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.239
 but it could also be clear 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.519
 be worse and you can see that too 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.320
 at other smart watch is pretty good 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.950
 So the apple watch is really doing here 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.070
 a great job and I would be really positive 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.350
 surprised 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.480
 the system which year at first 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.160
 looks pretty cluttered 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.360
 I actually have that pretty fast 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.250
 learned to appreciate 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:13.580
 although that is with the round icons and such 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.900
 and with that back and forth 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.090
 but I have to get used to it 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.210
 worse presented so I see that 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.020
 sense in it 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:26.870
 Show quite a few apps at once 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.980
 want and then well without problems 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.350
 can tap on it 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.120
 this is supported by the digital 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.160
 crown also pretty good 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.200
 and this is also pretty positive for me 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.090
 noticed and I want her 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.440
 no longer really beginning to miss 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.370
 sign though thought it is unnecessary 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.870
 but in the meantime i like them i find 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.460
 she really great and i want her 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.830
 just do not miss anymore 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.320
 Overall, I can say the total package 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.300
 apple watch is really good that one 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.130
 for the price gets the good one 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.760
 may find it a little expensive and the 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.440
 others find the price justified 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.960
 but i think the whole package is smart 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.420
 What you get here is really good 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.600
 Processing the display is correct 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:12.080
 and yes, everything is right up 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.880
 the price eventual and from the smart 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.400
 watch it is the apple jobs of mine 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.760
 Opinion on currently best on the market 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.320
 and i think as best smartphone can 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.960
 you also get a little higher 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.450
 price can therefore my opinion 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.180
 after the price is pretty much 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.790
 justified and the impact you 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.590
 he is paid for the apple program 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.330
 not as high as the iphone or 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.460
 similar your market for and I am 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.380
 pretty happy with the movie then 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.720
 Here is another conclusion after one 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.610
 week use then looks like 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.800
 times in the video description because there 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.290
 I still have the video of marvin from 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.120
 channel intervened and you linked this 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.220
 has also made a video where he is so 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.610
 his experience after a week of use 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.410
 the apple- watch communicates so look 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.030
 There necessarily over 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.070
 then it was with this one too 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.960
 video I hope you liked it 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.690
 if so, of course I would be over 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.520
 a positive rating front and if 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.470
 you can and videos from one channel more 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.900
 you want to miss then you too 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.970
 I like to have an abo there I hope you 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.290
 Look at the next video again 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.290
 until then
