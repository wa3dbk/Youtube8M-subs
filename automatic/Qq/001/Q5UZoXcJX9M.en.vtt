the second amazing way that fiber

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.980 
the second amazing way that fiber
contributes<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.490> weight<00:00:29.670> loss<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.240> something

contributes to weight loss is something

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.320 
contributes to weight loss is something
called<00:00:31.489> energy<00:00:32.489> density<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.570> like<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.710> call<00:00:34.950> it

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330 
called energy density I like to call it

calorie<00:00:36.330> density<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.140> calorie<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.130> unit<00:00:38.280> of

density<00:00:56.370> foods<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:57.330> fewer<00:00:57.720> calories<00:00:58.110> in<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
density foods have fewer calories in the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.990 
density foods have fewer calories in the
same<00:00:59.489> volume<00:01:00.150> of<00:01:00.510> food<00:01:00.900> this<00:01:01.799> means<00:01:02.190> with<00:01:02.670> low

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
same volume of food this means with low

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.050 
same volume of food this means with low
calorie<00:01:03.540> density<00:01:03.960> foods<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.339> eat<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.729> lot

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
calorie density foods you can eat a lot

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.590 
calorie density foods you can eat a lot
of<00:01:06.090> food<00:01:06.540> without<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.380> lot<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.100> calories<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:09.360> for

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
of food without a lot of calories so for

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.460 
of food without a lot of calories so for
example<00:01:09.690> this<00:01:10.350> peach<00:01:10.680> has<00:01:11.040> 51<00:01:12.000> calories<00:01:12.990> okay

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
example this peach has 51 calories okay

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.539 
example this peach has 51 calories okay
you<00:01:14.159> could<00:01:14.370> eat<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.820> whole<00:01:15.600> bowl<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.260> peaches<00:01:16.740> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
you could eat a whole bowl of peaches to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.660 
you could eat a whole bowl of peaches to
equal<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.150> chocolate<00:01:18.750> bar<00:01:18.930> which<00:01:19.170> has<00:01:19.670> 230

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
equal a chocolate bar which has 230

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.600 
equal a chocolate bar which has 230
calories<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.960> that's<00:01:22.260> a<00:01:22.409> lot<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.979> eat<00:01:23.340> in

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
calories so that's a lot to eat in

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.380 
calories so that's a lot to eat in

ounce<00:01:27.840> for<00:01:28.200> ounce<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.979> will<00:01:29.100> gain<00:01:29.280> more

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
ounce for ounce you will gain more

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.279 
ounce for ounce you will gain more
weight<00:01:29.759> from<00:01:30.479> eating<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.810> chocolate<00:01:31.020> bar

weight from eating the chocolate bar

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.429 
weight from eating the chocolate bar
then<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.039> same<00:01:32.340> volume<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:33.030> peaches<00:01:33.390> now<00:01:34.229> I'm

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
then the same volume of peaches now I'm

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.679 
then the same volume of peaches now I'm
not<00:01:34.469> saying<00:01:34.680> with<00:01:35.189> fiber<00:01:35.460> 35<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.359> you<00:01:36.509> can

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
not saying with fiber 35 that you can

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.999 
not saying with fiber 35 that you can
always<00:01:36.960> eat<00:01:37.109> peaches<00:01:37.289> and<00:01:37.649> never<00:01:37.799> have

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
always eat peaches and never have

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.160 
always eat peaches and never have
chocolate<00:01:38.430> remember<00:01:39.420> everything<00:01:39.840> in

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
chocolate remember everything in

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.859 
chocolate remember everything in
moderation<00:01:40.670> what<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.700> am<00:01:42.000> saying<00:01:42.359> though<00:01:42.659> is

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
moderation what I am saying though is
