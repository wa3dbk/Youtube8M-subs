00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
wanted a insult but then they like we

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.680 
wanted a insult but then they like we
blind<00:00:52.500> swapped<00:00:52.739> they<00:00:53.010> swapped<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.610> us<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:54.510> we

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
blind swapped they swapped on us then we

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.090 
blind swapped they swapped on us then we
were<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> bit<00:00:54.960> scared<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:55.469> they<00:00:55.530> didn't<00:00:55.949> really

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
were a bit scared but they didn't really

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.099 
were a bit scared but they didn't really
do<00:00:56.280> much<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.969> then<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.629> could<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:57.930> killed

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
do much and then we could have killed

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.650 
do much and then we could have killed
him<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.440> Neil's<00:00:59.070> miss<00:00:59.280> played<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> bit<00:00:59.699> even

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
him but Neil's miss played a bit even

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.420 
him but Neil's miss played a bit even
though<00:01:00.690> I'm<00:01:01.020> not<00:01:01.050> sure<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.829> think<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.309> could

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
though I'm not sure but I think we could

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.160 
though I'm not sure but I think we could
have<00:01:02.520> killed<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.090> I'm<00:01:03.270> not<00:01:03.420> sure<00:01:03.449> if<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.049> guy

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
have killed but I'm not sure if the guy

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.320 
have killed but I'm not sure if the guy
would<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.350> died<00:01:04.589> even<00:01:04.739> use<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.760> auto<00:01:06.030> attack

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
would have died even use the auto attack

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.710 
would have died even use the auto attack
before<00:01:06.540> he<00:01:06.810> but<00:01:07.470> yeah<00:01:08.150> that's<00:01:09.150> kind<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.570> how<00:01:09.689> it

getting the impression that a lot of LCS

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.619 
getting the impression that a lot of LCS
teams<00:02:57.840> think<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.590> be<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.889> killing<00:02:59.879> people<00:03:00.359> or

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.220 
teams think to be to killing people or
just<00:03:00.689> trading<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.739> out<00:03:01.920> trading<00:03:02.189> is

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
just trading and out trading is

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.899 
just trading and out trading is
important<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.530> in<00:03:04.980> reality<00:03:05.280> all<00:03:05.609> you<00:03:05.790> have

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
important that in reality all you have

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.140 
important that in reality all you have
to<00:03:06.000> do<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.269> farm<00:03:06.870> up<00:03:07.049> get<00:03:07.739> a<00:03:07.769> good<00:03:08.010> comp<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.790> not

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
to do is farm up get a good comp and not

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.220 
to do is farm up get a good comp and not
die<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.359> gangs<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.019> lose<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.920> game<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:12.230> yeah

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
die to gangs and lose the game and yeah

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.129 
die to gangs and lose the game and yeah
I<00:03:13.409> think<00:03:13.560> we<00:03:13.859> do<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.129> good<00:03:14.340> we<00:03:14.939> don't<00:03:15.150> kill

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
I think we do that good we don't kill

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.539 
I think we do that good we don't kill
the<00:03:16.409> enemy<00:03:16.680> i<00:03:16.709> mean<00:03:16.920> we<00:03:17.099> could<00:03:17.250> have<00:03:17.370> killed

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
the enemy i mean we could have killed

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.099 
the enemy i mean we could have killed
them<00:03:17.669> i<00:03:17.760> think<00:03:17.970> this<00:03:18.150> time<00:03:18.389> because<00:03:18.810> they

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
them i think this time because they

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.770 
them i think this time because they
screwed<00:03:19.500> up<00:03:19.680> but<00:03:20.030> it's<00:03:21.030> all<00:03:21.209> about<00:03:21.389> punishing

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
yeah so what happens here is that the we

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.479 
yeah so what happens here is that the we
have<00:03:51.150> TV<00:03:51.389> priority<00:03:51.810> on<00:03:51.900> them<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.680> market<00:03:53.400> has

no<00:03:53.639> TP<00:03:53.970> we<00:03:54.150> do<00:03:54.299> so<00:03:54.870> we're<00:03:55.379> basically<00:03:55.769> if<00:03:56.250> we<00:03:56.519> can

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
no TP we do so we're basically if we can

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.849 
no TP we do so we're basically if we can
basically<00:03:56.909> force<00:03:57.299> up<00:03:57.449> for<00:03:57.690> vs<00:03:58.019> 3<00:03:58.409> on<00:03:58.530> both<00:03:58.680> line

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
basically force up for vs 3 on both line

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.649 
basically force up for vs 3 on both line
