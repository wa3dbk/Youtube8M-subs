first<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.620> all<00:00:13.710> straight<00:00:14.040> talk<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.549> service

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
first of all straight talk is a service

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.290 
first of all straight talk is a service
provider<00:00:15.030> just<00:00:15.929> like<00:00:16.170> AT&amp;T<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:17.039> t-mobile<00:00:17.300> now

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
provider just like AT&amp;T and t-mobile now

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.179 
provider just like AT&amp;T and t-mobile now
the<00:00:18.750> reason<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.080> say<00:00:19.109> they're<00:00:19.470> just<00:00:19.500> like<00:00:19.890> AT&amp;T

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
the reason I say they're just like AT&amp;T

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.310 
the reason I say they're just like AT&amp;T
and<00:00:20.550> t-mobile<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:21.180> because<00:00:21.570> they<00:00:21.779> use<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
and t-mobile is because they use the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.130 
and t-mobile is because they use the
same<00:00:22.590> towers<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.609> are<00:00:23.670> used<00:00:24.060> by<00:00:24.269> AT&amp;T<00:00:24.720> and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
same towers that are used by AT&amp;T and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.589 
same towers that are used by AT&amp;T and
t-mobile<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.699> same<00:00:27.029> type<00:00:27.359> of

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
t-mobile so you get the same type of

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.300 
t-mobile so you get the same type of
connectivity<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.710> same<00:00:28.920> type<00:00:29.130> of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
connectivity and the same type of

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.400 
connectivity and the same type of
service<00:00:29.640> coverage<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.810> would<00:00:31.050> with

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
service coverage as you would with

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.760 
service coverage as you would with
companies<00:00:31.800> like<00:00:31.830> AT&amp;T<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.850> t-mobile<00:00:33.059> now<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
companies like AT&amp;T and t-mobile now the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.260 
companies like AT&amp;T and t-mobile now the
reason<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.280> good<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.760> because<00:00:35.940> they<00:00:36.210> are

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
reason this is good is because they are

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.150 
reason this is good is because they are
sharing<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.780> service<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.829> get<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.129> same

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
sharing the service and you get the same

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.420 
sharing the service and you get the same
connectivity<00:00:38.820> as<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.870> would<00:00:40.079> with<00:00:40.260> them<00:00:40.500> but
