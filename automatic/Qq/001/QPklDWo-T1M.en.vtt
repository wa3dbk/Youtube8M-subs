chocolate<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.750> lot<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.830> places<00:00:14.070> will<00:00:14.460> actually

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
chocolate a lot of places will actually

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.150

make the hot chocolate with water but I
like<00:00:17.490> using<00:00:17.910> milk<00:00:18.210> because<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:19.529> just<00:00:19.710> tastes

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
like using milk because it just tastes

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.189 
like using milk because it just tastes
way<00:00:20.340> better<00:00:20.420> so<00:00:21.420> we're<00:00:21.539> going<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> start<00:00:21.960> with

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
way better so we're going to start with

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.200 
way better so we're going to start with
putting<00:00:22.590> some<00:00:23.160> chocolate<00:00:23.519> syrup<00:00:23.730> into<00:00:24.090> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
putting some chocolate syrup into the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.570 
putting some chocolate syrup into the
cup<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:27.439> depending<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.529> what<00:00:28.949> kind<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.279> syrup

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
cup and depending on what kind of syrup

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.450 
cup and depending on what kind of syrup
you're<00:00:29.760> using<00:00:30.619> you<00:00:31.619> need<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.859> figure<00:00:32.160> out<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
you're using you need to figure out the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.190 
you're using you need to figure out the
ratio<00:00:32.870> of<00:00:33.870> chocolate<00:00:34.590> versus<00:00:35.520> milk<00:00:36.020> I'm<00:00:37.020> using

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
ratio of chocolate versus milk I'm using

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.049 
ratio of chocolate versus milk I'm using
the<00:00:37.440> organic<00:00:37.530> cocoa<00:00:38.280> communion<00:00:38.640> chocolate<00:00:38.969> so

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
the organic cocoa communion chocolate so

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.819 
the organic cocoa communion chocolate so
I'm<00:00:39.120> going<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.329> use<00:00:39.450> three<00:00:39.750> pumps<00:00:40.170> of

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
I'm going to use three pumps of

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.529 
I'm going to use three pumps of
chocolate<00:00:41.550> for<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.420> small<00:00:43.410> cup<00:00:44.090> four<00:00:45.090> pumps<00:00:45.390> are

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
chocolate for a small cup four pumps are

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.280 
chocolate for a small cup four pumps are
four<00:00:45.809> large<00:00:46.820> so

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
four large so

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.010 
four large so
then<00:00:50.290> I'm<00:00:50.590> gonna<00:00:51.360> pour<00:00:52.360> some<00:00:52.540> milk<00:00:52.690> into<00:00:52.900> my

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
then I'm gonna pour some milk into my

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.260 
then I'm gonna pour some milk into my
pitcher<00:00:53.440> steam<00:00:54.190> it<00:00:54.340> by<00:00:54.490> itself<00:00:54.820> and<00:00:55.120> the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
pitcher steam it by itself and the

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.940 
pitcher steam it by itself and the
reason<00:00:55.570> why<00:00:55.690> I'm<00:00:55.810> steaming<00:00:56.260> it<00:00:56.380> without<00:00:56.800> the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
reason why I'm steaming it without the

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.950 
reason why I'm steaming it without the
chocolate<00:00:57.130> is<00:00:57.490> so<00:00:58.210> if<00:00:58.300> I'm<00:00:58.450> making<00:00:58.600> an<00:00:58.840> odd

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
chocolate is so if I'm making an odd

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.780 
chocolate is so if I'm making an odd
drink<00:00:59.230> at<00:00:59.380> the<00:00:59.440> same<00:00:59.620> time<00:00:59.950> I<00:01:00.220> can

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
drink at the same time I can

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.670 
drink at the same time I can
that<00:01:01.210> requires<00:01:01.570> milk<00:01:01.870> I<00:01:01.990> can<00:01:02.020> actually<00:01:02.530> use

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
that requires milk I can actually use

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:11.640 
that requires milk I can actually use
that<00:01:02.890> milk<00:01:03.160> for<00:01:03.430> that<00:01:03.460> drink<00:01:03.790> -<00:01:10.230> and<00:01:11.230> I'm<00:01:11.560> gonna

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
that milk for that drink - and I'm gonna

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.770 
that milk for that drink - and I'm gonna
steam<00:01:12.070> it<00:01:12.250> like<00:01:12.430> I'm<00:01:12.700> steaming<00:01:13.030> four<00:01:13.330> elastics
