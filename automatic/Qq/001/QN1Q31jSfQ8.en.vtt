landscape<00:00:22.180> photography<00:00:22.689> is<00:00:22.869> a<00:00:22.930> creative

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
landscape photography is a creative

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.519 
landscape photography is a creative
process<00:00:23.860> and<00:00:24.310> filters<00:00:25.240> are<00:00:25.450> vital<00:00:26.110> creative

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
process and filters are vital creative

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.800 
process and filters are vital creative
tools<00:00:26.800> there<00:00:27.789> are<00:00:27.910> some<00:00:28.090> effects<00:00:28.540> that

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
tools there are some effects that

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.670 
tools there are some effects that
filters<00:00:29.650> are<00:00:30.070> able<00:00:30.550> to<00:00:30.820> impart<00:00:31.779> that<00:00:32.079> cannot

polarisers<00:00:35.890> are<00:00:36.160> a<00:00:36.190> really<00:00:36.550> good<00:00:36.699> example<00:00:36.760> of

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
polarisers are a really good example of

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.830 
polarisers are a really good example of
this<00:00:37.449> and<00:00:37.720> so<00:00:38.440> to<00:00:38.500> our<00:00:39.040> nd<00:00:39.699> standard<00:00:40.480> filters

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
this and so to our nd standard filters

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.920 
this and so to our nd standard filters
both<00:00:41.620> of<00:00:41.860> them<00:00:42.040> provide<00:00:42.519> us<00:00:42.730> with<00:00:42.940> effects

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
both of them provide us with effects

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.560 
both of them provide us with effects
that<00:00:44.170> are<00:00:44.350> are<00:00:44.739> not<00:00:45.129> reproducible<00:00:45.790> in<00:00:46.150> any

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
that are are not reproducible in any

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.780 
that are are not reproducible in any
other<00:00:46.750> way<00:00:46.989> they're<00:00:47.589> very<00:00:47.620> much<00:00:48.070> part<00:00:48.430> of<00:00:48.610> the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
other way they're very much part of the

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.299 
other way they're very much part of the
craft<00:00:49.150> of<00:00:49.449> photography<00:00:49.930> in<00:00:50.559> the<00:00:50.769> field<00:00:51.070> and

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
craft of photography in the field and

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.459 
craft of photography in the field and
I'd<00:00:51.910> now<00:00:52.150> like<00:00:52.180> to<00:00:52.539> show<00:00:52.750> you<00:00:52.809> how<00:00:53.140> they<00:00:53.289> work

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
I'd now like to show you how they work

00:00:53.469 --> 00:01:07.080 
I'd now like to show you how they work
in<00:00:53.680> practice<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.860> polarizer<00:01:06.640> is<00:01:06.940> an

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
in practice the polarizer is an

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.820 
in practice the polarizer is an
important<00:01:07.630> part<00:01:07.899> of<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.470> landscape

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
important part of the landscape

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.480 
important part of the landscape
photographers<00:01:09.399> armoury<00:01:10.240> it<00:01:10.960> it<00:01:11.590> has<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:11.979> number

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
photographers armoury it it has a number

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.240 
photographers armoury it it has a number
of<00:01:12.610> advantages<00:01:12.910> for<00:01:13.600> us<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:15.070> most

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
of advantages for us the the most

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.100 
of advantages for us the the most
obvious<00:01:15.640> one<00:01:15.910> I<00:01:15.940> think<00:01:16.119> the<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.720> one<00:01:16.869> most

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
obvious one I think the the one most

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.169 
obvious one I think the the one most
people<00:01:17.440> already<00:01:18.009> know<00:01:18.369> and<00:01:18.520> understand<00:01:18.970> is

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
people already know and understand is

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:22.499 
people already know and understand is
that<00:01:19.330> it<00:01:19.420> darkens<00:01:19.929> a<00:01:20.080> blue<00:01:20.289> sky<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:22.210> it<00:01:22.330> has

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
that it darkens a blue sky but it has

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.140 
that it darkens a blue sky but it has
other<00:01:22.720> applications<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:24.310> takes<00:01:25.060> the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
other applications it takes the

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.140 
other applications it takes the
reflections<00:01:25.689> of<00:01:26.189> vegetation<00:01:27.189> for<00:01:27.520> example<00:01:27.939> so

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
reflections of vegetation for example so

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.810 
reflections of vegetation for example so
that<00:01:28.180> often<00:01:29.049> increases<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.590> saturation<00:01:30.250> of

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
that often increases the saturation of

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.359 
that often increases the saturation of
the<00:01:30.880> colors<00:01:31.509> and<00:01:32.380> it<00:01:32.500> can<00:01:32.650> be<00:01:32.770> really<00:01:33.189> useful

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
the colors and it can be really useful

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.330 
the colors and it can be really useful
by<00:01:33.700> water<00:01:34.140> taking<00:01:35.140> off<00:01:35.259> specular<00:01:35.799> reflections

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
by water taking off specular reflections

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.030 
by water taking off specular reflections
and<00:01:36.810> also<00:01:37.810> allowing<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.259> to<00:01:38.380> see<00:01:38.650> underneath

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
and also allowing you to see underneath

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.760 
and also allowing you to see underneath
the<00:01:39.280> surface<00:01:39.640> of<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.880> water

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.650 

after<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.890> nd<00:01:48.190> grad<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.880> polarizer<00:01:49.420> is

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
after the nd grad the polarizer is

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.660 
after the nd grad the polarizer is
really<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.170> most<00:01:50.440> important<00:01:51.010> filter<00:01:51.400> that<00:01:51.550> a

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
really the most important filter that a

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.200 
really the most important filter that a
landscape<00:01:52.030> photographer<00:01:52.180> needs<00:01:53.080> and<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:55.090> an

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
landscape photographer needs and it's an

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.420 
landscape photographer needs and it's an
expensive<00:01:55.690> item<00:01:56.100> there's<00:01:57.100> no<00:01:57.220> doubt<00:01:57.400> about

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
expensive item there's no doubt about

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.870 
expensive item there's no doubt about
that

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
that

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.620 
that
but<00:01:58.210> you<00:01:59.170> only<00:01:59.350> need<00:01:59.590> one<00:01:59.980> because<00:02:00.730> the<00:02:01.180> system

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
but you only need one because the system

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.340 
but you only need one because the system
holder<00:02:02.080> has<00:02:02.350> an<00:02:02.710> external<00:02:03.340> accessory<00:02:04.120> ring<00:02:04.390> so

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
holder has an external accessory ring so

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.070 
holder has an external accessory ring so
you<00:02:05.410> have<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.560> 105<00:02:06.340> millimeter<00:02:07.080> polarizer

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
you have a 105 millimeter polarizer

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.360 
you have a 105 millimeter polarizer
right<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:10.149> fits<00:02:10.509> on<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:11.230> this<00:02:11.470> ring

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
right and that fits on to this ring

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.670 
right and that fits on to this ring
which<00:02:12.850> needs<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.480> be<00:02:13.660> attached<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.350> the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
which needs to be attached to the

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.510 
which needs to be attached to the
outside<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.490> holder<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.600> I<00:02:16.780> recommend

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
outside of the holder and I recommend

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.010 
outside of the holder and I recommend
fitting<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:19.060> polarizer

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
fitting the polarizer

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.530 
fitting the polarizer
onto<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.920> holder<00:02:21.220> before<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:22.030> put<00:02:22.209> it<00:02:22.300> on<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
onto the holder before you put it on the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.260 
onto the holder before you put it on the
camera<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.080> it's<00:02:23.680> best<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.040> hold<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.670> the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
camera and it's best to hold the the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.320 
camera and it's best to hold the the
holder<00:02:25.570> flat<00:02:25.980> just<00:02:26.980> put<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.430> polarizer<00:02:28.000> down

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
holder flat just put the polarizer down

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.080 
holder flat just put the polarizer down
on<00:02:28.510> top<00:02:28.690> of<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.709> screw<00:02:30.370> down<00:02:30.400> this<00:02:30.700> avoids

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
on top of it and screw down this avoids

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:41.670 
on top of it and screw down this avoids
the<00:02:31.300> danger<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.900> dropping

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.160 

the<00:02:42.680> polarizer<00:02:43.130> does<00:02:43.780> darken<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.960> light

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
the polarizer does darken the light

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.470 
the polarizer does darken the light
coming<00:02:45.440> into<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.740> camera<00:02:45.830> a<00:02:46.160> little<00:02:46.460> and<00:02:46.610> I

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
coming into the camera a little and I

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.590 
coming into the camera a little and I
therefore<00:02:48.380> think<00:02:48.800> it's<00:02:48.950> easiest<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.820> set<00:02:50.480> the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
therefore think it's easiest to set the

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.960 
therefore think it's easiest to set the
orientation<00:02:50.720> of<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.500> polarizer<00:02:51.730> before<00:02:52.730> you

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
orientation of the polarizer before you

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.410 
orientation of the polarizer before you
put<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.300> on<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:54.050> camera<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:55.210> it's<00:02:56.210> worth

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
put it on the camera and it's worth

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.960 
put it on the camera and it's worth
pointing<00:02:56.780> out<00:02:56.960> that<00:02:57.020> it's<00:02:57.560> in<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.190> rotating

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
pointing out that it's in a rotating

this picture the waterfall at the bottom

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.740 
is very very brightly lit and I think I
can<00:04:15.200> improve<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:16.040> image<00:04:16.190> further<00:04:16.700> and<00:04:17.030> also

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
can improve the image further and also

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.930 
can improve the image further and also
