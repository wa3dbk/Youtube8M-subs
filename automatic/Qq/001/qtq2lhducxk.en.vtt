double ultra rare pack unfortunately

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.010 
double ultra rare pack unfortunately
because<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.670> ultra-rare<00:01:54.240> pull<00:01:54.540> rate<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.869> so

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
because the ultra-rare pull rate is so

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.020 
because the ultra-rare pull rate is so
high<00:01:55.049> on<00:01:55.229> legendary<00:01:55.710> treasures<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.640> ultra

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
rares are worth almost nothing so that's

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.109
