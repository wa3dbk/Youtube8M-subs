we<00:02:59.440> will<00:02:59.680> start<00:03:00.010> at<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.280> top<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:01.630> agent<00:03:02.080> is

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
we will start at the top the agent is

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.250 
we will start at the top the agent is
the<00:03:02.260> pathogen<00:03:02.650> germ<00:03:03.460> bug<00:03:03.880> what<00:03:04.180> have<00:03:04.330> you<00:03:04.420> so

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
the pathogen germ bug what have you so

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.900 
the pathogen germ bug what have you so
let's<00:03:05.830> say<00:03:06.010> our<00:03:06.160> agent<00:03:06.580> is<00:03:07.230> eco<00:03:08.230> like<00:03:08.410> a<00:03:08.910> nasty

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
let's say our agent is eco like a nasty

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.810 
let's say our agent is eco like a nasty
little<00:03:10.030> bar<00:03:10.270> okay<00:03:10.510> exactly<00:03:11.020> so<00:03:11.800> our<00:03:12.070> agent<00:03:12.670> is

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
little bar okay exactly so our agent is

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.330 
little bar okay exactly so our agent is
eco<00:03:13.330> like<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.900> reservoir<00:03:14.470> is<00:03:14.650> our<00:03:14.830> own<00:03:15.010> GI

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
eco like the reservoir is our own GI

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:32.290 
eco like the reservoir is our own GI
tract<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:16.330> portal<00:03:16.840> of<00:03:16.930> exit<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.770> get<00:03:18.700> it

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:50.030 

you

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.099
