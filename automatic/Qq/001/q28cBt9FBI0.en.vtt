in in housing here in the downtown

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.410 
in in housing here in the downtown
district<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.769> doesn't<00:02:36.070> stop<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.850> I<00:02:37.209> think

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
district so it doesn't stop and I think

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.820 
district so it doesn't stop and I think

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
think the importance of attracting

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.920 
think the importance of attracting
retail<00:04:42.740> or<00:04:43.070> visitors<00:04:43.730> to<00:04:43.940> a<00:04:43.970> community<00:04:44.480> and<00:04:44.630> is

retail or visitors to a community and is

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.450 
retail or visitors to a community and is
not<00:04:45.169> just<00:04:45.200> the<00:04:45.590> streetscape<00:04:45.950> it's<00:04:46.220> what's

not just the streetscape it's what's

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.950 
not just the streetscape it's what's

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
underneath and that's the geothermal

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.610 
underneath and that's the geothermal
district<00:04:48.500> system<00:04:49.090> I<00:04:50.090> think<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.630> importance

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
district system I think the importance

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.050 
district system I think the importance
of<00:04:51.710> that<00:04:52.240> is<00:04:53.240> that<00:04:53.300> we're<00:04:54.140> bringing<00:04:54.400> an<00:04:55.400> energy

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
of that is that we're bringing an energy

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.270 
of that is that we're bringing an energy
