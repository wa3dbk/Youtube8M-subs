over<00:03:18.810> your<00:03:18.959> hockey<00:03:19.290> stick<00:03:19.370> so<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:21.299> a

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
over your hockey stick so that is a

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.570 
over your hockey stick so that is a
quick<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:21.840> easy<00:03:21.930> solution<00:03:22.140> but<00:03:22.950> I'd<00:03:23.280> say<00:03:23.459> I'd

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
quick and easy solution but I'd say I'd

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.520 
quick and easy solution but I'd say I'd
recommend<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.269> demo<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.930> if<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.380> had<00:03:25.500> a

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
recommend the demo of if you had a

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.930 
recommend the demo of if you had a
hockey<00:03:25.980> team<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.400> wanted<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.700> get<00:03:26.880> the

whole<00:03:27.090> hockey<00:03:27.239> team<00:03:27.480> using<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.019> you<00:03:28.110> can

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
whole hockey team using it so you can

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.930 
whole hockey team using it so you can
get<00:03:28.680> each<00:03:28.799> different<00:03:29.070> player<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.430> try<00:03:29.580> it<00:03:29.730> and

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
get each different player to try it and

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.270 
get each different player to try it and
use<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.080> really<00:03:31.290> push<00:03:31.470> that<00:03:31.620> point<00:03:31.920> home<00:03:32.100> of

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
use it to really push that point home of

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.250 
use it to really push that point home of
not<00:03:32.430> gripping<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.850> hockey<00:03:33.660> stick<00:03:33.900> too<00:03:34.049> tight

fingers to sort of grip it a little bit

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.640 
fingers to sort of grip it a little bit
so<00:04:33.120> when<00:04:33.270> I'm<00:04:33.360> stickhandling<00:04:33.960> you<00:04:34.349> know<00:04:34.440> when

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
so when I'm stickhandling you know when

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.499 
so when I'm stickhandling you know when
I<00:04:34.710> do<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.919> odd<00:04:35.039> move<00:04:35.280> like<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.610> toe<00:04:35.970> drag<00:04:36.210> I

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
I do the odd move like the toe drag I

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.110 
I do the odd move like the toe drag I
like<00:04:37.169> to<00:04:37.289> use<00:04:37.409> my<00:04:37.590> hands<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:38.610> sort<00:04:38.789> of<00:04:38.849> grip<00:04:39.030> the

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
like to use my hands to sort of grip the

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.999 
like to use my hands to sort of grip the
stick<00:04:39.300> at<00:04:39.479> one<00:04:39.629> point<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.139> then<00:04:40.530> pull<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:40.889> in

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
stick at one point and then pull it in

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.040 
stick at one point and then pull it in
so<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.340> stick<00:04:42.060> can't<00:04:42.270> slide<00:04:42.509> through<00:04:42.750> so<00:04:42.930> with

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
so the stick can't slide through so with

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.869 
so the stick can't slide through so with
the<00:04:43.169> PVC<00:04:43.500> pipe<00:04:43.770> it's<00:04:44.190> always<00:04:44.490> sliding<00:04:44.819> no

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:44.879 
the PVC pipe it's always sliding no

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:46.010 
the PVC pipe it's always sliding no
matter<00:04:45.030> what<00:04:45.240> you<00:04:45.330> can't<00:04:45.509> really<00:04:45.659> get<00:04:45.810> a<00:04:45.840> grip
