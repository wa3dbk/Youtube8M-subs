00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:12.719
 new chess game I would say so 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:18.090
 do not play games I play games 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:21.539
 I play games playfully okay he 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.760
 would like to play groupie attack that 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.070
 I allow 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:31.939
 he does not play well then play 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.939
 I'm holding something else 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.170
 Now we have to change 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:50.520
 a normal position 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:56.340
 get from the kite that the normal 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.489
 dragon he wants to trade immediately 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.379
 here if I 'm allowed to go here again 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.129
 he likes to try then i take out 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.500
 and wins springer well I want 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:18.689
 Of course now the dangerous variant 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:21.259
 play with g and h 4 me too here though 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.259
 not yet 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:36.290
 I save that I have to look at times 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:39.050
 I do not think so now I hope so 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:45.100
 a 1901 opponent 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.100
 well, great mum look what happens 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.979
 the hand 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.209
 here also nice little that would be 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.819
 but there it has something springer 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.780
 Nest yourself here 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:25.040
 maybe the runner will fail it 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.040
 always possible 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.610
 because that is always possible 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.830
 yes I am a memorial as long as I am not 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:53.940
 I do not know yet 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.940
 can see 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.010
 springer 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.080
 I believe here too threatens anyway 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.110
 right around the other gates too 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.110
 can 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.980
 I do not know why that too here 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.730
 Usually important before you stop 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.140
 attacking myself , I guess that leaves me 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.920
 surely somehow now 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.849
 take advantage of what my king is doing with it 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.480
 Do you want that? I want that now 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:34.540
 not gone now I won 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.630
 that has been a stupid lot there is 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.640
 yes, nothing has happened yet 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:44.050
 well then, I'll stop 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.700
 then recovered are already planning another 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.000
 Partie or yes so it's good to see 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.000
 dance
