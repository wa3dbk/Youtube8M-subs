00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.139 

I<00:00:00.149> love<00:00:00.900> his<00:00:01.050> friends<00:00:01.560> yes<00:00:02.399> another<00:00:02.639> bookmark

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
I love his friends yes another bookmark

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.619 
I love his friends yes another bookmark
but<00:00:03.780> I<00:00:04.020> think<00:00:04.470> it's<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.460> blast<00:00:05.940> for<00:00:06.540> the

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
but I think it's a blast for the

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.890 
but I think it's a blast for the
momentum<00:00:06.870> because<00:00:07.859> it<00:00:08.550> is<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.030> last<00:00:09.269> book

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
momentum because it is the last book

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.720 
momentum because it is the last book
marker<00:00:10.559> there<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.030> have<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:13.610> in<00:00:14.610> this

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
marker there that I have and so in this

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.810 
marker there that I have and so in this
case<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.509> pattern<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:16.080> really<00:00:16.890> very<00:00:17.220> simple

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
case the pattern is really very simple

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.200 
case the pattern is really very simple
it's<00:00:18.390> always<00:00:19.199> an<00:00:19.590> odd<00:00:19.800> count<00:00:20.039> peyote<00:00:20.789> stitch

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
it's always an odd count peyote stitch

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.630 
it's always an odd count peyote stitch
and<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.990> can<00:00:22.170> find<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> pattern<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:23.160> this

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
and you can find the pattern of this

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.460 
and you can find the pattern of this
