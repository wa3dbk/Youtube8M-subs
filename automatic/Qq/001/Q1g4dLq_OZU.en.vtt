00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
cars a 2008 39 m5 I believe the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.790 
cars a 2008 39 m5 I believe the
procedure<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.600> going<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.869> be<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.140> same<00:00:19.410> for

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
procedure is going to be the same for

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.250 
procedure is going to be the same for
about<00:00:20.160> any<00:00:20.520> BMW<00:00:21.090> part<00:00:21.720> numbers<00:00:22.050> maybe

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
about any BMW part numbers maybe

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.560 
about any BMW part numbers maybe
slightly<00:00:22.769> different<00:00:23.279> but<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.460> believe<00:00:23.760> any<00:00:24.000> e39

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
slightly different but I believe any e39

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.410 
slightly different but I believe any e39
that<00:00:25.410> doesn't<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:25.890> those<00:00:26.609> 528<00:00:27.420> or<00:00:27.599> style<00:00:28.160> 525

the same way notice these are a little
bit<00:00:34.200> different<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.829> noticed<00:00:35.160> over<00:00:35.280> Timmy<00:00:35.640> fest

that we attended in June that a lot of
the<00:00:38.309> m5s<00:00:38.700> had<00:00:38.969> these<00:00:39.180> different<00:00:39.600> caps<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:40.110> them

mine<00:00:40.980> as<00:00:41.280> far<00:00:41.460> as<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.670> know<00:00:41.730> our<00:00:42.180> original<00:00:42.719> OEM

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.500 
mine as far as I know our original OEM
to<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.559> car<00:00:43.770> never<00:00:44.129> been<00:00:44.340> changed<00:00:44.610> notice<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
to the car never been changed notice the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.420 
to the car never been changed notice the
condition<00:00:45.719> here<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:46.440> not<00:00:46.530> too<00:00:46.770> bad<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.219> have

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
condition here it's not too bad we have

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.049 
condition here it's not too bad we have
a<00:00:47.489> couple<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.969> bubbles<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:50.070> finish

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
a couple of bubbles and the the finish

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.630 
a couple of bubbles and the the finish
here<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.050> think<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.129> going<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.430> look<00:00:53.579> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
here so I think this is going to look a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.220 
here so I think this is going to look a
little<00:00:53.850> bit<00:00:54.030> nicer<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.420> there<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.719> notice<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
little bit nicer in there and notice the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.799 
little bit nicer in there and notice the
border<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.100> outline<00:00:56.550> around<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.120> badge<00:00:57.420> is

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
border the outline around the badge is

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.810 
border the outline around the badge is
definitely<00:00:58.410> different<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.340> kind<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.640> a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
definitely different this is kind of a

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.270 
definitely different this is kind of a
cheap<00:01:00.180> gray<00:01:00.629> matte<00:01:00.989> plastic<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.920> definitely

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
cheap gray matte plastic that definitely

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.030 
cheap gray matte plastic that definitely
looks<00:01:02.579> at<00:01:02.760> sage<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.780> looks<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.379> lot<00:01:04.530> more<00:01:04.799> like

one
I'm<00:02:13.110> going<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.349> take<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.650> new<00:02:13.799> one<00:02:14.030> line<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.209> up

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
I'm going to take the new one line it up

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:20.690 
I'm going to take the new one line it up
like<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:17.150> push<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.319> clips<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:19.950> and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
like so and push and it clips in and

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.330 
like so and push and it clips in and
looks<00:02:21.000> really<00:02:21.689> nice<00:02:21.900> looking<00:02:22.680> here<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.099> new

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
looks really nice looking here this new

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.509 
looks really nice looking here this new
one<00:02:23.549> is<00:02:23.700> definitely<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.450> higher-quality<00:02:25.519> new

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
one is definitely a higher-quality new

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.190 
one is definitely a higher-quality new
style<00:02:26.879> part<00:02:27.299> here<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.569> looks<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.930> little<00:02:27.989> bit

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
style part here that looks a little bit

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.750 
style part here that looks a little bit
more<00:02:28.319> modern<00:02:28.709> notice<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.099> typeface<00:02:29.549> is

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
more modern notice the typeface is

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.039 
more modern notice the typeface is
different<00:02:30.120> but<00:02:30.239> really<00:02:30.510> it's<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:30.720> ring

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
different but really it's the ring

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.220 
different but really it's the ring
around<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.500> edge<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.359> it's<00:02:33.359> a<00:02:33.599> lot<00:02:33.900> more

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
around the edge and it's a lot more

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.410 
around the edge and it's a lot more
reflective<00:02:35.069> because<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.760> seems<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.150> be<00:02:36.180> made

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
reflective because it seems to be made

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.349 
reflective because it seems to be made
out<00:02:36.599> of<00:02:36.629> a<00:02:36.840> slightly<00:02:37.260> different<00:02:37.470> material

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
out of a slightly different material

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.750 
out of a slightly different material
backing<00:02:39.359> here<00:02:39.599> works<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.019> same<00:02:40.230> way<00:02:40.470> my<00:02:41.099> new

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
backing here works the same way my new

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.490 
backing here works the same way my new
one<00:02:41.909> is<00:02:42.030> obviously<00:02:42.450> quite<00:02:42.629> a<00:02:42.720> bit<00:02:42.930> cleaner<00:02:43.230> and

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
one is obviously quite a bit cleaner and

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.860 
one is obviously quite a bit cleaner and
a<00:02:44.099> little<00:02:44.280> bit<00:02:44.370> more<00:02:44.700> uniform<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.359> it's<00:02:45.540> clips

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
a little bit more uniform and it's clips

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.160 
a little bit more uniform and it's clips
but<00:02:46.430> it's<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.549> nice<00:02:47.700> fresher<00:02:48.180> updated<00:02:48.870> look<00:02:48.989> to

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
but it's a nice fresher updated look to

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.750 
but it's a nice fresher updated look to
the<00:02:49.260> outside<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.769> car<00:02:49.980> if<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.400> care<00:02:50.670> about

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
the outside of the car if you care about

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.250 
the outside of the car if you care about
doing<00:02:51.120> little<00:02:51.329> things<00:02:51.420> like<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.139> it's

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
doing little things like that and it's

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.020 
doing little things like that and it's
the<00:02:52.379> border<00:02:52.739> around<00:02:52.859> the<00:02:53.190> edge<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.760> really

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
the border around the edge that I really

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.550 
the border around the edge that I really
like<00:02:54.180> about<00:02:54.209> this<00:02:54.690> because<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.989> other<00:02:55.109> one<00:02:55.319> is

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
like about this because the other one is

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.800 
like about this because the other one is
definitely<00:02:55.799> a<00:02:56.040> separate<00:02:56.459> part<00:02:56.760> from<00:02:57.030> badges

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
definitely a separate part from badges

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.179 
definitely a separate part from badges
found<00:02:58.019> elsewhere<00:02:58.260> on<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.709> car<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.099> this

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
the side pry out like that

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.409 
the side pry out like that
two<00:03:18.239> easy<00:03:18.560> drops<00:03:19.560> down<00:03:19.879> set<00:03:20.879> the<00:03:21.030> old<00:03:21.120> one<00:03:21.299> up
