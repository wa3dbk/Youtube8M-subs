00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
I in early June the reason why this is

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.430 
I in early June the reason why this is
significant<00:03:23.970> is<00:03:24.090> because<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.630> back<00:03:24.900> camera

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
significant is because the back camera

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.060 
significant is because the back camera
lens<00:03:25.769> on<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.040> iphone<00:03:27.030> 4<00:03:27.360> is<00:03:27.540> an<00:03:28.140> omni<00:03:28.650> vision

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070
