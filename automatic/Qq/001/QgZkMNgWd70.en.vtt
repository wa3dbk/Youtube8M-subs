00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
technology and the best and brightest of

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.250 
technology and the best and brightest of
our<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.780> humanity<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.950> earth<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:36.300> because

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
our of the humanity on earth and because

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.180 
our of the humanity on earth and because
of<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.440> they<00:02:37.560> become<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.860> target<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.100> in

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
of that they become a target and so in

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.740 
of that they become a target and so in
order<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.400> save<00:02:41.640> themselves<00:02:42.230> they<00:02:43.230> have<00:02:43.470> to

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
order to save themselves they have to

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.350 
order to save themselves they have to
hijack<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.560> Academy<00:02:47.070> so<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.280> speak<00:02:47.610> using

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
hijack the Academy so to speak using

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.530 
hijack the Academy so to speak using
some<00:02:48.570> fold<00:02:49.110> technology<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:51.120> they<00:02:51.300> leave

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
some fold technology and and they leave

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.360 
some fold technology and and they leave
earth<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.230> entire<00:02:52.470> Academy<00:02:52.650> trying<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.280> go

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
earth of the entire Academy trying to go

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.040 
earth of the entire Academy trying to go
after<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.760> expeditionary<00:02:54.510> force<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:54.960> it's

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
after the expeditionary force and it's

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.020 
after the expeditionary force and it's
all<00:02:55.170> about<00:02:55.350> what<00:02:55.530> happens

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
all about what happens

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.660 
all about what happens
relationships<00:02:57.050> and<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.680> all<00:02:58.800> takes<00:02:59.010> place<00:02:59.310> in

oh<00:03:05.780> my<00:03:06.780> parenting<00:03:07.260> binary<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.770> course<00:03:11.660> I<00:03:13.280> would

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
oh my parenting binary of course I would

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.180 
oh my parenting binary of course I would
say<00:03:14.610> that<00:03:15.030> my<00:03:15.180> favorite<00:03:15.210> piece<00:03:16.200> of<00:03:16.440> technology

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
say that my favorite piece of technology

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.300 
say that my favorite piece of technology
was<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.940> cycle<00:03:18.540> is<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.680> fact<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.280> a

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
was the cycle is the fact that a

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.000 
was the cycle is the fact that a
motorcycle<00:03:21.150> could<00:03:21.300> wrap<00:03:21.600> around<00:03:22.020> you<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.530> you

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
motorcycle could wrap around you and you

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.240 
motorcycle could wrap around you and you
could<00:03:23.190> wear<00:03:23.520> it<00:03:24.200> made<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.470> very<00:03:25.980> very

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
could wear it made that very very

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.040 
could wear it made that very very
unusual<00:03:26.820> among<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.180> mecha<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.720> made<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:28.020> very

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
unusual among the mecha it made it very

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.620 
unusual among the mecha it made it very
personal<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.550> that's<00:03:29.790> why<00:03:30.030> I<00:03:30.060> appreciated

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
personal and so that's why I appreciated

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.690 
personal and so that's why I appreciated
that<00:03:30.900> design<00:03:31.170> so<00:03:31.380> much<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:32.070> plus<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.490> fact

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
that design so much and plus the fact

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.910 
that design so much and plus the fact
that<00:03:32.820> it<00:03:32.940> was<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.270> complicated<00:03:33.990> to<00:03:34.350> transform

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
that it was so complicated to transform

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.260 
that it was so complicated to transform
that<00:03:35.370> if<00:03:35.580> you<00:03:35.670> can<00:03:35.820> figure<00:03:35.970> out<00:03:36.090> how<00:03:36.240> to

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
that if you can figure out how to

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.000 
that if you can figure out how to
transform<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:37.050> thing<00:03:37.320> but<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:37.800> in<00:03:37.920> itself

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
transform that thing but that in itself

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.770 
transform that thing but that in itself
was<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.460> bragging<00:03:38.880> right<00:03:39.030> back<00:03:39.270> then<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.690> know
