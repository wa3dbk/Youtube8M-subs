00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
a hole into the target so it'll pull it

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.499 
a hole into the target so it'll pull it
out<00:01:52.590> it's<00:01:52.739> not<00:01:52.830> destroying<00:01:53.220> everything<00:01:53.509> but

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
out it's not destroying everything but

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.790 
out it's not destroying everything but
we<00:01:54.929> just<00:01:55.020> thought<00:01:55.170> it'd<00:01:55.319> be<00:01:55.349> interesting<00:01:55.410> to

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
show you that ok so just cut out a few

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:07.020 
show you that ok so just cut out a few
arrows<00:01:59.729> put<00:01:59.940> in<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.119> older<00:02:00.360> here

all good when I told his area shop to a
little<00:05:21.099> bit<00:05:21.189> hi<00:05:21.370> there

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:21.819 
little bit hi there

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:24.480 
little bit hi there
but<00:05:22.479> he<00:05:22.599> tried<00:05:22.839> to<00:05:22.990> compensate<00:05:23.469> with<00:05:24.249> the<00:05:24.309> pin

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
but he tried to compensate with the pin

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.659 
but he tried to compensate with the pin
adjustment<00:05:24.999> it's<00:05:25.870> what<00:05:26.020> we'd<00:05:26.110> have<00:05:26.199> to<00:05:26.259> do<00:05:26.669> for

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
adjustment it's what we'd have to do for

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.469 
adjustment it's what we'd have to do for
the<00:05:27.759> longer<00:05:28.029> shots<00:05:28.589> see<00:05:29.589> the<00:05:29.710> different<00:05:30.009> pins

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
the longer shots see the different pins

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.600 
the longer shots see the different pins
they<00:05:31.479> are<00:05:31.599> aim<00:05:31.719> off<00:05:31.900> points<00:05:32.339> so<00:05:33.339> you<00:05:33.430> get<00:05:33.550> the

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
they are aim off points so you get the

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.700 
they are aim off points so you get the
height<00:05:33.789> from<00:05:33.939> the<00:05:34.029> angle<00:05:34.330> of<00:05:34.389> the<00:05:34.509> boat<00:05:34.719> so<00:05:35.620> the

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
height from the angle of the boat so the

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.769 
height from the angle of the boat so the
arrows<00:05:35.949> dropped<00:05:36.219> into<00:05:36.370> the<00:05:36.580> same<00:05:36.789> the<00:05:37.599> same

arrows dropped into the same the same

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.439 
arrows dropped into the same the same
area<00:05:38.229> the<00:05:38.409> further<00:05:38.740> you<00:05:38.889> go<00:05:39.039> back<00:05:39.279> have<00:05:40.150> pretty
