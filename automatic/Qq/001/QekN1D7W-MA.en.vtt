00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.599
 Now it will be a password 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.599
 each of us has a bunch of different accounts 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:15.719
 in different on different sites 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.430
 whether it's some kind of social network 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.870
 let's say kira classmates 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.550
 contact 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.130
 also other passwords we have 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.130
 on the mailbox but we are good 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.240
 on different sphere sohei so on 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.140
 that is, a bunch of a bunch of password 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.140
 in any case do not specify 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.200
 or 11 4 5 6 7 8 it will not add to the virus 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.620
 if a 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.240
 add a couple more workshop 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.240
 either they are months of war birth 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.220
 or you arteka 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.710
 this is all standards and password 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.710
 whose mother 8 is very fast 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.430
 password must be mixed 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.170
 of 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.860
 Latin xx sides 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.960
 and trace 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.820
 perfect if anyone would 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.690
 how big and only small mixed 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.370
 mixed with numbers 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.230
 sometimes it must be at least leaves 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.230
 strength then he will be truly safer 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.580
 in order to create a password 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.250
 exist 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.180
 Soros scientists I propose 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.120
 took advantage of soy nose 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.940
 Ambassador point ru 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.190
 that is, you go to this site 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.820
 read different articles dedicated 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.960
 password 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.990
 and the password generator will open 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.579
 let's go point by point first of all 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.820
 which will have your password that is 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.680
 there is 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.520
 first datsika then 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.060
 capital letters 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.060
 small side 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.290
 you can add some of your own 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.830
 For example, all the specials or remove it 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.590
 some side 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.970
 then specify which letters will be 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.750
 small capital letters 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.360
 and know you can be generous 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.670
 learn this success of all of them also 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.020
 called 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.229
 Here such here for example to ask for 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.630
 running faces are strong 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.099
 quotes 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.619
 asterisks and so on 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:13.689
 you can basically batenin is because 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.019
 what are they so 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.019
 the broth is true enough porn 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:22.090
 but here you specify for but sometimes lazy hay 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:24.769
 recommended costs 10 and the number of password 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.209
 which can 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.889
 it's already 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:28.959
 as you please 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.340
 and push the button 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.559
 create a pair 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:33.449
 then to your post 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:35.379
 ten different passwords 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.989
 who accidentally general ao not 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.459
 think these passwords are possible 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.179
 have themselves will follow 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:45.569
 it is put in by chance in absolutely the manner 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.199
 lead in development 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.069
 and I've never seen a network 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.949
 that is, it is only for you dates 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:53.930
 from here we choose any password 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.439
 for example the first 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.419
 recorded it somewhere and here such 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:00.859
 password 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.029
 they are securely they are as secure as possible 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:05.559
 you can also 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.659
 thieves personally prime minister ian sometimes 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.309
 for example will stand 15 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:12.219
 long 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:13.749
 let's start 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.269
 of generate already much more complicated 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:16.769
 password 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.769
 these are very very difficult to crack 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:23.059
 so I hope it is now clear that 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:24.659
 Bush refused 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.779
 in such simple passwords 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:31.189
 and use such password alternately 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.849
 using the capital little side 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.169
 numbers 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.759
 and various spices a little also you always 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.689
 must remember that 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.689
 for example 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.949
 passwords 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.949
 by the way kana 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.009
 this is the password 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:57.259
 they are sensitive credits 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:00.569
 that is, if indicated initially 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.519
 small co you should always keep 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.039
 small letter if you write suddenly 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:07.069
 big all this is no longer going 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.969
 on this i finish this pic video 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:10.419
 rock 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:11.609
 Thank you for watching
