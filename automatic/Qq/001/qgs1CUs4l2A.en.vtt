 not always the head has room for details 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.609
 technicians of a flight pressurization for example what is this 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:13.199
 agency but we never know for sure what you want without a shadow of 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:17.029
 This is one of the first lessons of the civil aviation school. 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.450
 the arbitration of altitude between the turbine 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.890
 passes through processes that control the temperature inside the airplane valves 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.700
 regulates the air pressure causing it to have faster than quit this 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.890
 until the pressurization that makes it possible to breathe inside the airplane 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.660
 studying failures in this process is also important 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.970
 emergency is part of the craft to depressurise that the air intake 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.940
 unexpectedly caused by some failure may occur at different levels 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.339
 one of them is factual the explosive depressurising marry the father feel bad 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:57.660
 last 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.840
 very cheated the flight and did not cook there is no confirmation that it has 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.899
 been the problem that led to the fall of the aircraft from the 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.359
 but according to medical experts the space age it is very likely that the 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:14.859
 depressurising was the cause of the death of passengers 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.320
 the last communication I go four 4 7 sent to the company to air 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.960
 france 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.740
 he warned that the cabin had been depressurised 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.870
 the nespresso decision was the consequence of a 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.740
 was a unique moment with an intricate with uncontrolled air intake to 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.640
 plane temperature stays the same as everyone expects 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.060
 at high altitudes as in the case of the air france flight 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.280
 the air is cold and thin and hard to breathe 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.000
 lack of oxygen in a short time causes serious damage to the body until 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.790
 loss of consciousness due to 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.500
 at 30,000 to 35,000 feet 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.850
 a bully pug together of awareness that will range between 30 seconds and two 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.220
 minutes
