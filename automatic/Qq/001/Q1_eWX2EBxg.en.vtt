right now but I did want to talk about a
couple<00:00:13.200> things<00:00:13.559> first<00:00:14.280> off<00:00:14.549> people<00:00:14.910> were

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
couple things first off people were

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.960 
couple things first off people were
asking<00:00:15.450> me<00:00:15.920> Sarah<00:00:16.920> ascend<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.490> seems<00:00:17.520> very

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
asking me Sarah ascend it seems very

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.269 
asking me Sarah ascend it seems very
overpowered<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.140> one<00:00:19.439> for<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.740> 11

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
overpowered this is the one for the 11

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.609 
overpowered this is the one for the 11
lifelink<00:00:21.180> creature<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.840> if<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.109> have<00:00:22.289> over

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
lifelink creature that if you have over

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.730 
lifelink creature that if you have over
30<00:00:22.859> life<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:24.090> gets<00:00:24.240> plus<00:00:24.539> five<00:00:24.750> plus<00:00:25.019> five<00:00:25.320> and

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
30 life it gets plus five plus five and

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.130 
30 life it gets plus five plus five and
flying<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.820> would<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.150> 66<00:00:27.750> flying

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
flying so you would have a 66 flying

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.490 
flying so you would have a 66 flying
lifelink<00:00:28.740> creature<00:00:29.510> and<00:00:30.510> while<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.289> isn't

that's<00:01:14.909> not<00:01:15.210> going<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.479> happen<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:16.320> then<00:01:16.439> I

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
that's not going to happen but then I

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.840 
that's not going to happen but then I
started<00:01:16.710> doing<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.070> little<00:01:17.100> research<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.729> was

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
started doing a little research I was

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.109 
started doing a little research I was
trying<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.090> figure<00:01:18.390> out<00:01:18.450> ok<00:01:19.259> well<00:01:19.970> when<00:01:20.970> you

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
trying to figure out ok well when you

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.460 
trying to figure out ok well when you
were<00:01:21.210> playing<00:01:21.360> two-headed<00:01:21.840> giant<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.380> you

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
were playing two-headed giant and you

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.070 
were playing two-headed giant and you
start<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:22.860> Sarah<00:01:23.130> ascended<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:24.930> just

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
start with Sarah ascended so do you just

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.609 
start with Sarah ascended so do you just
start<00:01:25.790> with<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.820> full<00:01:27.210> 66<00:01:28.080> flying<00:01:28.350> creature

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
start with the full 66 flying creature

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.219 
start with the full 66 flying creature
since<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.670> are<00:01:29.700> technically<00:01:30.420> 30<00:01:30.720> life<00:01:30.960> or

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
since you are technically 30 life or

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.810 
since you are technically 30 life or
does<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.409> count<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.490> guys<00:01:32.670> have

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
does it count it as you guys have

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.539 
does it count it as you guys have
separate<00:01:33.119> life<00:01:33.299> totals<00:01:33.780> does<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.369> card

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
separate life totals does it is the card

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.039 
separate life totals does it is the card
band<00:01:35.850> or<00:01:36.210> anything<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.570> well<00:01:36.869> I

surprising<00:03:14.209> but<00:03:14.389> if<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.840> can<00:03:15.170> see<00:03:15.319> how<00:03:15.470> I<00:03:15.500> just

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
surprising but if you can see how I just

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.740 
surprising but if you can see how I just
went<00:03:15.799> through<00:03:15.920> like<00:03:16.069> tons<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:16.970> tons<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:17.480> tons

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
went through like tons and tons and tons

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.589 
went through like tons and tons and tons
of<00:03:18.019> restarts<00:03:18.560> of<00:03:18.680> games<00:03:18.889> and<00:03:19.209> still<00:03:20.209> did<00:03:20.569> not

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
of restarts of games and still did not

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.750 
of restarts of games and still did not
get<00:03:20.840> manis<00:03:21.170> food<00:03:21.410> or<00:03:21.650> manna<00:03:21.859> flooded<00:03:22.310> once<00:03:22.489> so

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
get manis food or manna flooded once so

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.720 
get manis food or manna flooded once so
it<00:03:23.049> is<00:03:24.049> it<00:03:24.319> is<00:03:24.500> possible<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.099> again<00:03:25.310> we<00:03:25.489> won't

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
it is it is possible and again we won't

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.759 
it is it is possible and again we won't
know<00:03:25.849> until<00:03:25.970> final<00:03:26.450> game<00:03:26.630> comes<00:03:26.870> out<00:03:27.019> yeah

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
know until final game comes out yeah

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.280 
know until final game comes out yeah
that<00:03:28.310> there<00:03:28.609> is<00:03:28.760> no<00:03:28.940> Mulligan<00:03:29.329> abut<00:03:29.750> there<00:03:30.139> is

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
that there is no Mulligan abut there is

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.379 
that there is no Mulligan abut there is
some<00:03:30.590> kind<00:03:30.799> of<00:03:30.889> algorithm<00:03:31.190> in<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.609> game<00:03:31.819> that

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
some kind of algorithm in the game that

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.059 
some kind of algorithm in the game that
makes<00:03:32.569> it<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:32.959> you<00:03:33.349> can't<00:03:33.739> that<00:03:33.950> you'll

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
makes it so that you can't that you'll

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.039 
makes it so that you can't that you'll
always<00:03:34.250> have<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:34.519> balanced<00:03:35.120> starting<00:03:35.660> hand<00:03:35.900> so

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
always have a balanced starting hand so

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.089 
always have a balanced starting hand so
you're<00:03:36.200> not<00:03:36.290> going<00:03:36.440> there<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:36.829> get<00:03:36.950> totally

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
you're not going there and get totally

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.370 
you're not going there and get totally
screwed<00:03:37.549> by<00:03:37.700> luck<00:03:37.910> or<00:03:38.209> totally<00:03:38.930> helped<00:03:39.200> by

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
screwed by luck or totally helped by

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.129 
screwed by luck or totally helped by
luck<00:03:39.590> either<00:03:39.799> way<00:03:40.810> you're<00:03:41.810> always<00:03:41.840> gonna<00:03:42.019> have

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
luck either way you're always gonna have

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.479 
luck either way you're always gonna have
some<00:03:42.380> kind<00:03:42.530> of<00:03:42.560> balanced<00:03:42.950> hand<00:03:43.099> so<00:03:43.220> I<00:03:43.250> don't

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
some kind of balanced hand so I don't

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.640 
some kind of balanced hand so I don't
know<00:03:43.579> if<00:03:43.790> that's<00:03:43.970> permanent<00:03:44.419> and<00:03:44.540> I<00:03:45.200> could<00:03:45.470> you

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
know if that's permanent and I could you

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.659 
know if that's permanent and I could you
know<00:03:45.680> some<00:03:46.010> people<00:03:46.220> are<00:03:46.280> gonna<00:03:46.370> be<00:03:46.489> angry

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
know some people are gonna be angry

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.159 
know some people are gonna be angry
about<00:03:46.849> that<00:03:47.150> some<00:03:47.419> people<00:03:47.660> can<00:03:47.810> be<00:03:47.840> happy

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169 
about that some people can be happy

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:49.960 
about that some people can be happy
about<00:03:48.290> that<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:48.680> could<00:03:49.099> go<00:03:49.160> either<00:03:49.400> way<00:03:49.519> on<00:03:49.700> it

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
about that I could go either way on it

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.490 
about that I could go either way on it
but<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.120> am<00:03:50.299> slightly<00:03:50.630> concerned<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:51.319> I<00:03:51.349> did

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
but I am slightly concerned that I did

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.789 
but I am slightly concerned that I did
not<00:03:51.530> draw<00:03:51.859> saris<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:52.459> it's<00:03:52.609> once<00:03:53.560> which<00:03:54.560> made

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
not draw saris and it's once which made

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.379 
not draw saris and it's once which made
me<00:03:54.980> think<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:55.430> know<00:03:55.549> is<00:03:55.730> there<00:03:55.910> more<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.299> the

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
me think you know is there more to the

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.150 
me think you know is there more to the
algorithm<00:03:56.900> that<00:03:57.169> other<00:03:57.410> certain<00:03:57.769> cards<00:03:57.980> you

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
algorithm that other certain cards you

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.670 
algorithm that other certain cards you
can't<00:03:58.489> draw<00:03:58.790> on<00:03:59.000> your<00:03:59.180> first<00:03:59.419> turn<00:03:59.660> maybe<00:04:00.470> the

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
can't draw on your first turn maybe the

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.050 
can't draw on your first turn maybe the
game<00:04:00.859> doesn't<00:04:01.040> want<00:04:01.370> me<00:04:01.489> to<00:04:01.579> draw<00:04:01.760> Sarah

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
game doesn't want me to draw Sarah

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.250 
game doesn't want me to draw Sarah
ascending<00:04:02.419> because<00:04:02.660> it<00:04:02.780> knows<00:04:02.989> it's

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
ascending because it knows it's

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.170 
ascending because it knows it's
overpowered<00:04:03.859> her<00:04:04.010> first<00:04:04.220> turn<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.730> if<00:04:04.970> that's

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
overpowered her first turn and if that's

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.390 
overpowered her first turn and if that's
true<00:04:05.599> that's<00:04:06.169> kind<00:04:06.380> of<00:04:06.410> you<00:04:06.859> know<00:04:06.889> that's<00:04:07.250> a

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
true that's kind of you know that's a

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.699 
true that's kind of you know that's a
big<00:04:07.579> concern<00:04:07.730> now<00:04:08.720> of<00:04:08.840> course<00:04:09.019> again<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.500> could

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
big concern now of course again it could

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.259 
big concern now of course again it could
just<00:04:09.829> be<00:04:09.919> a<00:04:10.010> demo<00:04:10.340> version<00:04:10.370> thing<00:04:10.849> or<00:04:11.030> it<00:04:11.120> could

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
just be a demo version thing or it could

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.819 
just be a demo version thing or it could
just<00:04:11.299> be<00:04:11.450> a<00:04:11.540> versus<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.110> computer<00:04:12.530> things

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
just be a versus the computer things

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.009 
just be a versus the computer things
that<00:04:13.010> you<00:04:13.159> can't<00:04:13.430> have<00:04:13.640> some<00:04:14.209> huge<00:04:14.599> advantage

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
that you can't have some huge advantage

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.590 
that you can't have some huge advantage
over<00:04:15.110> the<00:04:15.290> computer<00:04:15.519> it's<00:04:16.519> very<00:04:16.789> possible

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
over the computer it's very possible

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.300 
over the computer it's very possible
but<00:04:18.200> of<00:04:18.290> course<00:04:18.320> i<00:04:18.560> won't<00:04:18.740> be<00:04:18.920> able<00:04:19.070> to<00:04:19.160> test

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
but of course i won't be able to test

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.680 
but of course i won't be able to test
that<00:04:19.459> until<00:04:19.730> the<00:04:19.820> final<00:04:20.120> version<00:04:20.270> comes<00:04:20.570> out

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
that until the final version comes out

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.230 
that until the final version comes out
and<00:04:20.870> I<00:04:20.930> could<00:04:21.110> play<00:04:21.200> against<00:04:21.530> actual<00:04:22.240> human

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
and I could play against actual human

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.940 
and I could play against actual human
players<00:04:23.510> so<00:04:24.020> anyway<00:04:24.260> this<00:04:24.440> just<00:04:24.680> a<00:04:24.740> quick

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
players so anyway this just a quick

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.070 
players so anyway this just a quick
video<00:04:25.130> to<00:04:25.490> just<00:04:26.270> share<00:04:26.480> my<00:04:26.720> thoughts<00:04:26.870> about

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
video to just share my thoughts about

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.900 
video to just share my thoughts about
those<00:04:27.320> things<00:04:27.470> about<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:28.280> know<00:04:28.370> can<00:04:28.670> you<00:04:28.700> or

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
those things about you know can you or

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.600 
those things about you know can you or
can't<00:04:29.150> you<00:04:29.210> mulligan<00:04:29.890> to<00:04:30.890> Sarah<00:04:31.160> ascended

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
can't you mulligan to Sarah ascended

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.640 
can't you mulligan to Sarah ascended
thing<00:04:31.850> is<00:04:32.300> still<00:04:32.570> an<00:04:32.690> open<00:04:32.990> question<00:04:33.140> I<00:04:33.440> still

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
thing is still an open question I still

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.840 
thing is still an open question I still
don't<00:04:33.830> know<00:04:33.920> because<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.190> haven't<00:04:34.460> been<00:04:34.700> able

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
don't know because I haven't been able

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.000 
don't know because I haven't been able
to<00:04:35.030> get<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:35.360> in<00:04:35.480> an<00:04:35.630> opening<00:04:35.990> hand<00:04:36.170> but<00:04:36.710> I<00:04:36.740> can

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
to get it in an opening hand but I can

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.560 
to get it in an opening hand but I can
at<00:04:37.160> least<00:04:37.310> safely<00:04:37.700> say<00:04:37.850> and<00:04:38.090> definitely<00:04:38.420> say

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
at least safely say and definitely say

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.270 
at least safely say and definitely say
you<00:04:38.630> are<00:04:38.780> not<00:04:38.960> allowed<00:04:39.230> to<00:04:39.260> team<00:04:40.100> up<00:04:40.130> with

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
you are not allowed to team up with
