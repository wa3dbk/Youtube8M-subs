00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello to all friends of next today as in 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.950
 past videos I show you a short unboxing 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.630
 of one of the newest 300 series radeons 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.929
 in particular I'm talking about the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.839
 sapphire nitro r 93 80 in the 4 version 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.910
 gigabytes as classic packs 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.369
 sapphire have a minimal style and a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.960
 although extremely essential bundle 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.900
 the robot is always in the foreground 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.750
 a nice figure splits hook without 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.070
 delay now as we said we do not find 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.080
 great accessories inside the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.059
 pack under a first layer of 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.190
 packing we find our card 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.870
 without a protective film that is 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.540
 the classic that we are used to finding 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.879
 to protect these components beyond 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.030
 it includes a vga adapter 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.440
 live you have maybe a little obsolete since 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.570
 we are talking about a series that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.760
 should point to 4k 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.379
 a disk containing the graphics drivers ei 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.899
 classic booklets and brochures of 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.570
 card as usual we throw everything in 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.329
 a corner and let's focus on this 380 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.160
 the dimensions for these are 9 more 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.780
 contained compared to the older sister 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.210
 which we analyzed a few days ago 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.799
 and the weight is definitely lower 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.409
 also due to the lack of a 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.750
 backplate cooling is a system 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.220
 classic of the comprehensive safire cards 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.170
 of a single radiator that runs along 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.180
 all the card which receives the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.979
 heat through the four is pipe that 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.470
 they start from the resting metal plate 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.240
 on the GPU to cool the whole 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.490
 two structures think warmly 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.020
 venturoni from ten centimeters with 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.180
 an intelligent control technology 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.460
 and the ability to crash in cases of 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.140
 low operational intensity canceling 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.270
 so the noise coming from the card 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.710
 we are obviously talking about the dual 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.890
 hicks pooling if you didn't 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.090
 understood as mentioned talking about the weight the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.950
 back side of the board is 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.450
 without a backplate that you give the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.040
 board size would have been 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.420
 simply an insertion more 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.829
 aesthetic and functional 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.770
 regarding the power supply 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.869
 instead unlike the GPUs among the 93 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.700
 90 hicks this card needs 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.920
 only a double 6-pin connector 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.659
 pin while connectivity is that 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.880
 classic that we have already seen that 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.020
 includes two stars you have a displayport e 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.010
 a hdmi 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.420
 also in this case I give you 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.520
 appointment to the next videos for a 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.840
 deepening on these new radeons 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.510
 and the invitation also take a look at the 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.600
 sister a few days ago 92 views 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.400
 90 hicks m site gaming version for now 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.400
 I greet you and the next hello
