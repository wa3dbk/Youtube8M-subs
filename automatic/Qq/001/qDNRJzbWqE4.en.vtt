00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.030
 hello i welcome you to 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.410
 a new episode of in naughty 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.330
 today we are talking about the little one 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.920
 difference between men and women 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.600
 because there are trends that we women 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.619
 but men never love 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.930
 learn to understand 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.490
 what exactly that is 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.440
 I try to find out today and 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.170
 Although with an expert on my side 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.780
 and you guessed it is a man and two 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.730
 the women understand that hope 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.340
 me anyway 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.280
 as moderator and actor jochen 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.839
 Schropp with which you can just everything 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.480
 but now seriously 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.190
 Do not you carry everything there ? 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.480
 I brought trends here at 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.989
 But I like women a bit 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:53.059
 difficult then you will find yourself as 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.769
 nee I could call myself 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.210
 I do not have to call it a fake 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.530
 also honestly say so I need 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.089
 always a little bit I like it 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.999
 exciting but until then the sales 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.199
 I'm not that brave but here 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:07.000
 For example, we already have one 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.000
 Result of the things I brought 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.510
 you walk on clouds, I know 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.220
 have heard a thousand times I think also 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.750
 but casual look suits it if you like that 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.340
 Chic is so if I am chic women 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.360
 who then dress so acutely then 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.870
 I think I always take you but 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.640
 change shoes with does not find that applies 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.530
 also for ballerinas in the summer 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.310
 sundress trainers totally in 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.200
 order but at one 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.640
 evening event i know your women 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.750
 you always need to attract high heels 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.090
 and someday wanted to dance 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.740
 So you take change with you 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.150
 The note near is not at all 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.400
 reprehensible that is just then mostly 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.260
 also ballerinas but then maybe 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.420
 then rather high quality shoes 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.510
 take along like this one for example 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.560
 and not these things rolled up 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.480
 the one for five years in the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.890
 bag i can understand so here 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.630
 in this glitter propos lends the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.960
 whole bit 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.229
 Lemmer and looks good in any case 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.229
 out 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.970
 I think you can definitely do it 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.500
 wear better as she finds it 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.450
 it's almost too tight it almost seems like 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.519
 a cat zoot you see right now he 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.800
 except in the jazz dance class 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.970
 I really believe we can 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.590
 Greta and I are better 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.170
 Thinking a little and saying that is 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.340
 But now, let's have a look 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.340
 if that pleases better 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:35.890
 curious what you say yes I think that 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.810
 you can also see direct it differed 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.060
 everything is a bit looser and 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.980
 definitely great for the shoe 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.530
 evening then of course with the 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.390
 belt and the arm ralf beautiful 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.860
 accessories and happy to be happy about 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.750
 the ballerinas I also talked needs 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.310
 quite honestly they would say now if 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.989
 She still wants to dance to the outfit 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.190
 so be careful so everything is done right 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.190
 thanks for the tip 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.380
 an absolute trend namely the wedges 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.860
 yes we do not understand men I do not believe 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.950
 really 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.050
 well so you have a paragraph here 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.600
 This shoe should look like 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.700
 a casual shoe he i believe where to get 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.260
 I just do not know that woman 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.420
 that just uses a nicer one 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.740
 to get leg and be bigger and 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.270
 most can honestly on 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.040
 the material that matches the run well 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.170
 I do not think they look that good 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.130
 always like a few 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.780
 health sports so I think to 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.280
 example the shoes the greta Anna the 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.530
 that a flat niger I like 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.690
 anyway much better and also colorful 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.340
 and as neutral as it looks today bears 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.170
 I think they have that up again and 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.090
 fit very well and the thing is the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.430
 also have metal elements in itself 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.020
 And by the way, that's an absolute one too 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.250
 trend for the next season so with 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.340
 She has everything right this school year 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.680
 monsters have a real red again 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.570
 lips are the beauty statement of 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.459
 Season even if you are on the internet in 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.290
 all possible forums next the 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.770
 Most men do not really like it 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.270
 to like 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.980
 I do not know why I think so 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.170
 actually quite good or sees a greta 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.970
 I also think it's good 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.440
 I actually say my best 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.670
 Girlfriends are wearing red lips though 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.019
 since years that means they have 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.310
 discover the statement in itself 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.450
 You should really only look at the color 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.100
 be careful that you maybe before 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.380
 once again his tears check in front of the town hall 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.489
 Offer that should be on everyone 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.859
 case again but otherwise 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.669
 I think we have criticism through the day 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.620
 accompany 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.209
 Thank you very much for being there 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.890
 and I hope that was fun 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.030
 In the end, I think you should 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.560
 Always remember model should be fun 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.450
 make you feel good 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.750
 I have to compliment what 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.800
 I think that's different today 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.120
 And now I really have to 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.320
 First, the men's department, I believe 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.120
 need a bit of testosterone 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.120
 Well, let's go
