00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
that didn't unfortunately instead of

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.450 
that didn't unfortunately instead of
just<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.840> week<00:01:12.990> ten<00:01:15.049> who<00:01:16.049> said<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> week<00:01:17.130> ten<00:01:17.310> now

to<00:01:19.830> start<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.310> magic<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.970> think<00:01:21.720> norm<00:01:21.960> is

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
to start the magic I think norm is

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.499 
to start the magic I think norm is
caught<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.560> between<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.939> about<00:01:24.180> everything

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
caught in between just about everything

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.990 
caught in between just about everything
out<00:01:24.810> there<00:01:25.080> he's<00:01:25.259> he<00:01:25.920> can't<00:01:26.460> play<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.820> line

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.490 
out there he's he can't play the line
that<00:01:27.210> he<00:01:27.299> played<00:01:27.570> all<00:01:27.600> week<00:01:27.900> long<00:01:28.049> that's<00:01:28.320> too

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
that he played all week long that's too

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.160 
that he played all week long that's too
far<00:01:28.710> right<00:01:28.979> he<00:01:29.250> can't<00:01:29.520> move<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.780> around

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
