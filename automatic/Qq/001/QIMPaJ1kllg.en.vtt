00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.460
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.160
 of trail running review dotcom today 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.130
 let's analyze the adidas sonic adidas 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.910
 4 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.960
 and you have them 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:24.560
 in yellow and black with white and 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.950
 silver to me is a design that I like 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.169
 rather daring that yes but to me 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.410
 I particularly like it is a 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:36.320
 super lightweight shoe logically not 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.380
 you can check it but I do not know if the 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.560
 sensations 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.410
 they arrive 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.780
 to your house that is very light a 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.250
 very light shoe we will start to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.560
 see it as you see a sole 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.710
 here you have the shape of small 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.920
 taquitos and is that this is a sneaker 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.660
 for trail but that is a little bit 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.840
 horse between the asphalt and the train and 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:06.130
 perhaps very worthy for asphalt and also 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:09.280
 apt to get in terrains like track 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.950
 forest or easy terrain to bring the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.369
 running as you see the province of the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.100
 tacos is very small they are very close together 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:22.590
 practically like an asphalt sole 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:26.110
 and here is this gray part in tacos 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.649
 Hexagonal reminds us a little 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.320
 tacos traction of other models of 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:35.860
 adidas and fix the stabilized in the 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.960
 plastic part totally hard and 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.800
 Here we are already announced that this is 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.270
 model incorporates the system my coach 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.509
 adidas 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.500
 to digital devices too 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:53.799
 fix the sole on the back as 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.770
 borders but leaves the central part free 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:00.159
 here there are no taco orientations anything 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.340
 that looks like it and we're going to see the 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.110
 flexibility fixes flexapp quite 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.270
 easy costs a bit at first then 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.650
 easy by a flex zone 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:14.709
 quite centered and look like the 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.440
 Sneaker regains its original position 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.200
 very quickly look at this second 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.290
 bending line fixes also like me 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.690
 it's going to cost a lot to double if I do 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.180
 enough strength so I get it but 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.900
 this plate here gets this 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.940
 stabilization in the central part of the 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.819
 sneaker let's see the midsole 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.060
 as you see here a pretty profile 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.069
 high behind that falls quite 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.650
 sharply forward with a 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.680
 drop therefore quite pronounced 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:52.319
 in the front look at the iprem 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.590
 plus an adidas compound an eba 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:03:00.379
 very absorbent impacts and very revulsive 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.519
 and behind a lighter for absorption 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.239
 of impacts 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.640
 let's say this band here side and 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:11.000
 cross 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.870
 in gold in silver forgiveness 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.060
 with how it is like plastic and 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.050
 that borders the entire part of the heel giving 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.570
 a little consistency fixos 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:27.010
 the heel has has structure like 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:29.500
 you can see but not too much and it matches 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.220
 a bit with the band is that it borders 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.070
 let's see now doing protection in the 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.740
 front area something more than 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.500
 asphalt slippers but pretty 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.990
 less than training shoes a 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.870
 little of synthetic skin here fixos 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.210
 to give it a little more progression in 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.600
 the protection and one but the truth is 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:55.300
 which is super light and 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.080
 very finite will perspire very well 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.270
 sure we will see I will open for 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.300
 wish us inside 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:09.890
 the tongue that is super minimalist 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:13.520
 fix and super short is stitched 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:17.390
 directly in the upper as for the 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:21.200
 laces laces flat as close 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.640
 a lifelong cord that does not end 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.550
 of running well therefore we will have 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.110
 than to help her from the beginning to 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.030
 run well to me one thing that has 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.300
 liked this shoe and is that the three 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:36.710
 bands instead of always go in this 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:39.500
 direction this time they go in the other 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.750
 in another direction which gives you a 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.480
 little more dynamism to the entire design 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.130
 of the shoe thing that the truth to me 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.000
 I liked it enough let's see them 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.560
 inside 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.540
 see here the interior 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.850
 a fine mesh bleu aspirates all this 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.600
 black part for example like the 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:01.810
 yellow fix the finger you can not see but 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:06.070
 almost and the michaels system as you see 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:09.540
 here as I take out the piece and here it gets 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:13.860
 the michaels pill 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:17.760
 in the middle on the foot bridge to 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:20.470
 that does not bother fixes very little quilted 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.450
 In the back 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.330
 to certainly gain weight is a 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.560
 sneaker as we said very light 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.440
 let's see the template template 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.330
 simple eva 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.270
 a little thick medium thickness 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:38.060
 we could say bridge like a little 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:42.070
 very progressive profile a very 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:45.120
 plain very simple adidas house 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:49.350
 let's put it 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:53.270
 therefore friends the sonic 4 destined 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:56.150
 to asphalt but also destined 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:00.640
 to those stretches of land that we want a 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:06.560
 plus adherence and also a plus 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:08.600
 support to the foot for these sections 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.750
 that the asphalt shoes do not 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.430
 offer and these adidas adizero are and 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.820
 four yes they will do so 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.880
 so much here you have friends analyzed 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.600
 for bringing a review dotcom see you 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.600
 in the next analysis
