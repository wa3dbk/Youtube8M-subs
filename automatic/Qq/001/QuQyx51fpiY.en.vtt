00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.720
 well 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.940
 where you live where you are the water is the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.610
 life liquid as vital as the air 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.800
 that you breathe in our days the water 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.320
 is within our reach where the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.989
 we need and when we want it without 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.580
 However, we do not know if we do not have the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.370
 way to take advantage of some properties 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.989
 of water that can give us a lot 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.989
 more than what we get from it 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.960
 Magnetized present a trans loves the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 new way to take advantage of the water in your 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.640
 100% body when you enter is greatness 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.640
 in water 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:15.620
 and that is going to be guaranteed is a product 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.730
 very novel result of investigations of 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.250
 the effects of the fields 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.610
 electromagnetic and biology 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.220
 molecular on the living matter in the 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.110
 bride every time 40 years ago we made a 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.000
 thesis about the effects of the fields 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.890
 electromagnetic on the molecules 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.290
 of water now I find the great 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.509
 surprise that this technology the 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:40.250
 we have available for everyone here in 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.380
 colombia magnetized water magnum 3 is 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.390
 treated drinking water that has two 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.770
 differences compared to the others 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:52.439
 waters quality and health 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:56.710
 quality is pure water 99.99 percent 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:01.200
 free of bacteria 100% virus free 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:04.210
 free of pathogenic microorganisms health 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.670
 it is pure water that is subjected to a load 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.590
 of gauss process by which the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.950
 water suffers a physical change where the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.540
 molecules that are messy 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.700
 they initiate a magnetic ordering in 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.709
 symmetric pairs there is an activation 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.020
 cellular and its effects on the body 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.610
 they produce a greater metabolic yield 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.650
 with this procedure to have control 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.650
 about the water molecules obtained 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.250
 benefits such as 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.569
 weight control 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.700
 full recovery from the problems of 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.040
 osteoporosis control over the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.530
 aging by recovery of 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.060
 Collagen helps to recover the good 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.629
 functioning of the digestive system 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:51.879
 as well as the nervous system 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:54.340
 circulatory bone and the renal system 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:03:04.120
 in a nutshell at the source of the 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:06.069
 youth since I was 18 years old I started 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.019
 have gout arthritis 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.750
 they started formulating having medications 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.290
 that over time were damaging the mouth 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.590
 those at 45 had a kidney problem 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.090
 that scared me because the same doctors 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.670
 they were telling me that I for a 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.799
 dialysis and kidney transplant that 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.359
 also my life could last a year just 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:31.030
 as a result of this we started to investigate 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:33.010
 how to monetize the water because I 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.140
 they started reporting that if I took 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.590
 medicines with magnetized water or 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.810
 magnetized could improve my health 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.819
 is researching in the magnetized market 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.430
 could get more non-magnetized 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.370
 because I got to use canes 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.170
 crutches and even wheelchair 28 months 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.510
 consuming these drugs until 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.940
 finally we managed to magnetize the water 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.010
 four months consume the same 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.959
 medicines with magnetic water more 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.959
 north or on that line in perfect days 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.040
 the magnetization breaks the structures 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.980
 of the molecules in the water and group them 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.990
 in small structures the studies of 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.810
 magnetic resonance imaging have shown that 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.790
 there are 3 to 5 molecules in the 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.210
 small clusters or chains of molecules 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.820
 in the magnetized water while in 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.870
 the raw water are from 30 to 50 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.870
 molecules per group 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:56.910
 matrix greatness of the water to conquer 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.910
 dot com 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.210
