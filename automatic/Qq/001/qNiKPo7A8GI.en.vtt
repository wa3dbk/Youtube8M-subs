 You may want to carry some parts there. 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.130
 that will grind anyway in the 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.140
 blender 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:29.000
 there we will put thulium will see how much 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:33.080
 make this recipe people had to give it to me 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.450
 all rinse well because sometimes it is only 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.369
 Leftover corn you have to play and 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.780
 that I like to play made by your 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:44.630
 team from outside, we put more 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.070
 from this package and will save the 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.410
 The rest, now, just call the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.200
 blender and wait it triturated 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.890
 It's okay between tradings, we do not have 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.330
 that leave and during the 1 to 2 minute 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:05.060
 minutes and he grinded well to look good 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:09.560
 And little pastor. 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.680
 maize residue done that is only 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.380
 Turn off a blender, you too. 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.830
 of what is not looking well 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.900
 yellow that is bill of the river and a little 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.310
 more consistent than when people 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:29.180
 stayed n inside the right blender 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:33.230
 So we'll turn off that mix 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:37.610
 goes to the pan with oil in the pan or 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.880
 olive oil in my case I used haveit there myself 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.670
 I cut more onions here you cut 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.010
 Any size you want too, I guess. 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.400
 as like onion I like to feel 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.680
 She will not cut the line, then I will. 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.950
 I cut her very thick because I like 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.209
 same to us but if you want it 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.370
 better divide there already from your 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:04.790
 I'll also prefer that in that 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:11.840
 Leave me a light 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:14.400
 My Photo 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.860
 onion that I like well in the taste of 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:23.360
 onion and then I used the olive oil I used 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:27.120
 this number can be used any other 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.400
 And then he's going to give me one. 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.730
 chopped garlic only little body 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.570
 good thing is say that it is good to 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.670
 garlic when you lose you put the 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.740
 onion because it cuts the 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.239
 garlic cooking effect 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:47.370
 however when the rennet before the onion 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:52.610
 it gets burned because the piece is good 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.610
 local thing the water it has 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:00.600
 He burns so I prefer to play. 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.680
 after she lets go of her stew, right? 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.630
 I think it's better after you have 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.530
 onion with a little garlic and listen 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:20.549
 with the best prize he liked it 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:22.560
 everything inside the pot to mess like me 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.990
 I do not like it very much. 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.180
 Here such a spoon corn starch 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.990
 that does not need but I already put the cream 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.479
 of milk 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.750
 but it's only because I like it come 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:35.760
 creamy I'm not going to mess with these 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.310
 parts of chives burned because I 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.270
 I like to fix a hive of chives 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.669
 burned 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.479
 I do not know, you, I like this taste. 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.820
 in football who will boil well 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:54.350
 right and right after the visa I go 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:57.000
 place one or a bit later we will 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:03.360
 put a lot to a little even to give 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.990
 a most spicy flavor in baby cream 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.800
 and it's a delight, people you need 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:14.550
 I tried it, I 'm going to make it obvious, right? 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.169
 to stir him not to concentrate 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.760
 in a place only if there is a lot of 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:22.840
 ball and not 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:27.550
 not only the cookie and I'll let you cook 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.350
 well he's good with cidinho stays that way 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.000
 the yellow got a little stronger 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:36.550
 I also put it and the tv cream 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.890
 obviously, then they get this 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.980
 consistency stay a bit longer 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:45.790
 consistent is not so divine anymore 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:50.290
 creamy and then I also put the rest 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:53.230
 I put this package of corn here. 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:56.140
 to keep a few million lost there 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:59.590
 we taste the corn when we eat 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:03.370

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:06.940
