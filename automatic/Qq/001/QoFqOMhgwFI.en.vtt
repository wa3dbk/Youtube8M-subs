00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
one side with the rubber and I clamped

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.220 
one side with the rubber and I clamped
those<00:00:28.349> right<00:00:28.980> here<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:30.539> was<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:31.109> looking

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
those right here and I was just looking

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.319 
those right here and I was just looking
at<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.470> little<00:00:31.800> ring<00:00:32.070> down<00:00:32.309> there<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.790> wasn't

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
at that little ring down there I wasn't

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.450 
at that little ring down there I wasn't
actually<00:00:33.450> trying<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.870> get<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.070> clamp<00:00:35.309> on

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
actually trying to get it to clamp on

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.920 
actually trying to get it to clamp on
the<00:00:35.610> curve<00:00:35.850> here

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
the curve here

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.510 
the curve here
I<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.320> clamped<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.710> right<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:37.980> ring<00:00:38.280> so

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
I just clamped it right on that ring so

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.060 
I just clamped it right on that ring so
what<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.820> did<00:00:39.680> put<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.770> clamp<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.250> there<00:00:41.489> and

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
what I did put the clamp on there and

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.680 
what I did put the clamp on there and
then<00:00:45.440> like<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.829> vise<00:00:47.129> grip<00:00:47.160> were<00:00:47.700> like<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> CC

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
then like a vise grip were like a CC

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.360 
then like a vise grip were like a CC
ripper<00:00:49.289> what<00:00:49.410> are<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.530> going<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.680> call<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.980> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
ripper what are we going to call it and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.869 
ripper what are we going to call it and
I<00:00:51.120> put<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.680> suppose<00:00:53.579> not<00:00:53.699> all

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
I put that on the I suppose not all

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.490 
I put that on the I suppose not all
bikes<00:00:54.090> will<00:00:54.239> be<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> same<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.020> has<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
bikes will be the same but this has the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.150 
bikes will be the same but this has the
little<00:00:55.770> clip<00:00:56.550> or<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> mounting<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.160> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
little clip or the mounting for the the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.459 
little clip or the mounting for the the
mudguard<00:00:59.370> or<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.940> chain<00:01:00.270> guard<00:01:00.480> sorry<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.079> so

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
mudguard or the chain guard sorry and so

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.119 
mudguard or the chain guard sorry and so
I<00:01:01.500> put<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:01.920> there<00:01:02.100> as<00:01:02.870> you<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:04.049> see<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
I put that there as you can see the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.570 
I put that there as you can see the
little<00:01:06.380> little<00:01:07.380> ring<00:01:07.890> there<00:01:08.189> just

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
little little ring there just

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.780 
little little ring there just
disappeared<00:01:10.070> hopefully<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.220> doesn't<00:01:11.400> snap

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
disappeared hopefully this doesn't snap

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.359 
disappeared hopefully this doesn't snap
off<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.210> kill<00:01:12.420> me<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:14.180> get<00:01:15.180> both<00:01:15.390> grips<00:01:15.780> there

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
off and kill me and get both grips there

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.770 
off and kill me and get both grips there
and<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.430> bet<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.700> could<00:01:17.850> take<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.270> pin<00:01:18.509> out<00:01:18.600> with

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
and I bet I could take this pin out with

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.230 
and I bet I could take this pin out with
just<00:01:18.960> my<00:01:19.110> fingers<00:01:19.729> tada

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
just my fingers tada

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.310 
just my fingers tada
there<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:23.659> then<00:01:24.659> you'll<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
there it is and then you'll just do the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.429 
there it is and then you'll just do the
reverse<00:01:26.780> see<00:01:27.780> that's<00:01:27.990> why<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.170> got<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> be

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
reverse see that's why you got to be

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.069 
reverse see that's why you got to be
careful<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.820> then<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.570> reverse<00:01:30.869> that

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
careful and then to reverse that

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.230 
careful and then to reverse that
obviously<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:31.890> want<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:33.320> there<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.470> is

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
obviously you just want to there it is

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.080 
obviously you just want to there it is
just<00:01:36.240> use<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.829> clamps<00:01:38.280> both<00:01:38.520> ways<00:01:38.759> again

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
just use the the clamps both ways again

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.960 
just use the the clamps both ways again
and<00:01:39.810> you'll<00:01:40.259> get<00:01:40.380> your<00:01:40.650> uh<00:01:40.680> your<00:01:41.340> kick<00:01:41.549> kick

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
and you'll get your uh your kick kick

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.929 
and you'll get your uh your kick kick
stand<00:01:42.180> out<00:01:42.420> pretty<00:01:42.930> straightforward<00:01:43.939> thanks
