00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
feel you compensated a little bit I

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.460 
feel you compensated a little bit I
think<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.240> because<00:01:21.540> she<00:01:21.689> was<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:21.990> ill<00:01:22.170> she

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
think so because she was so ill she

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.350 
think so because she was so ill she
could<00:01:22.650> not<00:01:22.799> walk<00:01:23.009> more<00:01:23.490> than<00:01:23.700> five<00:01:24.090> minutes

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
could not walk more than five minutes

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.359 
could not walk more than five minutes
without<00:01:24.960> falling<00:01:25.530> down<00:01:25.710> because<00:01:25.920> her<00:01:26.189> legs

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
without falling down because her legs

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.460 
without falling down because her legs
gave<00:01:26.549> way<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.600> think<00:01:27.659> for<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.259> tried

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
gave way and I think for that we tried

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.170 
gave way and I think for that we tried
to<00:01:28.590> build<00:01:28.710> her<00:01:28.860> out<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.100> possibly<00:01:29.220> built<00:01:30.090> her

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
to build her out and possibly built her

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.749 
to build her out and possibly built her
up<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.360> bit<00:01:30.509> too<00:01:30.659> quick<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:32.280> mom<00:01:32.520> sue

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
up a bit too quick so with mom sue

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.390 
up a bit too quick so with mom sue
worried<00:01:33.119> her<00:01:33.329> tests<00:01:33.630> might<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.200> distress

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.039 

it's<00:01:38.400> time<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.880> get<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> measure<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.600> this

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
it's time to get the measure of this

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.740 
it's time to get the measure of this
treasure<00:01:43.009> so<00:01:44.009> she's<00:01:44.220> coming<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.610> just<00:01:44.970> over<00:01:45.149> 46

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
which is brilliant progress your

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.819 
which is brilliant progress your
direction<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:51.450> do<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.720> think<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.229> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
direction what do you think is the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.550 
direction what do you think is the
perfect<00:01:53.220> weight<00:01:53.399> for<00:01:53.700> example<00:01:54.149> attesa<00:01:54.689> forty

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
perfect weight for example attesa forty

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.080 
perfect weight for example attesa forty
will<00:01:55.710> be<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> next<00:01:56.310> stage<00:01:56.490> we<00:01:56.700> want<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.000> aim

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
will be the next stage we want to aim

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.179 
will be the next stage we want to aim
for<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:57.930> I'm<00:01:58.170> honest<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.649> think<00:01:58.710> we<00:01:58.920> might<00:01:59.159> be

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
for if I'm honest I think we might be

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.260 
for if I'm honest I think we might be

eight<00:02:00.509> if<00:02:00.630> we're<00:02:00.750> lucky<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.439> numbers<00:02:01.890> are<00:02:02.040> at

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
eight if we're lucky the numbers are at

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.370 
eight if we're lucky the numbers are at
least<00:02:02.340> heading<00:02:02.790> downwards<00:02:03.240> but<00:02:03.659> how<00:02:03.899> can<00:02:03.960> we

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
least heading downwards but how can we

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.160 
least heading downwards but how can we
help<00:02:04.560> test<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.219> where<00:02:05.399> even<00:02:05.820> less

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
help test to where even less

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.380
