00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
you know the first person in the world

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.560 
you know the first person in the world
that<00:00:01.620> talked<00:00:02.129> about<00:00:02.399> talked<00:00:02.939> about<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.300> chip

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
that talked about talked about the chip

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.590

issue<00:00:04.140> was<00:00:04.560> me<00:00:04.710> right<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.310> issued<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.390> press

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
issue was me right I issued a press

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.080 
issue was me right I issued a press
release<00:00:07.280> with<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.340> two<00:00:08.580> hundred<00:00:08.730> million

dollars reserved and and in fact our

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.730 
dollars reserved and and in fact our
customers<00:00:12.599> were<00:00:12.780> saying<00:00:13.019> Jensen<00:00:13.440> why<00:00:13.559> are<00:00:13.620> you

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
customers were saying Jensen why are you

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.939 
customers were saying Jensen why are you
doing<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:15.230> well<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.410> reason<00:00:16.560> for<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.830> is

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
doing that well the reason for that is

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.700 
doing that well the reason for that is
this<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.430> really<00:00:17.760> simple<00:00:17.970> they<00:00:18.660> are<00:00:19.170> customers

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
this is really simple they are customers

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.910 
this is really simple they are customers
worth<00:00:19.859> listen<00:00:20.699> up<00:00:21.470> you<00:00:22.470> know<00:00:22.590> what<00:00:22.769> are<00:00:22.859> you

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
worth listen up you know what are you

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.650 
worth listen up you know what are you
doing<00:00:23.160> your<00:00:23.250> issue<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.880> press<00:00:24.180> release<00:00:24.210> and

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
doing your issue a press release and

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.060 
doing your issue a press release and
then<00:00:24.720> also<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.320> press<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.619> going<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.830> ask<00:00:25.949> you

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
then also the press is going to ask you

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.060 
then also the press is going to ask you
well<00:00:26.760> here--here's<00:00:27.150> comes<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.480> logic<00:00:28.070> and

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
well here--here's comes to logic and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.700 
well here--here's comes to logic and
it's<00:00:29.640> an<00:00:29.789> echo<00:00:30.000> it's<00:00:30.510> logical<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.529> just

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
it's an echo it's logical it's just

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.049 
it's an echo it's logical it's just
messy<00:00:32.059> okay<00:00:33.079> the<00:00:34.079> logic<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.469> impeccable<00:00:35.059> we

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
messy okay the logic is impeccable we

notebook is just fine right Mosin opals
are<00:01:23.009> fine<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.820> just<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.030> certain<00:01:24.540> of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
are fine it's just that certain of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.080 
are fine it's just that certain of
notebooks<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.560> problem<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.340> well

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
notebooks have this problem and so well

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.249 
notebooks have this problem and so well
the<00:01:27.600> problem<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.110> if<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.220> problem

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.300 
let's just go solve it in fact i'll put
a<00:01:47.970> reserve<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.540> place<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.619> if<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.159> were

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
a reserve in place so that if you were

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.999 
a reserve in place so that if you were
to<00:01:50.340> solve<00:01:50.640> i'll<00:01:50.850> pay<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.030> back<00:01:51.649> now<00:01:52.649> i<00:01:52.890> just

you<00:02:09.369> know<00:02:09.430> this<00:02:09.580> particular<00:02:09.970> issue<00:02:10.240> is<00:02:10.570> is

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
you know this particular issue is is

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.080 
you know this particular issue is is
pretty<00:02:11.770> industry<00:02:12.160> window<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.850> reason

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
pretty industry window and the reason

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.480 
pretty industry window and the reason
for<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.240> is<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:14.110> just<00:02:14.380> don't<00:02:14.530> want<00:02:14.770> the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
for that is I just don't want the

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.850 
for that is I just don't want the
consumers<00:02:15.910> have<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.150> fight<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.960> process<00:02:17.440> and

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
consumers have to fight the process and

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.370 
consumers have to fight the process and
so<00:02:18.670> if<00:02:19.240> you<00:02:19.300> take<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.570> look<00:02:19.780> at<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.110> number<00:02:20.320> of

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
so if you take a look at the number of

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.660 
so if you take a look at the number of
chips<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.710> we've<00:02:20.860> shipped<00:02:21.100> it's<00:02:21.370> in

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
chips that we've shipped it's in

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.480 
chips that we've shipped it's in
millions<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.330> hundreds<00:02:22.660> of<00:02:22.720> millions<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.490> if

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
millions and hundreds of millions and if

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.070 
millions and hundreds of millions and if
you<00:02:24.700> just<00:02:24.820> did<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.090> math<00:02:25.240> that<00:02:25.450> i<00:02:25.540> just<00:02:25.750> talked

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
you just did the math that i just talked

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.390 
you just did the math that i just talked
about<00:02:26.170> we're<00:02:26.500> talking<00:02:26.770> about<00:02:26.950> very<00:02:27.100> small

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
about we're talking about very small

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.250 
about we're talking about very small
percentage<00:02:27.760> i<00:02:28.060> just<00:02:28.690> wanted<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:28.990> make<00:02:29.200> sure

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
percentage i just wanted to make sure

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.670 
percentage i just wanted to make sure
that<00:02:29.770> we<00:02:30.430> put<00:02:30.700> put<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.540> out<00:02:31.660> there<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.110> give<00:02:32.530> a

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
that we put put it out there that give a

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.160 
that we put put it out there that give a
consumer<00:02:33.220> wants<00:02:33.490> it<00:02:33.670> repaired<00:02:34.000> they<00:02:34.990> should

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
consumer wants it repaired they should

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.110 
consumer wants it repaired they should
get<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.380> repaired<00:02:35.620> well<00:02:35.890> obviously<00:02:36.280> all<00:02:36.940> the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
get it repaired well obviously all the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.580 
get it repaired well obviously all the
aliens<00:02:37.450> now<00:02:37.600> believe<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.020> really<00:02:38.320> enough<00:02:38.560> to

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
aliens now believe it really enough to

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.380 
aliens now believe it really enough to
do<00:02:38.740> to<00:02:38.830> my<00:02:38.950> right<00:02:39.400> thing<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.640> do<00:02:39.760> as<00:02:39.880> well<00:02:40.120> and

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
do to my right thing to do as well and

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.240 
do to my right thing to do as well and
it's<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.780> little<00:02:41.020> bit<00:02:41.140> a<00:02:41.350> little<00:02:41.560> bit<00:02:41.860> messy

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
it's a little bit a little bit messy

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.250 
it's a little bit a little bit messy
because<00:02:42.490> you<00:02:43.270> know<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.540> competition<00:02:44.080> was<00:02:44.200> to

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
because you know the competition was to

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.750 
because you know the competition was to
start<00:02:44.590> up<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.010> there's<00:02:45.130> people<00:02:45.459> who<00:02:45.520> want<00:02:45.670> to

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
start up and there's people who want to

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.250 
start up and there's people who want to
stir<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.060> up<00:02:46.180> but<00:02:46.690> it's<00:02:46.810> not<00:02:46.930> really<00:02:47.170> that

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
stir it up but it's not really that

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.230 
stir it up but it's not really that
complicated<00:02:47.530> in<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.250> end<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.760> we're<00:02:49.030> seeing

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
complicated in the end and we're seeing

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.990 
complicated in the end and we're seeing
a<00:02:49.420> higher<00:02:49.750> than<00:02:50.020> then<00:02:50.650> then<00:02:51.310> what<00:02:51.700> we<00:02:51.850> would

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
a higher than then then what we would

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.500 
a higher than then then what we would
like<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.450> see<00:02:52.709> failure<00:02:53.709> rate<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.130> that<00:02:55.090> if<00:02:55.360> the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
like to see failure rate and that if the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.900 
like to see failure rate and that if the
consumer<00:02:55.810> has<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:56.110> failure<00:02:56.470> or<00:02:56.700> replace<00:02:57.700> that

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
consumer has a failure or replace that

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.460 
consumer has a failure or replace that
and<00:02:58.870> get<00:02:59.080> it<00:02:59.170> fixed<00:02:59.320> right<00:02:59.440> away<00:03:00.330> so<00:03:01.330> i<00:03:01.630> was<00:03:02.350> the

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.150 
way to make it fail in lab and even now
it's<00:04:20.359> just<00:04:20.660> an<00:04:20.810> extraordinary<00:04:21.109> challenge<00:04:21.799> it

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
it's just an extraordinary challenge it

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.850 
it's just an extraordinary challenge it
just<00:04:22.340> takes<00:04:22.550> a<00:04:22.640> long<00:04:22.880> time<00:04:23.500> yeah<00:04:24.500> it's<00:04:24.650> not<00:04:24.830> a

just takes a long time yeah it's not a

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.600 
just takes a long time yeah it's not a
it's<00:04:24.980> not<00:04:25.250> a<00:04:25.370> functionality<00:04:26.030> problem<00:04:26.660> and

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
it's not a functionality problem and

it's not a functionality problem and

it's not detectable as shipping it's a

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.400 
it's not detectable as shipping it's a
