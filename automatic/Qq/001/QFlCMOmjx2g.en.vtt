00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.780
 Hello dear friends with you about 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.360
 joker love day our beloved 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.300
 developers have presented us 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.670
 wonderful test patch 084 which 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.250
 all famously bend over new british 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.530
 poteshki and small German lighten and 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.290
 besides this were still redone 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.900
 several cards that is what interests us 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.660
 because any alteration brings us new 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.200
 bugs and loopholes about exactly one of these 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.500
 cards today and let's talk so 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.600
 in patch 084 under absolutely all modifications 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.900
 hit such a wonderful card 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.060
 like the map of the ridge of the dragon the map is very 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.340
 interesting it remade pretty 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.860
 there were a lot of great 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.110
 wonderful things and here's one of them 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.930
 already on your screens as you remember to 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.890
 patch on a piece of iron could get but 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.320
 for this we need 4 or maybe 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.070
 even ottyazhkah this homes throw 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.970
 current firefly 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.100
 now with alteration this height is much 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.770
 reduced now you can climb when 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.070
 using two hard too, is not dead no cords 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.109
 Kovpaka somehow our example Mouse Batchat 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.190
 and firefly instead of firefly you can 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:31.290
 use 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.470
 my tank they are very heavy on the ledge 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.890
 pledged so let's see how 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.020
 climb there and what's so interesting 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.030
 Here is a batch is attached with me and for 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.370
 it is attached to the mouse and so 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.190
 principle we are trying to rise 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.110
 absolutely anywhere but we 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.930
 somehow choose this option as you 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.110
 see the initial best option I'll lay down 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.800
 right there in it a place pretty pretty 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.810
 very interesting perhaps but 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.590
 is useful to you the pain well to get here 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.120
 again, it's very difficult to get in again 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.400
 especially in battle 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.150
 Exactly do not ride on the bridge because 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.770
 what you see so many openings 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.560
 which firefly can fail 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.800
 you can drive there you can 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:24.320
 come down here here unfortunately 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:27.060
 the red line of the market begins therefore 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.470
 Firefly drive there may well not like 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.260
 this is the correct red line then not 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.740
 always beautiful also with a remake of the card 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.140
 there was a small such hill on 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.790
 which you can easily pour not even 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.810
 on the firefly anna st 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.400
 maybe even on which pipe these techniques 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.610
 this is how you get how you are here 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.210
 think also a very interesting place 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.880
 maybe somehow useful in battle but 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.980
 I'm not sure about that well, and in the end 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.080
 you can come down here 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.770
 it is not so difficult here unfortunately 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.340
 the red line and the bridge support therefore 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:12.450
 it's not hard to do but work hard 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.760
 need as always do not forget by the way 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.980
 get here not all forget
