our<00:01:48.390> speed<00:01:48.689> knob<00:01:48.899> right<00:01:49.770> here<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.450> that's

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
our speed knob right here and that's

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.700 
our speed knob right here and that's
pretty<00:01:51.600> much<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:51.930> controls<00:01:52.320> alright

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
pretty much just controls alright

overall pretty much if you think of it

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.850 
overall pretty much if you think of it

if you are you're playing a little bit

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.960 
if you are you're playing a little bit
more<00:02:14.950> volume<00:02:15.160> but<00:02:15.370> you're<00:02:15.460> still<00:02:15.580> gonna<00:02:15.700> want

more volume but you're still gonna want

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.760 
more volume but you're still gonna want
to<00:02:16.060> kind<00:02:16.210> of<00:02:16.270> create<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.660> volume<00:02:16.930> up<00:02:17.170> from

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
to kind of create that volume up from

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.530 
to kind of create that volume up from
about<00:02:17.980> seven<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.460> ten<00:02:18.520> for<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.030> sweet<00:02:19.270> spot

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
about seven to ten for the sweet spot

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.390 
about seven to ten for the sweet spot
anything<00:02:19.840> above<00:02:20.560> nine<00:02:20.770> is<00:02:20.950> gonna<00:02:21.070> be<00:02:21.190> louder

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
anything above nine is gonna be louder

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.920 
anything above nine is gonna be louder
than<00:02:21.580> normal<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:22.060> anything<00:02:22.390> below<00:02:22.600> seven<00:02:22.870> is

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
than normal and anything below seven is

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.690 
than normal and anything below seven is
gonna<00:02:23.080> be<00:02:23.200> quieter<00:02:23.560> than<00:02:23.650> normal<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.160> then

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
gonna be quieter than normal and then

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.340 
gonna be quieter than normal and then
right<00:02:25.180> here<00:02:25.330> is<00:02:25.390> just<00:02:25.420> our<00:02:25.630> intensity<00:02:26.020> this<00:02:26.230> is

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
right here is just our intensity this is

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.170 
right here is just our intensity this is
how<00:02:26.470> much<00:02:26.650> we<00:02:27.220> pretty<00:02:27.370> much<00:02:27.460> have<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.000> mix

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
how much we pretty much have in the mix

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.060 
how much we pretty much have in the mix
the<00:02:28.330> whole<00:02:28.450> time<00:02:28.660> so<00:02:28.930> if<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.110> want<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.920> know<00:02:30.040> a

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
the whole time so if you want you know a

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.800 
the whole time so if you want you know a
real<00:02:30.400> soft<00:02:30.730> style<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.300> can<00:02:31.450> turn<00:02:31.570> everything

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
real soft style you can turn everything

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.050 
real soft style you can turn everything
down<00:02:32.080> but<00:02:32.350> this<00:02:33.130> pedal<00:02:33.370> does<00:02:33.550> pretty<00:02:33.880> much

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
down but this pedal does pretty much

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.030 
down but this pedal does pretty much
sound<00:02:34.270> good<00:02:34.540> cranked<00:02:34.960> out<00:02:35.050> let's<00:02:35.710> check<00:02:35.770> out

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
sound good cranked out let's check out

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.800 
sound good cranked out let's check out
the<00:02:36.160> actual<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.120> outs<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.480> everything

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
the actual in and outs and everything

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.520 
the actual in and outs and everything
right<00:02:37.960> now<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:40.060> right<00:02:40.090> here<00:02:40.540> we<00:02:41.020> actually<00:02:41.050> have

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
right now so right here we actually have

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.680 
right now so right here we actually have
our<00:02:41.560> input<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:43.060> that's<00:02:43.210> just<00:02:43.390> our<00:02:43.510> standard

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
our input so that's just our standard

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.580 
our input so that's just our standard
input<00:02:44.550> is<00:02:45.550> our<00:02:45.820> standard<00:02:46.720> output<00:02:46.900> right<00:02:47.380> over

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
input is our standard output right over

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.740 
input is our standard output right over
here<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.010> then<00:02:48.520> the<00:02:48.640> cool<00:02:48.820> thing<00:02:49.030> is<00:02:49.060> what<00:02:49.720> I

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
here and then the cool thing is what I

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.150 
here and then the cool thing is what I
want<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:49.960> mention<00:02:50.080> on<00:02:50.290> this<00:02:50.410> unit<00:02:50.770> is<00:02:50.890> that<00:02:51.100> you

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
want to mention on this unit is that you

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.560 
want to mention on this unit is that you
can<00:02:51.280> actually<00:02:51.400> get<00:02:51.670> an<00:02:51.790> extension<00:02:52.210> foot

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
can actually get an extension foot

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.450

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
switch for Dunlop does make one it looks

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.460 
switch for Dunlop does make one it looks
just<00:02:54.730> like<00:02:54.910> their<00:02:55.120> crybaby<00:02:55.600> pedal<00:02:55.900> that<00:02:56.320> you

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
just like their crybaby pedal that you

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.870 
just like their crybaby pedal that you
turn<00:02:56.650> up<00:02:56.770> and<00:02:56.950> down<00:02:57.070> but<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.370> actually<00:02:57.490> ends<00:02:57.820> up

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
turn up and down but it actually ends up

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.970 
turn up and down but it actually ends up
triggering<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.450> unit<00:02:58.720> on<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.260> then<00:02:59.800> also

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
triggering the unit on and then also

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.920 
triggering the unit on and then also
adjusting<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.670> rate<00:03:00.850> within<00:03:01.180> one<00:03:01.360> foot<00:03:01.630> pedal

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
adjusting the rate within one foot pedal

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.600 
adjusting the rate within one foot pedal
the<00:03:02.530> nice<00:03:02.680> thing<00:03:02.860> is<00:03:02.890> this<00:03:03.160> does<00:03:03.340> have<00:03:03.520> an

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
the nice thing is this does have an

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.350 
the nice thing is this does have an
actual<00:03:03.880> vintage<00:03:04.540> button<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:06.280> know<00:03:06.370> not<00:03:06.580> not

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
actual vintage button you know not not

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.430 
actual vintage button you know not not
even<00:03:07.390> designed<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.870> pedal<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:08.230> I'm<00:03:08.290> not<00:03:08.380> sure

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
even designed the pedal so I'm not sure

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.470 
even designed the pedal so I'm not sure
exactly<00:03:08.770> how<00:03:09.250> they<00:03:09.460> get<00:03:09.550> it<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:09.760> do<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:09.970> but<00:03:10.150> it

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
exactly how they get it to do it but it

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.510 
exactly how they get it to do it but it
does<00:03:10.690> give<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:11.050> much<00:03:11.230> more<00:03:11.260> older<00:03:12.190> kind<00:03:12.370> of

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
does give it a much more older kind of

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.870 
does give it a much more older kind of
brown-brown<00:03:13.270> sound<00:03:13.690> broken<00:03:13.990> up<00:03:14.200> kind<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:14.470> tone

leaving that on today start off with I'm

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.790 
leaving that on today start off with I'm
pretty<00:03:19.660> much<00:03:19.750> just<00:03:19.810> going<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.230> run<00:03:20.380> us<00:03:20.530> on<00:03:20.739> a

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
pretty much just going to run us on a

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.600 
pretty much just going to run us on a
very<00:03:21.520> simple<00:03:22.920> vibrato<00:03:23.920> mode<00:03:24.250> right<00:03:24.400> now<00:03:24.459> the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
very simple vibrato mode right now the

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.120 
very simple vibrato mode right now the
nice<00:03:24.820> thing<00:03:24.850> with<00:03:25.090> this<00:03:25.209> pedal<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.980> can

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
nice thing with this pedal is you can

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.860 
nice thing with this pedal is you can
actually<00:03:27.250> turn<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.790> vibrato<00:03:28.090> on<00:03:28.330> separately

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
actually turn the vibrato on separately

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.750 
actually turn the vibrato on separately
and<00:03:29.050> then<00:03:29.470> also<00:03:29.680> add<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.130> chorus<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:30.610> to

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
and then also add the chorus and to

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.070 
and then also add the chorus and to
blend<00:03:30.970> it<00:03:31.090> with<00:03:31.180> it<00:03:31.390> with<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.630> same<00:03:31.810> foot

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
blend it with it with the same foot

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.720 
blend it with it with the same foot
switch<00:03:32.320> so<00:03:32.950> let's<00:03:33.130> try<00:03:33.250> that<00:03:33.400> right<00:03:33.550> now<00:03:33.640> I've

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
switch so let's try that right now I've

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.970 
switch so let's try that right now I've
got<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:33.910> real<00:03:34.239> slow<00:03:34.600> real<00:03:34.900> laggy<00:03:35.530> kind<00:03:35.890> of

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
got a real slow real laggy kind of

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.600 
got a real slow real laggy kind of
vibrato<00:03:36.250> through<00:03:36.700> that<00:03:36.850> right<00:03:37.030> now

so<00:03:55.000> there's<00:03:55.150> our<00:03:55.270> slow<00:03:55.510> vibrato<00:03:55.900> right<00:03:56.200> now

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
so there's our slow vibrato right now

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.080 
so there's our slow vibrato right now
and<00:03:56.710> while<00:03:56.860> I'm<00:03:56.980> on<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.220> same<00:03:57.400> vibrato<00:03:57.760> I<00:03:57.910> said

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
and while I'm on the same vibrato I said

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.550 
and while I'm on the same vibrato I said
I'm<00:03:58.240> actually<00:03:58.450> just<00:03:58.720> gonna<00:03:58.930> turn<00:03:59.170> it<00:03:59.320> up<00:03:59.440> right

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
I'm actually just gonna turn it up right

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.560 
I'm actually just gonna turn it up right
now<00:03:59.620> so<00:03:59.740> you<00:03:59.890> can<00:04:00.040> hear<00:04:00.220> how<00:04:00.250> funky<00:04:01.090> this<00:04:01.210> unit

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
now so you can hear how funky this unit

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.890 
now so you can hear how funky this unit
can<00:04:01.690> get<00:04:01.900> so<00:04:02.350> now<00:04:02.530> we're<00:04:03.310> about<00:04:03.490> about<00:04:03.730> 6.5<00:04:04.420> on

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
can get so now we're about about 6.5 on

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.660 
can get so now we're about about 6.5 on
the<00:04:05.080> the<00:04:05.620> speed<00:04:05.920> control<00:04:06.310> we've<00:04:06.430> got<00:04:06.550> our

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
the the speed control we've got our

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.220 
the the speed control we've got our
volume<00:04:07.000> at<00:04:07.090> about<00:04:07.300> seven<00:04:07.630> point<00:04:07.810> five<00:04:07.960> and<00:04:08.110> our

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
volume at about seven point five and our

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.530 
volume at about seven point five and our
intensity<00:04:08.710> to<00:04:08.860> nine<00:04:09.130> so<00:04:10.060> we<00:04:10.090> can<00:04:10.240> just<00:04:10.360> really

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
intensity to nine so we can just really

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.880 
intensity to nine so we can just really
give<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.750> pedal<00:04:10.990> a<00:04:11.140> teaser<00:04:11.410> let's<00:04:11.620> try<00:04:11.740> that

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
give the pedal a teaser let's try that

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
so I'll leaving the unit on I'm actually

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.780 
so I'll leaving the unit on I'm actually
going<00:04:31.900> to<00:04:31.960> turn<00:04:32.230> our<00:04:32.920> speed<00:04:33.250> back<00:04:33.430> down<00:04:33.610> to

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
going to turn our speed back down to

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.820 
going to turn our speed back down to
something<00:04:34.120> a<00:04:34.390> little<00:04:35.020> bit<00:04:35.110> slower<00:04:35.380> so<00:04:35.500> now

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
something a little bit slower so now

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.130 
something a little bit slower so now
we're<00:04:35.950> about<00:04:36.040> three<00:04:36.520> on<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:37.270> speed<00:04:37.540> and<00:04:37.750> I'm

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
we're about three on the speed and I'm

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.320 
we're about three on the speed and I'm
going<00:04:38.320> to<00:04:38.380> actually<00:04:38.650> blend<00:04:38.890> in<00:04:39.250> our<00:04:39.580> course

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
going to actually blend in our course

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.000 
going to actually blend in our course
with<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.440> vibrato

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
with the vibrato

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.890

so<00:04:42.580> while<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:42.940> units<00:04:43.240> on<00:04:43.390> I'm<00:04:43.540> not<00:04:43.660> sure<00:04:43.750> just

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
so while the units on I'm not sure just

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.030 
so while the units on I'm not sure just
going<00:04:44.020> to<00:04:44.110> turn<00:04:44.230> that<00:04:44.320> on<00:04:44.380> right<00:04:44.620> now<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:44.950> now

volume<00:05:25.630> quite<00:05:25.810> a<00:05:25.900> bit<00:05:26.080> high<00:05:26.260> -<00:05:26.520> also<00:05:27.520> with<00:05:27.820> the

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
volume quite a bit high - also with the

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.640 
volume quite a bit high - also with the
intensity<00:05:28.270> cranked<00:05:28.750> so<00:05:29.320> let's<00:05:29.500> hear<00:05:29.590> that

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
intensity cranked so let's hear that

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.960 
intensity cranked so let's hear that
really<00:05:29.920> quick<00:05:30.100> in<00:05:30.220> a<00:05:30.280> quick<00:05:30.430> example<00:05:30.730> you're

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
really quick in a quick example you're

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:31.860 
really quick in a quick example you're
hear<00:05:31.090> a<00:05:31.120> little<00:05:31.270> bit<00:05:31.390> of<00:05:31.450> a<00:05:31.570> difference

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
hear a little bit of a difference

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:43.290 
hear a little bit of a difference
between<00:05:31.990> our<00:05:32.260> last<00:05:32.440> example<00:05:42.030> so<00:05:43.030> now<00:05:43.150> we've

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
between our last example so now we've

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.610 
between our last example so now we've
got<00:05:43.450> a<00:05:43.480> little<00:05:43.630> bit<00:05:43.810> of<00:05:43.930> gain<00:05:44.080> added<00:05:44.440> to<00:05:44.500> the

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
got a little bit of gain added to the

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.810 
got a little bit of gain added to the
amp<00:05:44.800> so<00:05:44.980> let's<00:05:45.100> just<00:05:45.250> play<00:05:45.340> some<00:05:45.520> real<00:05:45.640> simple

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
amp so let's just play some real simple

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.400 
amp so let's just play some real simple

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
difference in the tone and we've done

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.310 
difference in the tone and we've done
with<00:05:49.060> some<00:05:49.090> overdrive<00:05:49.600> on<00:05:49.960> this<00:05:50.080> particular

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
with some overdrive on this particular

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
using a standard fender tube amp we've

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.900 
using a standard fender tube amp we've
got<00:05:53.740> a<00:05:53.770> little<00:05:53.890> bit<00:05:54.040> the<00:05:54.130> gain<00:05:54.310> added<00:05:54.610> to<00:05:54.760> it

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
got a little bit the gain added to it

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.490 
got a little bit the gain added to it
and<00:05:55.090> just<00:05:55.120> a<00:05:55.240> little<00:05:55.300> bit<00:05:55.480> of<00:05:55.600> reverb<00:05:55.720> -<00:05:56.080> so

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
and just a little bit of reverb - so

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.850 
and just a little bit of reverb - so
let's<00:05:56.620> get<00:05:56.740> into<00:05:56.890> that<00:05:56.950> right<00:05:57.190> now
