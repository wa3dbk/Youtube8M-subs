00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.040
 well how clear do you want it to be 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.300
 the road authority does everything to make sure the traffic landscape for us 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.759
 to make drivers as clear as possible 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.789
 we should not be confronted with surprises like this 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.519
 and yet sometimes it is not easy to get all those signals on while driving 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.320
 at and above the road times went on to record 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.770
 thorn and there are more and more of those signals to use also one 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.650
 getting busier on the road of course and there are limits to what you do 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.010
 at 120 kilometers per hour you can still take in and that you would be someone 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.800
 must offer a images along the way 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.880
 Rijkswaterstaat is trying to ensure that the cylinders read like this 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.840
 remains possible 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.540
 the church in the time that there will be park and it was not there yet to see any information 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.500
 you had a lot less traffic 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.230
 according to total in the file and waiting but patiently wondering that it was over 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.090
 and now it is the time of hectic and speed people want to continue 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.090
 He knows in advance where we stand 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.090
 good mastery of the option winterstop book from holland gouda in both 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.800
 directions we naturally want more and more towards specific information 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.680
 Someone in Groningen has nothing on the first information that in Limburg 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.840
 takes place 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.600
 we warn if we have snow in the winter but that you stepped in the car 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.130
 it can all be said again at the affair 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.539
 so we look at it 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.659
 specific on location in a certain region that provides information to road users 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.800
 by passing on what is needed there too 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.680
 in what way is information provided than the usual 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.799
 used by the Ministry of Waterways and Public Works 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.079
 dynamic route information panels are those very large signs above the 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:38.900
 large road 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.290
 For example, where file information is on it is also rare 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.170
 in the small that can for example stand along the emergency lane if there is information 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.110
 would not give would find much more work are much more misery on the roads and 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.200
 arise 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.610
 the fact that people can make choices also does not fall behind in the 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.210
 traffic jam and we are now on this reformation knee cool 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.880
 gets 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.640
 do I choose another route 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.270
 by definition, those bikes will no longer be 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.920
 and there are also text carts that we temporarily recognize in put one 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.010
 large plate full but it closes lights we set up every text with one 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.050
 type of telephone connection can remotely change the texts to as much 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.169
 to inform potential road users of 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:21.799
 why they steal why he slow 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.889
 to provide that information on the spot 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:28.290
 and think, for example, of Congo traps or road works 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.699
 great concerts that are there 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:33.760
 But people are warned to follow a certain good to one 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:34.729
 parking spot 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:38.389
 but that means becoming the new generation and information 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.389
 pim that can also be operated guy with color 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:43.970
 further that country 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.780
 You can get deformations that you want to give from Friday or that is now fully implemented 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.630
 is going to be you will of course get through the trees once in a while 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.939
 can't see the forest anymore 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.299
 and exactly where we obviously have to pay attention, it is not allowed and the 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.099
 Dangers are just too many signs on and along the road that leads of course 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:01.759
 I also only own it 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:06.219
 we try to make him display that information as simple and as simple as possible 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.319
 give people must be able to understand training immediately and also immediately 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.229
 take action 

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:15.249
 a country 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:18.699
 excuse us that sometimes the trees no longer see the forest for the trees 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:22.739
 to draw extra attention to the motorways and a little bit in addition 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.180
 but everything that happens outside there is actually a side street 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.509
 no control over it 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:30.409
 and sometimes that is insured because just outside it 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.629
 sometimes wants to prevent advertising on a meadow 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.840
 and simply out on board that is perhaps up to that point 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.420
 but it goes further and further the intention of these billboards is to get attention 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.989
 of that road user 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.329
 And at that time you can't put your attention on it 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.139
 nevertheless traffic was getting busier 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.939
 Unfortunately, Rijkswaterstaat cannot do anything about it, the only thing we can do is 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:59.079
 ask the municipality or province not to issue any permits for this 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.369
 give the if we look to the future as a piece I think the people 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:07.029
 much better and much quicker not to be bothered about how they make their route 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:10.029
 have to drive and what some may encounter 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:13.239
 do nothing 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.689
 we are already maria the system with animals warning the road user of it 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:20.170
 fact that they come for example and and a future long-term traffic jam 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.450
 and advise richly through the system to choose alternative routes but you can 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.180
 You think new techniques out there and it all came with moves 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.700
 the sms all day long will be able to think of that pronounced sms in the future 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.880
 messages that are available to you for a very specific area 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.490
 Nijmegen on the A50 for long-term finding then you can be in that area and send text messages 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.100
 without bothering another person and with the information we provide 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.590
 use it at that time 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.690
 provide information to road users who are open 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.880
 that moment is in that place, it is of course a goal 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.670
 but a piece is known to the perpetrator
