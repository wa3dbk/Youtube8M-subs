okay got under that magic number now

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.950 
okay got under that magic number now
first<00:00:34.920> what<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.430> want<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.660> get

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
first what you want to do is get

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.410 
first what you want to do is get
familiar<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.469> your<00:00:37.590> blocks<00:00:38.010> also<00:00:38.420> realizing

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
familiar with your blocks also realizing

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.319 
familiar with your blocks also realizing
that<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.930> 200<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> 400<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.790> start<00:00:42.120> is

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
that the 200 and the 400 the start is

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.670 
that the 200 and the 400 the start is
going<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.570> bring<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.899> into<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.290> curved

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
going to bring you into a curved

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.590 
going to bring you into a curved
position<00:00:44.219> whereas<00:00:44.850> if<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.149> were<00:00:45.180> running<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
position whereas if you were running the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.479 
position whereas if you were running the
100<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.649> don't<00:00:46.770> have<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.980> worry<00:00:47.100> about<00:00:47.129> going

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
100 you don't have to worry about going

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.299 
100 you don't have to worry about going
straight<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.200> if<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.410> would<00:00:49.620> set<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:49.920> block

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
straight so if you would set your block

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.160 
straight so if you would set your block
straight<00:00:50.730> here<00:00:51.120> then<00:00:51.629> you're<00:00:51.840> going<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.020> have

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
straight here then you're going to have

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.630 
straight here then you're going to have
to<00:00:52.260> make<00:00:52.440> an<00:00:52.590> abrupt<00:00:52.920> turn<00:00:53.160> you're<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.579> to

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
to make an abrupt turn you're going to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.490 
to make an abrupt turn you're going to
be<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:54.000> right<00:00:54.270> into<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.750> intersection<00:00:55.230> to

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
be going right into this intersection to

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.650 
be going right into this intersection to
the<00:00:55.530> right<00:00:55.770> what<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:56.460> want<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.329> set<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the right what we want to do is set the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.810 
the right what we want to do is set the
blocks<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.320> manner<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.859> we're<00:00:59.430> going<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
blocks in a manner that we're going to

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.479 
blocks in a manner that we're going to
intersect<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.930> inside<00:01:01.350> lane<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.250> if<00:01:02.370> you

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
intersect with the inside lane so if you

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.620 
intersect with the inside lane so if you
stand<00:01:02.820> behind<00:01:03.149> your<00:01:03.539> blocks<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:05.299> then<00:01:06.299> let

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
stand behind your blocks and then let

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.050 
stand behind your blocks and then let
the<00:01:06.780> iSight<00:01:07.320> hit<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.460> me<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.850> going<00:01:09.000> to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the iSight hit and to me it's going to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.940 
the iSight hit and to me it's going to
be<00:01:09.150> about<00:01:09.630> right<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:12.170> so<00:01:13.170> Reggie<00:01:13.470> kind<00:01:13.830> of

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
be about right here so Reggie kind of

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.440 
be about right here so Reggie kind of
set<00:01:14.250> your<00:01:14.460> blocks<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:15.000> you're<00:01:15.180> going<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.330> be

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
set your blocks that you're going to be

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.190 
set your blocks that you're going to be
at<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.720> angle<00:01:16.110> right<00:01:16.259> here

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.490 

I<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:23.340> turkey<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.909> turn<00:01:24.229> yeah<00:01:27.320> that's<00:01:28.320> pretty

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
I the turkey I turn yeah that's pretty

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.789 
I the turkey I turn yeah that's pretty
good

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
good

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.830 
good
that's<00:01:29.159> pretty<00:01:29.430> good<00:01:29.670> now<00:01:30.180> what<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.450> allows

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
that's pretty good now what that allows

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.490 
that's pretty good now what that allows
him<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.140> do<00:01:31.790> he's<00:01:32.790> got<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> direct<00:01:33.479> shot<00:01:33.869> into

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
him to do he's got a direct shot into

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.690 
him to do he's got a direct shot into
the<00:01:34.590> intersection<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.399> curve<00:01:37.340> okay<00:01:38.340> next

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the intersection of the curve okay next

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.389 
the intersection of the curve okay next
thing<00:01:39.140> Reggie<00:01:40.140> has<00:01:40.380> got<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.740> set<00:01:40.950> his<00:01:41.100> blocks

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
thing Reggie has got to set his blocks

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.420 
thing Reggie has got to set his blocks
properly<00:01:41.970> not<00:01:42.450> only<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.350> spacing<00:01:43.950> difference

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
properly not only the spacing difference

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.639 
properly not only the spacing difference
in<00:01:44.549> there<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.119> meets<00:01:45.330> his<00:01:45.539> build<00:01:45.899> but<00:01:46.619> also

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
in there that meets his build but also

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.630 
in there that meets his build but also
the<00:01:47.189> angle<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.210> block<00:01:48.479> itself<00:01:49.640> first

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
the angle of the block itself first

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.290 
the angle of the block itself first
we'll<00:01:50.850> set<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.240> blocks<00:01:52.430> okay<00:01:53.430> looks<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.149> you

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
we'll set the blocks okay looks like you

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.419 
we'll set the blocks okay looks like you
got<00:01:54.450> them<00:01:54.600> about<00:01:54.869> 12<00:01:55.380> inches<00:01:55.619> apart<00:01:55.920> there

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
got them about 12 inches apart there

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:03.440 
got them about 12 inches apart there
maybe<00:01:57.619> probably<00:02:00.979> right<00:02:01.979> now<00:02:02.220> what<00:02:02.789> what<00:02:03.210> you

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
maybe probably right now what what you

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.070 
maybe probably right now what what you
do<00:02:03.929> here<00:02:04.319> actually<00:02:05.280> Reggie<00:02:05.970> has<00:02:06.659> got<00:02:06.929> to

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
do here actually Reggie has got to

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.840 
do here actually Reggie has got to
reverse<00:02:07.350> or<00:02:07.770> what<00:02:07.920> you're<00:02:08.069> supposed<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.399> be

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
reverse or what you're supposed to be

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.690 
reverse or what you're supposed to be
so<00:02:09.119> Reggie<00:02:09.539> number<00:02:09.840> one<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.950> front<00:02:11.250> block<00:02:11.489> you

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
so Reggie number one the front block you

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.449 
so Reggie number one the front block you

you<00:02:14.700> set<00:02:14.970> up<00:02:15.120> why<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.690> well<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:17.100> position

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
you set up why is that well the position

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.729 
you set up why is that well the position
when<00:02:17.880> you're<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.239> set<00:02:18.450> position<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:19.440> foot

your foots off and the hill needs to be
have<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.690> little<00:02:27.780> support<00:02:28.440> there<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.130> you'll

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
have a little support there and you'll

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.789 
have a little support there and you'll
see<00:02:29.579> that<00:02:29.730> as<00:02:29.910> he<00:02:30.030> gets<00:02:30.239> in<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.510> blocks<00:02:30.799> okay

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
see that as he gets in the blocks okay

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.009 
see that as he gets in the blocks okay
Reggie<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.160> just<00:02:32.370> get<00:02:32.549> just<00:02:32.940> this<00:02:33.390> back<00:02:33.690> into

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
Reggie you just get just this back into

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.990 
Reggie you just get just this back into
the<00:02:34.109> blocks<00:02:34.320> first<00:02:34.620> we'll<00:02:35.579> show<00:02:35.760> them<00:02:35.850> what

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
the blocks first we'll show them what

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.060 
the blocks first we'll show them what
we're<00:02:36.150> talking<00:02:36.450> about

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.370 

okay<00:02:44.070> you<00:02:44.310> notice<00:02:44.640> right<00:02:44.730> here<00:02:44.880> if<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.020> block

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
okay you notice right here if this block

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.800 
okay you notice right here if this block
was<00:02:46.680> laid<00:02:47.250> back<00:02:47.520> it<00:02:47.850> would<00:02:48.030> be<00:02:48.180> them<00:02:48.360> even

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
was laid back it would be them even

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.750 
was laid back it would be them even
being<00:02:48.990> further<00:02:49.320> here<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:50.610> actually

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
being further here this is actually

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.850 
being further here this is actually
going<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.180> be<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.300> recall<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.080> teaching

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
going to be a recall and teaching

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.210 
going to be a recall and teaching
starting<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:54.210> new<00:02:54.450> concept<00:02:55.110> where<00:02:55.350> I<00:02:55.380> taught

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
starting the new concept where I taught

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.340 
starting the new concept where I taught
it<00:02:56.370> forever<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.570> have<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.750> single<00:02:58.200> leg

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
it forever that you have a single leg

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.210 
it forever that you have a single leg
push<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:59.550> theory<00:03:00.090> now<00:03:00.270> is<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:01.320> reality<00:03:01.680> when

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
push the theory now is in reality when

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.580 
push the theory now is in reality when
the<00:03:02.310> gun<00:03:02.550> fires<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:03.450> really<00:03:03.750> have<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.930> double

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
the gun fires you really have a double

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.430 
the gun fires you really have a double
leg<00:03:04.800> push<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.400> then<00:03:05.880> a<00:03:05.910> single<00:03:06.420> leg<00:03:06.570> push<00:03:06.840> well

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
leg push and then a single leg push well

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.590 
leg push and then a single leg push well
that's<00:03:07.650> all<00:03:07.920> in<00:03:08.280> semantics<00:03:08.880> it's<00:03:09.240> what<00:03:09.420> you're

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
that's all in semantics it's what you're

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.810 
that's all in semantics it's what you're
told<00:03:09.750> me<00:03:09.900> I've<00:03:10.110> always<00:03:10.440> maintained<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.580> you

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
told me I've always maintained that you

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.420 
told me I've always maintained that you
have<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.420> single<00:03:13.290> leg<00:03:13.470> push<00:03:13.830> with<00:03:14.400> your

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
have a single leg push with your

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.150 
have a single leg push with your
strongest<00:03:15.060> leg<00:03:15.330> this<00:03:15.990> leg<00:03:16.050> is<00:03:16.620> being

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
strongest leg this leg is being

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.910 
strongest leg this leg is being
conscious<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.820> going<00:03:18.150> forward<00:03:18.450> but<00:03:19.260> in<00:03:19.500> order

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
conscious of going forward but in order

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.130 
conscious of going forward but in order
to<00:03:20.070> go<00:03:20.220> forward<00:03:20.520> it's<00:03:21.420> going<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.750> kick<00:03:21.930> back

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
to go forward it's going to kick back

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.820 
to go forward it's going to kick back
slightly<00:03:22.740> so<00:03:24.260> conceivably<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.500> could<00:03:25.680> say

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
slightly so conceivably you could say

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.920 
slightly so conceivably you could say
it's<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.130> two-legged<00:03:26.640> push<00:03:26.850> but<00:03:27.330> I<00:03:27.360> really<00:03:27.810> have

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
it's a two-legged push but I really have

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.140 
it's a two-legged push but I really have
my<00:03:28.110> strong<00:03:28.470> doubts<00:03:28.740> that<00:03:29.040> most<00:03:29.610> kids<00:03:29.820> think

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
my strong doubts that most kids think

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.420 
my strong doubts that most kids think
about<00:03:30.480> pushing<00:03:30.930> other<00:03:31.380> than<00:03:31.650> pushing<00:03:32.100> in

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
about pushing other than pushing in

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.670 
about pushing other than pushing in
order<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.120> get<00:03:33.240> it<00:03:33.360> out<00:03:33.450> this<00:03:33.720> way<00:03:33.870> not<00:03:34.350> pushing

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
order to get it out this way not pushing

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.290 
order to get it out this way not pushing
against<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.160> blocks<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.610> go<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:36.000> way<00:03:36.180> so

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
against the blocks to go that way so

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.180 
against the blocks to go that way so
he's<00:03:39.300> going<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.660> be<00:03:39.870> thanking<00:03:40.350> primarily<00:03:40.980> of

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
he's going to be thanking primarily of

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.850 
he's going to be thanking primarily of
exerting<00:03:42.090> force<00:03:42.450> here<00:03:42.840> pushing<00:03:43.350> against<00:03:43.680> this

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
exerting force here pushing against this

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.000 
exerting force here pushing against this
block<00:03:44.330> to<00:03:45.330> propel<00:03:45.720> him<00:03:45.930> out<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.380> actually

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
block to propel him out and actually

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.680 
block to propel him out and actually
starting<00:03:49.310> it's<00:03:50.310> hard<00:03:50.610> you<00:03:51.300> want<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.600> go

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
starting it's hard you want to go

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.530 
starting it's hard you want to go
horizontally<00:03:52.500> fast<00:03:52.830> that's<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.700> object<00:03:53.880> but

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
horizontally fast that's the object but

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.480 
horizontally fast that's the object but
in<00:03:54.660> order<00:03:54.990> to<00:03:55.050> do<00:03:55.350> that<00:03:55.560> you're<00:03:56.130> going<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.370> have

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
in order to do that you're going to have

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.900 
in order to do that you're going to have
to<00:03:56.640> have<00:03:56.760> vertical<00:03:57.450> force<00:03:58.310> coming<00:03:59.310> down<00:03:59.460> of

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
to have vertical force coming down of

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.630 
to have vertical force coming down of
the<00:04:00.150> support<00:04:00.600> leg<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:01.200> what<00:04:01.740> propels<00:04:02.280> you<00:04:02.430> that

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
the support leg is what propels you that

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.280 
the support leg is what propels you that
way<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.240> only<00:04:03.450> time<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:03.870> really<00:04:04.110> have<00:04:04.260> a

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
way the only time you really have a

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.910 
way the only time you really have a
combination<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.430> vertical<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.570> horizontal

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
combination of vertical and horizontal

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.320 
combination of vertical and horizontal
would<00:04:07.920> be<00:04:08.100> in<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.400> starting<00:04:08.640> because<00:04:09.120> you're

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
would be in the starting because you're

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.900 
would be in the starting because you're
coming<00:04:09.570> from<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:10.050> down<00:04:10.530> position<00:04:10.770> up<00:04:11.520> to<00:04:11.580> a

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
coming from a down position up to a

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.730 
coming from a down position up to a
vertical<00:04:12.660> position<00:04:13.020> so<00:04:13.410> he's<00:04:13.560> in<00:04:13.710> a

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
vertical position so he's in a

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.370 
vertical position so he's in a
horizontal<00:04:14.130> position<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:15.090> start<00:04:15.360> with<00:04:15.630> he's
