first free hi expandable full lamp wall

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.450 
first free hi expandable full lamp wall
it's<00:00:25.510> the<00:00:25.720> first<00:00:25.990> one<00:00:26.320> of<00:00:26.440> its<00:00:26.530> kind<00:00:26.680> it<00:00:27.160> has

it's the first one of its kind it has

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.000 
it's the first one of its kind it has
never<00:00:27.790> been<00:00:27.910> done<00:00:28.300> before<00:00:28.510> and<00:00:29.020> yeah<00:00:29.680> it's<00:00:29.890> a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
never been done before and yeah it's a

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.570 
never been done before and yeah it's a
new<00:00:30.190> concept<00:00:30.400> and<00:00:31.000> I<00:00:31.480> tried<00:00:32.349> my<00:00:32.800> best<00:00:32.830> to<00:00:33.340> make

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
new concept and I tried my best to make

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.330 
new concept and I tried my best to make
it<00:00:33.610> compaq<00:00:34.390> and<00:00:34.629> maintain<00:00:35.410> that<00:00:35.650> amazing

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
it compaq and maintain that amazing

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.729 
it compaq and maintain that amazing
speed<00:00:36.670> that<00:00:36.940> I<00:00:37.150> was<00:00:37.570> able<00:00:37.750> to<00:00:37.989> get<00:00:38.140> out<00:00:38.379> of<00:00:38.440> it

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
speed that I was able to get out of it

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.460 
speed that I was able to get out of it
and<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:40.120> can<00:00:40.420> show<00:00:40.449> it<00:00:40.600> to<00:00:40.780> you<00:00:40.870> in<00:00:40.989> action<00:00:41.140> out

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
and I can show it to you in action out

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.490 
and I can show it to you in action out
and<00:00:41.680> you<00:00:42.640> can<00:00:42.790> see<00:00:43.180> it's<00:00:43.420> really<00:00:43.690> really<00:00:44.170> fast

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
and you can see it's really really fast

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.860 
and you can see it's really really fast
and<00:00:44.739> there's<00:00:45.250> so<00:00:45.489> much<00:00:45.640> going<00:00:45.850> on<00:00:46.120> that<00:00:46.360> it

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
and there's so much going on that it

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.430 
and there's so much going on that it
even<00:00:47.050> slows<00:00:47.470> down<00:00:47.830> my<00:00:48.250> pc<00:00:48.879> by<00:00:49.210> around<00:00:49.629> 200<00:00:50.290> FPS

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
even slows down my pc by around 200 FPS

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.310 
even slows down my pc by around 200 FPS
and<00:00:51.040> you<00:00:51.909> should<00:00:52.150> know<00:00:52.360> that<00:00:52.390> I<00:00:52.629> have<00:00:52.900> a<00:00:53.019> pretty

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
and you should know that I have a pretty

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.000 
and you should know that I have a pretty
pretty<00:00:53.769> good<00:00:54.100> pc<00:00:54.550> and<00:00:54.870> yeah<00:00:55.870> that<00:00:56.650> is<00:00:56.800> because

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
pretty good pc and yeah that is because

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.780 
pretty good pc and yeah that is because
of<00:00:57.250> all<00:00:57.820> that<00:00:57.879> redstone<00:00:58.750> over<00:00:59.320> here<00:00:59.739> so<00:01:00.519> you

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
of all that redstone over here so you

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.280 
of all that redstone over here so you
can<00:01:01.000> see<00:01:01.030> it<00:01:01.360> kind<00:01:02.260> of<00:01:02.530> big<00:01:02.890> in<00:01:03.129> 6<00:01:03.489> x<00:01:03.760> 4<00:01:04.180> x<00:01:04.210> 16<00:01:05.049> and

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
can see it kind of big in 6 x 4 x 16 and

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.640 
can see it kind of big in 6 x 4 x 16 and
I<00:01:06.250> really<00:01:06.790> tried<00:01:07.090> my<00:01:07.360> best<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.930> keep<00:01:08.260> it<00:01:08.500> in

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
I really tried my best to keep it in

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.910 
I really tried my best to keep it in
that<00:01:08.680> space<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:09.250> not<00:01:09.729> make<00:01:09.970> it<00:01:10.150> bigger<00:01:10.390> and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that space and not make it bigger and

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.149 
that space and not make it bigger and
yeah<00:01:11.920> I<00:01:12.100> can<00:01:12.280> show<00:01:12.430> you<00:01:12.490> in<00:01:12.760> action<00:01:12.940> ax<00:01:13.299> and<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
yeah I can show you in action ax and the

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.120 
yeah I can show you in action ax and the
crazy<00:01:15.430> thing<00:01:15.520> is<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:16.030> opening<00:01:16.509> I<00:01:16.689> think

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
crazy thing is the opening I think

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.100 
crazy thing is the opening I think
because<00:01:18.130> there<00:01:18.520> are<00:01:18.640> so<00:01:18.670> many<00:01:19.090> butted<00:01:19.659> Pistons

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
because there are so many butted Pistons

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.740 
because there are so many butted Pistons
over<00:01:20.469> here<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:20.890> that<00:01:21.250> creates<00:01:21.969> a<00:01:22.119> lot<00:01:22.299> of<00:01:22.360> lag

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
over here and that creates a lot of lag

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.609 
over here and that creates a lot of lag
and<00:01:23.369> yeah<00:01:24.369> I<00:01:24.399> did<00:01:24.880> not<00:01:25.149> design<00:01:25.810> this<00:01:26.049> thing<00:01:26.380> on

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
and yeah I did not design this thing on

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.450 
and yeah I did not design this thing on
my<00:01:26.799> own<00:01:27.359> cranberry<00:01:28.359> jelly<00:01:28.950> helped<00:01:29.950> me<00:01:30.189> to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
my own cranberry jelly helped me to

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.779 
my own cranberry jelly helped me to
create<00:01:30.909> this<00:01:31.149> concept<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.079> he<00:01:32.950> made<00:01:33.340> his<00:01:33.549> own

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
create this concept and he made his own

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.130 
create this concept and he made his own
design<00:01:34.270> but<00:01:34.869> his<00:01:35.799> design<00:01:36.509> used<00:01:37.509> another

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
design but his design used another

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.169 
design but his design used another
piston<00:01:38.590> over<00:01:38.859> here<00:01:39.070> on<00:01:39.250> that<00:01:39.429> side<00:01:39.700> somewhere

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
piston over here on that side somewhere

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.690 
piston over here on that side somewhere
over<00:01:40.420> here<00:01:40.479> to<00:01:41.259> update<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.979> other<00:01:42.159> pistons

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
over here to update the other pistons

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.980 
over here to update the other pistons
and<00:01:42.880> my<00:01:43.719> goal<00:01:43.990> was<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:45.000> keep<00:01:46.000> every<00:01:46.450> updating

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
and my goal was to keep every updating

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.399 
and my goal was to keep every updating
piston<00:01:47.439> so<00:01:47.679> when<00:01:47.920> it's<00:01:48.039> over<00:01:48.159> here<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:48.579> one<00:01:48.969> is

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
piston so when it's over here and one is

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.889 
piston so when it's over here and one is
it<00:01:50.409> somewhere<00:01:51.039> there<00:01:51.310> in<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.520> middle<00:01:51.700> to<00:01:52.630> keep

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
it somewhere there in the middle to keep

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.950 
it somewhere there in the middle to keep
all<00:01:53.170> that<00:01:53.350> updating<00:01:54.189> Pistons<00:01:54.729> there<00:01:55.630> in<00:01:55.810> that

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
all that updating Pistons there in that

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.669 
all that updating Pistons there in that
redstone<00:01:56.380> section<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.659> think<00:01:59.289> I've<00:01:59.499> done<00:01:59.619> a

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
redstone section and I think I've done a

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.219 
redstone section and I think I've done a
pretty<00:01:59.740> good<00:02:00.009> job<00:02:00.159> his<00:02:01.149> design<00:02:01.359> was<00:02:01.570> a<00:02:01.840> bit

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
pretty good job his design was a bit

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.069 
pretty good job his design was a bit
smaller<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:02.950> also<00:02:03.609> a<00:02:03.640> bit<00:02:03.880> faster<00:02:04.420> but<00:02:04.659> yeah

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
smaller and also a bit faster but yeah

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.859 
smaller and also a bit faster but yeah
he<00:02:05.380> had<00:02:05.649> to<00:02:05.859> have<00:02:06.369> this<00:02:06.729> pistons<00:02:07.240> on<00:02:07.390> that<00:02:07.569> side

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
he had to have this pistons on that side

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.150 
he had to have this pistons on that side
and<00:02:08.050> I<00:02:08.350> did<00:02:08.649> not<00:02:08.830> like<00:02:09.039> them<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.479> I<00:02:10.780> said<00:02:11.110> 6<00:02:11.650> x<00:02:11.860> 4

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
and I did not like them so I said 6 x 4

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.880 
and I did not like them so I said 6 x 4
x<00:02:12.190> 16<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.030> size<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.600> that's<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.410> minimal

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
x 16 is the size and that's the minimal

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.640 
x 16 is the size and that's the minimal
size<00:02:15.130> then<00:02:15.460> that<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.210> can<00:02:16.450> make<00:02:16.690> it

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
size then that you can make it

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.280 
size then that you can make it
and<00:02:17.739> of<00:02:18.159> course<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.610> can<00:02:18.790> expand<00:02:19.209> it<00:02:19.390> at<00:02:19.959> some

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
and of course you can expand it at some

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.110 
and of course you can expand it at some
point<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.829> would<00:02:20.980> have<00:02:21.189> to<00:02:21.430> add<00:02:21.640> some
