00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.189
 hello galera cristina relative personal 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.050
 talking trainer is entering this 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.400
 Fifth week of training our program 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.269
 to run five kilometers in eight 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.980
 weeks 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.590
 in the week the prizes are still short 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.119
 but they are intense so let's force 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.900
 a little while ago from the movie that the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.890
 people will totally change the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:29.160
 characteristic of him 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:31.019
 Come on, let's get the guys in 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.820
 this week and still have a 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.280
 a little of the training characteristics 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.829
 last week is a short workout 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.540
 it's 15 minutes only that the whole workout 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.790
 short, we work in intensity 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.110
 and in the week it will not be any different 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.789
 the idea of ​​the threshold you are using 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.739
 last week I was working on 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.760
 above the threshold will keep 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.559
 only now with a small variation 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.930
 For some time we 'll go 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.460
 pass the speed threshold a little bit 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.140
 greater number of folders a little more than 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.160
 who is accustomed and in sequence to 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.930
 people are going to go down a little bit to 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.309
 To recover this we're going to do some 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.629
 rises and falls along these 15 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.969
 minutes all 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.070
 the idea is to encourage people to 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.900
 imposes increasingly this limit up to 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.689
 of the heart to make less and less effort 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.150
 at a lower legal intensity than the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.290
 people find it difficult to tell the steps of 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.090
 esquire 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.439
 if you need to have too intense 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.000
 decreases a little intensity 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.979
 space takes time to 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.420
 recovery you need but always 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.610
 It will stimulate eliminating a little 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.610
 Cool top with the ball forward. 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.299
 so people went to train our 5th week 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.220
 our last intense workout really 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.770
 tip of the week is nail care 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.630
 feet had a screen always short 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.380
 prudent to avoid to hurt the skin 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.899
 fingers 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.130
 he is making a bubble and causing some 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.110
 thing that will interrupt your work 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.110
 cool next week
