00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello everyone to the program a first 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.009
 glimpses of the freeze was cutting focus on 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.400
 most beautiful movie cars transformers 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.230
 4 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:16.350
 before that we talk about real consumption 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:17.520
 with auto plus question consumption them 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.619
 measures announced by the builders 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.070
 that all of us more wrong than 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.869
 others 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.430
 it did not escape to self more who 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.170
 for more than a decade now 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.539
 sift every novelty of the market on 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.220
 his tour of linas montlhÃ©ry precisely 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.380
 our lab has just published its 1000 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.880
 last steps and you'll see the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.530
 observation is edifying listen to nicolas 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.690
 Bernard Chief of Service and Auto Scene 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.790
 most were consumption that rises 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.170
 up to 80% more ie 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.510
 almost twice what is announced 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.710
 at best it goes down to less than 10% of 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.660
 squares in general it's about 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.010
 sports builders and profits 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.440
 finally of a European cycle which is 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.320
 very kind to them who realized in 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.820
 a room closed on rolls or one 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.500
 do not spin the wheels there are 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.520
 very low accelerations and that's for 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.250
 that we find numbers that are 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.320
 impossible to redo on the road so 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.910
 it suits them well necessarily even 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.650
 if they know that the present time 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.729
 never had such big differences 40% 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.080
 on average the gap between what they 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.970
 announce is what we find 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.380
 actually on the road facing this setback 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.540
 the European Commission decided to 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.280
 react by substituting the current cycle of 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.990
 average consumption by a new 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.580
 currently under development 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.659
 meanwhile find all the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.299
 more auto measurements in a folder 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.700
 exceptional to read in the number 1369 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.500
 on newsstands from November 28 to December 4 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.659
 and no time limit on 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.780
 pc tablets and via google headsets 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.549
 play and apple that follows there the mystery 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.860
 is not up yet but it could 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.650
 be the mercedes g and the future coupe 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.759
 competitor of the bmw x6 the one that one 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.110
 could discover from the month of 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.000
 January at Strait Auto Show 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.280
 pose alongside the class c for 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.530
 promote a new brand within 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.759
 from the firm to the star amg sport has 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.380
 product will fit in the range 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.990
 between the body kits is the real ones 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.960
 prepared models and badger amg a kind 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.729
 of version s to the audi in sum the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.320
 did you know bumblebee the yellow camaro 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.180
 star of the saga received a facelift 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.920
 in this fourth installment and this is 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.630
 absolutely not the doro of design 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.030
 chevrolet which is causing the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.250
 transformation but the production 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.530
 the entire front and back part of 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.180
 the car has been changed look and 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.280
 Husband son wider and my 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.439
 so we prominently characterize this 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.870
 declination that will have asked the team 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.459
 over 3000 hours of casting work 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.379
 automobile which also counts some 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.930
 beautiful recruits whose modified for the shot 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.689
 when your race team stingray of 1959 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.209
 pagani huayra bugatti veyron or 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.799
 lamborghini adventador and supercars have 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.500
 between chases and amp fight 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.299
 is between my robot guys and galibot dvd 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.760
 and blu ray of the fourth part of the saga 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.989
 transformers the age of extinction into 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.510
 playing without further delay on the site 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.920
