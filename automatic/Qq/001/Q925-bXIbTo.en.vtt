00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
Photoshop cs6 extended and today we're

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.179 
Photoshop cs6 extended and today we're
going<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.220> look<00:00:05.370> at<00:00:05.609> materials<00:00:06.420> and<00:00:06.830> UVs

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
going to look at materials and UVs

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.000 
going to look at materials and UVs
this<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.790> part<00:00:09.269> 3<00:00:09.660> video<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.139> believe<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.800> going

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
this is part 3 video I believe of going

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.740 
this is part 3 video I believe of going
into<00:00:11.130> materials<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.730> what<00:00:11.820> not<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.179> we're

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
into materials and what not and we're

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.999 
into materials and what not and we're
going<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.929> look<00:00:13.049> at<00:00:13.139> painting<00:00:13.500> on<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:13.740> head

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
going to look at painting on this head

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.070 
going to look at painting on this head
and<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.460> UV<00:00:14.759> materials<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.719> what<00:00:15.960> that

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
and the UV materials and and what that

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.269 
and the UV materials and and what that
all<00:00:16.199> means<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.710> how<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.830> find<00:00:17.039> them<00:00:17.160> in

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
all means and how to find them in

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.640 
all means and how to find them in
Photoshop<00:00:17.720> before<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.779> do<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:18.960> let's<00:00:19.350> look<00:00:19.500> at

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
Photoshop before I do that let's look at

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.859 
Photoshop before I do that let's look at
UVs<00:00:20.039> very<00:00:20.279> quickly<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.699> grabbed<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.600> image

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
UVs very quickly I grabbed this image

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.269 
UVs very quickly I grabbed this image
from<00:00:22.020> Wikipedia<00:00:22.619> if<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.920> just<00:00:23.100> search<00:00:23.250> for

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
from Wikipedia if you just search for

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.029 
from Wikipedia if you just search for
UVs<00:00:23.880> you'll<00:00:24.570> see<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> 3d<00:00:25.050> model<00:00:25.350> there's<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.710> UV

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
UVs you'll see a 3d model there's a UV

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.890 
UVs you'll see a 3d model there's a UV
map<00:00:26.250> here's<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.730> texture<00:00:27.240> map<00:00:27.269> that's<00:00:27.720> mapped

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
map here's a texture map that's mapped

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.740 
map here's a texture map that's mapped
on<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.310> UVs<00:00:29.760> basically<00:00:30.330> provide

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
on to this and the UVs basically provide

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.659 
on to this and the UVs basically provide
the<00:00:30.840> information<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.410> will<00:00:31.650> place<00:00:32.009> this

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
the information that will place this

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.940 
the information that will place this
texture<00:00:33.300> as<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.170> can<00:00:34.320> see<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.530> applied<00:00:34.829> on

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
texture as you can see it's applied on

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.479 
texture as you can see it's applied on
this<00:00:35.040> UV<00:00:35.370> here<00:00:35.579> on<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.059> model<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.739> shows<00:00:38.219> it

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
this UV here on the model it it shows it

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.369 
this UV here on the model it it shows it
where<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.450> be<00:00:39.570> applied<00:00:39.660> or<00:00:39.930> wrapped

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
where it is to be applied or wrapped

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.770 
where it is to be applied or wrapped
around<00:00:40.590> your<00:00:40.890> 3d<00:00:41.190> object<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.790> that's<00:00:42.239> what<00:00:42.450> UV

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
around your 3d object and that's what UV

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.709 
around your 3d object and that's what UV
maps<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:44.129> let's<00:00:44.309> go<00:00:44.430> back<00:00:44.460> here<00:00:44.969> we're

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
maps do so let's go back here we're

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.139 
maps do so let's go back here we're
looking<00:00:45.840> at<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.260> Lego<00:00:46.559> man<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.100> cool<00:00:47.969> little

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
looking at this Lego man is cool little

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.090 
looking at this Lego man is cool little
Lego<00:00:48.420> figure<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.320> we're<00:00:49.950> going<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
Lego figure here and we're going to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.520 
Lego figure here and we're going to
paint<00:00:50.309> some<00:00:50.660> something<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.840> his<00:00:51.960> head<00:00:52.170> here

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
paint some something on his head here

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.799 
paint some something on his head here
now<00:00:53.309> I'm<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.969> go<00:00:54.030> ahead<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.780> that

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
now I'm going to go ahead and do that

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
right now I'm just going to do a dot

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.810 
right now I'm just going to do a dot
here<00:00:56.640> dot<00:00:57.270> here<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.010> there<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.160> go<00:00:59.309> now<00:00:59.340> where

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
here dot here and there you go now where

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.910 
here dot here and there you go now where
has<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.210> been<00:01:00.270> applied<00:01:00.809> let's<00:01:01.440> open<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
has this been applied let's open the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.590 
has this been applied let's open the
texture<00:01:02.449> and<00:01:03.920> I'm<00:01:04.920> going<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.489> arrange<00:01:06.360> my

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
texture and I'm going to arrange my

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.620 
texture and I'm going to arrange my
workspace<00:01:06.930> accordingly<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:08.240> let's<00:01:09.240> slide

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
workspace accordingly here let's slide

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.240 
workspace accordingly here let's slide
him<00:01:09.840> around<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:11.900> close<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:14.130> can

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
him around and close that and you can

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.679 
him around and close that and you can
see<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.640> there's<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.970> space<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> middle

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
see that there's a space in the middle

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.070 
see that there's a space in the middle
of<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.140> map<00:01:16.799> here<00:01:17.330> let's<00:01:18.330> back<00:01:18.570> up<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.900> little

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
of this map here let's back up a little

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.499 
of this map here let's back up a little
bit<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.650> full<00:01:19.830> texture<00:01:20.250> here<00:01:20.430> now<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.210> can

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
bit so the full texture here now you can

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.560 
bit so the full texture here now you can
look<00:01:21.659> at<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> UVs<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.619> your<00:01:23.009> layer<00:01:23.369> here<00:01:23.820> by

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
look at the UVs on your layer here by

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.010 
look at the UVs on your layer here by
going<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.619> 3d<00:01:26.180> menu<00:01:27.180> create<00:01:27.720> paint

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
going to the 3d menu create paint

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.800 
going to the 3d menu create paint
overlay<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:29.100> you'll<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.640> wireframe<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.570> it

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
overlay and you'll see wireframe and it

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.810 
overlay and you'll see wireframe and it
will<00:01:30.960> show<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.320> exactly<00:01:32.009> where<00:01:32.280> these<00:01:32.430> things

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
will show you exactly where these things

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.240 
will show you exactly where these things
mapped<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> object<00:01:34.140> let's<00:01:34.799> zoom<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.189> a

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
mapped on to the object let's zoom in a

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.880 
mapped on to the object let's zoom in a
little<00:01:35.369> bit<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.380> see<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.770> it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
little bit and you can see that it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.260 
little bit and you can see that it
generated<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.549> new<00:01:38.820> layer<00:01:39.060> with<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.479> wireframe

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
generated a new layer with the wireframe

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.580 
generated a new layer with the wireframe
concede<00:01:42.270> turn<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.899> off<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.200> could<00:01:43.470> even

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
concede turn it on and off I could even

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.830 
concede turn it on and off I could even
save<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.810> is

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
save this and you can see that it is

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.740 
save this and you can see that it is
applied<00:01:46.290> because<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:47.009> another<00:01:47.130> layer

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
applied because it's just another layer

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
object and create new ones inside

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.160 
object and create new ones inside
Photoshop<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:39.100> I'll<00:03:39.310> say<00:03:39.610> ok<00:03:40.480> let's<00:03:40.930> do<00:03:41.140> it

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
Photoshop and I'll say ok let's do it

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.900 
Photoshop and I'll say ok let's do it
you<00:03:41.500> can<00:03:41.650> do<00:03:41.740> fewer<00:03:42.040> seams<00:03:42.370> or<00:03:42.700> a<00:03:42.730> lower

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
you can do fewer seams or a lower

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.520 
you can do fewer seams or a lower
Distortion<00:03:43.600> I'm<00:03:43.750> just<00:03:44.020> going<00:03:44.140> to<00:03:44.200> say<00:03:44.320> lower

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
Distortion I'm just going to say lower

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.930 
Distortion I'm just going to say lower
distortion<00:03:45.100> this<00:03:45.220> time<00:03:45.460> around<00:03:45.700> and

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
distortion this time around and

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.400 
distortion this time around and
everything<00:03:46.870> is<00:03:46.960> gone

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
everything is gone

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.170 
everything is gone
or<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:47.980> backs<00:03:48.130> have<00:03:48.310> been<00:03:48.430> remapped<00:03:48.820> it's<00:03:49.060> not

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
or the backs have been remapped it's not

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.850 
or the backs have been remapped it's not
gone<00:03:49.360> but<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.570> UVs<00:03:49.840> are<00:03:49.960> gone<00:03:50.170> so<00:03:50.410> if<00:03:50.500> I<00:03:50.560> open

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
gone but the UVs are gone so if I open

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.610 
gone but the UVs are gone so if I open
this<00:03:50.950> up<00:03:51.100> again<00:03:51.250> this<00:03:52.180> is<00:03:52.390> still<00:03:52.600> here<00:03:52.900> but<00:03:53.140> if

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
this up again this is still here but if

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.520 
this up again this is still here but if
we<00:03:54.100> go<00:03:54.400> back<00:03:54.610> to<00:03:54.760> 3d<00:03:55.060> create<00:03:55.900> paint<00:03:56.170> overlay

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
we go back to 3d create paint overlay

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.720 
we go back to 3d create paint overlay
let's<00:03:56.890> find<00:03:57.070> out<00:03:57.160> where<00:03:57.310> those<00:03:57.370> movies<00:03:57.700> are

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
let's find out where those movies are

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.430 
let's find out where those movies are
they're<00:03:58.150> down<00:03:58.360> here<00:03:58.750> they've<00:03:59.320> been

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
they're down here they've been

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.050 
they're down here they've been
simplified<00:03:59.800> and<00:04:00.280> they're<00:04:00.370> down<00:04:00.520> here<00:04:00.580> so<00:04:00.940> the

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
simplified and they're down here so the

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.600 
simplified and they're down here so the
face<00:04:01.270> I<00:04:01.570> think<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.530> face<00:04:02.710> is<00:04:02.740> actually<00:04:03.070> here

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
face I think the face is actually here

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.630 
face I think the face is actually here
so<00:04:03.670> I<00:04:03.820> put<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.030> dot<00:04:04.300> here<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:04.630> a<00:04:04.750> dot<00:04:04.780> here<00:04:05.170> let's

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
so I put a dot here and a dot here let's

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.530 
so I put a dot here and a dot here let's
let's<00:04:06.870> tile<00:04:07.870> here<00:04:08.320> and<00:04:08.440> get<00:04:08.560> an<00:04:08.650> idea<00:04:08.950> and<00:04:09.540> save

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
let's tile here and get an idea and save

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.750 
let's tile here and get an idea and save
this<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:11.050> you<00:04:11.740> can<00:04:11.920> see<00:04:12.130> that<00:04:12.280> is<00:04:12.430> actually

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
this and you can see that is actually

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.180 
this and you can see that is actually
the<00:04:12.880> head<00:04:13.450> there<00:04:13.720> so<00:04:14.350> you<00:04:14.410> can<00:04:14.530> see<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.800> value

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
the head there so you can see the value

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.400 
the head there so you can see the value
of<00:04:15.220> overlays<00:04:15.940> and<00:04:16.239> wireframes<00:04:16.840> in<00:04:17.080> the<00:04:17.200> and

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
of overlays and wireframes in the and

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.010 
of overlays and wireframes in the and
seeing<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.310> UV<00:04:18.580> overlays<00:04:18.970> you<00:04:19.600> can<00:04:19.750> paint

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
seeing the UV overlays you can paint

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.330 
seeing the UV overlays you can paint
them<00:04:20.200> you<00:04:20.320> can<00:04:20.440> find<00:04:20.650> out<00:04:20.830> where<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.040> paint

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
them you can find out where to paint

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.640 
them you can find out where to paint
them<00:04:21.549> it's<00:04:22.090> very<00:04:22.180> useful<00:04:22.810> if<00:04:23.440> you

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
them it's very useful if you

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.950 
them it's very useful if you
