00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.380
 in the training part I could 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.970
 notice a regulation part that 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.050
 I did not know anything at all 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.500
 being born as bad 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.690
 aeronautics that was still very 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.800
 high air regulations is in 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.849
 increase the air a whole lot of 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.390
 procedure stated at the level of the 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.790
 snow is enough 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:36.550
 and most importantly I was able to learn the 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.680
 design the design of the drone and the 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.239
 design that can be done for 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.520
 each year for each activity 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.830
 me it takes a lot of misconceptions on 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.050
 only exactly but especially the idea 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.370
 received that the drone was not just a 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.780
 leisure effect etc an effect 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.830
 cinematographic to take it from 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.720
 photos or videos 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.370
 but just here we can without 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.010
 to kick you is a tool 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.930
 work quite well online 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.480
 I am very scared in current economic 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.950
 ecological economy since it does not 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.900
 works only with non- oath resist 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.860
 that I did not know apart from the 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.380
 private radio control of model aircraft 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.729
 it really is beyond the scope recreation 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.320
 it can really be a tool a tool 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.810
 that the steering is quite 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.299
 different for a model maker and for a 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.890
 professional pilot I thought it 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.869
 was easier than that since I 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.270
 do heroism but the long list 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.470
 rallying and it's true 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.640
 the drone at the speed up not at all like 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.840
 administration and to have a 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.159
 professional application it takes 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.760
 absolutely follow a training 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.170
 a theoretical training as well 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.050
 practical training 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.390
 ie learn and learn 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.770
 I found before that it was 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.770
 best and most professional 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.250
 I already wanted to have knowledge 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.080
 on professional drones so I 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.910
 went on the internet and I found a 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.270
 France failure in the east in the 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.970
 first pages and so I sent a 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.399
 commercial message the same evening and the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.989
 next morning 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.970
 call me and we've already been able to 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.900
 apprehend training and especially the 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.709
 everything we could do with a 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.939
 occupational group 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.549
 I found in the defenses a contact 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.230
 fast and very professional so what 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.200
 about me at weather france 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.629
 it's the very fast reaction time 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.260
 from the commercial 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.330
 Implementation 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.640
 center where I personally take care of it 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.920
 of a training system that ended a 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.360
 training center compared to 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.610
 companies so I was able to set up 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.650
 an internal training to the company and 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.750
 who set up with the dtcc 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.150
 France fast enough 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.319
 and most of all I was told after 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.739
 a few weeks I could hold the 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.110
 loud but here I could so a 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.250
 very accurate training as well 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.250
 theoretical and practical 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.420
 to develop a whole 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:12.900
 including the monitoring of 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.580
 cultures and especially bring another 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.920
 analysis according to treatments 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.269
 that we could bring to lead the drone 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.300
 with a self-propelled treatment the 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:27.330
 drone would be the gate map and 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.470
 analyze the earth and through a 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.900
 algorithm we could put it in 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.940
 our engine and this one could handle 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.069
 nitrogen inputs or inputs from 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.140
 fungicides or pesticides concoret a 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.049
 carried on the land so an economy 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.970
 at the level and of course the cac 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.060
 money for us the sign the economy 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.230
 and especially an awareness for 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.850
 ecology since we would bring just 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.799
 the dose it takes the andorra a 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.720
 dynamic moment to analyze not 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.099
 need of sensors analyzed not 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.480
 need to ride in rooms a 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.250
 need helicopters need anything 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:02.350
 transmitted a simple cartography 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.350
 thermal would suffice 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.680
 to take it like that they analyze rim 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.969
 on a surface 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.620
 area one could divide the costs 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:17.139
 by three or even by five by 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.180
 earth analysis report the analysis of 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.430
 earth is getting done and we have the results that 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.259
 a few weeks after that it would be 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.360
 instantly we could react in 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.160
 the day so refine the settings of 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.110
 treatment of other applications in 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.600
 our business line of what we 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.220
 in Picardy we are exclusively 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.300
 serhani and beet growers 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.880
 we are beet planters 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.060
 sugar which would allow for especially 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.020
 calculate by the accompaniment put 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.630
 much faster 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.970
 the areas so the yield so 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.770
 love it sugar city and analyzed 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:52.090
 to refine especially to refine the iddac 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.770
 of grubbing up and that would also allow 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.960
 following the weather to see how one 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.800
 could be brought in relation to 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.800
 agriculture 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.970
 we when we arrive at the moment of 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.210
 harvest is what we want to know 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:09.470
 that's when the mermaid reaches maturity 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:13.100
 optimal its humidity and the six 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.590
 animals it would be possible with this guy 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:19.009
 of flying equipment obviously 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.320
 loosen active wheat rapeseed barley and 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:25.280
 let's dive and analyzed by magna 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.720
 biomass thermal so its humidity and 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.210
 knowledge according to its humidity 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.550
 as for him ready to harvest and put 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:35.050
 implement the material that allows to 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.050
 go so it will always be a winner
