00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.609 

somebody<00:00:17.320> asked<00:00:17.590> me<00:00:17.650> about<00:00:17.740> my<00:00:19.110> oil<00:00:20.110> drip<00:00:20.440> on

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
somebody asked me about my oil drip on

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.640 
somebody asked me about my oil drip on
the<00:00:20.770> lathe<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.689> I've<00:00:22.810> never<00:00:23.020> actually<00:00:23.200> shown

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
the lathe and I've never actually shown

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.589 
the lathe and I've never actually shown
it<00:00:23.830> any<00:00:24.099> detail<00:00:24.580> and<00:00:24.910> let<00:00:25.029> it's<00:00:25.119> incredibly

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
it any detail and let it's incredibly

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:35.520 
it any detail and let it's incredibly
simple<00:00:27.510> all<00:00:28.510> we've<00:00:28.779> got<00:00:29.050> is<00:00:31.860> it's<00:00:32.860> an<00:00:33.010> old<00:00:34.530> tin

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
simple all we've got is it's an old tin

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.290 
simple all we've got is it's an old tin
of<00:00:35.710> shotgun<00:00:36.580> reloading<00:00:37.120> powder<00:00:37.830> and<00:00:39.300> there's

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
of shotgun reloading powder and there's

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.939 
of shotgun reloading powder and there's
a<00:00:40.390> site<00:00:40.629> to<00:00:40.900> bond<00:00:41.110> it<00:00:41.260> potentially<00:00:41.769> at<00:00:41.860> the

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
a site to bond it potentially at the

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.530 
a site to bond it potentially at the
moment<00:00:42.309> doesn't<00:00:42.460> really<00:00:42.640> work<00:00:42.879> very<00:00:42.910> well<00:00:43.210> I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
moment doesn't really work very well I

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.860 
moment doesn't really work very well I
think<00:00:44.019> the<00:00:44.199> top<00:00:44.410> got<00:00:44.620> broken<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:46.420> was<00:00:46.570> just<00:00:46.780> a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
think the top got broken that was just a

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.320 
think the top got broken that was just a
refinement<00:00:47.290> anyway<00:00:47.769> I<00:00:47.800> put<00:00:48.100> some<00:00:48.400> sulfur

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
refinement anyway I put some sulfur

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.350 
refinement anyway I put some sulfur
based<00:00:49.570> oil<00:00:49.900> in<00:00:50.080> that<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.780> then<00:00:54.330> below<00:00:55.330> the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
based oil in that and then below the

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.119 
based oil in that and then below the
site<00:00:55.750> you<00:00:56.019> blow<00:00:56.290> at<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:56.440> bottom<00:00:56.769> though<00:00:56.920> you

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
site you blow at the bottom though you

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.180 
site you blow at the bottom though you
can<00:00:57.309> see<00:00:57.489> there's<00:00:57.699> a<00:00:57.790> valve<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:59.620> just<00:00:59.890> a<00:00:59.979> gas

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
can see there's a valve it's just a gas

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.250 
can see there's a valve it's just a gas
valve<00:01:00.430> actually<00:01:00.879> which<00:01:01.420> gives<00:01:01.690> me<00:01:01.839> means<00:01:02.080> to

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
valve actually which gives me means to

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.120 
valve actually which gives me means to
shut<00:01:02.470> it<00:01:02.620> off<00:01:02.769> if<00:01:02.949> I<00:01:03.100> need<00:01:03.309> to<00:01:04.740> and<00:01:05.740> then<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
shut it off if I need to and then and

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:19.620 
shut it off if I need to and then and
then<00:01:09.460> we<00:01:09.700> come<00:01:09.970> down<00:01:14.100> from<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.369> tank<00:01:18.359> we<00:01:19.359> come

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
then we come down from the tank we come

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.149 
then we come down from the tank we come
down<00:01:19.840> with<00:01:20.109> some<00:01:20.350> sick<00:01:20.799> six<00:01:21.640> millimeter<00:01:22.030> bore

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
down with some sick six millimeter bore

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.719 
down with some sick six millimeter bore
silicon<00:01:24.159> to<00:01:24.399> a<00:01:25.979> bit<00:01:26.979> longer<00:01:27.219> than<00:01:27.490> I<00:01:27.520> need

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
silicon to a bit longer than I need

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.160 
silicon to a bit longer than I need
really<00:01:27.969> let<00:01:28.539> me<00:01:28.630> come<00:01:28.840> down<00:01:28.869> to<00:01:29.170> this<00:01:29.289> area<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
really let me come down to this area the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.840 
really let me come down to this area the
other<00:01:32.200> piece<00:01:32.530> of<00:01:32.560> interest<00:01:33.100> if<00:01:33.340> we'd<00:01:33.520> assume

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
other piece of interest if we'd assume

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.450 
other piece of interest if we'd assume
in<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.060> bit

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
in a bit

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.130 
in a bit
is<00:01:36.460> here<00:01:37.030> on<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:38.079> saddle<00:01:38.409> I've<00:01:38.590> just<00:01:38.770> got<00:01:38.979> a

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
is here on the saddle I've just got a

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.190 
is here on the saddle I've just got a
steel<00:01:41.140> column<00:01:41.409> with<00:01:41.740> a<00:01:41.770> little<00:01:42.070> bracket<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
steel column with a little bracket the

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.709 
steel column with a little bracket the
valve<00:01:44.679> is<00:01:45.130> actually<00:01:45.490> a<00:01:45.850> sort<00:01:46.119> of<00:01:46.179> diaphragm

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
valve is actually a sort of diaphragm

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:53.209 
valve is actually a sort of diaphragm
fell<00:01:47.049> from<00:01:48.719> LPG<00:01:49.799> as<00:01:51.030> usual<00:01:52.030> something<00:01:52.479> I<00:01:52.570> had

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
fell from LPG as usual something I had

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.529 
fell from LPG as usual something I had
bit<00:01:54.219> of<00:01:54.249> soldering<00:01:54.789> here<00:01:54.999> and<00:01:55.119> there<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.450> a

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
bit of soldering here and there and a

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.120 
bit of soldering here and there and a
few<00:01:55.689> fittings<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.859> then<00:01:57.340> we've<00:01:57.520> got<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:59.130> I'll

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
few fittings and then we've got the I'll

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.870 
few fittings and then we've got the I'll
just<00:02:00.189> show<00:02:00.490> you<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.670> valve<00:02:00.909> a<00:02:01.030> bit<00:02:01.210> closer<00:02:02.880> so

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
just show you the valve a bit closer so

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.559 
just show you the valve a bit closer so
there's<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.299> valve<00:02:06.210> doesn't<00:02:07.210> need<00:02:07.390> to<00:02:07.479> be

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
there's the valve doesn't need to be

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.950 
there's the valve doesn't need to be
open<00:02:07.840> very<00:02:08.080> much<00:02:08.289> usually<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:10.509> a<00:02:10.630> little<00:02:10.840> bit

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
open very much usually just a little bit

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.559 
open very much usually just a little bit
until<00:02:11.230> I<00:02:11.290> get<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.500> steady<00:02:12.060> drip<00:02:13.060> at<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.360> flow

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
until I get a steady drip at the flow

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.630 
until I get a steady drip at the flow
rate<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.050> need

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.460 

and<00:02:18.420> then<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.290> end<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:20.780> just<00:02:21.780> stuffed<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.350> bit

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
and then to the end I just stuffed a bit

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.780 
and then to the end I just stuffed a bit
a<00:02:22.560> tube<00:02:22.800> in<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.070> end<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.430> final<00:02:23.670> fitting

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
a tube in the end of the final fitting

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.200 
a tube in the end of the final fitting
and<00:02:26.790> then<00:02:27.570> in<00:02:27.690> use<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:28.110> course<00:02:28.700> bend<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.910> whole

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
and then in use of course bend the whole

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.440 
and then in use of course bend the whole
thing<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:31.520> get<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.610> piece<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.940> tube<00:02:33.120> over<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
thing to get the piece of tube over the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.710 
thing to get the piece of tube over the
work<00:02:34.760> it'll<00:02:35.760> be<00:02:35.910> nice<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.120> have<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.390> complete

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
work it'll be nice to have a complete

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.060 
work it'll be nice to have a complete
subsystem<00:02:37.530> but<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.830> tend<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.160> use<00:02:39.260> oil<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.890> by

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
subsystem but I tend to use oil just by

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.370 
subsystem but I tend to use oil just by
brushing<00:02:41.310> most<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.940> time<00:02:42.180> but<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.570> parting

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
brushing most of the time but on parting

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.050 
brushing most of the time but on parting
and<00:02:43.500> other<00:02:43.620> things<00:02:43.920> sometimes<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.610> drips<00:02:44.820> very

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
and other things sometimes it drips very

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.930 
and other things sometimes it drips very
handy<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:46.410> oil<00:02:46.560> is<00:02:46.740> pretty<00:02:46.920> much<00:02:47.130> sacrificial

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
handy the oil is pretty much sacrificial

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.690 
handy the oil is pretty much sacrificial
there<00:02:48.270> there's<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:49.040> tray<00:02:50.040> underneath<00:02:50.400> the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
there there's a tray underneath the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.490 
there there's a tray underneath the
lathe<00:02:50.880> bed<00:02:50.910> which<00:02:51.390> collects<00:02:51.870> chips<00:02:52.200> and

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
lathe bed which collects chips and

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.340 
lathe bed which collects chips and
sometimes<00:02:52.980> if<00:02:53.160> there's<00:02:53.340> enough<00:02:53.550> oil<00:02:54.350> sitting

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
sometimes if there's enough oil sitting

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.690 
sometimes if there's enough oil sitting
around<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.830> there<00:02:55.980> I'll<00:02:56.130> rescue<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.670> and

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
around and there I'll rescue it and

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.340 
around and there I'll rescue it and
cycle<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.630> through<00:02:57.660> again<00:03:00.050> so<00:03:01.050> there<00:03:01.230> we<00:03:01.320> are

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
cycle it through again so there we are

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.650 
cycle it through again so there we are
that's<00:03:01.920> all<00:03:02.190> there<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:03.830> gravity<00:03:04.830> feed

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
that's all there is to it gravity feed

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:18.220 
that's all there is to it gravity feed
but<00:03:06.660> as<00:03:06.840> simple<00:03:07.140> as<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.350> can<00:03:07.500> get

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.290
