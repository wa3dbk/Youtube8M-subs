each<00:01:07.570> one<00:01:07.750> of<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.990> strings<00:01:08.350> would<00:01:08.830> hit<00:01:09.369> I'm

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
each one of the strings would hit I'm

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:14.940 
each one of the strings would hit I'm
just<00:01:10.540> going<00:01:10.659> to<00:01:10.720> make<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:14.439> know<00:01:14.530> it's<00:01:14.710> very

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
just going to make you know it's very

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.649 
just going to make you know it's very
you<00:01:15.430> know<00:01:15.549> it's<00:01:15.670> just<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:15.880> rough<00:01:16.090> estimate<00:01:16.600> of

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
you know it's just a rough estimate of

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.749 
you know it's just a rough estimate of
where<00:01:16.990> you'd<00:01:17.110> get<00:01:17.290> it<00:01:17.439> because<00:01:17.829> you<00:01:18.520> know<00:01:18.610> the

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
where you'd get it because you know the

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.319 
where you'd get it because you know the
strings<00:01:19.090> kind<00:01:19.420> of<00:01:19.509> move<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:20.340> then<00:01:21.340> I'm<00:01:22.180> just

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
strings kind of move and then I'm just

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.569 
strings kind of move and then I'm just
going<00:01:22.540> to<00:01:22.570> kind<00:01:22.810> of<00:01:22.899> work<00:01:23.049> these<00:01:23.350> in<00:01:23.770> and<00:01:24.310> kind

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
going to kind of work these in and kind

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.090 
going to kind of work these in and kind
of<00:01:24.670> make<00:01:24.820> some<00:01:25.000> gouges<00:01:25.570> with<00:01:25.750> it<00:01:25.960> of<00:01:26.680> kind<00:01:27.009> of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
of make some gouges with it of kind of

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:37.630 
of make some gouges with it of kind of
what<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.430> different<00:01:28.270> strings<00:01:28.540> would<00:01:28.780> do

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.580 

kinda<00:01:38.210> have<00:01:38.299> to<00:01:38.360> go<00:01:38.570> at<00:01:38.720> it<00:01:38.750> two<00:01:39.290> different

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
kinda have to go at it two different

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.469 
kinda have to go at it two different
angles<00:01:39.710> to<00:01:40.009> kind<00:01:40.280> of<00:01:40.340> get<00:01:40.520> that<00:01:40.700> breaking<00:01:41.600> in

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
angles to kind of get that breaking in

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.969 
angles to kind of get that breaking in
and<00:01:44.479> that<00:01:44.960> will<00:01:45.079> make<00:01:45.200> those<00:01:45.409> little<00:01:45.649> Nick's

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
and that will make those little Nick's

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.920 
and that will make those little Nick's
there<00:01:48.759> took<00:01:49.759> off<00:01:49.939> quite<00:01:50.149> a<00:01:50.180> bit<00:01:50.390> on<00:01:50.539> that<00:01:50.689> one

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
there took off quite a bit on that one

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.510 
there took off quite a bit on that one
I<00:01:51.080> don't<00:01:51.380> want<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:51.590> take<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:51.950> much<00:01:52.130> off<00:01:52.310> on
