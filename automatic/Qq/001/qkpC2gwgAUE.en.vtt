had let this fire go out and we have a
little<00:00:22.800> small<00:00:23.760> propane<00:00:24.269> heater<00:00:25.039> like<00:00:26.039> a

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
little small propane heater like a

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.800 
little small propane heater like a
little<00:00:26.400> space<00:00:26.699> heater<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.240> back<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
little space heater it back in the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.540
