00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.810
 everything for beginner women who 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.500
 they can decorate with cream with that with 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.520
 Meringue 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.620
 pressing the sleeve with a mouthpiece 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.570
 large are improving directly on 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.180
 the cake this is a bunny is the 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.640
 simple figure here ducklings that lives 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:25.000
 everything with cream in plane becomes the lake 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:32.980
 Rosita in turn the three sticks the idea 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.250
 of these cakes is that you the 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.250
 carrots 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.510
 especially for people who want 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.460
 sell cakes I have to tell you that 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.980
 I received a letter from a white bay boy 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.740
 that one day we show the works that 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.300
 I had done following you and that 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.130
 really from the moment we show them 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.080
 our program has been very successful 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.080
 there so we are very happy 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.270
 the vertical index good and fast 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.980
 this is called pressure system 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.840
 it's very fast especially when I eat 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.000
 I said want to sell cakes I'm going to 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.920
 show the nozzles that we have to 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.930
 use and technique and we can make a 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.320
 fast whitening cake that is made 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.570
 of this we are going to fix our cardboard 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.100
 here for you to see and you 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.200
 Do the same when you practice if you do not 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.300
 it goes running and the nozzles that 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.200
 we use are round tip without any 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.140
 edge cited special and great then 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.690
 let's start I suggest you start with 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.100
 any trace for example the ducklings 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:47.610
 they make a little hook pressed hard the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.320
 tail and the wing then now I make another 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.530
 and then we will add it with colors 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.770
 the details see how easy I press 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.680
 I do the little bone as a hook then fine 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.650
 strong 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.570
 the list then later with cartridges 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.410
 of colors you can go 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:12.130
 adding the spikes also for 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.130
 beginners and eyes 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.250
 when you start this stroke 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.650
 let's go changing the cards 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.930
 let's leave here 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.360
 I want to tell you something that is going to 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.000
 spend generally when they want to do 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.220
 a cupete leave the sleeve very high 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.920
 board and they do this then nothing comes out 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.319
 and if you do the opposite so 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.840
 lift the stroke are the two errors what 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.879
 What is done is to place the sleeve of this 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.129
 form just two or three millimeters and 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.980
 press then learn to do 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.750
 these copeitos following these 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.099
 little copetito I'm going to move to the 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.989
 cake and I'm going to make you a bunny 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:53.770
 whole and we're going to reach the cake here 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.870
 the required know 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.910
 alone with this movement you 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.640
 they press 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.870
 short without any do not have to follow 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.990
 because if they did not have a peak in the 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.580
 I do the 2 cachetitos to the rabbit 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.270
 from the bottom rising to be seen 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:14.220
 better press a little open and I do the 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:18.150
 ears to the rabbit and then 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.750
 very strong outward the body the 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.710
 legs 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.180
 the tail and the body forgive the arm 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.390
 then we raise to see the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.000
 base of the figure in a minute this already 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.860
 has the base of the bunny then with a 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.960
 brush moistened in water all 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.180
 small piquitos that have remained 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.950
 If you are beginners you are going to 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.530
 analyze I 'm just going to touch a 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.020
 bit 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.510
 even you your creams are going to 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.360
 bring this out and all the details 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.850
 is the easiest maybe you can if 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.800
 they want to trace the figures on a 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.080
 cellophane until they learn the 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.720
 we are going to place the 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.819
 little eyes that are can be with phyllites 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.110
 that fall because they are a little young 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:07.050
 let's brush and then with cartridges 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:11.120
 of colors we will continue all the 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.120
 details you need it 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.260
 a carrot that is what they eat 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.260
 bunnies 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.489
 let's make him little leaves 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.490
 look at how few minutes you do 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.530
 a cute cake for the boys I go back to 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.770
 lift so they can see how it's going 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.930
 staying with the details there is and 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.110
 now we finish off with a mouthpiece 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.390
 curly let's make a little arabesque 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.600
 to make the environment then we go 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.220
 making a zig zag I do it slow though 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.990
 to you it seems lie is more 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.380
 easy to decorate fast of course there's 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.440
 to start slowly but then the 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.050
 movement of the hand if it goes faster 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.370
 it's more symmetrical then we're doing 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.330
 all the zig zag 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:05.310
 and we have 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:07.740
 a cake decorated in just 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.990
 minutes the number of figures that 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.810
 you can do good is 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:16.230
 innumerable can make turtles 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.210
 ducklings recreate and then there are figures a 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.400
 little more elaborated than if you 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.980
 they are learning these we are going to go 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.290
 teaching we are going to make some twigs 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.790
 use bright colors of these cakes 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:31.000
 they are for boys 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.890
 small age then you have to do 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.800
 cakes with colors that call it the 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:38.590
 attention those little dots I did is for 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.260
 paste little flowers that can simply 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:44.490
 do with sharp 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:46.919
 then with this and it was not lies 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.660
 in a few minutes a cake ends this 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.520
 It is ideal for ladies who sell 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.190
 cakes at home and they ask me for models 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.490
 what can they do in quantity here 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.870
 we have the figure already finished and 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.930
 I recommend if you do not want to use 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:04.680
 you can use creams with 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.660
 inah or meringue vegetable butter and in two 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.229
 minutes already has a dessert of just 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.229
 same 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:16.110
 I wish he was leaving something out because 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.729

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:24.060
 count our applications working 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.800
 So I wanted to do something soon already 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.940
