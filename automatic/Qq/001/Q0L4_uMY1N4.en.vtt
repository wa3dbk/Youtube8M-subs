because back in Romania was 2:00 in the

morning and I had no idea about history
or<00:00:35.860> anything<00:00:36.160> that<00:00:36.900> came<00:00:37.900> with<00:00:38.199> those<00:00:38.350> Olympic

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800

Games
I<00:00:40.440> usually<00:00:41.440> don't<00:00:41.769> watch<00:00:41.949> the<00:00:42.190> scoreboard<00:00:42.760> I

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
I usually don't watch the scoreboard I

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.289 
I usually don't watch the scoreboard I
say<00:00:43.210> that<00:00:43.420> all<00:00:43.900> the<00:00:44.290> time<00:00:44.320> because<00:00:44.739> I<00:00:45.210> kind<00:00:46.210> of

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:46.299 
say that all the time because I kind of

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:49.770 
say that all the time because I kind of
gave<00:00:46.570> myself<00:00:47.049> a<00:00:47.710> score<00:00:48.460> after<00:00:48.909> I<00:00:48.940> do<00:00:49.420> every

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
gave myself a score after I do every

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.229 
gave myself a score after I do every
routine<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:50.440> I<00:00:50.650> thought<00:00:51.309> what<00:00:51.580> I<00:00:51.610> did<00:00:51.909> on<00:00:52.089> the

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
routine and I thought what I did on the

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.829 
routine and I thought what I did on the
bars<00:00:52.449> was<00:00:52.930> a<00:00:52.960> pretty<00:00:53.350> good<00:00:53.440> routine<00:00:53.799> but<00:00:54.839> not

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
bars was a pretty good routine but not

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.770 
bars was a pretty good routine but not
watching<00:00:56.229> the<00:00:56.350> score<00:00:56.710> a<00:00:57.269> couple<00:00:58.269> of<00:00:58.360> seconds

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
watching the score a couple of seconds

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.930 
watching the score a couple of seconds
later<00:00:58.989> I<00:00:59.229> finished<00:00:59.650> I<00:00:59.830> heard<00:01:00.489> a<00:01:00.549> lot<00:01:00.699> of<00:01:00.729> noise

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
later I finished I heard a lot of noise

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.180 
later I finished I heard a lot of noise
in<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.299> arena<00:01:01.720> and<00:01:01.900> I<00:01:02.080> turned<00:01:02.710> my<00:01:02.860> head<00:01:03.040> around

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
in the arena and I turned my head around

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.609 
in the arena and I turned my head around
and<00:01:03.640> then<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.330> scoreboard<00:01:05.080> spin<00:01:05.470> around

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
and then the the scoreboard spin around

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.760 
and then the the scoreboard spin around
with<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.450> zero<00:01:07.450> 73<00:01:08.080> which<00:01:08.320> was<00:01:08.530> my

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
with the zero 73 which was my

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.100 
with the zero 73 which was my
competition<00:01:09.040> number<00:01:09.580> under<00:01:10.270> that<00:01:10.420> was<00:01:10.810> a<00:01:10.840> one

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
competition number under that was a one

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.980 
competition number under that was a one
point<00:01:11.439> zero<00:01:11.530> zero<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:13.060> I'm<00:01:13.270> turning<00:01:13.540> my<00:01:13.810> head

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
point zero zero so I'm turning my head

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.590 
point zero zero so I'm turning my head
to<00:01:14.049> my<00:01:14.350> teammates<00:01:14.860> because<00:01:15.280> I'm<00:01:15.430> like<00:01:15.610> one<00:01:16.420> is

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
to my teammates because I'm like one is

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.910 
to my teammates because I'm like one is
not<00:01:16.780> a<00:01:16.810> good<00:01:17.080> scorer<00:01:17.380> isn't<00:01:17.740> it<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:20.140> I'm<00:01:20.649> it

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
not a good scorer isn't it and I'm it

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.219 
not a good scorer isn't it and I'm it
should<00:01:21.189> go<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.399> one<00:01:21.729> two<00:01:22.000> three<00:01:22.299> four<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:22.869> nine

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
should go to one two three four to nine

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.080 
should go to one two three four to nine
nine<00:01:23.590> nine<00:01:23.920> nine<00:01:24.100> five<00:01:24.899> so<00:01:25.899> I<00:01:25.929> had<00:01:26.350> no<00:01:26.500> idea

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
nine nine nine five so I had no idea

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.940 
nine nine nine five so I had no idea
that<00:01:28.090> long<00:01:28.780> gene<00:01:29.109> that<00:01:29.350> created<00:01:29.829> the

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
that long gene that created the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.139 
that long gene that created the
scoreboard<00:01:31.920> nobody<00:01:32.920> expected<00:01:33.609> that<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:33.939> ten

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
scoreboard nobody expected that the ten

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:35.989 
scoreboard nobody expected that the ten
is<00:01:34.299> possible<00:01:34.869> they<00:01:34.990> called<00:01:35.380> the

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:35.999 
is possible they called the

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:39.510

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
ask if the 10 will be possible and they

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.120 
ask if the 10 will be possible and they
said<00:01:42.069> no<00:01:42.310> nobody<00:01:42.549> is<00:01:42.759> going<00:01:42.909> to<00:01:42.969> score<00:01:43.149> a<00:01:43.210> 10

said no nobody is going to score a 10

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.709 
said no nobody is going to score a 10
and<00:01:45.130> they<00:01:45.549> didn't<00:01:45.819> know<00:01:45.909> how<00:01:46.090> to<00:01:46.149> do<00:01:46.420> it<00:01:46.569> and

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
and they didn't know how to do it and

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.690 
and they didn't know how to do it and
came<00:01:46.960> up<00:01:47.170> as<00:01:47.380> a<00:01:47.439> one<00:01:47.710> point<00:01:47.920> zero<00:01:48.039> zero<00:01:48.549> and

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
came up as a one point zero zero and

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.969 
came up as a one point zero zero and
then<00:01:48.909> with<00:01:49.119> all<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.710> scoreboards<00:01:50.710> that<00:01:50.859> that

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
then with all the scoreboards that that

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.559 
then with all the scoreboards that that
long<00:01:51.130> gene<00:01:51.399> made<00:01:51.640> for<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:51.999> Olympics<00:01:52.420> they

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
long gene made for the Olympics they

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.480 
long gene made for the Olympics they
said<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.960> we<00:01:53.590> had<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.799> use<00:01:54.159> those

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
said that we had to use those

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.510 
said that we had to use those
scoreboards<00:01:55.390> after<00:01:56.109> and<00:01:56.380> every<00:01:57.130> time<00:01:57.340> when

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
scoreboards after and every time when

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.039 
scoreboards after and every time when
Nadia<00:01:57.759> wasn't<00:01:58.359> coming<00:01:58.659> to<00:01:58.689> the<00:01:58.869> competition

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
Nadia wasn't coming to the competition

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.109 
Nadia wasn't coming to the competition
that's<00:01:59.590> when<00:01:59.799> we<00:01:59.950> put<00:02:00.189> our<00:02:00.399> scoreboards

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
that's when we put our scoreboards

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.179 
that's when we put our scoreboards
because<00:02:01.479> we<00:02:01.960> couldn't<00:02:02.229> accommodate<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.950> ten

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
because we couldn't accommodate the ten

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.059 
because we couldn't accommodate the ten
so<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:04.240> ten<00:02:04.539> that<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:05.170> history<00:02:05.530> of<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.859> ten

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
so the ten that the history of the ten

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.969 
so the ten that the history of the ten
actually<00:02:06.280> is<00:02:06.639> one<00:02:06.909> point<00:02:07.240> zero<00:02:07.329> zero<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.020> I'm

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
actually is one point zero zero and I'm

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.410 
actually is one point zero zero and I'm
up<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:11.800> just<00:02:12.010> better<00:02:12.670> than<00:02:12.880> attend<00:02:13.240> oh

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
up it's just better than attend oh

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.690
