and<00:00:18.119> I'm<00:00:19.119> gonna<00:00:19.360> be<00:00:19.540> building<00:00:19.750> the<00:00:19.930> type<00:00:20.170> a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
and I'm gonna be building the type a

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.179 
and I'm gonna be building the type a
robot<00:00:22.180> which<00:00:22.660> got<00:00:22.960> the<00:00:23.199> 18<00:00:23.859> degree<00:00:24.070> of

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
robot which got the 18 degree of

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.420 
robot which got the 18 degree of
freedoms<00:00:24.609> and<00:00:25.500> what<00:00:26.500> I<00:00:26.529> won't<00:00:26.710> do<00:00:26.920> the<00:00:27.039> type<00:00:27.189> a

freedoms and what I won't do the type a
because<00:00:27.760> the<00:00:28.060> hips<00:00:28.269> can<00:00:28.539> move<00:00:28.750> you<00:00:29.410> can<00:00:29.560> go<00:00:29.650> to

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
because the hips can move you can go to

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.859 
because the hips can move you can go to
your<00:00:29.859> website<00:00:30.039> and<00:00:30.310> check<00:00:30.460> it<00:00:30.609> out<00:00:30.699> the<00:00:31.330> type<00:00:31.539> B

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
your website and check it out the type B

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.270 
your website and check it out the type B
and<00:00:31.900> type<00:00:32.349> C<00:00:32.699> they<00:00:33.699> are<00:00:33.930> well<00:00:34.930> it's<00:00:35.830> got<00:00:35.980> 16

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
and type C they are well it's got 16

and type C they are well it's got 16
degree<00:00:36.460> of<00:00:36.550> freedom<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:38.079> by<00:00:38.290> the<00:00:38.350> way<00:00:38.530> when<00:00:38.829> I

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
degree of freedom and by the way when I

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.990 
degree of freedom and by the way when I
bought<00:00:39.219> this<00:00:39.550> robot<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:41.250> agent<00:00:42.250> check<00:00:42.850> the

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
bought this robot the agent check the

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.340 
bought this robot the agent check the
menus<00:00:43.329> to<00:00:43.510> make<00:00:43.660> sure<00:00:43.809> that<00:00:43.960> this<00:00:44.079> is<00:00:44.260> the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
menus to make sure that this is the

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.290 
menus to make sure that this is the
latest<00:00:44.500> version<00:00:44.800> because<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:45.940> older

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
latest version because the older

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.040 
latest version because the older
versions<00:00:46.750> got<00:00:47.050> some<00:00:47.410> numbers<00:00:47.879> incorrect<00:00:49.050> so

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
versions got some numbers incorrect so

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.500 
versions got some numbers incorrect so
you<00:00:50.110> can<00:00:50.350> ask<00:00:50.469> your<00:00:50.800> agent<00:00:51.100> as<00:00:51.430> well<00:00:51.460> so<00:00:52.450> the

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
you can ask your agent as well so the

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.799

them where they are and then dub the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.170 
them where they are and then dub the
Program<00:02:34.110> Files<00:02:34.140> 10<00:02:34.830> them<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:36.300> place<00:02:36.510> stops<00:02:38.180> ok

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
Program Files 10 them and place stops ok

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.580 
Program Files 10 them and place stops ok
so<00:02:39.239> once<00:02:39.690> we<00:02:39.900> go<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.380> is<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:41.450> controller

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
so once we go this is the controller

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.920 
so once we go this is the controller
point<00:02:43.590> off<00:02:43.709> switch<00:02:44.010> some<00:02:44.520> buttons<00:02:45.060> without

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
point off switch some buttons without

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:53.090 
point off switch some buttons without
final<00:02:46.440> later<00:02:47.780> sensors<00:02:49.400> sensors<00:02:50.400> X<00:02:51.300> is<00:02:51.690> 12<00:02:52.100> -

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
final later sensors sensors X is 12 -

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.560 
final later sensors sensors X is 12 -
probably<00:02:53.340> this<00:02:53.520> out<00:02:53.730> for<00:02:53.910> controlling<00:02:54.360> these

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
probably this out for controlling these

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.630 
probably this out for controlling these
other<00:02:54.750> sensors<00:02:55.260> they're<00:02:55.440> supposed<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.250> be<00:02:56.370> 6

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
other sensors they're supposed to be 6

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.930 
other sensors they're supposed to be 6
analog<00:02:57.150> inputs<00:02:57.840> sensor<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:59.280> this<00:02:59.459> is<00:02:59.610> probably

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
analog inputs sensor so this is probably

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.650 
analog inputs sensor so this is probably
wait<00:03:00.180> plug<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.019> this<00:03:01.170> thing<00:03:01.739> nothing

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
wait plug in this thing nothing

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.770 
wait plug in this thing nothing
yeah<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.840> seems<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.200> fit<00:03:04.910> all<00:03:05.910> right<00:03:06.090> and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
yeah it seems to fit all right and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.830 
yeah it seems to fit all right and
there's<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.260> fuse<00:03:07.620> here<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.130> I<00:03:08.910> think<00:03:09.720> there's

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
there's a fuse here and I think there's

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.810 
there's a fuse here and I think there's
a<00:03:09.900> spare<00:03:10.590> fuse<00:03:10.860> somewhere<00:03:11.340> in<00:03:11.459> there<00:03:11.610> in<00:03:11.700> case

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
a spare fuse somewhere in there in case

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.330 
a spare fuse somewhere in there in case
you<00:03:11.910> blow<00:03:12.180> it<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:12.510> can<00:03:13.380> plug<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.709> power<00:03:14.010> here

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
you blow it I can plug in the power here

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.130 
you blow it I can plug in the power here
and<00:03:14.489> play<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:14.940> so<00:03:15.739> let's<00:03:16.739> see

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
and play of it so let's see

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.309 
and play of it so let's see
this<00:03:19.140> is<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.319> repo<00:03:19.709> very<00:03:20.810> we<00:03:21.810> can<00:03:21.959> take<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.260> apart

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
this is a repo very we can take it apart

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.140 
this is a repo very we can take it apart
yes<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.099> then<00:03:23.220> it's<00:03:23.340> replaced<00:03:23.730> another<00:03:23.940> way

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
yes and then it's replaced another way

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.360 
yes and then it's replaced another way
which<00:03:24.300> was<00:03:24.930> three<00:03:25.230> salary<00:03:25.680> for<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:25.920> period<00:03:26.310> of

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
which was three salary for a period of

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.250 
which was three salary for a period of
Amelia<00:03:26.880> would<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.569> see<00:03:28.110> helicopters<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.770> stuff

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
Amelia would I see helicopters and stuff

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.300 
Amelia would I see helicopters and stuff
and<00:03:32.360> we<00:03:33.360> got<00:03:33.599> here<00:03:33.930> this<00:03:34.830> is<00:03:35.160> some<00:03:36.060> sort<00:03:36.420> of

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
and we got here this is some sort of

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.070 
and we got here this is some sort of
sensors<00:03:38.310> that<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.700> put<00:03:39.209> on<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.510> chest

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
sensors that you put on the chest

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.770 
sensors that you put on the chest
I<00:03:40.110> think<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:42.019> let's<00:03:43.019> find<00:03:43.260> out<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.560> elevator

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
I think and let's find out the elevator

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.960 
I think and let's find out the elevator
and<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:46.050> is<00:03:46.200> another<00:03:46.470> distance<00:03:47.069> sensor<00:03:47.730> for

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
and this is another distance sensor for

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.199 
and this is another distance sensor for
the<00:03:48.060> foot<00:03:48.330> other<00:03:48.630> arms<00:03:49.290> or<00:03:49.470> shoulder<00:03:50.209> this

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
the foot other arms or shoulder this

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.809 
the foot other arms or shoulder this
distance<00:03:51.959> sensor<00:03:52.590> so<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.190> know<00:03:53.280> infrared

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
distance sensor so you know infrared

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.920 
distance sensor so you know infrared
distance<00:03:54.510> sensor<00:03:57.319> and<00:03:58.319> this<00:03:58.920> is<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.250> gyros

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
distance sensor and this is a gyros

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.039 
distance sensor and this is a gyros
-<00:04:01.350> directional<00:04:01.860> gyro<00:04:01.890> so<00:04:02.489> it<00:04:02.549> allows<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.330> all

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
- directional gyro so it allows the all

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.259 
- directional gyro so it allows the all
do<00:04:04.799> they<00:04:04.920> call<00:04:05.099> it<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.220> cellar<00:04:05.519> rater<00:04:05.790> now<00:04:06.090> I

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
do they call it a cellar rater now I

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.309 
do they call it a cellar rater now I
don't<00:04:06.480> know<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.780> was<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.260> difference<00:04:08.150> and

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
don't know it was the difference and

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.900 
don't know it was the difference and
this<00:04:10.319> is<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.620> sick<00:04:10.830> B<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:12.470> normally<00:04:13.470> this<00:04:13.650> is

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
this is the sick B so normally this is

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.490 
this is the sick B so normally this is
infrared<00:04:14.910> which<00:04:15.480> is<00:04:15.599> not<00:04:15.810> supposed<00:04:16.290> to<00:04:16.410> be

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
infrared which is not supposed to be

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.069 
infrared which is not supposed to be
very<00:04:16.799> good<00:04:17.040> and<00:04:17.430> you<00:04:18.299> can<00:04:18.450> plug<00:04:18.690> in<00:04:18.840> one<00:04:18.989> of

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
very good and you can plug in one of

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.580 
very good and you can plug in one of
these<00:04:19.229> things<00:04:19.500> in<00:04:20.190> here<00:04:20.820> somewhere

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
these things in here somewhere

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.890 
these things in here somewhere
you<00:04:22.590> don't<00:04:22.770> know<00:04:23.070> one<00:04:24.320> to<00:04:26.510> one<00:04:27.510> of<00:04:27.600> these<00:04:27.660> thing

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
you don't know one to one of these thing

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.700 
you don't know one to one of these thing
here<00:04:28.110> somewhere

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
here somewhere

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.310 
here somewhere
so<00:04:29.580> let's<00:04:29.880> find<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.270> elevator<00:04:30.600> so<00:04:31.020> this<00:04:31.140> is<00:04:31.289> a

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
so let's find it elevator so this is a

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.340 
so let's find it elevator so this is a
sick<00:04:31.590> be<00:04:32.030> that<00:04:33.030> comes<00:04:33.419> free<00:04:34.550> well<00:04:35.990> given<00:04:36.990> free

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
sick be that comes free well given free

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.310 
sick be that comes free well given free
by<00:04:37.560> the<00:04:37.620> seller<00:04:38.250> as<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.610> gift<00:04:39.030> or<00:04:39.240> something<00:04:39.320> so

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
by the seller as a gift or something so

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.320 
by the seller as a gift or something so
this<00:04:40.530> thing<00:04:40.770> is<00:04:40.890> not<00:04:40.919> notion<00:04:41.550> in<00:04:41.640> the<00:04:41.729> menu<00:04:42.060> so

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
this thing is not notion in the menu so

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.659 
this thing is not notion in the menu so
always<00:04:42.450> I'm<00:04:43.169> gonna<00:04:43.350> have<00:04:43.500> to<00:04:43.620> do<00:04:43.770> some<00:04:43.979> web

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
always I'm gonna have to do some web

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:51.409 
always I'm gonna have to do some web
surfing<00:04:45.060> searching<00:04:46.550> cables<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:49.560> head<00:04:50.419> arm

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
surfing searching cables the head arm

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.000 
surfing searching cables the head arm
where<00:04:51.600> you<00:04:51.690> can<00:04:51.840> paint<00:04:52.080> them<00:04:52.289> and<00:04:52.500> stuff<00:04:52.770> later

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
where you can paint them and stuff later

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.900 
where you can paint them and stuff later
I<00:04:53.160> guess<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:54.950> you<00:04:55.950> can<00:04:56.100> put<00:04:56.280> it<00:04:56.370> infrared

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
I guess and you can put it infrared

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:03.840 
I guess and you can put it infrared
receiver<00:04:57.300> or<00:04:57.630> ZigBee<00:04:58.080> inside<00:04:58.500> here<00:04:58.800> so

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.590 

so<00:05:04.850> the<00:05:04.940> body<00:05:05.150> hammer<00:05:05.630> I<00:05:05.660> mean<00:05:05.960> deploy<00:05:06.230> bracket

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
so the body hammer I mean deploy bracket

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.590 
so the body hammer I mean deploy bracket
and<00:05:08.600> a<00:05:09.050> lot<00:05:09.199> of<00:05:09.260> wires<00:05:09.470> and<00:05:09.830> give<00:05:10.490> him<00:05:10.610> a<00:05:10.880> Hong
