in<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.590> desert<00:04:12.970> in<00:04:13.970> that<00:04:14.600> same<00:04:15.500> central<00:04:15.739> area

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
in a desert in that same central area

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:21.009 
in a desert in that same central area
regardless<00:04:18.310> it's<00:04:19.310> against<00:04:19.820> big<00:04:20.299> reservoirs

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
regardless it's against big reservoirs

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.840 
regardless it's against big reservoirs
you<00:04:21.350> like<00:04:21.650> people<00:04:21.979> that<00:04:22.130> build<00:04:22.370> these<00:04:22.550> big

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850
