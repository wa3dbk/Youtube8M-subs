00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
noticed a feature which is actually

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:50.060 
noticed a feature which is actually
really<00:01:34.710> helpful<00:01:48.320> all<00:01:49.320> right<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.890> also

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
really helpful all right so we can also

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.730 
really helpful all right so we can also
find<00:01:50.460> seven<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.090> these<00:01:51.210> scalp<00:01:51.570> flies<00:01:51.840> which<00:01:52.590> we

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
find seven of these scalp flies which we

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.950 
find seven of these scalp flies which we
can<00:01:52.920> either<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:54.240> know<00:01:54.360> like<00:01:54.660> what<00:01:54.840> I'm<00:01:54.929> doing

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
can either you know like what I'm doing

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.630 
can either you know like what I'm doing
right<00:01:55.229> here<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.800> guess<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.250> could<00:01:56.369> be<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:56.550> a

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
right here I guess it could be like a

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.490 
right here I guess it could be like a
headbutt<00:01:56.940> or<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.390> also<00:01:57.539> uppercut<00:01:58.259> them

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
headbutt or you can also uppercut them

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.730 
headbutt or you can also uppercut them
and<00:01:58.740> if<00:01:59.670> you<00:02:00.000> collect<00:02:00.210> seven<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.080> each<00:02:01.380> area

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
and if you collect seven in each area

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.020 
and if you collect seven in each area
you'll<00:02:02.190> get<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> Power<00:02:02.580> Cell

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
you'll get a Power Cell

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.960 
you'll get a Power Cell
now<00:02:03.869> there's<00:02:04.200> 101<00:02:04.830> Power<00:02:05.159> Cells<00:02:05.550> in<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.759> game

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
now there's 101 Power Cells in the game

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.449 
now there's 101 Power Cells in the game
so<00:02:06.690> there's<00:02:06.840> plenty<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.170> collect<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:08.310> only

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
so there's plenty to collect you only

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.120 
so there's plenty to collect you only
need<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> hundred<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.360> actually<00:02:09.979> get<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
need a hundred to actually get the

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.040 
need a hundred to actually get the
secret<00:02:11.489> underneath<00:02:11.850> but<00:02:12.120> there<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.480> an<00:02:12.660> extra

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
secret underneath but there is an extra

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:32.380 
secret underneath but there is an extra
which<00:02:13.980> I'll<00:02:14.130> be<00:02:14.250> getting<00:02:14.519> everything<00:02:15.269> 100%

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.570 

now<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.170> controls<00:02:33.680> are<00:02:33.920> pretty<00:02:33.950> good<00:02:34.370> in<00:02:34.489> this

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
now the controls are pretty good in this

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.650 
now the controls are pretty good in this
game<00:02:34.819> there's<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.060> lot<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.330> different

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
game there's a lot of different

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:55.270 
game there's a lot of different
combinations<00:02:52.569> so<00:02:53.569> this<00:02:54.410> is<00:02:54.590> one<00:02:54.769> of<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.040> three

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
combinations so this is one of the three

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.479 
combinations so this is one of the three
eCos<00:02:55.760> will<00:02:56.060> actually<00:02:56.450> four<00:02:56.810> if<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.410> rip<00:02:57.620> okay

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
eCos will actually four if you rip okay

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.509 
eCos will actually four if you rip okay
five<00:02:59.260> that<00:03:00.260> you'll<00:03:00.440> be<00:03:00.590> able<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:00.980> run<00:03:01.130> into<00:03:01.430> in

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
five that you'll be able to run into in

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:11.650 
five that you'll be able to run into in
this<00:03:01.670> game<00:03:01.910> okay<00:03:02.630> six<00:03:09.940> what<00:03:10.940> I'm<00:03:11.090> thinking<00:03:11.540> of

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
this game okay six what I'm thinking of

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.229 
this game okay six what I'm thinking of
is<00:03:11.930> I<00:03:12.200> keep<00:03:12.530> on<00:03:12.709> thinking<00:03:12.860> of<00:03:13.040> all<00:03:13.190> the<00:03:13.430> main

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
is I keep on thinking of all the main

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.809 
is I keep on thinking of all the main
ones<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:14.660> use<00:03:14.900> as<00:03:15.140> weapons<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:15.950> stuff<00:03:16.250> but

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
ones you use as weapons and stuff but

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:17.680 
ones you use as weapons and stuff but
there

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
there

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.479 
there
I'm<00:03:18.049> guessing<00:03:18.530> yeah<00:03:18.739> there's<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.069> there's<00:03:19.430> only

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
I'm guessing yeah there's a there's only

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.289 
I'm guessing yeah there's a there's only
six<00:03:20.180> actual<00:03:20.720> eCos<00:03:21.260> in<00:03:21.560> this<00:03:21.680> game<00:03:22.299> that

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
six actual eCos in this game that

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.539 
six actual eCos in this game that
usually<00:03:23.840> that<00:03:23.989> really<00:03:24.350> doesn't<00:03:24.500> change<00:03:24.680> but

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
usually that really doesn't change but

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.120 
usually that really doesn't change but
there's<00:03:25.730> blue<00:03:26.000> red<00:03:26.450> yellow<00:03:26.780> white<00:03:27.170> green<00:03:27.889> and

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
there's blue red yellow white green and

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.569 
there's blue red yellow white green and
dark<00:03:29.380> it's<00:03:30.380> never<00:03:30.590> specified<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.220> clover<00:03:31.489> -

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
dark it's never specified the clover -

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.979 
dark it's never specified the clover -
dark<00:03:31.760> eco<00:03:31.910> but<00:03:32.209> dark<00:03:32.450> eco<00:03:32.569> is<00:03:32.870> what<00:03:33.019> changed

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
dark eco but dark eco is what changed

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:51.340 
dark eco but dark eco is what changed
Baxter<00:03:35.989> to<00:03:36.200> what<00:03:36.380> he<00:03:36.470> is<00:03:36.500> now<00:03:49.989> alright<00:03:50.989> so

got a duck jump we got punch we got
uppercut<00:05:26.499> you<00:05:27.499> can<00:05:27.679> just<00:05:27.859> combine<00:05:28.099> them<00:05:28.459> all

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:28.579 
uppercut you can just combine them all

after you get all the cursor orbs in one

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.559 
after you get all the cursor orbs in one
area<00:05:40.159> it'll<00:05:40.639> tell<00:05:40.849> you<00:05:40.999> at<00:05:41.089> the<00:05:41.209> bottom
