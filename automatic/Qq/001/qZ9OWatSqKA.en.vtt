00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
to the end of the row now you might find

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.940 
to the end of the row now you might find
as<00:03:58.860> you're<00:03:59.040> knitting<00:03:59.250> around<00:04:00.020> that<00:04:01.020> it's

getting<00:04:02.400> tighter<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:03.320> that's<00:04:04.320> because<00:04:04.970> when

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
getting tighter and that's because when

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.300 
getting tighter and that's because when
you<00:04:06.120> pull<00:04:06.390> that<00:04:06.570> yarn<00:04:06.870> across<00:04:07.290> three<00:04:07.980> stitches

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
you pull that yarn across three stitches

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.570 
you pull that yarn across three stitches
it<00:04:08.790> has<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.030> tendency<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.780> pull<00:04:10.160> so<00:04:11.160> you<00:04:11.220> want<00:04:11.490> to

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
it has a tendency to pull so you want to

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.420 
it has a tendency to pull so you want to
make<00:04:11.730> sure<00:04:11.760> that<00:04:12.270> when<00:04:12.450> you're<00:04:12.600> knitting<00:04:13.430> you

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
make sure that when you're knitting you

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.150

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
don't pull it real tight you try to keep

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.780 
don't pull it real tight you try to keep
it<00:04:17.310> loose<00:04:18.770> otherwise<00:04:19.770> it'll<00:04:20.190> be<00:04:20.280> very<00:04:20.640> bubbly

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
it loose otherwise it'll be very bubbly

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.670

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
so again when you're pulling that thread

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.610 
so again when you're pulling that thread
across<00:04:28.920> the<00:04:29.700> three<00:04:30.000> stitches<00:04:30.500> instead<00:04:31.500> of

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
across the three stitches instead of

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.250 
across the three stitches instead of
pulling<00:04:31.860> it<00:04:32.070> tight<00:04:32.340> like<00:04:32.670> that<00:04:32.960> try<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.020> have

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
pulling it tight like that try to have

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.300 
pulling it tight like that try to have
some<00:04:34.500> slack<00:04:34.980> in<00:04:35.220> it<00:04:36.410> so<00:04:37.410> that<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.680> doesn't<00:04:37.890> pull

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
some slack in it so that it doesn't pull

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.360 
some slack in it so that it doesn't pull
the<00:04:39.120> stitches<00:04:39.600> too<00:04:39.930> tight<00:04:40.230> the<00:04:40.890> ones<00:04:41.100> that<00:04:41.280> are
