00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
regular square of origami paper and you

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.579 
regular square of origami paper and you
want<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.130> start<00:00:05.370> on<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.490> white<00:00:05.700> side<00:00:06.529> okay<00:00:07.529> so

the first thing we want to do is fold
the<00:00:09.840> paper<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.230> half<00:00:10.410> diagonally<00:00:16.910> like<00:00:17.910> this

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
the paper in half diagonally like this

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.320 
the paper in half diagonally like this
and<00:00:18.449> then<00:00:18.570> open<00:00:18.900> up<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.970> next<00:00:20.970> thing<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.180> want

to do is you want to take each of these

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.370 
to do is you want to take each of these
four<00:00:23.789> edges<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.420> fold<00:00:25.019> them<00:00:25.109> in<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
four edges and fold them in to the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:59.560 
four edges and fold them in to the
center<00:00:25.710> line<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.070> unfold

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
should have several creases across the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.490 
should have several creases across the
paper<00:01:04.250> okay<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.309> now<00:01:05.519> what<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.700> want<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.500> is

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.740 
it's like this you want to take these
two<00:01:42.300> points<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.929> fold<00:01:43.740> them<00:01:43.860> down<00:01:47.630> now<00:01:48.630> you

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
two points and fold them down now you

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.380 
two points and fold them down now you
can<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.050> take<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> few<00:01:49.440> moments<00:01:50.119> to<00:01:51.119> neaten

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
to do is take the model and fold it in

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:12.740 
to do is take the model and fold it in
half<00:02:01.819> like<00:02:02.819> this<00:02:03.090> down<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.420> center

down like this and do exactly the same
thing<00:02:32.760> on<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:32.970> other<00:02:33.000> side<00:02:35.300> so<00:02:36.300> now<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.540> should

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
thing on the other side so now it should

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.370 
thing on the other side so now it should
look<00:02:36.750> like<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:38.660> so<00:02:39.660> with<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.900> model<00:02:40.200> like

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
look like this so with the model like

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.170 
look like this so with the model like
this<00:02:40.620> what<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.520> want<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.730> do<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.030> want<00:02:42.150> to

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
take this side and this side is gonna

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.120 
take this side and this side is gonna
become<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.610> head<00:02:45.560> no<00:02:46.560> what<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.770> want<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.010> do

do is take the model and open it from
the<00:03:28.260> top<00:03:28.520> and<00:03:29.520> you<00:03:29.820> should<00:03:30.030> see<00:03:30.209> these<00:03:30.360> two

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
the top and you should see these two

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.050 
the top and you should see these two
creases<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:31.020> you<00:03:31.170> just<00:03:31.380> made<00:03:31.940> with<00:03:32.940> the

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
creases that you just made with the

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.870 
creases that you just made with the
crease<00:03:33.300> that's<00:03:33.540> farthest<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.080> left<00:03:34.880> fold

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
crease that's farthest to the left fold

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.660 
crease that's farthest to the left fold
the<00:03:36.030> tip<00:03:36.239> backwards<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:37.280> then<00:03:38.280> with<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.550> one

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
the tip backwards and then with the one

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.600 
the tip backwards and then with the one
remaining<00:03:39.030> crease<00:03:39.890> fold<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.070> tip<00:03:41.250> forwards

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
remaining crease fold the tip forwards

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.810 
remaining crease fold the tip forwards
again<00:03:42.890> so<00:03:43.890> now<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.100> should<00:03:44.160> look<00:03:44.340> like<00:03:44.400> this

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
again so now it should look like this

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.479 
again so now it should look like this
and<00:03:45.570> once<00:03:45.720> you've<00:03:45.810> done<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.250> you<00:03:47.250> want<00:03:47.340> to

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
and once you've done that you want to

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.250 
and once you've done that you want to
reclose<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.180> model

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.210 

so<00:03:53.260> now<00:03:53.350> what<00:03:53.440> you<00:03:53.500> want<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.680> do<00:03:53.800> is<00:03:53.890> just<00:03:54.040> take

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
the point of the novel and just bring it

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.340 
the point of the novel and just bring it
further<00:03:58.240> up<00:03:58.390> like<00:03:58.690> this<00:04:00.450> okay<00:04:01.450> to<00:04:01.510> finish<00:04:01.780> what

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
tail and you want to point it upwards

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.460 
tail and you want to point it upwards
slightly<00:04:07.980> just<00:04:08.980> fold<00:04:09.280> it<00:04:09.430> like<00:04:09.550> that<00:04:10.470> then

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
slightly just fold it like that then

slightly just fold it like that then
unfold<00:04:12.990> open<00:04:13.990> the<00:04:14.080> top<00:04:14.260> of<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.440> model<00:04:14.680> again

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
unfold open the top of the model again

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.660 
unfold open the top of the model again
and<00:04:15.720> using<00:04:16.720> that<00:04:16.900> crease<00:04:17.310> push<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.489> tip

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
and using that crease push the tip

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.270 
and using that crease push the tip
inwards<00:04:19.180> like<00:04:19.420> this<00:04:20.790> then<00:04:21.790> when<00:04:21.940> you<00:04:22.030> refold

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
inwards like this then when you refold

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.610 
inwards like this then when you refold
the<00:04:24.280> tip<00:04:24.490> will<00:04:24.640> point<00:04:24.820> upwards<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.620> you've

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
the tip will point upwards and you've

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.820 
the tip will point upwards and you've
