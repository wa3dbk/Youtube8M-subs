00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello my name is chimpanzee and you 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.180
 Battlefield 4 sees a detail 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.820
 the second of the soul dlc and the map 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.719
 Operation firestorm that is natural 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.580
 a map we already out 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.049
 battlefield 3 many of you know the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.389
 do not know how the whole thing works 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.460
 or came about that is here 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.730
 capture the flag he plays on the xbox 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.560
 one and if you already have one 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.210
 xbox from battlefield 4 and the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.010
 battlefield 4 premium service at the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.410
 You can already have xbox one 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.000
 that secondos all dlc play this here 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.650
 is the second map of this one 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.469
 Another video made with golfing 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.660
 Format of user check24 or jack twenty 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.190
 four gave me some gameplay here 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.719
 provided perhaps comes 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.660
 he still a third and fourth of the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.270
 other two maps besides the center 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.969
 should dlc has the cards with three 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.980
 operation metro group of oman operation 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.449
 firestorm and Caspian border so 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.760
 caspian border on me 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.020
 Personally, that is especially pleasing 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.610
 Whole is natural as in the other 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.899
 video already seen before 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.690
 or have already seen one today 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.610
 Revision of the of wild So when 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.290
 sex should dlc are natural as well 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.700
 said the last of these four maps 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.430
 we are from battlefield 4 already 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.560
 know and the xbox people so xbox man 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.810
 People with premium service who can do that 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.460
 all here too that they what to 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.200
 I think you have in the last 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.240
 video I already experienced personally 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.330
 not a big friend of that kind 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.540
 dlcs so far before or after 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.189
 actual release of some 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.540
 I can play platforms 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.790
 personally do not like it so much 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.350
 on the other side it is natural 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.540
 also a deal that the companies made there 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.979
 have and absolutely legitimate for the and 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.990
 I'm not there anyway 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.700
 how to say totally jealous or 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.990
 I'm sorry for that, I'll come anyway 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.270
 finds halt just a bit, it's stupid 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.340
 so extreme before the actual release 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.380
 Date is done now and as far as I am concerned 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.360
 I've seen that for a second 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.119
 salt for the pc at least not yet 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.509
 firm date is the only thing that is now 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.860
 that one on the xbox so i believe i 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.820
 have to look again just after 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.380
 now in the next few days 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.479
 second seconds accurate to the second 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.030
 So here on the official page 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.190
 battlefield dot com to battlefield 4 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.890
 expansion packs disgusting it should stand 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.300
 that one should tick that now 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.950
 Exclusively for the xbox of users with 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.010
 premium services can play and am 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.080
 third december for the xbox one 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.680
 user without battlefield 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.660
 premium membership is playable 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.240
 means these two user groups 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.130
 So xbox user with and without are from 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.840
 the fourth quarter of the third december 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.459
 the secondos should already play now 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.200
 and everyone else has to stop 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.940
 we are waiting for the official release 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.330
 can again our ass on it 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.280
 Bet that I'll tell the xbox too 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.870
 there again like the playstation before 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.220
 people were french playstation people i 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.480
 I do not have that in the picture 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.700
 my that the playstation people the 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.690
 last time because somehow preferred 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.280
 and two weeks earlier 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.690
 could gamble anyway, I guess 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.190
 that's what xbox wants now too 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.500
 be the case again but also plays 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.810
 no matter in any case many again 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.220
 thanks to the check 24 checkpoint before the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.680
 me this has made available 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.510
 I think exploded on this map 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.190
 something pipeline is moderate that one has 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.810
 I only heard that way in between 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.700
 I've already said in the last video 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.500
 I purposely have this whole 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.090
 evolution events are not yet on the 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.620
 various videos also included 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.760
 if i search then they are what 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.530
 This direction is therefore everything 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.640
 battlefield has a lot to do but me 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.290
 wants to surprise me as I leave 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.060
 I did not want the complete one now 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.190
 anticipation of somehow destroy by 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.540
 I have to just watch everything because of 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.650
 disposal is available although I unfortunately 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.049
 can not gamble yet 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.030
 that would only make me in there 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.110
 I do not influence a direction 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.310
 would like or 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.530
 I will not only be mine anyway 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.840
 why buy an xbox and then here 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.450
 still battlefield 4 with premium service 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.250
 otherwise operations firestorm is 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.620
 Of course, again very much 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.269
 very close to the original is here 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.370
 not so much has been changed at least 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.750
 I'm not a significant one now 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.280
 difference noticed so you see 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.299
 your again this pipeline it will always be 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.549
 still fighting hard 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.870
 Here's how to naturally over there 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.700
 just looks like a few optical 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.530
 elements have been introduced in the middle 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.519
 that those flames are beating on it 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.950
 will of course also take damage 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.329
 At least I hope so and that's the way it is 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.760
 small things yes I do not have now 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.260
 seen whether, for example, now 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.670
 still the big buildings on it come if 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.260
 there are some things on it so me 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.480
 my sluiter if you have the one now 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.130
 building front left right there somehow 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.959
 still great in ruins 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.579
 which of course could be very cool 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.920
 and these are things that I am looking forward to 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.450
 it is the 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.250
 elements on which I personally 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.780
 I am glad that everything is possible here 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.060
 can disassemble and an even bigger one 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.850
 destruction takes place as is already in 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.340
 Battlefield 3 d would have been possible 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.370
 So that's why I'm looking forward now 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.810
 Let's see what awaits us and it 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.300
 definitely makes me want more 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.740
 I'm not necessarily here either 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.140
 convinced that this is the best 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.340
 card has been to play so 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.560
 is not my favorite map 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.170
 either a lot of 3 so not one of the apps 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.220
 which I liked to play but 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.770
 in battlefield 4 I will of course 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.930
 No offense and the thing is high 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.340
 and gamble down are unfortunately already 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.750
 again at the end of the video is a right 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.250
 short clip here from this gameplay 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.110
 thanks again for giving me that 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.490
 provided that check24 link 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.000
 is in the video description to his 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.520
 channel 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.290
 I think it's very cool and opens 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.790
 Everybody wants to know that 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.350
 to try my name is dimmable 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.920
 say thank you for watching and me 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.270

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.270
