the<00:01:15.890> sketchies<00:01:16.370> tire<00:01:16.670> ever<00:01:16.970> liked<00:01:17.600> it<00:01:17.840> the

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
the sketchies tire ever liked it the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.560 
the sketchies tire ever liked it the
angle<00:01:18.620> of<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.040> banks<00:01:19.400> like<00:01:19.700> it<00:01:19.880> would<00:01:20.270> shoot

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
angle of the banks like it would shoot

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.850 
angle of the banks like it would shoot
the<00:01:20.690> board<00:01:20.900> right<00:01:21.050> up<00:01:21.200> into<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.440> top<00:01:21.650> of<00:01:21.800> the

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
the board right up into the top of the

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.320 
the board right up into the top of the
tire<00:01:22.070> I<00:01:22.280> frankly<00:01:22.790> didn't<00:01:23.030> think<00:01:23.150> it<00:01:23.210> was<00:01:23.270> a

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
tire I frankly didn't think it was a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.520 
tire I frankly didn't think it was a
good<00:01:23.420> idea<00:01:23.480> to<00:01:23.780> try<00:01:24.020> it<00:01:24.080> in<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.260> first<00:01:24.440> place

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
good idea to try it in the first place

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.200 
good idea to try it in the first place
but<00:01:24.800> I<00:01:24.890> was<00:01:24.980> like<00:01:25.070> me<00:01:25.190> you<00:01:25.580> see<00:01:25.790> something<00:01:26.060> I

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
but I was like me you see something I

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.760 
but I was like me you see something I
don't<00:01:26.450> maybe<00:01:26.750> he'll<00:01:26.960> do<00:01:27.080> it<00:01:27.230> didn't<00:01:27.620> get<00:01:27.710> to

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
don't maybe he'll do it didn't get to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.200 
don't maybe he'll do it didn't get to
that<00:01:27.860> part<00:01:27.950> he<00:01:28.370> just<00:01:28.520> started<00:01:28.730> front-flipping

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
that part he just started front-flipping

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.610 
that part he just started front-flipping
but<00:01:29.420> regardless<00:01:29.570> of<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.050> sketchy<00:01:30.230> set<00:01:30.500> up

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620
