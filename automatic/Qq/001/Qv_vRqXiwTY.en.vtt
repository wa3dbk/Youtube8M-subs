00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.480
 hello and welcome white 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.389
 we are at the ifa 2010 in 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.799
 berlin at lg electronics to the of 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.809
 Fox shapes behind the camera 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.930
 Best thanks in this place and we 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.670
 Look at the lg pad 8.3 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.359
 also one of the first videos on this 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.580
 be device 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.470
 We begin with a tour around the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.970
 housing here for a louder quieter 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.130
 I feel like the power partner 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.349
 Aluminum both goes in this process 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.090
 very well processed that pleases 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.890
 good on the top of the infrared 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.079
 port here the 3.5 millimeters 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.210
 jack connection and a slot 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.460
 for a micro sd memory card of the 16th 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.379
 gb big internal memory can be so 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.390
 to be extended this page is absolutely 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.980
 Long kept on the bottom 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.090
 we connect the micro usb as well 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.890
 first microphone 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.449
 interesting here is the back 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.340
 because you probably are here 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.870
 can easily recognize the whole exists 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.610
 made of aluminum, the processing 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.559
 I did so just as annoying is already 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.840
 in this pre-series device very very good 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.820
 and we both like it, I think 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.369
 very very good as well two here 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.260
 speaker stereo speakers around the 5th 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.880
 Megapixel main camera the front camera 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.220
 I know if I am right 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.729
 remember 16 megapixels 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.909
 The display is 83 inches tall as the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.299
 name already suggests dissolves with 1920 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:24.960
 x 1200 pixeln on as cpu the qualcomm 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.320
 snapdragon 600 and 2 gigabyte working 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.000
 should also be an lt version here 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.409
 what i have to mention is the software 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.479
 of course not yet final we have 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.979
 here a VorseriengerÃ¤t nevertheless the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.229
 Performance is here at least on the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.909
 homescreen already pretty good the device 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.070
 feels very valuable and I think 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.680
 especially the format interesting 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.570
 8.3 inches is optimal and note 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.700
 here are the beautiful thin frames 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.399
 it was the first short hands on with it 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.240
 the lg pad 8.3 as I said the whole is 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.040
 not yet final 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.750
 as soon as that's the case, we will 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.430
 of course, to test the whole whole in this one 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.630
 I hope, as always, the video has 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.100
 Thank you very much for your help 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.670
 watch and says, looking up to 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.670
 next
