this<00:01:24.370> time<00:01:24.640> in<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.120> top<00:01:25.300> 4<00:01:25.690> I<00:01:26.020> think<00:01:26.950> my<00:01:27.580> dish

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
this time in the top 4 I think my dish

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.500 
this time in the top 4 I think my dish
had<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:29.710> as<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.130> judges<00:01:30.340> said<00:01:30.670> that<00:01:30.910> the<00:01:31.150> idea

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
had the as the judges said that the idea

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.630 
had the as the judges said that the idea
was<00:01:31.690> good<00:01:31.870> but<00:01:32.020> I<00:01:32.170> was<00:01:32.350> unable<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.650> executed<00:01:33.490> my

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
was good but I was unable to executed my

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.490 
was good but I was unable to executed my
seasoning<00:01:34.210> there<00:01:34.540> was<00:01:34.690> no<00:01:34.870> seasoning<00:01:35.290> so<00:01:35.410> it

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
seasoning there was no seasoning so it

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.730 
seasoning there was no seasoning so it
was<00:01:35.620> probably<00:01:35.890> black<00:01:36.340> blonde<00:01:36.820> and<00:01:37.530> that's<00:01:38.530> one

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
was probably black blonde and that's one

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.590 
was probably black blonde and that's one
of<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.980> reasons<00:01:39.340> why<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:39.790> couldn't<00:01:40.240> make<00:01:40.360> it<00:01:40.420> to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
of the reasons why I couldn't make it to

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.070 
of the reasons why I couldn't make it to
the<00:01:40.720> top<00:01:40.900> three<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:43.150> but<00:01:43.450> I<00:01:43.600> think<00:01:43.720> he<00:01:44.050> I

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
the top three and that but I think he I

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.930 
the top three and that but I think he I
was<00:01:44.320> totally<00:01:44.680> my<00:01:44.860> fault<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.280> I<00:01:45.370> kind<00:01:45.820> of

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
was totally my fault and I kind of

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.050 
was totally my fault and I kind of
deserved<00:01:46.270> it<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:47.260> it's<00:01:47.830> only<00:01:48.250> fair<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.820> feels

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
deserved it so it's only fair it feels

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.700 
deserved it so it's only fair it feels
bad<00:01:52.360> that<00:01:52.420> I<00:01:52.630> couldn't<00:01:52.720> make<00:01:53.140> it<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.410> the<00:01:53.530> top

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
bad that I couldn't make it to the top

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.680 
bad that I couldn't make it to the top
three<00:01:53.920> but<00:01:54.370> then<00:01:54.550> making<00:01:54.790> it<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.120> the<00:01:55.210> top<00:01:55.240> four

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
three but then making it to the top four

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.980 
three but then making it to the top four
alone<00:01:56.110> was<00:01:56.470> was<00:01:57.340> exciting<00:01:57.940> for<00:01:57.970> me<00:01:58.180> something

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
alone was was exciting for me something

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.080 
alone was was exciting for me something
that<00:01:59.170> has<00:01:59.590> never<00:01:59.620> happened<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.910> me<00:02:00.970> before

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
that has never happened to me before

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.780 
that has never happened to me before
like<00:02:01.570> something<00:02:02.290> completely<00:02:02.950> unexpected<00:02:03.160> I

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
like something completely unexpected I

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.700 
like something completely unexpected I
mean<00:02:03.940> would<00:02:04.210> have<00:02:04.300> thought<00:02:04.540> so<00:02:05.050> it's<00:02:05.500> an

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
mean would have thought so it's an

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.900 
mean would have thought so it's an
experience<00:02:06.130> working<00:02:06.430> in<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.790> professional

experience working in a professional
kitchen<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:07.720> motivated<00:02:08.320> me<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.470> go<00:02:08.830> into

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
kitchen and motivated me to go into

probably trained as a pastry chef so
hopefully<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.290> dream<00:02:14.530> will<00:02:14.650> also<00:02:14.950> come<00:02:15.160> to

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.980 
hopefully that dream will also come to
some<00:02:15.550> time<00:02:15.730> like<00:02:16.000> this<00:02:16.180> has<00:02:18.390> obviously<00:02:19.390> like

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
some time like this has obviously like

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.080 
some time like this has obviously like
your<00:02:20.140> odds<00:02:20.380> entry<00:02:20.770> was<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.370> threat<00:02:21.880> and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
your odds entry was a threat and

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.850 
your odds entry was a threat and
eventually<00:02:22.660> has<00:02:22.840> one<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.380> reasons<00:02:23.710> why<00:02:23.830> i

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
eventually has one of the reasons why i

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.100 
eventually has one of the reasons why i
was<00:02:24.040> out<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.400> but<00:02:25.000> then<00:02:25.210> it's<00:02:25.630> part<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:25.989> the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
was out it but then it's part of the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.530 
was out it but then it's part of the
game<00:02:26.320> if<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.250> win<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:27.520> never<00:02:27.910> complain<00:02:28.330> so

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
game if you win you never complain so

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.910 
game if you win you never complain so
why<00:02:28.660> should<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:28.959> contain<00:02:29.290> if<00:02:29.410> you're<00:02:29.530> losing

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
why should you contain if you're losing

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.890 
why should you contain if you're losing
it's<00:02:30.070> just<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:30.880> don't<00:02:31.360> have<00:02:31.510> anything<00:02:31.750> to

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
it's just you don't have anything to

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.960 
it's just you don't have anything to
lose<00:02:32.170> it's<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.890> experience<00:02:33.070> that<00:02:33.430> matters

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
lose it's the experience that matters

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.550 
lose it's the experience that matters
and<00:02:34.150> that's<00:02:34.209> probably<00:02:34.690> going<00:02:35.020> to<00:02:35.110> help<00:02:35.320> me<00:02:35.470> in

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
and that's probably going to help me in

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.170 
and that's probably going to help me in
the<00:02:35.650> future<00:02:35.680> when<00:02:36.550> I'm<00:02:36.670> looking<00:02:36.970> for<00:02:37.150> a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
the future when I'm looking for a

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.880 
the future when I'm looking for a
professional<00:02:37.360> culinary<00:02:37.930> education<00:02:38.260> so

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
hopefully yeah it's it's an experience

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.780 
hopefully yeah it's it's an experience
and<00:02:41.410> I<00:02:41.470> enjoyed<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.860> I<00:02:41.980> hope<00:02:42.070> they<00:02:42.250> fight<00:02:42.610> it

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.760 

it<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.460> actually<00:02:51.420> great<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.050> be<00:02:52.170> in<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.410> finals

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
it is actually great to be in the finals

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.430 
it is actually great to be in the finals
why<00:02:53.010> why<00:02:53.850> shouldn't<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.270> need<00:02:54.390> not<00:02:54.630> be<00:02:54.870> feeling

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
why why shouldn't I need not be feeling

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.380 
why why shouldn't I need not be feeling
great<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.800> be<00:02:55.890> in<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.070> finals<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.970> was<00:02:57.120> tough

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
great to be in the finals it was tough

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.990 
great to be in the finals it was tough
and<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.990> thought<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.500> know<00:02:58.730> getting<00:02:59.730> into

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
and I thought you know getting into

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.900 
and I thought you know getting into
finals<00:03:00.420> was<00:03:00.690> not<00:03:01.050> really<00:03:01.530> easy<00:03:01.710> because<00:03:02.010> you

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
finals was not really easy because you

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.950 
finals was not really easy because you
had<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.150> really<00:03:03.480> work<00:03:04.020> with<00:03:05.030> two<00:03:06.030> ingredients

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
had to really work with two ingredients

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.920 
had to really work with two ingredients
and<00:03:07.170> i<00:03:07.470> used<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.890> strategy<00:03:08.610> and<00:03:08.640> i<00:03:09.180> thought

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
and i used the strategy and i thought

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.600 
and i used the strategy and i thought
either<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.500> win<00:03:10.740> with<00:03:10.920> started<00:03:11.310> with<00:03:11.460> this

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
either you win with started with this

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.240 
either you win with started with this
strategy<00:03:12.120> or<00:03:12.210> you<00:03:12.330> fail<00:03:12.690> but<00:03:13.140> i<00:03:13.320> think<00:03:13.620> i<00:03:13.740> got

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
strategy or you fail but i think i got

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.790 
strategy or you fail but i think i got
my<00:03:14.430> strategy<00:03:14.850> right<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:15.230> actually<00:03:16.230> enhancing

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
my strategy right of actually enhancing

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.280 
my strategy right of actually enhancing
the<00:03:16.980> whatever<00:03:17.910> they<00:03:18.090> said<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.690> maximum

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
the whatever they said to the maximum

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.190 
the whatever they said to the maximum
and<00:03:20.090> unbalancing<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.180> flavor<00:03:21.420> that's<00:03:21.959> all<00:03:22.170> I

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
and unbalancing the flavor that's all I

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.110 
and unbalancing the flavor that's all I
did<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.680> probably<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.490> know<00:03:23.520> that<00:03:23.880> worked

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
did and probably you know that worked

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.170 
did and probably you know that worked
well<00:03:24.750> i<00:03:24.810> think<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.440> know<00:03:25.500> in<00:03:25.860> my<00:03:26.130> last<00:03:26.370> 10<00:03:27.030> to

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
well i think you know in my last 10 to

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.440 
well i think you know in my last 10 to
15<00:03:27.300> years<00:03:27.570> of<00:03:27.840> me<00:03:28.470> associating<00:03:29.400> with<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.790> with

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
15 years of me associating with the with

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.870 
15 years of me associating with the with
the<00:03:30.570> kitchen<00:03:30.900> I<00:03:31.080> had<00:03:31.380> more<00:03:31.920> failures<00:03:32.370> than<00:03:32.400> you

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
the kitchen I had more failures than you

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.470 
the kitchen I had more failures than you
know<00:03:33.000> then<00:03:33.780> success<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.470> but<00:03:35.240> every<00:03:36.240> failure

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
know then success and but every failure

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.540 
know then success and but every failure
you<00:03:36.750> know<00:03:36.780> you<00:03:36.930> learn<00:03:39.800> well<00:03:40.800> I<00:03:40.830> don't<00:03:41.459> know

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
you know you learn well I don't know

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.360 
you know you learn well I don't know
what<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.000> format<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:43.560> finest<00:03:43.980> is<00:03:44.130> going

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
what is the format the finest is going

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.510 
what is the format the finest is going
to<00:03:44.430> be<00:03:44.550> only<00:03:44.970> thing<00:03:45.240> I<00:03:45.360> can<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:45.990> can<00:03:46.260> probably

a fair idea of what are the ingredients

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.170 
a fair idea of what are the ingredients
which<00:04:00.930> which<00:04:01.350> you<00:04:01.530> could<00:04:01.769> get<00:04:01.980> but<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.060> know
