ok<00:00:00.750> so<00:00:01.319> this<00:00:01.970> research<00:00:02.970> ball

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:03.930 
ok so this research ball

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.530 
ok so this research ball
developed<00:00:04.440> by<00:00:04.470> nuclear<00:00:04.800> research

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
developed by nuclear research

what<00:00:07.350> we<00:00:07.470> really<00:00:07.680> here's<00:00:07.890> its<00:00:08.250> adjustable

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
what we really here's its adjustable

leverages<00:00:11.510> phone's<00:00:12.320> camera<00:00:12.760> to<00:00:13.760> track<00:00:13.969> our

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
leverages phone's camera to track our

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.900 
leverages phone's camera to track our
districts<00:00:14.860> and<00:00:15.860> so<00:00:16.129> we'll<00:00:16.279> be<00:00:16.400> done<00:00:16.550> here<00:00:16.610> is

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
districts and so we'll be done here is

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.350 
districts and so we'll be done here is
we've<00:00:17.090> connected<00:00:18.400> anymore<00:00:19.400> and<00:00:20.150> it<00:00:20.240> can

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
we've connected anymore and it can

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.670 
we've connected anymore and it can
actually<00:00:20.540> be<00:00:20.720> used<00:00:20.810> with<00:00:21.170> any<00:00:21.320> any

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
actually be used with any any

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.200 
actually be used with any any
touchscreen<00:00:22.130> phone<00:00:22.310> so<00:00:23.150> an<00:00:23.300> s60<00:00:23.720> v5<00:00:23.980> any<00:00:24.980> other

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
touchscreen phone so an s60 v5 any other

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.890 
touchscreen phone so an s60 v5 any other
enemy<00:00:26.210> oh<00:00:27.160> yeah<00:00:28.160> exactly<00:00:28.670> and<00:00:29.150> this<00:00:29.689> just

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
enemy oh yeah exactly and this just

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.229 
enemy oh yeah exactly and this just
stand<00:00:30.199> here<00:00:30.289> and<00:00:30.859> we<00:00:30.949> connect<00:00:31.279> the<00:00:31.460> phone<00:00:31.640> to<00:00:31.699> a

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
stand here and we connect the phone to a

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.890 
stand here and we connect the phone to a
TV<00:00:32.540> via<00:00:33.170> hdmi<00:00:33.260> cable<00:00:34.100> all<00:00:34.820> right<00:00:34.970> and<00:00:35.180> it<00:00:35.720> could

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
TV via hdmi cable all right and it could

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.080 
TV via hdmi cable all right and it could
actually<00:00:36.050> be<00:00:36.230> a<00:00:36.320> TV<00:00:36.620> cable<00:00:36.949> school<00:00:37.129> okay<00:00:37.850> so<00:00:37.910> it

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
actually be a TV cable school okay so it

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.910 
actually be a TV cable school okay so it
doesn't<00:00:38.300> matter<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:38.930> fact<00:00:39.140> fact<00:00:39.710> is<00:00:39.890> that

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
doesn't matter to the fact fact is that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.780 
doesn't matter to the fact fact is that
now<00:00:40.640> with<00:00:41.300> a<00:00:41.330> small<00:00:41.660> application<00:00:42.199> like<00:00:42.890> 34<00:00:43.339> kb

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
now with a small application like 34 kb

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.490 
now with a small application like 34 kb
we're<00:00:45.420> able<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.660> leverage<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.080> camera<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.470> a

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
we're able to leverage the camera as a

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.340 
we're able to leverage the camera as a
sensor<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> track<00:00:47.220> record<00:00:47.990> and<00:00:48.990> so<00:00:49.200> we've

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
sensor in the track record and so we've

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.010 
sensor in the track record and so we've
got<00:00:49.380> two<00:00:49.860> majors<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.760> click<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.810> other

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
got two majors what is click the other

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.890 
got two majors what is click the other
is<00:00:52.320> scrolling<00:00:53.040> vertical<00:00:53.730> school<00:00:53.940> okay<00:00:54.840> so

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
is scrolling vertical school okay so

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:02.580 
is scrolling vertical school okay so
initially<00:00:55.860> that's<00:00:56.040> really<00:00:56.760> cool

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.599 

very<00:01:03.590> strong

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:08.609 

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:11.700 

that's<00:01:09.609> that's<00:01:10.240> going<00:01:10.600> on<00:01:10.689> but<00:01:10.899> even<00:01:11.409> we<00:01:11.530> can

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
that's that's going on but even we can

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.399 
that's that's going on but even we can
do<00:01:11.829> this

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.350 

okay<00:01:17.409> so<00:01:17.740> this<00:01:17.950> is<00:01:18.100> not<00:01:18.250> just<00:01:18.460> this<00:01:18.850> can<00:01:19.270> be

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
okay so this is not just this can be

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.510 
okay so this is not just this can be
done<00:01:19.510> for<00:01:19.780> a<00:01:20.020> lot<00:01:20.200> of<00:01:20.260> applications<00:01:20.860> not<00:01:21.310> all

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
done for a lot of applications not all

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.790 
done for a lot of applications not all
applications<00:01:22.210> but<00:01:22.990> we<00:01:23.080> can<00:01:23.229> also<00:01:23.380> you<00:01:23.710> know

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
applications but we can also you know

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:33.510 
applications but we can also you know
sort<00:01:24.010> of<00:01:25.590> play<00:01:26.590> around<00:01:26.710> with<00:01:27.040> a<00:01:27.430> menu

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.340 

keep<00:01:34.520> officers<00:01:35.109> understanding<00:01:36.109> how<00:01:36.229> to

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
keep officers understanding how to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.819 
keep officers understanding how to
leverage<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.310> sensor<00:01:37.670> in<00:01:38.479> a<00:01:38.630> device<00:01:38.960> whether

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
leverage the sensor in a device whether

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.949 
leverage the sensor in a device whether
it's<00:01:39.979> a<00:01:40.130> camera<00:01:40.399> or<00:01:40.819> multiple<00:01:41.450> cameras<00:01:41.840> or

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
it's a camera or multiple cameras or

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.800 
it's a camera or multiple cameras or
anything<00:01:41.990> right<00:01:42.409> to<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:44.509> take<00:01:44.659> the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
anything right to to take the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.999 
anything right to to take the
touchscreen<00:01:45.200> experience<00:01:45.319> away<00:01:45.799> from<00:01:45.950> the

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
touchscreen experience away from the

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.889 
touchscreen experience away from the
social<00:01:46.340> right<00:01:47.119> and<00:01:47.270> this<00:01:47.329> is<00:01:47.479> important

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
social right and this is important

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.179 
social right and this is important
because<00:01:48.020> we're<00:01:48.349> having<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.799> lot<00:01:49.130> of

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
because we're having a lot of

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.819 
because we're having a lot of
development<00:01:49.789> augmented<00:01:50.509> reality<00:01:50.829> community

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
development augmented reality community

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.069 
development augmented reality community
you<00:01:51.979> live<00:01:52.189> things<00:01:52.969> like<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:53.539> you<00:01:53.959> know

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
you live things like that and you know

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.630 
you live things like that and you know
for<00:01:54.289> example<00:01:54.349> like<00:01:54.709> awesome<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.250> movie<00:01:55.429> Iron

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
for example like awesome the movie Iron

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.010 
for example like awesome the movie Iron
Man<00:01:57.849> create<00:01:58.849> things<00:01:59.179> are<00:01:59.450> really<00:01:59.569> cool<00:01:59.780> right

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
Man create things are really cool right

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.839 
Man create things are really cool right
yeah<00:02:00.289> and<00:02:00.560> that's<00:02:01.039> that<00:02:01.219> desperate<00:02:01.700> that

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:01.849 
yeah and that's that desperate that

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:05.020 
yeah and that's that desperate that
that's<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.719> can't<00:02:03.530> happen<00:02:03.739> right<00:02:04.219> what<00:02:04.939> it

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
that's that can't happen right what it

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.240 
that's that can't happen right what it
does<00:02:05.239> happen<00:02:05.509> how<00:02:06.439> we<00:02:06.500> going<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:06.920> be<00:02:07.039> able<00:02:07.099> to

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
does happen how we going to be able to

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.410 
does happen how we going to be able to
interact<00:02:07.520> with<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:10.429> only<00:02:10.759> way<00:02:10.879> to<00:02:10.940> do<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:11.269> is

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
interact with the only way to do it is

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.559 
interact with the only way to do it is
if<00:02:11.599> we<00:02:11.720> were<00:02:12.200> able<00:02:12.319> to<00:02:12.440> leverage<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.950> center

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
if we were able to leverage the center

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.740 
if we were able to leverage the center
but<00:02:14.569> so<00:02:14.870> we're<00:02:15.440> RTC<00:02:16.010> multiple<00:02:16.790> cameras<00:02:17.120> on<00:02:17.239> our

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
but so we're RTC multiple cameras on our

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.680 
but so we're RTC multiple cameras on our
phones<00:02:17.989> right<00:02:18.290> front<00:02:19.099> facing<00:02:19.489> back<00:02:19.700> bc<00:02:19.970> maybe

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
phones right front facing back bc maybe

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.569 
phones right front facing back bc maybe
see<00:02:20.959> more<00:02:21.260> more<00:02:21.620> more<00:02:22.010> cameras<00:02:22.370> actually

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
see more more more cameras actually

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.530 
see more more more cameras actually
connect<00:02:23.000> my<00:02:23.299> question

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
connect my question

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.089 
connect my question
front<00:02:24.900> facing<00:02:25.230> camera<00:02:25.469> not<00:02:25.620> but<00:02:25.799> I<00:02:25.829> was<00:02:25.980> going

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
front facing camera not but I was going

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.009 
front facing camera not but I was going
to<00:02:26.159> stop<00:02:26.340> here<00:02:26.579> and<00:02:27.000> control<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.569> TV<00:02:27.719> like

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
to stop here and control the TV like

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.390
