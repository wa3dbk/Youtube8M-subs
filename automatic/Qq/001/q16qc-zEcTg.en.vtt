fun results so you can be the judge for

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.880 
fun results so you can be the judge for
yourself<00:00:13.639> in<00:00:14.639> my<00:00:15.480> opinion<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.260> made<00:00:16.440> my<00:00:16.619> hair<00:00:16.859> a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
yourself in my opinion it made my hair a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.970 
yourself in my opinion it made my hair a
little<00:00:17.279> thicker<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:18.390> made<00:00:18.600> my<00:00:18.750> hair<00:00:18.930> fuller<00:00:19.320> it

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
little thicker it made my hair fuller it

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.800 
little thicker it made my hair fuller it
made<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.340> caliber<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.970> hair<00:00:21.240> which<00:00:21.480> means

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
made the caliber of the hair which means

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.540 
made the caliber of the hair which means
you<00:00:22.350> know<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.650> circumference<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> hair<00:00:23.519> a

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
you know the circumference of the hair a

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.290 
you know the circumference of the hair a
little<00:00:23.850> bigger<00:00:24.500> and<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:26.460> didn't<00:00:27.090> really<00:00:27.269> ever

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
little bigger and I didn't really ever

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.450 
little bigger and I didn't really ever
have<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.869> many<00:00:28.050> great<00:00:28.320> gray<00:00:28.710> hairs<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:29.160> 40

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
have that many great gray hairs on 40

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.939 
have that many great gray hairs on 40
years<00:00:29.609> old<00:00:29.820> now<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.230> still<00:00:31.500> don't<00:00:31.679> have<00:00:31.740> any

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
years old now and I still don't have any

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.080 
years old now and I still don't have any
gray<00:00:32.130> hair<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.520> don't<00:00:32.820> know<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.000> has

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
gray hair so I don't know if it has

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.670 
gray hair so I don't know if it has
anything<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.420> do<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.260> fact<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.559> I

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
anything to do with the fact that I

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.049 
anything to do with the fact that I
don't<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:34.980> any<00:00:35.160> gray<00:00:35.340> or<00:00:35.550> not<00:00:35.760> because<00:00:35.969> I

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
don't have any gray or not because I

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.350 
don't have any gray or not because I
don't<00:00:36.300> color<00:00:36.719> my<00:00:36.780> hair<00:00:36.930> um<00:00:37.790> I'd<00:00:38.790> also<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.210> to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
don't color my hair um I'd also like to

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.090 
don't color my hair um I'd also like to
say<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:39.809> more<00:00:40.020> manageable<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.800> mean<00:00:40.980> on

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
say that it's more manageable I mean on

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.860 
say that it's more manageable I mean on
it<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.430> always<00:00:41.700> like<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.210> stand<00:00:42.480> up<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.840> I

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
it I always like it to stand up and I

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.119 
it I always like it to stand up and I
don't<00:00:43.020> use<00:00:43.110> any<00:00:43.320> mousse<00:00:43.530> or<00:00:43.739> gel<00:00:43.770> or<00:00:44.100> anything

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
don't use any mousse or gel or anything

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.830 
don't use any mousse or gel or anything
like<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.000> like<00:00:45.239> using<00:00:45.360> those<00:00:45.600> kind<00:00:45.809> of

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
like that so I like using those kind of

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.549 
like that so I like using those kind of
products<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.940> it<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.570> basically<00:00:48.960> stands<00:00:49.320> up

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
products but it it basically stands up

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.729 
products but it it basically stands up
and<00:00:49.800> lays<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.219> way<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.760> want<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.149> light

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
and lays the way that I want it to light

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.990 
and lays the way that I want it to light
which<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.890> didn't<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:53.250> as<00:00:53.399> much<00:00:53.430> before<00:00:53.969> I

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
which it didn't do as much before I

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.830 
which it didn't do as much before I
started<00:00:54.420> using<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.960> laser<00:00:55.620> cap<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.090> you

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
started using the laser cap so so I you

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.299 
started using the laser cap so so I you
know<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.960> would<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.379> would<00:00:58.620> say<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> laser<00:00:59.039> cap

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
know I would I would say the laser cap

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.970 
know I would I would say the laser cap
has<00:00:59.550> some<00:00:59.940> effect<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:01.379> quality<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
has some effect on the quality of the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.219 
has some effect on the quality of the
hair<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.399> caliber<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.480> hair<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
hair the caliber of the hair the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.200 
hair the caliber of the hair the
thickness<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> hair<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.280> possibly<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
thickness of the hair and possibly the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.600 
thickness of the hair and possibly the
manageability<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> hair<00:01:07.350> but<00:01:07.979> ultimately

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
manageability of the hair but ultimately

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.460 
manageability of the hair but ultimately
you<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.939> be<00:01:09.150> your<00:01:09.630> own<00:01:09.810> judge<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.460> here's

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
you have to be your own judge but here's

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.350 
you have to be your own judge but here's
kind<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.530> what<00:01:13.650> mine<00:01:13.890> looks<00:01:14.360> like<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:17.360> don't

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
kind of what mine looks like I don't

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.719 
kind of what mine looks like I don't
know<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.780> don't<00:01:19.350> know<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.590> mean<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.189> guess<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.580> would

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
know I don't know I mean I guess I would

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.520 
know I don't know I mean I guess I would
read<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.150> four<00:01:21.570> out<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.720> five<00:01:21.960> if<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.290> had<00:01:22.439> to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
read it four out of five if I had to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.590 
read it four out of five if I had to
give<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.830> rating<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.729> anyway<00:01:24.119> these<00:01:24.360> are<00:01:24.420> my

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
give it a rating so anyway these are my

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.630 
give it a rating so anyway these are my
these<00:01:24.840> are<00:01:24.900> my<00:01:25.080> results<00:01:25.259> after<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.009> think<00:01:26.520> it's

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
these are my results after I think it's

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.730 
these are my results after I think it's
been<00:01:26.790> 15<00:01:27.390> weeks<00:01:27.600> but<00:01:27.810> I'm<00:01:28.080> not<00:01:28.259> sure<00:01:28.500> if<00:01:28.590> it's

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
been 15 weeks but I'm not sure if it's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.370 
been 15 weeks but I'm not sure if it's
between<00:01:28.920> 12<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.430> 16<00:01:29.970> weeks<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.450> roughly

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
between 12 and 16 weeks but roughly

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.370 
between 12 and 16 weeks but roughly
fifteen<00:01:31.740> fifteen<00:01:32.280> weeks<00:01:32.810> if<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.960> think<00:01:34.200> these

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
fifteen fifteen weeks if you think these

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.050 
fifteen fifteen weeks if you think these
results<00:01:34.829> are<00:01:34.950> any<00:01:35.070> good<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.549> might<00:01:35.759> want<00:01:36.000> to

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
results are any good you might want to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.260 
results are any good you might want to
give<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> laser<00:01:36.570> cap<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> try<00:01:37.729> I'll<00:01:38.729> put<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.030> link

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
give the laser cap a try I'll put a link

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.010 
give the laser cap a try I'll put a link
on<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.780> video<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.799> order<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.689> purchase<00:01:42.689> it

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
on the video to in order to purchase it

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.499 
on the video to in order to purchase it
but<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.610> end<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.030> decision<00:01:45.119> is

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
but in the in the end the decision is
