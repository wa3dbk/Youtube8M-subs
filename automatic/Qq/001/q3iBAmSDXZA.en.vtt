00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
ways to save power the battery life is

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.420 
ways to save power the battery life is
actually<00:00:08.930> pretty<00:00:09.260> good<00:00:09.379> on<00:00:09.559> this<00:00:09.680> on<00:00:10.070> this

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:10.430 
actually pretty good on this on this

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.959 
actually pretty good on this on this
device

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:10.969 
device

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:17.820 
device
it's<00:00:11.750> an<00:00:11.900> 1800<00:00:12.740> milliamp<00:00:13.400> hour<00:00:13.520> battery

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.740 

now<00:00:17.920> one<00:00:18.340> of<00:00:18.370> one<00:00:18.760> of<00:00:18.850> the<00:00:18.910> first<00:00:19.150> ways<00:00:19.360> to<00:00:19.570> save

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
now one of one of the first ways to save

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.020 
now one of one of the first ways to save
some<00:00:19.900> powers<00:00:20.230> that<00:00:20.410> keep<00:00:20.650> the<00:00:20.770> screen<00:00:21.070> off<00:00:21.220> so

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.030 
some powers that keep the screen off so

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.640 
some powers that keep the screen off so
what<00:00:22.120> you<00:00:22.210> can<00:00:22.330> do<00:00:22.420> is<00:00:22.570> you<00:00:22.660> can<00:00:22.780> peek<00:00:23.410> at<00:00:23.560> your

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
what you can do is you can peek at your

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.190 
what you can do is you can peek at your
stuff<00:00:23.950> you<00:00:24.850> can<00:00:24.970> look<00:00:25.090> around<00:00:25.210> and<00:00:25.570> then<00:00:25.780> if

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
stuff you can look around and then if

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.630 
stuff you can look around and then if
you<00:00:26.290> drag<00:00:26.530> your<00:00:26.710> finger<00:00:26.980> down<00:00:27.010> the<00:00:27.369> screen

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
you drag your finger down the screen

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.210 
you drag your finger down the screen
will<00:00:27.760> go<00:00:27.880> off<00:00:28.030> if<00:00:28.510> you<00:00:29.470> let<00:00:29.619> go<00:00:29.680> like<00:00:29.980> somewhere

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
will go off if you let go like somewhere

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.590 
will go off if you let go like somewhere
in<00:00:30.279> the<00:00:30.340> middle<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:30.880> screen<00:00:31.119> will<00:00:31.240> stay<00:00:31.420> on

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
in the middle the screen will stay on

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.690 
in the middle the screen will stay on
actually<00:00:32.050> so<00:00:32.440> it's<00:00:32.529> better<00:00:32.680> to<00:00:32.770> peek<00:00:33.070> and<00:00:33.310> shut

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
actually so it's better to peek and shut

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
and that can save battery if you

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.300 
and that can save battery if you
minimize<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:38.590> power<00:01:38.770> that's<00:01:39.010> used<00:01:39.250> during

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
minimize the power that's used during

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.120 
minimize the power that's used during
that<00:01:39.610> time

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.440 

playing<00:01:45.130> around<00:01:45.220> with<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.970> brightness

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
playing around with the the brightness

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.200 
playing around with the the brightness
is<00:01:46.689> also<00:01:47.229> very<00:01:47.409> important<00:01:47.890> if<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:48.820> look<00:01:48.970> over

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
is also very important if you look over

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.249 
is also very important if you look over
here<00:01:49.659> you<00:01:50.380> can<00:01:50.409> increase<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.490> brightness<00:01:51.640> or

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
here you can increase the brightness or

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.410 
here you can increase the brightness or
decrease<00:01:53.259> it<00:01:53.439> makes<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.220> very<00:01:54.250> big<00:01:55.240> difference

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
decrease it makes a very big difference

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.420 
decrease it makes a very big difference
actually<00:01:55.840> I<00:01:56.259> tend<00:01:56.860> to<00:01:56.890> keep<00:01:57.039> it<00:01:57.159> around<00:01:57.310> the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
actually I tend to keep it around the

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.609 
actually I tend to keep it around the
middle<00:01:57.549> a<00:01:57.899> bit<00:01:58.899> lower<00:01:59.140> than<00:01:59.320> the<00:01:59.409> middle

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619

to check is your applications that are

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.370 
to check is your applications that are
running<00:02:23.819> there's<00:02:24.450> no<00:02:24.510> point<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:24.990> having<00:02:25.140> all

these applications running if you're not
using<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.600> they're<00:02:27.750> simply<00:02:28.110> using<00:02:28.410> up<00:02:28.530> memory

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
using it they're simply using up memory

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.290 
using it they're simply using up memory
and<00:02:29.100> they're<00:02:29.640> taking<00:02:29.970> out<00:02:30.060> your<00:02:30.209> battery
