the show said 300 over and I said well

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.780 
the show said 300 over and I said well
listen<00:01:30.770> everyone<00:01:31.770> can<00:01:31.920> lie<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.159> boxing<00:01:32.640> but

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
listen everyone can lie in boxing but

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.280 
listen everyone can lie in boxing but
you<00:01:33.119> know<00:01:33.240> sometimes<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.750> truth<00:01:33.960> comes<00:01:34.170> out

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you know sometimes the truth comes out

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.620 
you know sometimes the truth comes out
so<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.710> guess<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.189> was<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> true<00:01:35.640> Bret<00:01:36.270> how<00:01:36.390> big

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
so I guess it was the true Bret how big

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.999 
so I guess it was the true Bret how big
can<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.869> get<00:01:37.140> because<00:01:37.320> because<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.710> know<00:01:37.770> that

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
can you get because because I know that

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.800
