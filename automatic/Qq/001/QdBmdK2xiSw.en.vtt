00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.530
 hello good gamers we are here in the 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.340
 level 38 of plants against zombies let's go 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.789
 to say the plants for this level 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:22.179
 room here in the sunflower repeater 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.179
 the plug foot in place to three beeps 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.870
 the peas we 're going to choose this 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.720
 just in case 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.930
 I believe that with this 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.990
 will be worth it and if not then we will change 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.160
 the strategy but for now 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.190
 my strategy has failed me 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.140
 and segregate mine that is quite 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.860
 pigheaded 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.860
 in other 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.860
 no no 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.860
 let's go back 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.110
 let's see if they give me solecitos to be 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.460
 two 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.460
 here we put another 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.240
 between a little we will have our row 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.350
 of sunflowers as you see 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.350
 in a moment 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.530
 and then we'll take care of him 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.500
 Searching as we want 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.030
 for example now here is here and so 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.650
 we take advantage to go picking 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.650
 all the suns that we can 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.900
 we do recovery here 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.260
 one that explodes 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.210
 catching 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.159
 take advantage of the I'm going to place here 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:08.979
 we have a little crazy cutlery brings 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.979
 and then I will be placing repeaters 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.009
 collecting soles 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.340
 thank you for leaving me a monedillas 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.340
 silly zombie 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.769
 we go 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.769
 I want to get to 325 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.420
 we go to a more solicitous 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.420
 here I have it 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.690
 in o grove gives me time to take the 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.730
 arrive maybe if it arrives but it will die just 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.580
 fair 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.580
 while they comment it so good even that 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.390
 so good 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.319
 25 let's put it here 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.319
 another 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.780
 place here is 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.709
 these are good because they cost 25 and if 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.640
 you come one wants to be a guardian of no 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.080
 place anything 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.080
 what are you saving 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.760
 so that another 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.069
 and that another one comes to me because we put another 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.069
 and then we will be placing 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.490
 this 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.540
 another one I need I request more for 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.230
 place the door here 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.230
 and it is already 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.690
 and it is already 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:04.000
 we have what is more or less the 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.300
 covered we are missing the area above the 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.300
 down 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.290
 the torch the truth that I do not know very well 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.489
 still 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.489
 what will it be worth 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.819
 I said that he was breaking the peas that are going 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.870
 above this level as you see we have 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:23.870
 two levels of truth 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.060
 I put it 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.640
 one up and one down here 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.870
 and I think that that will be enough for me 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.080
 more here 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.560
 to me a dolphin comes this from I suppose 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.560
 that will come fast 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.179
 pretty fast as you see 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:51.179
 and jump 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:57.550
 well one more thing we know now 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.310
 about what those do 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.820
 is going to place two since I only think that 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.820
 jump one 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.050
 I suppose in the truth that I think that 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.050
 you can only jump one 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.940
 this for example 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.620
 when jumping it would burn 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.280
 do not 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.129
 its mobilize more lives and with the 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.129
 torches 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.419
 to place another 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.210
 try and try and eat but 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.350
 collecting soles 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.460
 I was keeping many suns I'm going to go 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:03.440
 using as you see 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.440
 although they gave me the two finites 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.860
 that seems to be burning a 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.419
 bit 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.419
 it does not give them time nor to arrive 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.460
 Well, it seems that with the torches 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.460
 it removes quite 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.080
 place here 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.920
 one more 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:35.380
 or maybe with what here where the 4 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.380
 to put another here and you're 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.190
 another here and I'll leave it like that 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:46.140
 and it is quite more knows how they see 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.639
 well before we go last level of 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.340
 horde 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:51.840
 and I had noticed he did not keep many 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.169
 suns but well I do not think I have great 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.169
 difficulty 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.170
 we'll see 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.650
 if this has any difficulty or not 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.650
 here this one that jumps me 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:13.860
 you can not eat everything you want 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.860
 This is going to die right now and is 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.310
 and let him eat whatever he wants 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.789
 another less 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:29.280
 I'm going to take off the cap of 4 

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:31.710
 shoot bad is already no longer die 

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:36.440
 we think it's a giant, let's see again 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:36.440
 with the second bonus of level 38 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:46.510
 it's not cantankerous shell radiate 

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:49.750
 heavy plant that can not be exceeded 

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:51.880
 good as we see it will be what you put and from 

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:54.550
 there they can not pass the truth that is 

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:57.000
 cheap for the function that I think is going to 

00:07:54.550 --> 00:08:00.040
 have as good jugones this has been 

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 level 38 of plants against zombies and 

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.000
 see you on the next level
