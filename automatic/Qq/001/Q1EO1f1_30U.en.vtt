00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
going to launch into now is called a

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.809 
going to launch into now is called a
wrapping<00:00:04.380> turn<00:00:04.650> and<00:00:04.980> it's<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.460> little<00:00:05.700> bit

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
wrapping turn and it's a little bit

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.099 
wrapping turn and it's a little bit
different<00:00:06.089> than<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.299> salsa<00:00:06.660> turn<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.049> the

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
different than the salsa turn and the

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.350 
different than the salsa turn and the
fact<00:00:07.350> that<00:00:07.440> it's<00:00:07.799> not<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.280> full<00:00:08.550> rotation<00:00:08.760> it's

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
fact that it's not a full rotation it's

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.660 
fact that it's not a full rotation it's
just<00:00:09.570> half<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.929> one<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:10.620> very<00:00:10.650> versatile<00:00:11.400> move

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
just half of one so very versatile move

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.879 
just half of one so very versatile move
you<00:00:11.820> can<00:00:11.940> use<00:00:12.059> in<00:00:12.179> any<00:00:12.330> situation<00:00:12.870> take<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.620> look

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
you can use in any situation take a look

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.169 
you can use in any situation take a look
at<00:00:13.950> what<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.160> looks<00:00:14.309> like<00:00:14.429> first<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.000> then
