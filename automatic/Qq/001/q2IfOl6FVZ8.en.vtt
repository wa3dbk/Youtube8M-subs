00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
way because I think it really lends a

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.299 
way because I think it really lends a
perspective<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.930> kind<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.619> mean<00:01:05.070> furniture

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
art kind of is a surprising thing you

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.539 
art kind of is a surprising thing you
look<00:01:09.960> at<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.470> you're<00:01:10.650> surprised<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
involved in it so I think it really does

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.310 
involved in it so I think it really does
lend<00:01:13.860> another<00:01:14.640> dimension<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.420> any<00:01:15.689> space<00:01:16.080> that
