00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.859
 this is a ronald koeman one the category very important this one 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:08.149
 victory 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.069
 Yeah right 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:13.189
 if you have a lot and you want to look higher 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:15.619
 what we always try 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.550
 these are important competitions 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.739
 every match is important though 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:24.239
 think it has been very important not only victory but very 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:26.140
 certainly in the way 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.750
 I think that deserved that because we are more busy as the opponent 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.879
 put 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.940
 and they have waited and 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.540
 to us this is that left and that is work 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.480
 as the game gets better and better and eventually it results 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.210
 that we are in a very deserved victory what do you say if I also like your team as 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.970
 the 20 17 is in a stadium 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.810
 well 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.420
 especially ask players what is it like before I want to do a warm up 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.460
 well you see it saw that does not always mean if you have a win 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.630
 then that it is an advantage of kia 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.510
 how much the free kick president did not get to the stands also came to us first 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.470
 themselves had some problems with it 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.670
 but I thought that we dealt with it better also in the first eleven as as az 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.100
 it in the second half 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.590
 and a number of times well dangerous 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.120
 to make a purchase 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.480
 finally we started to play better and better in the game 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.710
 and of course we have a fantastic first chance 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.610
 Being able to say about the role of vandalism Lierse call is running out 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.080
 nice way yes totally his game I found fantastic in midfield marcel 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.140
 balvast 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.240
 which is very aggressive 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.700
 sometimes making too many meters, which is often not unnecessary, it turns out to be the case 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.940
 that makes position 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.229
 if you are 17 years old and you are no longer 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.399
 first with a with clasie take as in midfield relative to az can 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.390
 then that is a big compliment 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.460
 the red card is no longer very important because you were already ahead 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.609
 that moment it happened flat feyenoord the wood 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:58.680
 with balls and how excited it is 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.660
 he got a big hit 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.670
 I also think it was a very justified red card, but they are missing 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.140
 from behind the center line 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.390
 yes then you ask for a red card but I think it is not too bad 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:14.609
 he has been back in the field she said he could continue 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.030
 yes that was no longer necessary we walked in with the first option is to utrecht 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.389
 is a justified win in July he is important that they are different 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.169
 victories also margin in advance looked at animal meadow duels this was anyway 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:27.539
 maybe the bloated until the winter break doesn't say 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:30.129
 after currently not seen the rankings 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.219
 ballmer bin against rkc is higher next week than az 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.729
 brig anp laurent ciman blood and syria is of course clear that 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:41.289
 what is still there a team has had where a lot of football 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:42.069
 and 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.509
 when it is difficult to deal with but I think it was mainly our fault 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:50.549
 the way hz plays that varied were better 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.249
 Is this also means this also see what about the development of your team 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:56.989
 Should the team have the goal he could just strike the man in the final stage against 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.109
 such an opponent 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.729
 yes also adv but i also like the peace in football i think 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.209
 much better that we also think much better football players last year for years 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.579
 we played much nicer 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.469
 ear in switching with speed that still have to make through the sides 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:15.769
 You also see a positional game hitting it once also a moment in the second 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.189
 half japan 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.989
 then that part is absolutely better than we were used to the two meters 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.159
 surprisingly gerard meijer to look at that smile from ear to ear 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.699
 year that happens again something very beautiful in the tub for your guidance 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:31.459
 to get the feeling with will as according to after years of having that feeling 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.910
 we also have it ourselves with the players and 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.489
 he ruled that as grass feyenoord him 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.620
 of course you are wonderful that you have your club again 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.359
 yes that we count more and hold on to this as a free person 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:48.750
 and trust is in the group then 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.500
 is just like last season is just a lot of possible one more thing 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.170
 loses house of vitesse to crawl incredible that before but also nice 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.449
 what do you think of that development 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:02.529
 fantastic for the competition that you become the vitesse win in eindhoven 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:04.489
 it already makes an exciting of that 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.149
 and everything crawling close to each other gets a spicy program 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:10.559
 everyone until the winter break so 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:14.760
 PSV is also not unapproachable months that we already knew and there is an extra 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.079
 compliment to 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.909
 but vitesse that they have that we are already turning to me vision congratulations 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:21.120
