could do it this way and this way or we

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.420 
could do it this way and this way or we
could<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.090> top<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.259> left<00:01:40.500> side<00:01:40.799> we

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
could do it the top and the left side we

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.450 
could do it the top and the left side we
cannot<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.060> bottom<00:01:42.590> because<00:01:43.590> putting<00:01:44.280> it

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460

this way and the best way to do with the
left<00:01:49.380> side<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.710> pressing<00:01:50.130> towards<00:01:51.590> the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.070 
these two little pieces okay so what we
have<00:02:12.890> here<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.460> that<00:02:13.640> we<00:02:14.240> have<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.540> two<00:02:14.720> pieces

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
have here is that we have the two pieces

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.460 
have here is that we have the two pieces
of<00:02:15.200> tape<00:02:16.120> attached<00:02:17.980> as<00:02:18.980> if<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.430> can<00:02:19.610> see<00:02:20.470> this

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
of tape attached as if you can see this

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.810 
of tape attached as if you can see this
one<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:22.130> not<00:02:22.520> really<00:02:24.220> sticking<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:25.490> well

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
one is not really sticking that well

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.730 
one is not really sticking that well
because<00:02:26.210> there<00:02:26.420> are<00:02:26.600> there<00:02:27.020> are<00:02:27.080> some<00:02:27.290> ridges

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
because there are there are some ridges

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.830 
because there are there are some ridges
in<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:27.920> back<00:02:28.250> however<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.390> don't<00:02:29.480> have<00:02:29.600> to

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
in the back however you don't have to

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.450 
in the back however you don't have to
worry<00:02:30.080> about<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.650> much<00:02:30.860> because<00:02:31.040> once

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
worry about it that much because once

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.790 
worry about it that much because once
the<00:02:31.640> battery<00:02:32.000> goes<00:02:32.180> in<00:02:32.440> everything<00:02:33.440> is<00:02:33.560> going

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
the battery goes in everything is going

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.860 
the battery goes in everything is going
to<00:02:33.860> settle<00:02:34.100> down<00:02:34.310> now<00:02:35.030> what<00:02:35.210> we<00:02:35.360> have<00:02:35.390> is<00:02:35.570> that

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
to settle down now what we have is that

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.710 
to settle down now what we have is that
since<00:02:36.170> it's<00:02:36.350> double<00:02:36.740> tape<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.880> sticking<00:02:38.450> to

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
since it's double tape it sticking to

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.420 
since it's double tape it sticking to
this<00:02:38.900> side<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.500> it's<00:02:39.650> sticking<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:40.070> this<00:02:40.190> side

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
this side and it's sticking to this side

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.610 
this side and it's sticking to this side
and<00:02:40.730> then<00:02:41.240> the<00:02:41.360> other<00:02:41.390> sticky<00:02:41.900> side<00:02:42.110> is<00:02:42.140> going

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
and then the other sticky side is going

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.160 
and then the other sticky side is going
to<00:02:42.740> be<00:02:42.860> facing<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.400> battery<00:02:43.820> so<00:02:44.480> when<00:02:44.720> we

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
to be facing the battery so when we

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.250 
to be facing the battery so when we
place<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.770> battery<00:02:46.160> in<00:02:46.630> it's<00:02:47.630> going<00:02:47.990> to

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
place the battery in it's going to

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.400 
place the battery in it's going to
basically<00:02:48.620> take<00:02:48.800> its<00:02:49.190> place<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:50.050> fit<00:02:51.050> well

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.510 

you<00:02:54.410> can<00:02:54.590> also<00:02:54.800> place<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:56.150> tapes<00:02:56.510> like<00:02:57.020> these

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.770 

because<00:03:01.520> they<00:03:01.730> are<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.820> little<00:03:01.940> bit<00:03:02.180> thick<00:03:02.480> we

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
because they are a little bit thick we

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.410 
because they are a little bit thick we
are<00:03:02.870> having<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.320> little<00:03:03.530> problem<00:03:04.300> sticking<00:03:05.300> it

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
are having a little problem sticking it

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.860 
are having a little problem sticking it
to<00:03:05.450> this<00:03:05.870> side<00:03:06.760> and<00:03:07.760> then<00:03:08.060> have<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.480> battery

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
to this side and then have the battery

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.910 
to this side and then have the battery
going<00:03:09.080> on<00:03:09.320> this<00:03:09.470> side<00:03:09.710> so<00:03:10.250> we<00:03:10.640> are<00:03:11.000> going<00:03:11.240> to

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
going on this side so we are going to

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.010 
going on this side so we are going to
install<00:03:12.920> them<00:03:13.190> like<00:03:14.000> this<00:03:14.240> so<00:03:14.450> first<00:03:14.750> thing

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
install them like this so first thing

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.550 
install them like this so first thing
you<00:03:15.170> want<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.440> do<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:19.660> get<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.840> bottom<00:03:21.260> of<00:03:21.410> the

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
you want to do is get the bottom of the

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.250 
you want to do is get the bottom of the
battery<00:03:21.970> inside<00:03:22.970> because<00:03:23.450> there<00:03:23.720> are<00:03:23.960> little

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
battery inside because there are little

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.750 
battery inside because there are little
hooks<00:03:24.530> there<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.160> then<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:26.600> can<00:03:26.810> basically

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
hooks there and then you can basically

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.850 
hooks there and then you can basically
force<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:29.000> down<00:03:29.210> a<00:03:29.510> little<00:03:29.630> bit<00:03:29.900> as<00:03:30.140> you<00:03:30.710> can

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
force it down a little bit as you can

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.410 
force it down a little bit as you can
see<00:03:31.010> that<00:03:31.190> there<00:03:31.340> is<00:03:31.460> some<00:03:31.730> double<00:03:32.240> tape

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
see that there is some double tape

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.850 
see that there is some double tape
padding<00:03:32.810> on<00:03:32.900> this<00:03:33.110> side<00:03:33.380> and<00:03:34.360> this<00:03:35.440> is<00:03:36.440> also

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
padding on this side and this is also

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.840 
padding on this side and this is also
holding<00:03:37.040> in<00:03:37.310> here<00:03:37.640> and<00:03:38.200> basically<00:03:39.790> this<00:03:40.790> is

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
holding in here and basically this is

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.449 
holding in here and basically this is
going<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.360> make<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:41.900> so<00:03:42.140> tight<00:03:42.530> that<00:03:42.830> the

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
going to make it so tight that the

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:44.680 
going to make it so tight that the
battery<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:43.850> not<00:03:44.030> going<00:03:44.300> to<00:03:44.390> move<00:03:44.540> around

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
battery is not going to move around

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:56.059 
battery is not going to move around
anymore

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.089 

so<00:03:56.790> here<00:03:57.030> we<00:03:57.239> go<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.599> phone<00:03:57.840> has<00:03:58.140> now<00:03:58.680> started

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
so here we go the phone has now started

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.929 
so here we go the phone has now started
up<00:03:59.370> and<00:04:00.560> everything<00:04:01.560> seems<00:04:02.069> to<00:04:02.310> be<00:04:02.459> working

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
up and everything seems to be working

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:08.569 
up and everything seems to be working
fine<00:04:03.980> now<00:04:05.959> how<00:04:06.959> can<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.439> really<00:04:07.650> test<00:04:08.069> that

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
fine now how can you really test that

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.220 
fine now how can you really test that

slamming<00:04:17.039> the<00:04:17.190> phone<00:04:17.370> on<00:04:17.579> your<00:04:17.609> hand

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
slamming the phone on your hand

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.319 
slamming the phone on your hand
slamming<00:04:19.470> is<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.769> harsh<00:04:20.310> word<00:04:20.579> for<00:04:20.910> your<00:04:21.060> phone

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
slamming is a harsh word for your phone

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.300 
slamming is a harsh word for your phone
but<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:23.370> know<00:04:23.520> what<00:04:23.699> I<00:04:23.729> mean

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
but you know what I mean

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.939 
but you know what I mean
before<00:04:26.310> i<00:04:26.580> padded<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.449> sometimes<00:04:28.440> I<00:04:28.620> will<00:04:28.740> just

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
before i padded it sometimes I will just

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.740 
before i padded it sometimes I will just
put<00:04:29.550> it<00:04:29.580> down<00:04:29.820> like<00:04:30.090> this<00:04:30.240> and<00:04:30.419> the<00:04:30.539> phone

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
put it down like this and the phone

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.320 
put it down like this and the phone
would<00:04:30.960> restart<00:04:31.410> however<00:04:32.310> now<00:04:32.520> we<00:04:32.580> see<00:04:33.060> that

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
would restart however now we see that

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.260 
would restart however now we see that
the<00:04:33.900> double<00:04:34.199> tape<00:04:34.410> that<00:04:34.620> we<00:04:34.740> installed<00:04:35.270> is

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
the double tape that we installed is

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.080 
the double tape that we installed is
working<00:04:36.810> pretty<00:04:37.020> well<00:04:37.349> and<00:04:37.560> we<00:04:38.460> don't<00:04:38.669> have<00:04:38.880> to

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
working pretty well and we don't have to

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.770 
working pretty well and we don't have to
worry<00:04:39.300> about<00:04:39.419> it<00:04:40.099> restarting<00:04:41.099> all<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.340> time

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
worry about it restarting all the time

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.180 
worry about it restarting all the time
well<00:04:42.780> until<00:04:43.169> my<00:04:43.199> next<00:04:43.440> video
