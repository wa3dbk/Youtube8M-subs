 between siberia and japan what makes these 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.650
 cats are the greatest masters of survival 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.199
 kuril bobtail is highly regarded 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.210
 island people for being great 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.730
 mouse catch 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.110

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.289
 highly appreciated these cats throughout 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.829
 more than 200 years old but now their secret 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.140
 opened up 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.510
 over the past 20 years they have acquired 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.760
 very popular in Russia and steel 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.409
 one of the most widely known breeds 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.209
 but in America there are still very few of them 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.749
 of reasons because Kuril bobtails 

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:10.920
 give less offspring than other cats 

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:14.719
 the Kuril Islands far to the same these 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.799

 ordinary homemade shorthair 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.179
 cats can have four or five litters 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.749
 a year and when it comes to parenting 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.029
 offspring 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:26.969

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:28.409
 from the total weight male Kuril 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:31.979
 bobtail takes on the same 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.630
 responsibility like the female but the most 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.659
 wonderful in these ears short 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.669
 each tail has a unique 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.759
 shape like fingerprints 

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:43.049
 short tail is natural 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.560
 severe genetic trait is not 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.759
 defect 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:52.829
 and just the tail feature can have 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.659
 length from 2 to 10 vertebrae due 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.090

 little females up to five and a half with 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.179

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:06.179

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.710
 red to gray in red stripes are 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.700

 Can't wait to have a kitten, Mr. Bogey 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.270
 makes such a strong impression on 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.880
 customers are destro serov what they want 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.760

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.470
 desire to take it myself but mr miyagi 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.040

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.730
 including dogs of the family without Russia 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.660
 kurilian bobtails and behavior 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:41.150
 resemble dogs it means that mr 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.520
 bogey fits perfectly into the company 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.050
 when the whole family goes for a walk but 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.050
 as soon as he heard the chipmunk in the forest 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.910
 it wakes up a wild cat and dogs 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.650
 meanwhile doing their dog 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.960
 chores and when the time comes 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.270
 come home mr bogey comes 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.130
 the last in the end any cat 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.210
 who lives with four dogs need 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.210
 time to take care of yourself 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.310
 Kurilian bobtails are easy enough 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.140
 adapt to life in any home and 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.780
 as a breed that arose naturally 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.720
 these are strong healthy cats that can 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.280
 live for 15 or 20 years care for them 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.330
 easy 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.640
 despite the wild view of the Kuril 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.070
 bobtail his wool to the touch is soft and 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.450
 smooth enough to comb it once in 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.970
 week and if necessary 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:31.650
 bathe with cat shampoo so will they 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.800
 they are good pets for 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.440
 family yes if the family needs a playful cat 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.070
 and so the whole Kuril bobtail 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.900
 healthy breed without any problems 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.090
 just looking after them is enough 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.280
 comb them once or twice a week 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.910
 and they are well suited for families with children 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.910
 or dogs
