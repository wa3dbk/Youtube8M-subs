00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
o'neill reactor series wetsuits they're

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.270 
o'neill reactor series wetsuits they're
actually<00:00:05.910> made<00:00:06.210> for<00:00:06.540> women<00:00:06.839> men's<00:00:07.290> as<00:00:07.649> well<00:00:08.010> as

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
actually made for women men's as well as

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.669 
actually made for women men's as well as
children<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.540> constructions<00:00:10.200> identical

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
children the constructions identical

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.070 
children the constructions identical
throughout<00:00:11.219> all<00:00:11.460> three<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.090> it's<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.780> two

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
throughout all three and it's a two

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.410 
throughout all three and it's a two
millimeter<00:00:13.590> neoprene<00:00:14.429> throughout<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
millimeter neoprene throughout the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.840 
millimeter neoprene throughout the
entire<00:00:15.780> wetsuit<00:00:16.320> design<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:17.430> let's<00:00:17.670> take<00:00:17.789> a

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
entire wetsuit design so let's take a

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.859 
entire wetsuit design so let's take a
look<00:00:18.060> at<00:00:18.119> what<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.359> get<00:00:18.510> for<00:00:18.720> your<00:00:18.810> money

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
look at what you get for your money

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.870 
look at what you get for your money
first<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.800> all<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:19.920> get<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.130> warm<00:00:20.400> water<00:00:20.609> wet

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
first of all you get a warm water wet

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.420 
first of all you get a warm water wet
suit<00:00:21.150> with<00:00:21.720> flat<00:00:21.750> lock<00:00:22.380> seams<00:00:22.410> which<00:00:23.160> means

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
suit with flat lock seams which means

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.220 
suit with flat lock seams which means
the<00:00:23.640> stitch<00:00:23.910> actually<00:00:24.359> penetrates<00:00:24.869> all<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
the stitch actually penetrates all the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.320 
the stitch actually penetrates all the
way<00:00:25.320> through<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.830> neoprene<00:00:26.460> creating<00:00:27.240> a

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
way through the neoprene creating a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.970 
way through the neoprene creating a
breathable<00:00:27.720> scene<00:00:28.109> which<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.710> great<00:00:28.949> for

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
breathable scene which is great for

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.250 
breathable scene which is great for
warmer<00:00:29.490> conditions<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.779> front<00:00:31.050> you

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
warmer conditions on the front you

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.590 
warmer conditions on the front you
actually<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:32.070> mesh<00:00:32.460> skin<00:00:32.730> material<00:00:32.969> which

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
actually have a mesh skin material which

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.510 
actually have a mesh skin material which
is<00:00:33.630> both<00:00:33.899> wind<00:00:34.260> resistant<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.920> water

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
is both wind resistant and water

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.310 
is both wind resistant and water
resistant<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.540> helps<00:00:36.780> keep<00:00:36.960> your<00:00:37.110> core

also<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.020> back<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.440> wetsuit<00:00:41.450> what

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
also on the back of the wetsuit what

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.549 
also on the back of the wetsuit what
you'll<00:00:42.600> also<00:00:42.780> see<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> nice

along the mid back allows for you to get

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.490 
along the mid back allows for you to get
in<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.860> out<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:49.950> what's<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> lot<00:00:50.730> easier

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
in and out of what's it a lot easier

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.569 
in and out of what's it a lot easier
what<00:00:52.500> we're<00:00:52.649> going<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.860> see<00:00:53.010> here<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> nice

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
what we're going to see here is a nice

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.389 
what we're going to see here is a nice
little<00:00:53.850> hidden<00:00:54.210> key<00:00:54.539> pocket<00:00:54.570> area<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.500> up<00:00:56.250> at

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
little hidden key pocket area and up at

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.040 
little hidden key pocket area and up at
the<00:00:56.520> neck<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.180> applied<00:00:57.570> skin<00:00:57.899> material

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the neck we have applied skin material

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.709 
the neck we have applied skin material
it<00:00:58.590> helps<00:00:58.829> prevent<00:00:59.160> flushing<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.850> flushing

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
it helps prevent flushing and flushing

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.180 
it helps prevent flushing and flushing
is<00:01:00.870> when<00:01:01.050> too<00:01:01.170> much<00:01:01.289> water<00:01:01.530> comes<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.100> out

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
is when too much water comes in and out

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.130 
is when too much water comes in and out
of<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.370> wetsuit<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:02.969> doesn't<00:01:03.600> keep<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.870> warm

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
of the wetsuit and doesn't keep you warm

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.170 
of the wetsuit and doesn't keep you warm
so<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.890> actually<00:01:05.100> makes<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.760> seal<00:01:06.000> between

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
so this actually makes a seal between

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.820 
so this actually makes a seal between
your<00:01:06.450> skin<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.020> glyde<00:01:07.260> skin<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.740> what

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
your skin and the glyde skin and what

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.070 
your skin and the glyde skin and what
you<00:01:07.920> also<00:01:07.950> notice<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> reactor<00:01:09.030> here<00:01:09.420> down

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
you also notice in the reactor here down

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.000 
you also notice in the reactor here down
at<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> leg<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.280> nice<00:01:11.610> roll<00:01:12.030> skin<00:01:13.010> neoprene

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
at the leg is a nice roll skin neoprene

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.730 
at the leg is a nice roll skin neoprene
a<00:01:14.340> glide<00:01:14.820> skin<00:01:15.119> that's<00:01:15.420> rolled<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.350> actually

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
a glide skin that's rolled that actually

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.289 
a glide skin that's rolled that actually
also<00:01:16.920> does<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.310> same<00:01:17.430> thing<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.970> creates<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
also does the same thing it creates a

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.410 
also does the same thing it creates a
seal<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.900> your<00:01:19.439> upper<00:01:20.040> thigh<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.970> help<00:01:21.180> prevent

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
seal on your upper thigh to help prevent

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.149 
seal on your upper thigh to help prevent
flushing<00:01:21.900> here<00:01:22.080> as<00:01:22.200> well<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.680> that's<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
flushing here as well and that's in the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.310 
flushing here as well and that's in the
adult<00:01:23.460> version<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:24.299> not<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.840> children's
