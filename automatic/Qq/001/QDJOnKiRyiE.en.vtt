00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.160
 United States as part of the Cold War after World War II 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.730
 and the Soviet Union began a great space competition. 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.430
 On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union was the size of a basketball ball. 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.790
 The first artificial satellite has sprung the Sputnik 1 into space and placed it in orbit. 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.230
 Sputnik 2, the first live-in-space dog of Layka. 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.200
 He also launched a number of innovations by sending his satellite into space. 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.200
 A technology has not yet been developed that would throw a satellite into space and bring it back to Earth 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.770
 Layka has died in space due to extreme temperature and stress. 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.770
 he offered humanity an opportunity to better understand the space. 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.270
 After all these events, his own technology is superior to any field in the United States 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.310
 most of them have been shocked and tried to 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.390
 it had failed and became a mockery of international media. 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.530
 In addition to the US to make a demonstration against the Soviet Union 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.549
 In 1958 he had thought to send a nuclear bomb to the Moon. But working on the project 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.770
 a physicist could again have bad consequences for the United States 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.689
 or a potential nuclear explosion on the Moon 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.729
 and the project was canceled. Then the space competition began 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.520
 10 years after the first day, mostly failure 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.319
 The United States, by developing its technology 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.009
 accelerated the Apollo project to realize its event. 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.539
 US has little knowledge about the Moon and the Soviet Union uses 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.990
 unlike vehicles, it needs tools to maneuver in space to approach the Moon 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.209
 hears a big problem with the influence of the American space race 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.400
 In an unbelievable speed, he would meet all his shortcomings and 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.209
 It was the first time he was able to step on the moon. Neil Armstrong, the first people to walk on the moon 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.390
 and Buzz Aldrin from the surface of the Moon, consisting of rock fragments and dust 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.310
 they learned that the Moon was at least 3 billion years old by taking samples, and 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.480
 there is never any sign of life in the Moon that is thought to be a planet. 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.470
 They have discovered a lot of new information. 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.520
 But some people, institutions, or authorities are about 385,000 from NASA 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.710
 never sent a spacecraft to the moon that was miles away and 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.260
 they claim to be completely fake or manned by a spacecraft in the moon orbit 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.930
 astronauts due to technology deficiencies 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.410
 and that NASA has never done so 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.590
 stated. These claims 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.540
 The fluctuation of the American flag in the Moon environment, where there is no atmosphere, because there is no atmosphere. 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.180
 The single light source on the moon's surface 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.900
 the objects in the photos NASA offers 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.690
 having shadows at different angles, illuminated by multiple light sources, 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.000
 From the surface of the moon the atmosphere of the stars can be seen even with the naked eye from the Earth 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.340
 there should be no more stars in the photos, 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.630
 Van Allen radiation generations found between Earth and Moon killed astronauts 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.040
 the spacecraft descending into the moon 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.420
 astronaut footprints 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.390
 After the Apollo projects between 1969-1972, NASA 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.040
 reluctance to leave and later on 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.220
 it is based on a number of misconceptions or oddities. 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.070
 To see more of NASA's answers to these claims, 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.870
 remember, I also told the United States plan to throw nuclear bombs to the Moon "The Most Powerful 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.160
 A video of "What Happens If We Throw the Nuclear Bomb in the Moon" and Michael Collins alone 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.910
 The title of "World's Lone Man" 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.119
 Don't forget to watch my video.
