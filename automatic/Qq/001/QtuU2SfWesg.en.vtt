00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.390 

all<00:00:18.480> right<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:18.810> again<00:00:18.929> we<00:00:19.230> got<00:00:19.349> to<00:00:19.740> mines<00:00:20.159> of

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
all right so again we got to mines of

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.419 
all right so again we got to mines of
cones<00:00:21.179> that<00:00:21.480> are<00:00:21.539> offset<00:00:22.019> to<00:00:22.199> each<00:00:22.289> other<00:00:22.529> so

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:23.429 
cones that are offset to each other so

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:24.979 
cones that are offset to each other so
that<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.789> second<00:00:24.210> line<00:00:24.300> here<00:00:24.599> that<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.810> horse

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:24.989 
that the second line here that the horse

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.079 
that the second line here that the horse
is<00:00:25.079> going<00:00:25.230> around<00:00:25.409> is<00:00:25.919> actually<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.699> line<00:00:26.909> with

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:27.089 
is going around is actually in line with

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.389 
is going around is actually in line with
the<00:00:27.179> center<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.989> first<00:00:28.259> line<00:00:28.649> the<00:00:29.189> two

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:29.399 
the center of the first line the two

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.060 
the center of the first line the two
cones<00:00:29.669> so<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.119> get<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.269> zigzag<00:00:30.689> effect

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
cones so that you get a zigzag effect

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.410 
cones so that you get a zigzag effect
this<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.130> exercise<00:00:32.850> here<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.149> working<00:00:33.329> on

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
this this exercise here is working on

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.910 
this this exercise here is working on
shoulder<00:00:33.840> control<00:00:34.199> having<00:00:34.379> the<00:00:34.469> horse<00:00:34.620> follow

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
shoulder control having the horse follow

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.560 
shoulder control having the horse follow
his<00:00:35.219> nose<00:00:35.250> have<00:00:35.730> his<00:00:35.850> right<00:00:36.059> shoulder<00:00:36.239> go<00:00:36.510> to

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
his nose have his right shoulder go to

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.479 
his nose have his right shoulder go to
the<00:00:36.719> right<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.410> his<00:00:37.559> his<00:00:38.280> right

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
the right and have his his right

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.790 
the right and have his his right
shoulder<00:00:38.670> go<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.329> left<00:00:39.600> all<00:00:40.500> right<00:00:40.620> so

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
shoulder go to the left all right so

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.770 
shoulder go to the left all right so
we're<00:00:40.949> working<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.399> right<00:00:41.640> rein<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
we're working that right rein the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.200 
we're working that right rein the
control<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.199> that<00:00:43.410> right<00:00:43.679> shoulder<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.489> go<00:00:44.640> to

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
control of that right shoulder to go to

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.090 
control of that right shoulder to go to
go<00:00:45.629> here<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.230> go<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> right

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
go here to go to the right

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.479 
go here to go to the right
follow<00:00:48.089> the<00:00:48.239> nose<00:00:48.449> and<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:49.800> pick<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.309> go<00:00:50.429> to

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
follow the nose and to pick up and go to

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.700 
follow the nose and to pick up and go to
the<00:00:50.550> left<00:00:50.760> now<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.629> horse<00:00:51.929> slows<00:00:52.140> down<00:00:52.379> from

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
the left now the horse slows down from

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.459 
the left now the horse slows down from
the<00:00:52.890> trot<00:00:53.489> that's<00:00:53.879> fine<00:00:54.179> two<00:00:54.989> things<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.350> can

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
the trot that's fine two things you can

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.349 
the trot that's fine two things you can
do<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:55.980> open<00:00:56.339> it<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:56.550> make<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.999> circles

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
do you can open it up make the circles

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.139 
do you can open it up make the circles
bigger<00:00:58.010> give<00:00:59.010> him<00:00:59.160> more<00:00:59.370> room<00:00:59.550> or<00:00:59.820> let<00:00:59.969> him

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
bigger give him more room or let him

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.939 
bigger give him more room or let him
break<00:01:00.390> down<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.809> walk<00:01:01.050> until<00:01:01.469> he<00:01:01.649> gets

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
break down to the walk until he gets

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.939 
break down to the walk until he gets
more<00:01:02.129> solid<00:01:02.640> okay<00:01:03.570> because<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.739> is

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
more solid okay because this is this is

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.530 
more solid okay because this is this is
really<00:01:05.190> hard<00:01:05.489> work<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.940> don't<00:01:06.030> want<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.300> start

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
really hard work you don't want to start

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.810 
really hard work you don't want to start
out<00:01:06.660> on<00:01:06.870> this<00:01:07.070> exercise<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.250> want<00:01:08.370> to<00:01:08.460> work<00:01:08.670> on

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
out on this exercise you want to work on

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.640 
out on this exercise you want to work on
those<00:01:09.030> shoulders<00:01:09.450> strengthen<00:01:10.050> that<00:01:10.140> horse<00:01:10.410> up

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
those shoulders strengthen that horse up

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.890 
those shoulders strengthen that horse up
and<00:01:11.030> strengthen<00:01:12.030> those<00:01:12.300> shoulders<00:01:12.660> of<00:01:12.780> this

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
and strengthen those shoulders of this

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.820 
and strengthen those shoulders of this
is<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.350> hard<00:01:13.560> work

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
is this is hard work

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.620 
is this is hard work
a<00:01:14.130> lot<00:01:14.370> of<00:01:14.400> shoulder<00:01:14.670> work<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.300> this<00:01:15.450> will

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
a lot of shoulder work like this will

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.370 
a lot of shoulder work like this will
storm<00:01:15.870> up<00:01:16.520> right<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:17.940> you<00:01:18.120> go<00:01:18.930> through<00:01:19.170> one

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
storm up right and as you go through one

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.690 
storm up right and as you go through one
way<00:01:19.530> then<00:01:19.740> when<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.920> come<00:01:20.130> back<00:01:20.280> you'll<00:01:20.550> go

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
way then when you come back you'll go

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.810 
way then when you come back you'll go
through<00:01:20.730> on<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> other<00:01:21.210> rein<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:23.430> work<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
through on the other rein and work the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.660 
through on the other rein and work the
shoulder<00:01:24.120> off<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.300> other<00:01:24.630> rein

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
shoulder off the other rein

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.090 
shoulder off the other rein
so<00:01:26.670> again<00:01:26.940> if<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.210> horse<00:01:27.420> slows<00:01:27.660> way<00:01:27.900> down<00:01:28.100> you

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
so again if the horse slows way down you

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.430 
so again if the horse slows way down you
need<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.280> open<00:01:29.460> up<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> circles<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.510> priority

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
need to open up the circles the priority

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.200 
need to open up the circles the priority
though<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:31.950> he<00:01:32.400> softened<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:33.060> bit

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
though is that he softened to the bit

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.020 
though is that he softened to the bit
drop<00:01:34.050> his<00:01:34.260> nose<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.400> want<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.670> shoulders

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
drop his nose then we want the shoulders

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.420 
drop his nose then we want the shoulders
to<00:01:36.180> move<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.410> know<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.620> patterns<00:01:38.010> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
to move so you know the patterns the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.180 
to move so you know the patterns the
serpentine<00:01:39.420> exercises<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.290> teach<00:01:40.710> us<00:01:40.980> to

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
serpentine exercises just teach us to

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.090 
serpentine exercises just teach us to
ride<00:01:41.370> specific<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.810> if<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> horse<00:01:43.380> can't<00:01:43.740> do

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
ride specific so if the horse can't do

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.770 
ride specific so if the horse can't do
the<00:01:44.250> pattern<00:01:44.670> then<00:01:45.090> take<00:01:45.330> them<00:01:45.480> off<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
the pattern then take them off the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.110 
the pattern then take them off the
pattern<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.620> work<00:01:47.010> on<00:01:47.160> the<00:01:47.280> issue<00:01:47.580> and<00:01:48.000> then

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
pattern and work on the issue and then

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.240 
pattern and work on the issue and then
bring<00:01:48.300> them<00:01:48.390> back<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> pattern<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.920> here

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
bring them back to the pattern so here

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.710 
bring them back to the pattern so here
you<00:01:50.430> know<00:01:50.520> I'm<00:01:50.610> letting<00:01:50.730> the<00:01:50.940> horse<00:01:51.150> walk<00:01:51.420> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
you know I'm letting the horse walk the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.330 
you know I'm letting the horse walk the
trot<00:01:51.930> was<00:01:52.110> too<00:01:52.290> much<00:01:52.440> for<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.770> horse<00:01:53.040> at<00:01:53.220> that

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
trot was too much for this horse at that

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.250 
trot was too much for this horse at that
point<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.700> time<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.600> we're<00:01:54.750> gonna<00:01:54.840> go<00:01:55.050> to<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
point in time so we're gonna go to the

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.620 
point in time so we're gonna go to the

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
the back end is slowing way down we

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.790 
the back end is slowing way down we
don't<00:02:06.090> want<00:02:06.330> that<00:02:06.480> back<00:02:06.690> end<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.050> ever<00:02:07.200> stop<00:02:07.590> in

this<00:02:07.890> exercise<00:02:08.869> we're<00:02:09.869> aiming<00:02:10.080> for<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
this exercise we're aiming for the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.820 
this exercise we're aiming for the
center<00:02:10.800> line<00:02:11.130> so<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:12.210> horse<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:13.410> know<00:02:13.530> that's

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
center line so the horse you know that's

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.660 
center line so the horse you know that's
the<00:02:14.010> goal

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
the goal

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.440 
the goal
but<00:02:15.420> if<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.630> find<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.080> horse<00:02:16.290> is

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
but if you find that the horse is

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.210 
but if you find that the horse is
stopping<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.660> backend<00:02:19.110> then<00:02:19.410> open<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:19.860> up<00:02:19.980> for

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
stopping the backend then open it up for

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.020 
stopping the backend then open it up for
him<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.640> keep<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.120> forward<00:02:21.480> motion<00:02:21.660> going
