but<00:01:28.900> the<00:01:29.900> main<00:01:30.080> thing<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.290> look<00:01:30.470> at<00:01:30.590> is<00:01:30.650> the

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
but the main thing to look at is the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.310 
but the main thing to look at is the
conspiracy<00:01:31.790> theory<00:01:32.210> sight<00:01:32.510> of<00:01:32.720> all<00:01:32.810> that<00:01:33.080> and

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
conspiracy theory sight of all that and

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.280 
conspiracy theory sight of all that and

obviously this is zombies mrs. trioxide
obviously<00:01:36.710> going<00:01:36.860> to<00:01:36.920> be<00:01:37.040> focusing<00:01:37.220> mainly<00:01:37.640> on

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
obviously going to be focusing mainly on

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.960 
obviously going to be focusing mainly on
that<00:01:38.240> part<00:01:38.570> of<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.890> heart<00:01:40.070> research<00:01:40.460> center

get<00:01:54.050> the<00:01:54.440> ability<00:01:54.650> to<00:01:55.100> manipulate<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:56.860> you

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
get the ability to manipulate the you

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.980 
get the ability to manipulate the you
know<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.070> weather<00:01:58.280> they<00:01:58.610> could<00:01:58.990> essentially

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
know the weather they could essentially

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.040 
know the weather they could essentially
just<00:02:00.590> do<00:02:01.370> so<00:02:02.030> much<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.450> mean<00:02:02.540> they<00:02:02.690> could<00:02:02.840> put

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
just do so much I mean they could put

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.110 
just do so much I mean they could put
rain<00:02:03.770> in<00:02:04.010> Africa<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:04.580> then<00:02:04.670> they<00:02:04.760> could<00:02:04.940> get

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
rain in Africa and then they could get

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.390 
rain in Africa and then they could get
them<00:02:05.540> to<00:02:05.570> have<00:02:06.140> water<00:02:06.410> and<00:02:06.710> then<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:07.010> great

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
them to have water and then that great

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.100 
them to have water and then that great
or<00:02:07.730> what<00:02:07.790> they<00:02:08.300> could<00:02:08.450> do<00:02:08.539> they<00:02:08.569> cause<00:02:09.080> a

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
or what they could do they cause a

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.199 
or what they could do they cause a
thunderstorm<00:02:09.739> over<00:02:09.890> Russia<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:10.789> take<00:02:11.030> out

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
thunderstorm over Russia and take out

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.910 
thunderstorm over Russia and take out
all<00:02:11.360> of<00:02:11.390> their<00:02:11.690> electronics<00:02:12.319> and<00:02:12.500> then<00:02:12.620> launch

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
all of their electronics and then launch

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.960 
all of their electronics and then launch
a<00:02:13.069> full-scale<00:02:13.250> attack<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.030> take<00:02:14.180> over

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
a full-scale attack and take over

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.260 
a full-scale attack and take over
the<00:02:15.630> entire<00:02:15.900> world<00:02:16.170> essentially<00:02:17.000> so<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.060> know

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
the entire world essentially so you know

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.160 
the entire world essentially so you know
that<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.630> what<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:20.270> main<00:02:21.270> idea<00:02:21.510> about<00:02:22.020> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
that is what the main idea about the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.780 
that is what the main idea about the
harp<00:02:22.350> Research<00:02:22.710> Center<00:02:23.010> actually<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.520> about

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
harp Research Center actually is about

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.790 
harp Research Center actually is about
and<00:02:24.090> then<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.750> look<00:02:24.900> at<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.050> avogadro<00:02:25.650> and

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
and then you look at the avogadro and

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.440 
and then you look at the avogadro and
the<00:02:25.860> other<00:02:26.040> gadget<00:02:26.490> is<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.610> man<00:02:26.940> made<00:02:26.970> out<00:02:27.300> of

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
the other gadget is a man made out of

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.630 
the other gadget is a man made out of
lightning<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.080> that's<00:02:28.800> why<00:02:29.010> he<00:02:29.160> goes<00:02:29.310> up<00:02:29.490> into

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
lightning and that's why he goes up into

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.220 
lightning and that's why he goes up into
the<00:02:29.790> sky<00:02:29.970> knee<00:02:30.030> causes<00:02:30.510> big<00:02:30.630> lightnings<00:02:31.050> on

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
the sky knee causes big lightnings on

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.850 
the sky knee causes big lightnings on
that<00:02:31.530> guy<00:02:31.860> is<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:33.270> work<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.200> harp<00:02:34.380> Research

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
that guy is the work the harp Research

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.560 
that guy is the work the harp Research
Center<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.600> it<00:02:36.600> is<00:02:36.810> not<00:02:37.550> Arlington<00:02:38.570> Christ's

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
Center and it is not Arlington Christ's

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.770 
Center and it is not Arlington Christ's
sake<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.320> is<00:02:40.380> not<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:41.070> mean<00:02:41.910> there's<00:02:42.420> been<00:02:42.510> so

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
sake it is not I mean there's been so

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.600 
sake it is not I mean there's been so
many<00:02:42.900> kinds<00:02:43.350> about<00:02:43.560> this<00:02:43.770> but<00:02:43.980> all<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.400> out

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
many kinds about this but all it out

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.260 
many kinds about this but all it out
Vegard<00:02:45.000> rose<00:02:45.210> or<00:02:45.360> anyone<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:45.840> we<00:02:46.080> know<00:02:46.110> aka

Vegard rose or anyone that we know aka

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.540 
Vegard rose or anyone that we know aka
arlington<00:02:48.270> no<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:49.200> isn't<00:02:49.560> just<00:02:50.100> because<00:02:50.430> he

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
arlington no it isn't just because he

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.340 
arlington no it isn't just because he
goes<00:02:50.700> into<00:02:50.850> an<00:02:51.000> electric<00:02:51.390> do<00:02:51.510> TV<00:02:51.690> even<00:02:52.050> if<00:02:52.200> you

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
goes into an electric do TV even if you

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.350 
goes into an electric do TV even if you
go<00:02:52.500> into<00:02:52.680> afterlife<00:02:53.070> mode<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:54.120> look<00:02:54.270> at

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
go into afterlife mode and you look at

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.670 
go into afterlife mode and you look at
the<00:02:54.450> guy<00:02:54.570> in<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.780> flight<00:02:55.050> mode<00:02:55.260> looks<00:02:55.500> nothing

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
the guy in a flight mode looks nothing

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.710 
the guy in a flight mode looks nothing
like<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.040> avocado<00:02:56.430> so<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.820> doesn't<00:02:57.240> do

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
like the avocado so it doesn't do

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.660 
like the avocado so it doesn't do
anything<00:02:58.080> no<00:02:58.290> that's<00:02:58.650> not<00:02:58.800> how<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:58.980> works<00:02:59.310> and

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
anything no that's not how it works and

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.880 
anything no that's not how it works and
the<00:03:00.630> alligator<00:03:00.990> is<00:03:01.080> not<00:03:01.260> aren't<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.709> two

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
the alligator is not aren't and two

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.220 
the alligator is not aren't and two
completely<00:03:02.340> separate<00:03:02.760> entities<00:03:03.270> no<00:03:03.990> your

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
completely separate entities no your

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.410 
completely separate entities no your
correlation<00:03:04.980> at<00:03:05.310> all<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:05.910> that's<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.180> end<00:03:06.300> of

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
correlation at all and that's the end of

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.720 
correlation at all and that's the end of
it<00:03:06.590> but<00:03:07.590> then<00:03:07.709> there's<00:03:07.860> also<00:03:07.950> something<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.520> go

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
it but then there's also something to go

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.590 
it but then there's also something to go
into<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.090> bone<00:03:10.190> malton<00:03:11.190> as<00:03:11.459> well<00:03:11.790> who<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.300> the

exactly where he came from and most

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.449 
exactly where he came from and most
people<00:03:27.350> used<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.440> think<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:28.800> Arlington

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
people used to think that Arlington

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.000 
people used to think that Arlington
worked<00:03:29.970> at<00:03:30.360> area<00:03:30.690> 51<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.350> he<00:03:31.440> was<00:03:31.590> inside<00:03:31.980> of

that bunker in nuketown but that is

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.190 
that bunker in nuketown but that is
actually<00:03:34.769> not<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.250> case<00:03:35.280> that<00:03:35.489> is<00:03:35.850> not

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
actually not the case that is not

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.110 
actually not the case that is not
anything<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.380> do<00:03:37.500> with<00:03:37.620> molten<00:03:38.010> what<00:03:38.489> it<00:03:38.640> is<00:03:38.820> is

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
anything to do with molten what it is is

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.390 
anything to do with molten what it is is
that<00:03:39.300> that<00:03:39.450> is<00:03:39.600> supposed<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:40.200> be<00:03:40.980> setting<00:03:41.340> a

takes<00:05:03.930> place<00:05:04.140> in<00:05:04.380> Texas<00:05:04.980> which<00:05:05.310> is<00:05:05.520> a<00:05:05.790> very

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
takes place in Texas which is a very

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.110 
takes place in Texas which is a very
very<00:05:06.600> far<00:05:06.780> away<00:05:06.920> I<00:05:07.920> said<00:05:08.460> then<00:05:08.580> we'd<00:05:08.790> work<00:05:08.940> very

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
very far away I said then we'd work very

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.230 
very far away I said then we'd work very
very<00:05:09.150> far<00:05:09.480> away<00:05:09.680> but<00:05:10.680> yeah<00:05:10.920> that<00:05:11.130> is<00:05:11.240> most

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
very far away but yeah that is most

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.570 
very far away but yeah that is most
likely<00:05:12.690> the<00:05:12.960> origin<00:05:13.500> of<00:05:13.590> molten<00:05:14.070> is<00:05:14.220> where<00:05:14.370> he

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
likely the origin of molten is where he

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.910 
likely the origin of molten is where he
actually<00:05:14.670> came<00:05:15.630> from<00:05:15.690> is<00:05:16.110> that<00:05:16.320> he<00:05:16.620> came<00:05:16.770> from

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
actually came from is that he came from

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.520 
actually came from is that he came from
the<00:05:17.130> heart<00:05:17.310> research<00:05:17.820> center<00:05:18.390> he<00:05:19.320> probably

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
the heart research center he probably

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.240 
the heart research center he probably
didn't<00:05:19.860> really<00:05:21.320> get<00:05:22.320> too<00:05:22.590> high<00:05:22.830> up<00:05:23.040> in<00:05:23.220> the

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
didn't really get too high up in the

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.190 
didn't really get too high up in the
ranks<00:05:23.610> because<00:05:23.730> obviously<00:05:24.150> from<00:05:24.630> just

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
ranks because obviously from just

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.750 
ranks because obviously from just
looking<00:05:25.350> at<00:05:25.590> him<00:05:25.740> he<00:05:25.860> probably<00:05:26.040> didn't<00:05:26.490> change

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
looking at him he probably didn't change

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.360 
looking at him he probably didn't change
clothes<00:05:27.120> like<00:05:28.080> from<00:05:28.320> the<00:05:28.560> apocalypse<00:05:29.250> knee

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
clothes like from the apocalypse knee

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.030 
clothes like from the apocalypse knee
was<00:05:29.490> probably<00:05:29.760> raided<00:05:30.210> while<00:05:30.360> doing<00:05:30.540> some

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
was probably raided while doing some

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.680 
was probably raided while doing some
tests<00:05:32.040> of<00:05:32.130> some<00:05:32.310> kind<00:05:32.790> but<00:05:33.120> I<00:05:33.150> don't<00:05:33.510> think

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
tests of some kind but I don't think

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.390 
tests of some kind but I don't think
that<00:05:33.840> he<00:05:33.960> was<00:05:34.080> particularly<00:05:34.380> high<00:05:34.650> ranking<00:05:35.250> I

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
that he was particularly high ranking I

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.910 
that he was particularly high ranking I
think<00:05:35.640> that<00:05:35.790> he<00:05:36.260> obviously<00:05:37.260> was<00:05:37.560> like<00:05:37.710> one<00:05:37.890> of

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
think that he obviously was like one of

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.460 
think that he obviously was like one of
the<00:05:38.070> guys<00:05:38.220> which<00:05:38.520> were<00:05:39.200> more<00:05:40.200> intelligent

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
the guys which were more intelligent

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.530 
the guys which were more intelligent
than<00:05:40.830> even<00:05:41.280> high-ranking<00:05:41.490> officials<00:05:42.330> at<00:05:42.510> the

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
than even high-ranking officials at the

scientist<00:05:59.880> kind<00:06:00.180> of<00:06:00.330> guy<00:06:01.280> but<00:06:02.280> you<00:06:02.400> know<00:06:02.490> I

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550

scientist kind of guy but you know I
could<00:06:02.700> be<00:06:02.790> wrong<00:06:02.910> about<00:06:02.970> that<00:06:03.210> doesn't<00:06:03.540> really

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
could be wrong about that doesn't really

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.950 
could be wrong about that doesn't really
matter<00:06:03.840> but<00:06:04.170> um<00:06:05.000> those<00:06:06.000> uh<00:06:06.030> that's<00:06:06.630> the<00:06:06.810> most

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
matter but um those uh that's the most

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.560 
matter but um those uh that's the most
likely<00:06:07.380> the<00:06:07.950> placement<00:06:08.310> Moulton<00:06:08.610> came<00:06:09.240> from

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
likely the placement Moulton came from

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.780 
likely the placement Moulton came from
the<00:06:09.990> avogadro<00:06:10.560> operation<00:06:11.010> center<00:06:11.370> and<00:06:11.550> the

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
the avogadro operation center and the

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.790 
the avogadro operation center and the
fact<00:06:11.970> there's<00:06:12.600> Farkle<00:06:13.110> to<00:06:13.230> do<00:06:13.350> of<00:06:13.440> anything

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
fact there's Farkle to do of anything

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.400 
fact there's Farkle to do of anything
cuz<00:06:13.920> molded<00:06:14.280> edits<00:06:14.610> is<00:06:14.880> its<00:06:15.210> own<00:06:15.410> secularized

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
cuz molded edits is its own secularized

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.740 
cuz molded edits is its own secularized
