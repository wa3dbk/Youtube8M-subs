we're<00:03:47.090> trying<00:03:47.269> out<00:03:47.510> is<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:48.139> jetbeam<00:03:49.040> jet

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
we're trying out is the jetbeam jet

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.159 
we're trying out is the jetbeam jet
three<00:03:49.760> military<00:03:50.269> jet<00:03:50.810> 3m<00:03:51.230> on<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:53.049> mossberg<00:03:54.049> 12

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
three military jet 3m on the mossberg 12

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.830 
three military jet 3m on the mossberg 12
gauge<00:03:54.650> pump<00:03:54.849> we'll<00:03:55.849> see<00:03:56.030> how<00:03:56.060> this<00:03:56.329> one<00:03:56.540> fares

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
gauge pump we'll see how this one fares

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:05.550 
gauge pump we'll see how this one fares
with<00:03:57.169> the<00:03:57.290> with<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.069> recoil<00:03:58.519> weapons<00:03:59.389> hot

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.570 

like<00:04:06.560> no<00:04:06.740> problem<00:04:07.750> all<00:04:08.750> right<00:04:08.960> a<00:04:09.580> previous

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
like no problem all right a previous

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.400 
like no problem all right a previous
test<00:04:11.060> we've<00:04:11.270> only<00:04:11.420> been<00:04:11.630> shooting<00:04:11.960> off<00:04:12.080> one<00:04:12.290> at

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
test we've only been shooting off one at

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.130 
test we've only been shooting off one at
a<00:04:12.500> time<00:04:12.710> to<00:04:12.890> test<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.220> light<00:04:13.430> in<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:13.760> mount

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
a time to test the light in the mount

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.449 
a time to test the light in the mount
now<00:04:15.140> we're<00:04:15.290> going<00:04:15.440> to<00:04:15.500> do<00:04:15.650> an<00:04:15.740> extended<00:04:16.250> shot

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
now we're going to do an extended shot

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.420 
now we're going to do an extended shot
past<00:04:17.170> where<00:04:18.170> we're<00:04:18.320> going<00:04:18.440> to<00:04:18.530> shoot<00:04:18.799> seven

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
past where we're going to shoot seven

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.630 
past where we're going to shoot seven
shells<00:04:19.930> and<00:04:20.930> see<00:04:21.500> how<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.709> light<00:04:21.950> heads<00:04:22.310> up<00:04:22.460> on

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
shells and see how the light heads up on

00:04:22.640 --> 00:05:09.620 
shells and see how the light heads up on
that<00:04:26.980> with<00:04:27.980> the<00:04:28.100> top

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.470 

light's<00:05:10.630> not<00:05:10.960> changed<00:05:11.410> that<00:05:12.130> is<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.700> jet<00:05:12.970> 3m

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
light's not changed that is the jet 3m

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.650 
light's not changed that is the jet 3m
that<00:05:14.020> just<00:05:14.320> went<00:05:14.530> through<00:05:14.800> seven<00:05:15.790> rounds<00:05:16.420> with

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
that just went through seven rounds with

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:25.879 
that just went through seven rounds with
no<00:05:16.870> problem

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.949
