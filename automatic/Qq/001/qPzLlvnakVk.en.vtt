00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.820
 certainly these researchers 38 for a new video and today I 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.919
 so decided to show you to a super-cop cydia 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.919
 which output for 5 person practically saw 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.020
 but that's really great because nobody noticed anyone to present 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.010
 and I want to present to you that immediately it is therefore 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.950
 both shots the blocker 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.470
 e I tell you right now as a blocker it's a withdrawal so dia 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.130
 e 6% and that will block for 100 m 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.979
 either the calls from your contacts 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:47.240
 on calls to a number for 100 m 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.850
 number than it is calls co2 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.250
 so the calls knew it was better because m 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.800
 always m 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.900
 calls knew who's calling you constantly and who his government 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.400
 boring let's say so here's it 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.040
 nike what is good is that this trick cydia it is compatible with all 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.990
 versions from elsewhere 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.040
 e available at 99 cents surface on thirst for modenheim is free on 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.730
 some sources 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.120
 as everyone knows if you have other sources are free 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.120
 in version 3 points 6 created by navies 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.380
 2 hat to him 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.520
 so once we had it installed you leave cydia 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.150
 and so you click on the icon blockers 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.150
 so I'll show you right now 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.860
 first you have contact so here you can add a contact that for 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.080
 that he can no longer call you put the number 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.080
 for example you put 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.980
 here tonight you type the number tonight you click on the little blue plus 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.720
 I wanted to look in my contact 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.550
 I do not bring current 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.140
 you make a halt and that's it alone 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.299
 so what we type can not call you this number 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.520
 could you liked more at all 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.610
 so what's really great my opinion will fall on your email or 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.449
 maybe something like that 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:17.069
 then you've been historically kiki if you go to the history of 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.419
 your calls in fines I do not have any 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:23.529
 what delete them but in a year you have history and so that 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:25.469
 calls m 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.709
 blocked calls that reminded you and did not succeed 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:31.070
 and so it's unheard of 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.890
 then 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.189
 e actually pay attention 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.939
 here you do not touch it volunteer apps that you leave it soft if 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:38.829
 you want that 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.579
 I can call you 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.439
 then stop from the history 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.129
 you can see 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.480
 if you activate it you will not see the calls blocked calls that are you 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.359
 least who reminded you in the history 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.359
 block school so expensive if you check this box 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.089
 no one will have pleased you and I say more nobody 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:02.629
 mariton montaut on your e-mail or something 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.549
 so here is nobody 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.309
 then that I you 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:09.959
 offers you the cauchie directly 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.430
 blocked to edel but that's a box to block 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.959
 all calls to the private is hidden is blocked and all you 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:17.589
 want 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:22.269
 so here it is really super super super complicated it is very 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.369
 well created 

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.449
 but I advise you to tick this box of the hands 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:30.479
 so here you are for this video is that they are looking at 38% m I you 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:34.000
 say you can also subscribe to my bitch wore one ignores 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.760
