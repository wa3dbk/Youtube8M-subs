actually before I do that I need to wrap

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.350

up<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:39.100> brass<00:01:41.550> and<00:01:42.550> this<00:01:42.820> is<00:01:43.030> just<00:01:43.180> so<00:01:43.330> that

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
up the brass and this is just so that

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.300 
up the brass and this is just so that
the<00:01:43.600> glue<00:01:43.810> has<00:01:43.990> something<00:01:44.350> that<00:01:44.530> kind<00:01:45.070> of<00:01:45.100> grab

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
it's a it's a quick drying glue it

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:19.699 
it's a it's a quick drying glue it
really<00:01:58.300> does<00:01:58.479> dry<00:01:58.780> pretty<00:01:59.050> quickly

you see from the chart very well but you

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.450 
you see from the chart very well but you

know it goes all the way up to 12,000
grit<00:05:43.639> sandpaper<00:05:44.540> and<00:05:45.199> what<00:05:45.919> you<00:05:46.040> do<00:05:46.190> is<00:05:46.310> you

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
grit sandpaper and what you do is you

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.070 
grit sandpaper and what you do is you
use<00:05:46.639> these<00:05:46.820> pads<00:05:47.150> and<00:05:47.539> you<00:05:47.600> go<00:05:47.750> through<00:05:47.930> the

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
use these pads and you go through the

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.500 
use these pads and you go through the
colors<00:05:48.530> and<00:05:48.949> what's<00:05:49.910> great<00:05:50.060> about<00:05:50.150> this<00:05:50.449> is

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
colors and what's great about this is

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.330 
colors and what's great about this is
you<00:05:50.840> just<00:05:51.020> when<00:05:51.410> you're<00:05:51.530> done<00:05:51.680> you<00:05:51.949> just<00:05:51.979> wash

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
you just when you're done you just wash

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.670 
you just when you're done you just wash
them<00:05:52.520> off<00:05:52.699> let<00:05:53.300> them<00:05:53.419> dry<00:05:53.660> you<00:05:53.960> can<00:05:53.990> reuse<00:05:54.260> them

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
them off let them dry you can reuse them

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.960 
them off let them dry you can reuse them
and<00:05:54.800> so<00:05:54.919> you<00:05:55.100> just<00:05:55.250> sort<00:05:55.370> of<00:05:55.460> go<00:05:55.580> through<00:05:55.610> to

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
and so you just sort of go through to

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.120 
and so you just sort of go through to
the<00:05:56.060> colors<00:05:56.360> until<00:05:56.600> you<00:05:56.810> get<00:05:56.990> to<00:05:57.110> the<00:05:57.260> to<00:05:57.979> the

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
the colors until you get to the to the

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.850 
the colors until you get to the to the
grit<00:05:59.120> that<00:05:59.300> you<00:05:59.479> want<00:05:59.720> and<00:06:00.199> so<00:06:00.560> many<00:06:00.740> is<00:06:00.830> that

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
grit that you want and so many is that

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.450 
grit that you want and so many is that
that's<00:06:01.280> what<00:06:01.430> I<00:06:01.490> use<00:06:01.789> for<00:06:02.090> the<00:06:02.360> acrylic

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
that's what I use for the acrylic

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.040 
that's what I use for the acrylic
painting<00:06:04.460> it's<00:06:05.000> really<00:06:05.419> simple

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
painting it's really simple
