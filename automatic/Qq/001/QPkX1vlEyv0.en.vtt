00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.379

 Good. Let's go. I'm going to work at the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.640
 treatment . 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.070
 look is understanding this is a 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.220
 subject that likes to stay in the dark 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:17.580
 we are now the singer who finish using a 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.220
 politicization in cases is not known as 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.390
 evans to technologically 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.400
 technologically not even for this reason 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:32.370
 What are you doing there, boy? 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.280
 foner for me being a paranist 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.180
 who wants the car to say 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.770
 sync if you know how long 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.080
 take time to get this 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.630
 word six months with six attacks 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.760
 she funded cowell landmarks and on 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.640
 boyfriend in front only managed to 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.950
 However, after applying the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.500
 very well and it 's because I did not apply 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.650
 have to sync to see another 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.410
 time synchronize perhaps saw the 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.560
 facebook contacts and contacts for 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.380
 headphones sang on the iphone and yes it is explained 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.380
 profile appears on the profile screen 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.440
 that person using Facebook also 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.480
 synchronized again saw me 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.340
 I have to do yes, I have. 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.799
 Curious about how it was in the new 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.610
 I'm curious about a crisis I have. 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.590
 when I opened the site or when 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.380
 understanding this championship was an issue 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.960
 survival was essential. 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.570
 for me to sync and go four sucks 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.820
 the contacts with headsets with difficulties 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.400
 the fogging was then the important 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.500
 partner every time champion because magic 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.600
 some summary I'm just not going 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.080
 to bissau amount 2 is that we will have 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.610
 enrolled in the course I sat down and quite 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.709
 for talking about the company that 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.630
 I totally agree with the contract and I have 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.940
 a reasonable number of 104 players 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.930
 Stabilize when young faces cable 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.820
 in benfica hit comes in a lot I'm 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.739
 making my street more than two years in 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.590
 many resorts fact as there are 30 and such 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.540
 which I have never seen as the cleanest and 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.730
 I will never see this is the same channel 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.530
 because where I think it will be imaginary 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.230
 that no one has yet been able to convince 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.640
 correct and fair even if it was in fact 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.860
 Missing when I call Natal from 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.110
 ex-president at the time in the case of the post 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.300
 for example see was my example the 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.400
 simple call and the president was 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.620
 making even trained for example as 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.470
 this situation is cardozo sai does not leave 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.239
 to train, we do not train for a 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.760
 satisfactory proposal for the channel 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.530
 the musicians of wolfe were generated combine 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.930
 proof was with the head stuck after 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.400
 thank you, who made the final botafogo already 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.769
 gave error is at the time in how daughters 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.320
 I was there with the guys in time. 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:47.549
 The problems do not forget to try 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:50.590
 you that being something else is something else 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.470
 teaches you that it 's something else 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.150
 things 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.150
 with two outspoken bastos
