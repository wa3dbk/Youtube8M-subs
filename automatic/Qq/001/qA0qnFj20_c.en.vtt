00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.110 
look at that I really don't know what's
so<00:04:18.109> special<00:04:18.169> about<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:19.100> but<00:04:19.310> now<00:04:19.519> our<00:04:19.549> base<00:04:19.910> is

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
so special about it but now our base is

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:26.100 
so special about it but now our base is
green

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:34.170 

so<00:04:26.800> let's<00:04:27.240> plant<00:04:28.240> again<00:04:28.569> here<00:04:33.180> three

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
so let's plant again here three

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:41.920 
so let's plant again here three
factories<00:04:34.629> left

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.430 

and<00:04:42.979> I<00:04:43.979> do<00:04:44.160> believe<00:04:44.639> that<00:04:44.879> your<00:04:45.440> little

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.189 
and I do believe that your little
helicopter<00:04:47.250> dude<00:04:47.460> didn't<00:04:47.940> think<00:04:48.150> there<00:04:48.449> does

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
helicopter dude didn't think there does

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.939 
helicopter dude didn't think there does
not<00:04:49.590> have<00:04:50.449> like<00:04:51.449> a<00:04:51.479> health<00:04:51.990> bar<00:04:52.289> or<00:04:52.500> anything

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
importance

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.890 
importance

I<00:07:08.150> think<00:07:09.150> those<00:07:09.300> radar<00:07:09.629> things<00:07:10.169> help<00:07:10.710> the

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 
I think those radar things help the

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:15.019 
I think those radar things help the
enemy<00:07:11.099> to<00:07:11.610> figure<00:07:12.300> out<00:07:13.400> where<00:07:14.400> your<00:07:14.580> aircraft

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:15.029 
enemy to figure out where your aircraft

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:19.159 
enemy to figure out where your aircraft
carrier<00:07:15.569> is<00:07:17.449> so<00:07:18.449> if<00:07:18.539> you<00:07:18.659> manage<00:07:18.900> to<00:07:18.930> take

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:19.169 
carrier is so if you manage to take

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:23.450 
carrier is so if you manage to take
those<00:07:19.379> out<00:07:20.060> I'll<00:07:21.060> help<00:07:21.659> your<00:07:22.020> base<00:07:22.979> will<00:07:23.219> be<00:07:23.249> a

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:23.460 
those out I'll help your base will be a

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:32.650 
those out I'll help your base will be a
little<00:07:23.669> safer<00:07:25.490> yeah<00:07:26.490> ah<00:07:28.610> get<00:07:29.610> away<00:07:29.909> from<00:07:30.060> me

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:41.560 
damage not going as fast

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.879 
damage not going as fast
and<00:07:41.830> this<00:07:42.370> point<00:07:42.669> I'm<00:07:42.850> losing<00:07:43.389> control<00:07:43.889> I'm

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:44.889 
and this point I'm losing control I'm

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 
we've kind of proven the point of this

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.550 
we've kind of proven the point of this
game<00:08:04.880> so<00:08:05.880> I'm<00:08:06.150> fully<00:08:06.510> if<00:08:06.630> you<00:08:06.720> don't<00:08:06.900> know<00:08:07.110> and
