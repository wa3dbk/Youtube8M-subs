00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.300
 new video that as you are already seeing 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.300
 takes us back to modern 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.040
 warfare 3 to the arcade map in 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.869
 This team deathmatch 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.640
 accompanied by Mr. bloggers and the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.730
 show flow channel like it could not be 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.100
 from another in today's video I would like 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.170
 talk to you and ask you several things and 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.540
 know your opinion about it 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.739
 for that we will use the comments 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.110
 would like to leave in the comments 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.850
 with your opinions on the topics that 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.470
 I went to comment below for 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.530
 example 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.990
 how much do you want how much do you feel like 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.150
 go out gta 5 what comes next 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.910
 Tuesday 17 I can personally you 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.590
 say and I must recognize I'm like 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.130
 crazy because it comes to disconnect a 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.740
 little bit of the saga call of duty and power 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.480
 enjoy not that piece of the game that 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.150
 rockstars is preparing us you know 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.790
 always with these brutal mapping with 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.520
 a lot of surprises with a development 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.950
 in the stories surprising also 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.160
 this on this occasion in this gta 5 with 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.220
 three different protagonists could go 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.660
 changing protagonist I do not know I think that 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.190
 it's going to be something innovative I think it's going to 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.040
 be very funny I think it will be 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.680
 great and what I think is coolest 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.630
 It is still that the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.390
 the multiplayer service will not open 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.390
 until October 1 I do not think that 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.310
 will give us time to enjoy 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.330
 a lot of the game to be able to explore power 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.360
 discover and be able to see and share 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.040
 well with friends with everyone 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.660
 you, whatever we go 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.310
 hides finding and everything that 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.840
 let's discover what I'm sure 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.780
 that rockstar will have left us many 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.590
 pearls as you did in the previous gp 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.240
 although I must say that they were less 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.289
 but I also think that they are going to try 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.090
 Relive and remember your best best game 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.950
 that for my taste and in my opinion it was 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.330
 san andreas and I think that is what they are 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.200
 trying what they are going to try to do 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.540
 with this gta good of course prontito 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.280
 we will leave doubts next week 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.140
 we will see the returns on the same day if 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.390
 escort the day before I hope it's the 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.390
 day before so you can enjoy it a 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.549
 little bit sooner, the little trailer that 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.260
 came out yesterday of call of duty cause vale 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.390
 I would also like to know what you think of the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.150
 respect what you think of that 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.700
 new video that has released division and 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.810
 you know infinity ward is the one who does it 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.250
 fortunately this year its playability 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.319
 It is what has always excelled 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.850
 part of the technical realization fijaros 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.709
 in this detail that I never catch spears 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.720
 pe postponed putty I found a gun 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.880
 with spears pepos so to ricky town 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.320
 for me and well then what I would like 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.260
 know what you think, not me personally 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:05.610
 I was quite surprised is that start 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:09.930
 with that star wars halo moonraker at the most 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.700
 pure james bond 007 style and well then 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.400
 The truth is that I think they have already been 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.560
 see quite a few details of quality though 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.580
 they are cinematic but above all good 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.500
 well 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:25.530
 graphically of course standing out for 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.810
 above treyarch have also adopted 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.390
 certain trier details that level 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.980
 competitive level create classes and I 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.540
 it seems quite good because it is what 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.190
 I have always commented that bring the field 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.560
 of the definitive ideas take them to 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.210
 out and well then we will see again we see 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.500
 how it is developing to me 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.390
 personally I tell you I liked it 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.490
 quite the trailer let me see 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.490

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.620
