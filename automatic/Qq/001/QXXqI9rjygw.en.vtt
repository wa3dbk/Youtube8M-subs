00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
little over two years and one of the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.580 
little over two years and one of the
things<00:00:31.010> that<00:00:31.580> I<00:00:31.910> kind<00:00:32.510> of<00:00:32.629> always<00:00:32.870> hated<00:00:33.379> about

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
things that I kind of always hated about

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.979 
things that I kind of always hated about
this<00:00:33.800> was<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:34.340> USB<00:00:34.970> port<00:00:35.360> on<00:00:35.660> it

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
this was the USB port on it

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.040 
this was the USB port on it
now<00:00:36.290> when<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:37.010> USB<00:00:37.610> port<00:00:37.969> plug<00:00:38.270> is<00:00:38.510> plugged<00:00:38.809> in

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
now when the USB port plug is plugged in

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.979 
now when the USB port plug is plugged in
to<00:00:39.320> this<00:00:39.440> it's<00:00:39.710> one<00:00:39.890> of<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.130> many<00:00:40.340> USB<00:00:41.000> plugs<00:00:41.660> I

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
to this it's one of the many USB plugs I

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.650 
to this it's one of the many USB plugs I
always<00:00:42.829> worried<00:00:43.489> about<00:00:43.610> this<00:00:44.090> thing<00:00:44.360> getting

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
always worried about this thing getting

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.740 
always worried about this thing getting
broken<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:45.620> after<00:00:46.430> about<00:00:46.670> two<00:00:47.030> years<00:00:47.059> that's

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
broken and after about two years that's

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.170 
broken and after about two years that's
exactly<00:00:48.379> what<00:00:48.559> happened<00:00:48.950> to<00:00:49.010> mine<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:49.820> port

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
exactly what happened to mine the port

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.840 
exactly what happened to mine the port
basically<00:00:51.140> has<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.379> short<00:00:51.770> in<00:00:51.950> it<00:00:52.129> now<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:52.730> it

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
basically has a short in it now and it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.319 
basically has a short in it now and it
no<00:00:53.149> longer<00:00:53.510> charges<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.620> battery<00:00:55.550> when<00:00:56.059> the

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
no longer charges the battery when the

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.840 
no longer charges the battery when the
wireless<00:00:56.780> module<00:00:57.170> needs<00:00:57.469> to<00:00:57.620> be<00:00:57.710> recharged<00:00:58.309> so

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
wireless module needs to be recharged so

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.900 
wireless module needs to be recharged so
that<00:00:59.570> was<00:00:59.809> a<00:00:59.840> problem<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:00.410> instead<00:01:01.280> of<00:01:01.340> sending

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
that was a problem so instead of sending

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.029 
that was a problem so instead of sending
it<00:01:02.090> in<00:01:02.300> for<00:01:02.600> service

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:04.039 
it in for service

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:06.880 
it in for service
I<00:01:04.100> found<00:01:04.640> a<00:01:04.789> great<00:01:05.119> alternative<00:01:05.930> way<00:01:06.259> to<00:01:06.289> still

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
I found a great alternative way to still

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.280 
I found a great alternative way to still
use<00:01:07.160> my<00:01:07.369> tablet<00:01:07.729> on<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.240> battery<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:08.750> charge

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
use my tablet on the battery and charge

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.710 
use my tablet on the battery and charge
it<00:01:09.560> without<00:01:10.189> having<00:01:10.520> to<00:01:10.640> use<00:01:10.820> this<00:01:11.000> port<00:01:11.330> this

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
it without having to use this port this

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.899 
it without having to use this port this
port<00:01:12.049> is<00:01:12.140> pretty<00:01:12.439> much<00:01:12.560> useless<00:01:13.070> now<00:01:13.430> it<00:01:13.729> won't

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
port is pretty much useless now it won't

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.789 
port is pretty much useless now it won't
even<00:01:14.060> really<00:01:14.390> charge<00:01:14.780> unless<00:01:15.049> I<00:01:15.229> wiggle<00:01:15.590> it<00:01:15.680> at

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
even really charge unless I wiggle it at

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.100 
even really charge unless I wiggle it at
just<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:16.310> right<00:01:16.549> angle<00:01:16.760> and<00:01:17.299> like<00:01:17.930> I<00:01:18.049> said

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
just the right angle and like I said

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.810 
just the right angle and like I said
that's<00:01:18.409> no<00:01:18.590> good<00:01:18.770> I<00:01:18.830> don't<00:01:18.979> have<00:01:19.159> time<00:01:19.460> for<00:01:19.490> all

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
that's no good I don't have time for all

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.620 
that's no good I don't have time for all
that<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.600> what<00:01:21.350> I've<00:01:21.530> done<00:01:21.830> is<00:01:22.250> I<00:01:22.630> actually

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
that so what I've done is I actually

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.710 
that so what I've done is I actually
looked<00:01:24.080> on<00:01:24.350> amazon.com<00:01:25.100> for<00:01:26.090> first<00:01:26.420> a

looked on amazon.com for first a

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.170 
looked on amazon.com for first a
replacement<00:01:27.380> battery<00:01:27.890> so<00:01:28.490> I<00:01:28.790> ended<00:01:29.090> up

other thing I've got here is this tablet
again<00:04:00.860> I've<00:04:01.190> been<00:04:01.340> using<00:04:01.550> it<00:04:01.820> for<00:04:01.850> two<00:04:02.060> years

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
again I've been using it for two years

again I've been using it for two years
and<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:04.040> texture<00:04:04.640> of<00:04:04.940> this<00:04:05.180> tablet

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570

eventually wore off it had this field to

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.510 
eventually wore off it had this field to
make<00:04:08.660> it<00:04:08.840> recreate<00:04:09.380> sort<00:04:10.070> of<00:04:10.160> like<00:04:10.280> you<00:04:10.400> were

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
make it recreate sort of like you were

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.370 
make it recreate sort of like you were
drawing<00:04:10.790> on<00:04:10.970> paper<00:04:11.330> when<00:04:11.780> you're<00:04:11.930> using<00:04:12.170> the

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
drawing on paper when you're using the

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.560 
drawing on paper when you're using the
pen<00:04:12.620> on<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.100> actual<00:04:13.400> tablet<00:04:13.670> surface<00:04:14.150> itself

pen on the actual tablet surface itself

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.170 
pen on the actual tablet surface itself
well<00:04:14.930> mine<00:04:15.140> became<00:04:15.470> smooth<00:04:16.040> it<00:04:16.519> was<00:04:16.850> very

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
well mine became smooth it was very

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.539 
well mine became smooth it was very
slick<00:04:17.810> so<00:04:18.320> it<00:04:18.500> didn't<00:04:18.799> have<00:04:18.919> that<00:04:18.950> texture

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
slick so it didn't have that texture

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.580 
slick so it didn't have that texture
feel<00:04:19.850> anymore<00:04:20.480> now<00:04:20.959> you<00:04:21.049> can<00:04:21.290> send<00:04:21.500> your

resurface<00:04:24.890> it<00:04:25.100> but<00:04:25.460> I<00:04:25.669> don't<00:04:26.060> know<00:04:26.300> exactly

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
resurface it but I don't know exactly

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.210 
resurface it but I don't know exactly
how<00:04:26.990> much<00:04:27.140> it<00:04:27.320> costs<00:04:27.680> but<00:04:27.770> I'm<00:04:27.890> sure<00:04:28.070> it's

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
how much it costs but I'm sure it's

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.159 
how much it costs but I'm sure it's
going<00:04:28.400> to<00:04:28.520> be<00:04:28.610> over<00:04:28.760> $20<00:04:29.539> for<00:04:29.720> to<00:04:29.780> have<00:04:29.960> them

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
going to be over $20 for to have them

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.330 
going to be over $20 for to have them
replace<00:04:30.710> the

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
replace the

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.460 
replace the
surface<00:04:31.760> there<00:04:32.150> are<00:04:32.230> electronics<00:04:33.230> that<00:04:33.410> are

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
surface there are electronics that are

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.710 
surface there are electronics that are
on<00:04:33.830> this<00:04:34.100> surface<00:04:34.370> and<00:04:34.820> I'm<00:04:35.030> pretty<00:04:35.240> sure<00:04:35.330> they

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
on this surface and I'm pretty sure they

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.560 
on this surface and I'm pretty sure they
don't<00:04:35.870> come<00:04:35.990> all<00:04:36.290> that<00:04:36.320> cheap<00:04:36.919> so<00:04:37.550> in<00:04:37.910> lieu<00:04:38.540> of

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
don't come all that cheap so in lieu of

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.110 
don't come all that cheap so in lieu of
sending<00:04:39.440> my<00:04:39.620> tablet<00:04:40.070> in<00:04:40.190> to<00:04:40.520> get<00:04:40.669> the<00:04:40.850> surface

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
sending my tablet in to get the surface

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.659 
sending my tablet in to get the surface
redone<00:04:41.810> I<00:04:42.110> came<00:04:42.530> up<00:04:42.680> with<00:04:42.710> a<00:04:42.889> creative<00:04:43.220> way<00:04:43.610> to

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
redone I came up with a creative way to

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.560 
redone I came up with a creative way to
add<00:04:43.970> a<00:04:44.000> texture<00:04:44.750> back<00:04:45.169> to<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.530> tablet<00:04:45.740> surface

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
add a texture back to the tablet surface

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.480 
add a texture back to the tablet surface
basically<00:04:47.570> I<00:04:48.169> took<00:04:48.380> a<00:04:48.680> little<00:04:48.830> test<00:04:49.220> strip

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
basically I took a little test strip

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.920 
basically I took a little test strip
here<00:04:49.880> and<00:04:50.090> masked<00:04:50.960> it<00:04:51.110> off<00:04:51.290> and<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:51.919> used<00:04:52.370> a

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
here and masked it off and I used a

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.040 
here and masked it off and I used a
photo<00:04:53.930> finishing<00:04:54.710> matte<00:04:55.400> spray<00:04:56.030> on<00:04:56.300> it<00:04:56.360> now

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
photo finishing matte spray on it now

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.560 
photo finishing matte spray on it now
the<00:04:57.139> one<00:04:57.380> I<00:04:57.410> originally<00:04:58.340> used<00:04:58.729> had<00:04:59.210> a<00:04:59.240> lot<00:04:59.540> of

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
the one I originally used had a lot of

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.140 
the one I originally used had a lot of
odor<00:04:59.900> to<00:05:00.260> it<00:05:00.440> so<00:05:00.710> it<00:05:00.949> smelled<00:05:01.340> it<00:05:01.610> took<00:05:01.910> like

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
odor to it so it smelled it took like

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.150 
odor to it so it smelled it took like
five<00:05:02.540> or<00:05:02.750> six<00:05:02.960> days<00:05:03.139> for<00:05:03.410> the<00:05:03.530> smell<00:05:03.830> to<00:05:04.010> go

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
five or six days for the smell to go

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.980 
five or six days for the smell to go
away<00:05:04.250> on<00:05:04.610> this<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:04.970> it's<00:05:05.360> nothing<00:05:05.660> more<00:05:05.810> than

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
away on this and it's nothing more than

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.860 
away on this and it's nothing more than
an<00:05:06.110> acetate<00:05:06.500> spray<00:05:07.130> that<00:05:07.490> basically<00:05:08.300> gives<00:05:08.690> it

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
an acetate spray that basically gives it

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.200 
an acetate spray that basically gives it
a<00:05:08.960> matte<00:05:09.229> finish<00:05:09.500> back<00:05:09.889> to<00:05:10.130> this<00:05:10.250> image<00:05:10.820> you

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
a matte finish back to this image you

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.090 
a matte finish back to this image you
use<00:05:11.419> it<00:05:11.570> on<00:05:11.630> photo<00:05:11.960> prints<00:05:12.350> things<00:05:12.590> like<00:05:12.830> that

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
use it on photo prints things like that

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
use it on photo prints things like that
so<00:05:14.020> what<00:05:15.020> I<00:05:15.050> did<00:05:15.229> I<00:05:15.620> found<00:05:17.770> krylon<00:05:18.770> low<00:05:19.760> odor

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
so what I did I found krylon low odor
