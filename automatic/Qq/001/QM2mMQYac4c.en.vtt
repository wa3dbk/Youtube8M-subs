00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.370
 I am sorry for this cut of the coup 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.309
 in fact I'm going to run 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:13.170
 the playstation emulator is that 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.219
 I forgot the bios of the coup I 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.760
 revival 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.330
 the emulator so here is the same in the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.380
 settings i have any act iv 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.170
 finally all that little by little 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.210
 improve the image and put it in 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.920
 maximum 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.920
 now I 'm going to the teeth 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.510
 I do not know anymore to come to charge a 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.190
 Thu 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.719
 the gemmi tekken believe of course I come 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.909
 at large schemes are not sick and 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.019
 soon plugged in no configuration 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:52.920
 case was self configure game rests 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:55.699
 deep down there sorry I put you through 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.699
 I do not accept 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:11.050
 well then it's like we're riding has 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.050
 nothing of a descent we were there must 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.850
 so play my briefcase 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.190
 hot 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:57.330
 so that's fine now we're going 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.299
 pass an emulator that I have already reviewed 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.380
 in our video but with another game 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.500
 so here I can disconnect puppets 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:10.619
 will train further I will reposition 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:14.730
 logica is here so I'm going out the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.700
 style and since we will play the ds in 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.340
 besides drastically the best emulator 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.300
 ds course but when I tell you that 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.220
 is not crazy and then especially the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.319
 several ordinary and will have all 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.359
 phones 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.359
 but he disappoints he is on the note 3 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.640
 I'm sorry for now 10 and 100 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.640
 radial letters be adroit about 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:05.050
 so that's where it was told 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:09.070
 the age and this game why I'm running 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:20.920
 this game because in fact I 'm here he 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:23.709
 and brings more severe on the 3d and 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.220
 sure the vote 2 it works is 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:32.680
 really not bad especially the cold there is 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:36.120
 really more than a problem there we are 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.120
 really good for a crazy 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.930
 we knew that a seal not sure well 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.709
 have to the bottom of our war 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:51.390
 case but that's as much telling you that this 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:59.670
 either of the playsation 64 what is it 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:04:02.190
 is and he has just now ben la ds eh 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.860
 well there really is really no lag 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.810
 so now we're going to talk more about 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.569
 simulators but hey we'll all talk about 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.010
 this little end that I like well so 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.530
 good it's seen I could turn the 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.299
 joystick will walk the joystick ya other 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.979
 thing that impressed me is that 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.979
 one plugs in there I will reconnect 1 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.139
 if I get there 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.110
 tock 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.639
 so we say in the end is here what is 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.139
 I have an external hard drive 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.469
 that's how we are in bad shape but 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:40.099
 it works very well so it's a I 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:41.240
 believe that no 500 gigas and I thought 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:46.310
 not that it could work I tried 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:53.419
 like that actually and plug it in 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:56.120
 phone the hard drive launches without 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.979
 worry there my audi phone that has 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.229
 preferred usb storage device 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:03.439
 who opened who is who is 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.969
 connected and by opening it he asks me 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.050
 what am I going to do I can 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:08.990
 view all files every 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.590
 folders usb drive so this is it the 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.379
 hard drive I'm louvre and I have all my 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.699
 files from my hard drive on that which 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:19.460
 that works very well that are read 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.460
 as if it's like on a hard drive 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.569
 so here is the girls ag for example 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.569
 I will launch the thing said 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.129
 yeah right there it tells me that kodak a 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.020
 video is not good it's weird 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:43.479
 but a movie in hd I spent going 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:45.879
 run bah not be seen while the 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.659
 note 3 to a lot of problems of 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:49.089
 collect that 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:50.050
 there was not ours 2 so I hope 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:52.149
 they will do because updates 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.659
 that it's really not cool you the same 

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:57.429
 movie that I put on my lot 2 you're going 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:59.259
 turn live without laughing added 

00:05:57.429 --> 00:06:01.179
 that no reader at all I put 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:03.899
 in ours 3 either there will be a problem 

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:07.239
 of somsois is the problem of two videos 

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:08.679
 know it's not cool but hey it's a 

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:10.659
 detail planned to use our reader 

00:06:08.679 --> 00:06:12.819
 it will work necessarily in ours 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:17.429
 points but the scheme reader will have to 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:17.429
 what's wrong 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:34.069
 very well and here we are from 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:34.069
 hard drives avatar and we see signatory 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:42.760
 I found it really 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:46.449
 extremely well so suddenly I was able to 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.860
 also plug a keyboard mouse into 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:50.440
 like no configuration 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.580
 automatically cc manage 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.449
 that was surely the case on note 2 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:58.050
 I never paid attention but it's 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:00.510
 really it's really huge 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.460
 well then 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.770
 I'm not going to see this video any more 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.210
 continuation and I will tell you the next 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.440
 video i do not know what i'm going to be able to 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.230
 show you do not hesitate to ask me 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.400
 in comment I will try you 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.230
 to show good thing I know not 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.910
 someone who speaks necessarily very well 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.510
 even very very badly foolish 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.510
 I speak very badly 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.480
 I may have not cut as well 

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:25.880
 as well as some but in any case 

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.280
 it is a phone that I recommend it 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:31.639
 is expensive it is true that it is 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:34.070
 really expensive compared to others but 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:35.440
 when we have it we can do without 

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.940
 it's easy to call it 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.460
 really it replaces a pc is better 

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.930
 that a tablet and finally phone 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.380
 pc phones because these mixes 

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.400
 big mixture it's huge 

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.750
 I was surprised by another 2 is 

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.780
 really that I used all the 

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.750
 days and puts a note three tries I 

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.590
 am addicted sweat is a crazy thing 

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.360
 finally it's really a geek thing 

00:07:54.590 --> 00:08:01.280
 but it's really a poor game with 

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:03.669
 to use this good well then after 

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.669
 noon to salvation
