00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
thinking he has to be bluffing right

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.249 
thinking he has to be bluffing right
because<00:01:51.090> when<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.570> quads<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.140> all

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
because when you have quads you have all

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.639 
because when you have quads you have all
cards<00:01:52.530> locked<00:01:52.829> up<00:01:54.200> Robbo<00:01:55.200> leads<00:01:55.409> right<00:01:55.590> out

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
and bets the full house playing it like

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.940 
and bets the full house playing it like
well<00:01:57.960> that's<00:01:58.140> something<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.469> would<00:01:58.619> never<00:01:58.740> do

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
well that's something I would never do

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.969 
well that's something I would never do
in<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.159> spot<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> preflop<00:02:00.119> raiser<00:02:00.890> let<00:02:01.890> him

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
in this spot to a preflop raiser let him

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.410 
in this spot to a preflop raiser let him
pick<00:02:02.159> once<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.520> have<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.729> bluff<00:02:02.939> at<00:02:03.119> it

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
pick once to have the bluff at it

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.020 
pick once to have the bluff at it
now<00:02:03.689> obviously<00:02:03.899> Lewis<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.909> thinking<00:02:05.909> he's

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
now obviously Lewis is thinking he's

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.459 
now obviously Lewis is thinking he's
dad's<00:02:06.270> going<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.630> heaven<00:02:06.960> here<00:02:07.110> or<00:02:07.170> something

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
dad's going to heaven here or something

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.839 
dad's going to heaven here or something
he<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:07.710> can't<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.129> he's<00:02:08.250> also<00:02:08.429> thinking

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
he just can't but he's also thinking

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.699 
he just can't but he's also thinking
it's<00:02:09.000> got<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.300> be<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> bluff<00:02:09.690> or<00:02:09.899> an<00:02:09.989> ace<00:02:10.140> 9<00:02:10.440> it

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
it's got to be a bluff or an ace 9 it

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.809 
it's got to be a bluff or an ace 9 it
just<00:02:11.009> so

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
just so

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.149 
just so
yeah<00:02:12.780> he's<00:02:12.930> never<00:02:13.170> gonna<00:02:13.349> race<00:02:13.620> he's<00:02:13.859> never

I think Robles played it right both
players<00:03:24.810> are<00:03:24.840> Labrador<00:03:25.319> not<00:03:25.439> even<00:03:25.650> get<00:03:25.739> all

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
players are Labrador not even get all

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:33.110 
players are Labrador not even get all
the<00:03:25.919> chips<00:03:26.159> and<00:03:26.340> they're<00:03:26.430> gonna<00:03:26.669> try<00:03:26.879> to<00:03:32.120> shock

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
the chips and they're gonna try to shock

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.050 
the chips and they're gonna try to shock

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.089 

well<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.269> think<00:03:39.479> what's<00:03:39.870> what's<00:03:40.500> clear<00:03:40.889> is<00:03:40.919> that

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
well I think what's what's clear is that

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.249 
well I think what's what's clear is that
both<00:03:41.879> these<00:03:42.090> players<00:03:42.359> actually<00:03:42.900> think<00:03:43.139> the

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:43.259 
both these players actually think the

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:46.580 
both these players actually think the
other<00:03:43.409> guy<00:03:43.620> has<00:03:43.889> nothing<00:03:44.989> right<00:03:45.989> they<00:03:46.229> you

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
other guy has nothing right they you

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.140 
other guy has nothing right they you
know<00:03:46.709> that's<00:03:46.919> they're<00:03:47.129> positive<00:03:47.639> I<00:03:47.729> mean<00:03:47.879> it's

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
know that's they're positive I mean it's

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.689 
know that's they're positive I mean it's
Rawls<00:03:48.419> is<00:03:48.810> hoping<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.919> Lewis<00:03:50.189> has<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.400> queen

the<00:04:52.240> flop<00:04:52.480> I<00:04:52.630> mean<00:04:52.780> that's<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.020> first<00:04:53.050> thing<00:04:53.440> I

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
the flop I mean that's the first thing I

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.530 
the flop I mean that's the first thing I
would<00:04:54.370> have<00:04:54.400> never<00:04:54.550> thought<00:04:54.670> guys<00:04:55.120> gonna<00:04:55.360> make

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
on the flop that was I think horrible

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.900 
on the flop that was I think horrible
like<00:04:59.530> a<00:04:59.560> horrible<00:04:59.920> play<00:05:01.890> in<00:05:02.890> hindsight<00:05:03.460> these

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910
