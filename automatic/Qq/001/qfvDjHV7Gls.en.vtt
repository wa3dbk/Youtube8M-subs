00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:25.890
 and it's being between who 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.679
 which is the cerc we have seen above at two o'clock 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.150
 and approaches that are protos that we have 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.690
 at 7 am they are the same

 constants in competitions in the justice a dog bidders participated 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.580
 in which you have worked abyc well after triple left 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.720
 this cd the championship that we have dedicated 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.130
 try then have a little fun 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.390
 to practice 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.410
 percent 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.410
 facing what you can be kraft 2 psoe 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.370
 entertain and have fun and many people 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.900
 she 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.900
 pointed to resume this traffic is wrong 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.800
 p memo with the geop to san diego and also 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.410
 a little bit serious for 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.920
 learn and take miguel so let's comment the final so we see 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.570
 mouth 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.990
 is already making the reproduction reservation for Carlos Tatin without 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.090
 soon as possible 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.130
 while she is sending we overcome the area of ​​11 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.719
 It is always important 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.409
 visualize where your opponent is like what he is doing in fox he has sent 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:39.710
 your first probe 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.409
 aa the base 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.249
 because this is a map that is colosseum 

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.170
 we have not said it before 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.689
 the kiel four bases e also the probe the base that is five o'clock and now to the 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:50.390
 what is 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.649
 at 1 I was going to realize 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.799
 that his rival is like this while invoking what he is doing with that 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.230
 world super master 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.530
 send it 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.530
 directly to the base of the fights 5 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.950
 we already see that 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.899
 percent four followed by his rival in which he even already has the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.989
 extractor feder that is removing caspers but has the reservation of 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.330
 reproduction and the first cervix 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.579
 is going to leave in the meantime at the base 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:22.209
 delfos as we can see already gone proton pylons well positioned 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.360
 a faith are fruits that are already taking 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.709
 a fanatic 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.030
 per cent the forge protos that is the passage of scientific day of the spee 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.609
 fanatics and others 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.010
 units and also from assimilated 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.700
 the forge protos 4 0 is always very important it grabs as soon as possible already 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.189
 I know it's the building 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:47.059
 requirement to take out the photon cannons while we see that percent 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:49.949
 that is already sending the cervix to the base 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:52.229
 dp forst 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:56.639
 let's see why we have seen that the forest had the sky the forge 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.269
 protos but we are not seeing any photon cannon that usually is 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.820
 cover this bottleneck we have here 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.549
 the ferries have arrived 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.069
 percent in forums all fanatics who take care of cilic 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.929
 in front of that group d 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:16.109
 of six ibm telefilms we see that in the middle it is already percent invoking and 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.949
 consuming the first photon cannon fruits 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.669
 perfectly let's see if you can 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.629
 it's a bit of aggression in some structures or some waves 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.800
 at the moment is attacking sa forge protos to which already started 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.800
 a process of entities of jora 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:36.859
 It's going to be a battle, of course 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.759
 the pretty 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.659
 percent last a beginning can be 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.169
 it can be if it falls 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.339
 s 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:49.229
 that forge that has enough problems at the moment is holding three sections 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.380
 fanatics with class and experience and 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.250
 built a photon cannon here are cough pylons is possibly very 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.200
 tightly closed by 100 fors against what mouthpiece mouthpiece has made in the first 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.839
 expansion quickly 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:06.109
 in fact it has closer 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.349
 with it you create the offer 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.799
 we do not see percent and that no other improvement is being made 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.690
 also preparing a master lens while the ferries that are 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.910
 harassing your base 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.140
 we see that trying again is doing a lot of damage but they have 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.530
 to retire because in the body cut body could not against those 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.080
 four fans 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.080
 they retreat for the time being they have caught a probe 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:30.990
 they come back again 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.719
 they will try to hurt 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:38.550
 the maximum possible damage may be that that forge fall mpa to try until the 

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:39.259
 final 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.159
 He might fall down 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.699
 Well yes, in the end it may be that they are in a hurry 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.340
 percent but not a big hurry 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.229
 percent forst lake 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.240
 It has five fans who can withstand any attack stack prepare 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.900
 a pylon the five fans already know where you have to direct them that the 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.440
 true 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.390
 is that you have very few units I will have to prepare something quickly for 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.300
 protect yourself 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.479
 is preparing the web the ideal and scoop den 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.210
 where can the gürtel and then the counterattack go afterwards? 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.370
 we see that he fancied 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.370
 in capiro 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.080
 those arlexes even though they're going to go down 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.599
 the forsur 100 country straight to the base of devo quenda try to put something of 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:27.210
 Pressure 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.759
 although Boquense is preparing its first colony sunk its second where 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.050
 a high part see if he can hold 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.960
 likewise that pressure 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.150
 is going to try to do a little san luis as we see and it will be effective 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.150
 two fans fall 3 4 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.919
 there is a fifth that has passed 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.210
 will have to finish him off before he can do some harassment to those 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.580
 drones 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.990
 we already see how the lair has built from the lair 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.050
 can investigate can make other buildings more can advance in the text 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.419
 wic to fund 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:01.379
 we see how 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:04.379
 was with these breeding grounds generating new 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.960
 eef mites 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.330
 that last fanatic is over 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.919
 even though we give that force used all this time to generate 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.430
 a nexus protos ap allamad a forge fruits and is now doing what it is 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.300
 the typical movement in these maps that have a little bottleneck to the 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.229
 time to enter base by a proton when faced feb generated 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.819
 a pylon a forge fruits and then two photon cannons what stage ni 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:33.900
 contain any entry of cervix to the base 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.439
 to make him give a little harassment 

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:39.439
 percent 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:42.150
 then these workshops have already been 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.849
 percent what two does not have at the moment 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:48.279
 a lot of output let's see if there are any 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:49.750
 sixth investigation 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.710
 percent developing 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.930
 what is the lute 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.100
 enough necessary pastas against net protos the mossos organ 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.230
 what will he take 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.960
 the second expansion these stations 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.050
 It is usually very good to do what we see 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.139
 Delices dejas dress or 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:10.210
 so everything is progressing in the text of her and she needs a lot of hope 

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:12.130
 they need 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.589
 to all these races 

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:14.979
 6a 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:16.319
 defending right now 

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:19.270
 in forums I was in the forge proto still doing 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.300
 that improvement that was canceled before 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.720
 come out with five fans again 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.690
 to see if it comes out a little clear the way percent and not feel the harassment 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.690
 of those terrible that at the moment very well to the base 

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:33.159
 we have verified throwing 

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:35.249
 perfectly and establishing 

00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:36.770
 defenses 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.230
 just in case I had some air attack of fashion liz kosovo some 

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:44.129
 unit that would go through there 

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:47.629
 and they were also preparing the post the stellar port protos the port 

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:48.169
 stellar 

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:49.560
 it is very necessary 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.909
 the tamazight is doing it by stellar objects 

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:54.270
 they are very necessary 

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:56.189
 since surely 

00:07:56.189 --> 00:08:00.309
 attacking with corsairs at that time the corsairs are going to leave they will do much 

00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:01.639
 damage we overcome it why 

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:04.800
 can kill them can greatly limit the population 

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.099
 d to be 

00:08:06.099 --> 00:08:09.399
 and with it preterms we see them estefan won that was 

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:12.399
 in this area surely percent 

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:15.919
 will try to make the fourth expansion here
