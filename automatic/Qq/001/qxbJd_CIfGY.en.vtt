 business is an important part that is 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.830
 must take into account and from which 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.750
 can be taken lightly as it is the 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.090
 Your company's image shows how 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.919

 excellent service to see your logo will know 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.950

 customers you should know that there are 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.170
 different types of logos and it's important 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.410
 what different one from the other and you give yourself a 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.840
 idea that then you want 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.090
 did types is a symbol that represents 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.400
 your company in using letters such is the 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.500
 apple case and just see the apple 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.690
 we know what company is without using letters 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.550
 who mention their name logo 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.710
 conformed with the name of your company 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.960
 with a particular typeface and 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.809
 colors or color that are used as logo of 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.970
 your company imago type combines the two 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.070
 previous to form a single logo and 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.759
 whether the isotype is above the 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.890
 logo or to the side did logo to the 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:11.020
 just as the imagotype uses the isotype and 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.759
 the logo in a single logo only that in 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.890
 this work the two elements for 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.899
 form a single logo these are not for 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.910
 separate but they make up a single 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.009
 element as they can move with the 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.509
 burger king logo that simulates a 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:25.690
 hamburger using fonts that 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:29.230
 mention the name of the company 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.210
 Vector design is an important part 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.430
 that your logo looks excellent where 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.800
 that is why the design should be 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.990
 vector and not pixel since the pixel 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.490
 loses quality when enlarged as in 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.680
 the images that we take with our 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.720
 cell phones and when increasing the 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.610
 zoom the image gets blurred the 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.500
 vectors never lose quality for more 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.090
 great that they are since they use strokes in 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.130
 each one of his designs 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.960
 originality do not accept copies and 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.299
 similarities of other logos since 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.100
 they lose originality there are designers 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.189
 that lose their creativity in a moment 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.960
 and search the net for ideas for the logo and 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.000
 although it is something that we use to increase 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.100
 creativity does not always work for them and 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.929
 they simply trust the design what 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.150
 right is to create something new and not 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.730
 just copy us completely from 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.680
 Another logo as we see in the picture 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.540
 you can clearly notice that one is 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.239
 copy of another even though the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.030
 elements may be slightly 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.019
 modified does not stop being a plagiarism 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.540
 this can also get you in trouble 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.850
 with the person who owns the original logo and 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.650
 adjust you as plagiarism as a designer 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.690
 our job is to create a new design 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.980
 that represents what the company is and 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.409
 to be able to create a brand in it 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.209
 if you have some ideas of your logo or sketch 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:41.980
 but you're still not sure what 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.379
 you want and you feel that you need something more 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.750
 we help you create that idea 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.280
 you have and make it a reality as 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.060
 creative is not only our task 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.590
 create it 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.750
 to the letter what they ask of us 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.910
 also propose new ideas that can 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.580
 go according to what they request and 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.260
 that go according to the company a 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.790
 redesign is also important so that 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.519
 your company that image of freshness and 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.019
 not from an old company that does not offer 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.420
 what people are looking for today 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.000
 if the big brands do it because you 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.739
 no yes you already have a logo that carries 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.840
 enough time or you want a new turn 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.849
 for your company better start by giving a 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.709
 new image for her fresher and 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.940
 modern 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.799
 the changes do not have to be so 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.329
 drastic because they can be preserved 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.220
 some elements of your logo and 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.260
 change them slightly 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.299
 remember that you want to create a brand so 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.370
 that it is important that the logo change 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.599
 not so big for customers 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.670
 do not get lost and do not recognize who you are 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.620
 Colorful elements or shapes can 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.140
 reused for the design of the new 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.290
 logo 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.360
 corporate identity if you want to go more 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.190
 away and show the new image of your 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.020
 company it is important that the samples in 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.310
 all the elements of this company 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.350
 in this way you will create brand and 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.450
 will recognize who you are card 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.459
 presentation and letterhead manuel e 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.260
 corporate identity are what 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.240
 you will get in the identity package 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.040
 corporate whether you have a logo is 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.450
 important that you have reflected throughout 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.970
 your company the identity manual 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.860
 corporate will help you know the 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.080
 variations of colors that you can use 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.760
 logo and what no where else can 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.250
 use and the correct form that should be 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.109
 I hope it was clear to them 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.519
 what represents the design of a logo and 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.400
 how important it is for your company 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.510
 take it seriously shows giving it a 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.510
 professional image
