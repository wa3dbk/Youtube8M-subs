so as I said in DVD one you have two
forms<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:06.500> attack<00:00:07.500> with<00:00:07.740> this<00:00:07.919> at<00:00:08.340> anyway<00:00:08.849> sir

forms of attack with this at anyway sir

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.440 
forms of attack with this at anyway sir
which<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.809> striking<00:00:10.429> UB<00:00:11.429> was<00:00:11.610> er<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:12.000> using

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
which is the striking UB was er is using

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.789 
which is the striking UB was er is using
the<00:00:12.599> finger<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.049> we<00:00:13.170> could<00:00:13.290> be<00:00:13.349> grabbing

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
the finger so we could be grabbing

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.930 
the finger so we could be grabbing
rubbing<00:00:14.460> etc<00:00:14.910> etc<00:00:15.830> we<00:00:16.830> just<00:00:17.010> as<00:00:17.250> an<00:00:17.430> example<00:00:17.880> of

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
as an aside by the way you won't find

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.450 
as an aside by the way you won't find
that<00:00:54.600> point<00:00:54.840> working<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.379> women<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:55.800> if<00:00:56.280> your

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that point working on women so if your

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.590 
that point working on women so if your
training<00:00:56.670> with<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.910> female<00:00:57.270> training

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
training with the female training

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.290 
training with the female training
partner<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.379> won't<00:00:58.739> work<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.520> very<00:00:59.940> male

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
partner it won't work it's a very male

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.380 
partner it won't work it's a very male
point<00:01:01.170> also<00:01:01.710> known<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> male<00:01:03.120> pressure

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
point also known as the male pressure

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.000 
point also known as the male pressure
point<00:01:04.309> we<00:01:05.309> could<00:01:05.460> use<00:01:05.640> two<00:01:05.880> fingers<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.619> was

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
point we could use two fingers if it was

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.250 
point we could use two fingers if it was
as<00:01:08.310> an<00:01:08.430> example<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:09.420> could<00:01:09.600> run<00:01:09.780> along<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
as an example we could run along on the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.690 
as an example we could run along on the
inside<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> bone<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.400> we'll<00:01:11.580> be

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
inside of the bone here and we'll be

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.010 
inside of the bone here and we'll be
showing<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.150> applications<00:01:12.720> from<00:01:12.840> these

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
showing you the applications from these

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.780 
showing you the applications from these
later<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.100> could<00:01:14.280> come<00:01:14.430> along<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:15.000> here<00:01:16.790> get

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
later so I could come along in here get

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.810 
later so I could come along in here get
a<00:01:17.820> huge<00:01:18.420> pain<00:01:19.159> running<00:01:20.159> right<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> way

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
a huge pain running right the way

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.249 
a huge pain running right the way
through<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.420> lot<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.689> people<00:01:21.960> find<00:01:22.110> that

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
through and a lot of people find that

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.749 
through and a lot of people find that
will<00:01:22.380> actually<00:01:22.470> run<00:01:22.830> up<00:01:23.009> into<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> throat<00:01:23.580> as

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
will actually run up into the throat as

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.170 
will actually run up into the throat as
well<00:01:24.200> okay<00:01:25.200> now<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.009> probably<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.939> add<00:01:27.150> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
well okay now I probably have to add a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.789 
well okay now I probably have to add a
little<00:01:27.450> bit<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.720> control<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.439> I'd<00:01:28.590> run

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
little bit of control with this I'd run

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.550 
little bit of control with this I'd run
that<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.020> help<00:01:31.020> him<00:01:31.200> become

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
that in and then just help him become

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.870 
that in and then just help him become
nice<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.009> gently<00:01:32.310> okay<00:01:34.009> from<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.130> striking

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
nice and gently okay from a striking

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.399 
nice and gently okay from a striking
perspective<00:01:36.570> let's<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.020> look<00:01:37.170> at<00:01:37.259> some

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
perspective let's have a look at some

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.830 
perspective let's have a look at some
weapons<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:40.079> shovel<00:01:40.530> fist<00:01:41.509> beautiful<00:01:42.509> to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
weapons the shovel fist beautiful to

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.859 
weapons the shovel fist beautiful to
strike<00:01:43.110> into<00:01:43.350> there<00:01:43.680> but<00:01:44.399> would<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:45.030> truly

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
strike into there but would it be truly

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.149 
strike into there but would it be truly
effective<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:47.399> really<00:01:48.360> not

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
effective in a really not

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.350 
effective in a really not
life-threatening<00:01:50.159> situation<00:01:50.729> possibly<00:01:51.180> not

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
life-threatening situation possibly not

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.130 
life-threatening situation possibly not
and<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.049> again<00:01:52.320> weapon<00:01:52.770> selection<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.280> vital

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
and so again weapon selection is vital

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.380 
and so again weapon selection is vital
however<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.530> could<00:01:56.340> strike<00:01:56.579> him<00:01:56.790> into<00:01:57.060> here

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
however I could strike him into here

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.950 
however I could strike him into here
along<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.020> center<00:01:58.409> line<00:01:58.439> here<00:01:59.810> it's<00:02:00.810> going

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
along this center line here it's going

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.109 
along this center line here it's going
to<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> great<00:02:01.350> effect<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:02.009> could<00:02:02.670> use<00:02:02.880> a

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
to have a great effect I could use a

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.730 
to have a great effect I could use a
single<00:02:03.810> knuckle<00:02:04.170> or<00:02:04.439> Phoenix<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.369> fist

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
single knuckle or Phoenix I fist

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.080 
single knuckle or Phoenix I fist
perhaps<00:02:07.740> into<00:02:07.979> one<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.310> smaller<00:02:08.610> areas

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
perhaps into one of the smaller areas

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.139 
perhaps into one of the smaller areas
here

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
here

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.160 
here
a<00:02:11.610> Lionhead<00:02:12.610> facin<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.239> chinese<00:02:13.689> system

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
a Lionhead facin that the chinese system

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.550 
a Lionhead facin that the chinese system
again<00:02:15.040> i<00:02:15.069> drive<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:15.879> here<00:02:16.150> or<00:02:16.629> i<00:02:16.689> could<00:02:17.140> use<00:02:17.379> it

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
again i drive in here or i could use it

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.250 
again i drive in here or i could use it
in<00:02:18.000> running<00:02:19.000> along<00:02:19.269> into<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.629> heart<00:02:19.900> point

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
in running along into the heart point

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.929 
in running along into the heart point
here<00:02:20.439> so<00:02:20.470> i<00:02:20.620> can<00:02:20.799> access<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:21.220> heart<00:02:21.519> point<00:02:21.819> i

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
here so i can access that heart point i

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.360 
here so i can access that heart point i
could<00:02:22.360> drive<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.870> into<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.079> ribcage<00:02:23.409> so<00:02:24.250> it's

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
could drive it into the ribcage so it's

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.390 
could drive it into the ribcage so it's
going<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.549> actually<00:02:24.670> go<00:02:25.030> in<00:02:25.319> between<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:27.220> rib

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
going to actually go in between the rib

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.300 
going to actually go in between the rib
cage<00:02:27.609> and<00:02:27.730> start<00:02:28.030> working<00:02:28.450> on<00:02:28.569> that<00:02:29.310> other

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
cage and start working on that other

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.740 
cage and start working on that other

be ideal and if i can make it work

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.860 
be ideal and if i can make it work
within<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.459> meridians<00:02:45.940> that<00:02:46.150> will<00:02:46.450> be<00:02:46.629> even

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
within the meridians that will be even

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.019 
within the meridians that will be even
better
