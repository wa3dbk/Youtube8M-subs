00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
now when my craft boards already opened

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.130 
now when my craft boards already opened
up<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:40.150> can<00:03:40.269> go<00:03:40.420> ahead<00:03:40.510> and<00:03:40.720> go<00:03:40.810> into<00:03:40.930> options

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.470 
up you can go ahead and go into options
and<00:03:41.590> go<00:03:41.739> into<00:03:41.920> shaders<00:03:42.400> right<00:03:42.610> here<00:03:42.850> now<00:03:43.450> I

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
and go into shaders right here now I

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.240 
and go into shaders right here now I
already<00:03:43.810> have<00:03:43.959> a<00:03:44.140> shader<00:03:44.470> spec<00:03:44.829> so<00:03:45.010> I<00:03:45.070> don't

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
already have a shader spec so I don't

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.850 
already have a shader spec so I don't
really<00:03:45.340> need<00:03:45.730> my<00:03:46.660> other<00:03:46.959> shaders<00:03:47.470> cuz<00:03:47.709> I'm

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
really need my other shaders cuz I'm

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.949 
really need my other shaders cuz I'm
fine<00:03:48.040> with<00:03:48.220> this<00:03:48.340> shaders<00:03:48.730> but<00:03:49.180> what<00:03:49.390> you<00:03:49.660> do

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
fine with this shaders but what you do

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.710 
fine with this shaders but what you do
is<00:03:50.140> you<00:03:50.709> can<00:03:50.859> open<00:03:51.130> up<00:03:51.220> shaders<00:03:51.640> pack<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.540> the

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
is you can open up shaders pack and the

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.569 
is you can open up shaders pack and the
shader<00:03:52.930> open<00:03:53.290> shader<00:03:53.440> pack<00:03:53.620> folder<00:03:53.859> and<00:03:54.160> then

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
shader open shader pack folder and then

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.400 
shader open shader pack folder and then
drag<00:03:54.850> the<00:03:55.000> dist<00:03:55.209> folder<00:03:55.390> in<00:03:55.690> here<00:03:55.720> you<00:03:56.260> can

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
drag the dist folder in here you can

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.069 
drag the dist folder in here you can
drag<00:03:56.530> everything<00:03:57.070> from<00:03:57.340> here<00:03:57.700> it's<00:03:58.630> is<00:03:58.840> there

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
drag everything from here it's is there

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.410 
drag everything from here it's is there
but<00:03:59.560> I<00:03:59.590> don't<00:03:59.890> want<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.070> do<00:04:00.220> that<00:04:00.400> because<00:04:00.579> the

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
but I don't want to do that because the

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.750 
but I don't want to do that because the
shaders<00:04:01.750> I<00:04:01.930> use<00:04:02.170> is<00:04:02.320> fine<00:04:02.530> so<00:04:03.160> let<00:04:03.340> me<00:04:03.430> just<00:04:03.610> go

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
shaders I use is fine so let me just go

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.660 
shaders I use is fine so let me just go
ahead<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.269> choose<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.959> version<00:04:05.769> for<00:04:06.010> extreme

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
ahead and choose the version for extreme

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.509 
ahead and choose the version for extreme
which<00:04:07.030> is<00:04:07.209> which<00:04:07.660> I<00:04:07.780> already<00:04:07.930> have<00:04:08.290> so<00:04:09.160> version

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
which is which I already have so version

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.119 
which is which I already have so version
for<00:04:09.819> extreme<00:04:10.510> right<00:04:10.750> here<00:04:10.900> and<00:04:11.110> then<00:04:11.950> let<00:04:12.099> me

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
for extreme right here and then let me

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.070 
for extreme right here and then let me
go<00:04:12.310> ahead<00:04:12.459> and<00:04:12.640> open<00:04:13.090> up<00:04:13.209> a<00:04:13.680> shaders<00:04:14.819> world<00:04:15.819> and

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
go ahead and open up a shaders world and

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.219 
go ahead and open up a shaders world and
then<00:04:17.080> as<00:04:17.229> you<00:04:17.440> can<00:04:17.590> see<00:04:17.979> here<00:04:19.019> shaders<00:04:20.019> looks

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
then as you can see here shaders looks

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.740 
then as you can see here shaders looks
pretty<00:04:20.590> darn<00:04:21.010> good<00:04:21.130> doesn't<00:04:21.789> it<00:04:21.880> now<00:04:22.510> there

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
pretty darn good doesn't it now there

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.180 
pretty darn good doesn't it now there
are<00:04:22.840> many<00:04:23.050> other<00:04:23.200> shaders<00:04:23.770> that<00:04:23.919> could<00:04:24.099> be

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
are many other shaders that could be

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.560 
are many other shaders that could be
better<00:04:24.430> many<00:04:24.729> other<00:04:24.909> shooters<00:04:25.180> that<00:04:25.300> could<00:04:25.450> be

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
better many other shooters that could be

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.100 
better many other shooters that could be
worse

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
worse

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.930 
worse
but<00:04:26.530> because<00:04:26.800> I'm<00:04:26.919> recording<00:04:27.250> with<00:04:27.280> bandicam

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
but because I'm recording with bandicam

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.719 
but because I'm recording with bandicam
my<00:04:28.570> fps<00:04:29.349> isn't<00:04:29.620> that<00:04:29.770> well<00:04:30.010> but<00:04:30.340> if<00:04:30.430> you<00:04:30.550> do

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
my fps isn't that well but if you do

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.420 
my fps isn't that well but if you do
look<00:04:30.909> at<00:04:31.030> my<00:04:31.090> I'm<00:04:31.479> bad<00:04:31.750> at<00:04:31.990> videos<00:04:32.349> I<00:04:32.620> do<00:04:33.039> record

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
look at my I'm bad at videos I do record

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.550 
look at my I'm bad at videos I do record
the<00:04:33.520> shaders<00:04:33.849> it<00:04:33.970> is<00:04:34.060> not<00:04:34.210> quite<00:04:34.479> good<00:04:34.510> but<00:04:35.349> um

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
the shaders it is not quite good but um

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.770 
the shaders it is not quite good but um
as<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:36.400> can<00:04:36.550> see<00:04:36.669> here<00:04:36.909> shaders<00:04:37.630> looks

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
as you can see here shaders looks

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.570 
as you can see here shaders looks
beautiful<00:04:38.440> shaders<00:04:38.800> looks<00:04:38.950> nice<00:04:39.250> there<00:04:39.460> are

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
beautiful shaders looks nice there are

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.300 
beautiful shaders looks nice there are
the<00:04:39.669> shadows<00:04:40.180> but<00:04:40.750> what<00:04:40.900> I<00:04:40.930> do<00:04:41.080> sorry<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:41.890> go<00:04:42.250> to

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
the shadows but what I do sorry I go to

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.190 
the shadows but what I do sorry I go to
options<00:04:42.760> shaders<00:04:43.120> I<00:04:43.300> usually<00:04:43.720> use<00:04:43.900> the

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
options shaders I usually use the

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.200 
options shaders I usually use the
shaders<00:04:44.560> ultra<00:04:45.220> or<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.430> shaders<00:04:45.760> deal<00:04:45.970> web

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
shaders ultra or the shaders deal web

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.260 
shaders ultra or the shaders deal web
now<00:04:46.840> this<00:04:47.440> one<00:04:47.710> my<00:04:47.950> opinion<00:04:48.370> looks<00:04:48.520> so<00:04:49.030> much

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
now this one my opinion looks so much

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.990 
now this one my opinion looks so much
better<00:04:49.510> because<00:04:50.200> one<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:51.010> Sun<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.700> the

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
better because one the Sun to the

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.880 
better because one the Sun to the
shadows<00:04:52.599> looks<00:04:52.750> so<00:04:52.990> much<00:04:53.140> more<00:04:53.349> realistic<00:04:53.560> and

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
shadows looks so much more realistic and

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.710 
shadows looks so much more realistic and
they<00:04:53.979> look<00:04:54.099> actually<00:04:54.340> so<00:04:55.090> much<00:04:55.240> better

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
they look actually so much better

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.050 
they look actually so much better
but<00:04:56.470> um<00:04:56.620> yeah<00:04:57.099> guys<00:04:57.340> that's<00:04:57.580> how<00:04:57.729> you<00:04:57.789> install

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
but um yeah guys that's how you install

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.390 
but um yeah guys that's how you install
