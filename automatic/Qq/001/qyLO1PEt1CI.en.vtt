00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
simply is this you have only 20 seconds

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.630 
simply is this you have only 20 seconds
to<00:01:19.210> make<00:01:19.360> an<00:01:19.540> impression<00:01:19.630> so<00:01:20.259> the<00:01:21.100> first<00:01:21.400> time

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
to make an impression so the first time

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.090 
to make an impression so the first time
a<00:01:21.880> recruiter<00:01:22.570> looks<00:01:22.780> at<00:01:22.930> a<00:01:22.960> bunch<00:01:23.229> of<00:01:23.409> CVS<00:01:23.860> they

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
a recruiter looks at a bunch of CVS they

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.389 
a recruiter looks at a bunch of CVS they
look<00:01:24.939> at<00:01:25.060> them<00:01:25.270> for<00:01:25.479> 20<00:01:26.020> seconds<00:01:26.650> each<00:01:26.799> and<00:01:27.220> in

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
look at them for 20 seconds each and in

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.450 
look at them for 20 seconds each and in
fact<00:01:27.780> some<00:01:28.780> experts<00:01:29.020> think<00:01:29.590> it's<00:01:29.799> less<00:01:30.189> and

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
fact some experts think it's less and

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.280 
fact some experts think it's less and
less<00:01:30.549> that<00:01:30.610> it's<00:01:30.880> perhaps<00:01:31.060> only<00:01:31.329> 10<00:01:31.780> seconds

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
less that it's perhaps only 10 seconds

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.010 
less that it's perhaps only 10 seconds
so<00:01:32.799> that's<00:01:33.009> all<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.820> time<00:01:33.850> you've<00:01:34.270> got<00:01:34.510> so

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
so that's all the time you've got so

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.230 
so that's all the time you've got so
it's<00:01:35.200> a<00:01:35.260> maximum<00:01:35.830> of<00:01:35.979> 20<00:01:36.310> seconds<00:01:36.700> possibly

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
it's a maximum of 20 seconds possibly

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.590 
it's a maximum of 20 seconds possibly
only<00:01:37.450> 10<00:01:37.840> to<00:01:38.470> make<00:01:38.650> an<00:01:38.860> impression<00:01:39.310> so<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.330> can

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
only 10 to make an impression so you can

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.300 
only 10 to make an impression so you can
see<00:01:40.780> you'll<00:01:41.080> see<00:01:41.110> we<00:01:41.530> really<00:01:42.130> must<00:01:42.700> stand<00:01:43.330> out

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
see you'll see we really must stand out

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.010 
see you'll see we really must stand out
so<00:01:45.310> how<00:01:45.580> on<00:01:45.729> earth<00:01:45.850> do<00:01:46.060> you<00:01:46.090> adapt<00:01:46.479> your<00:01:46.659> CV<00:01:46.990> for

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
every job well it's not as difficult as

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.700 
every job well it's not as difficult as
you<00:01:49.900> might<00:01:50.110> think

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
you might think

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.530 
you might think
so<00:01:51.460> let's<00:01:51.640> take<00:01:51.820> a<00:01:51.880> look<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.970> what<00:01:55.120> you<00:01:55.240> do<00:01:55.360> is

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
so let's take a look so what you do is

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.740 
so let's take a look so what you do is
create<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.110> generic<00:01:56.530> CV<00:01:57.070> so<00:01:57.970> that's<00:01:58.150> a<00:01:58.330> CV

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
create a generic CV so that's a CV

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.990 
create a generic CV so that's a CV
that's<00:01:58.990> in<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.290> correct<00:01:59.740> format<00:02:00.220> and<00:02:00.850> with

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
that's in the correct format and with

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.120 
that's in the correct format and with
all<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.479> relevant<00:02:01.750> information<00:02:02.080> for<00:02:03.010> the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
all the relevant information for the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.039 
all the relevant information for the
type<00:02:03.340> of<00:02:03.369> job<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:03.760> you're<00:02:04.030> applying<00:02:04.060> for<00:02:04.659> and

type of job that you're applying for and

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.039 
type of job that you're applying for and

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
then you tailor each CV to the

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.889 
then you tailor each CV to the
individual<00:02:08.649> job<00:02:09.009> so<00:02:09.879> how<00:02:10.450> do<00:02:10.509> you<00:02:10.659> go<00:02:10.810> about

need<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.980> do<00:02:36.129> is<00:02:36.310> choose<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.790> most<00:02:37.269> important

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019

skills qualifications and experience

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.820 
skills qualifications and experience
that<00:02:41.529> the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
that the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.460 
that the
employer<00:02:42.160> is<00:02:42.400> asking<00:02:42.700> for<00:02:43.210> so<00:02:43.960> these<00:02:44.200> are<00:02:44.380> the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
employer is asking for so these are the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.230 
employer is asking for so these are the
ones<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:44.770> this<00:02:45.130> particular<00:02:45.790> employer

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
ones that this particular employer

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.590 
ones that this particular employer
values<00:02:46.990> most<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:48.700> could<00:02:49.000> be<00:02:49.150> applying

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
values most and you could be applying

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.210 
values most and you could be applying
for<00:02:49.900> several<00:02:50.230> jobs<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.650> are<00:02:50.770> very<00:02:50.920> similar

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
for several jobs that are very similar

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.370 
for several jobs that are very similar
but<00:02:51.790> there<00:02:51.940> might<00:02:52.030> be<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.240> slight<00:02:52.660> difference

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
but there might be a slight difference

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.000 
but there might be a slight difference
in<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:54.190> most<00:02:54.370> important<00:02:55.000> skills<00:02:55.770> so<00:02:56.770> this<00:02:56.890> is

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
in the most important skills so this is

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.100 
in the most important skills so this is
going<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.220> vary<00:02:57.250> according<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.720> employer

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
going to vary according to the employer

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.110 
going to vary according to the employer
and<00:02:59.500> you're<00:02:59.890> going<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.100> get<00:03:00.250> this<00:03:00.400> from<00:03:00.850> the

well of course he wants to know it but
just<00:04:06.430> writing<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.750> words<00:04:07.959> doesn't<00:04:08.590> mean<00:04:08.739> a

just writing the words doesn't mean a

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.660 
just writing the words doesn't mean a
thing<00:04:09.120> anyone<00:04:10.120> can<00:04:10.269> do<00:04:10.420> that<00:04:11.280> you've<00:04:12.280> got<00:04:12.519> to

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
thing anyone can do that you've got to

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.930 
thing anyone can do that you've got to
prove<00:04:12.970> it<00:04:13.769> sohow<00:04:14.769> enough<00:04:15.010> do<00:04:15.130> you<00:04:15.190> prove<00:04:15.760> it

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
prove it sohow enough do you prove it

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.840 
prove it sohow enough do you prove it
well<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.200> way<00:04:17.230> to<00:04:17.350> do<00:04:17.620> this<00:04:17.799> is<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.519> give<00:04:18.700> an

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
well the way to do this is to give an

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.740 
well the way to do this is to give an
example<00:04:19.269> of<00:04:19.660> where<00:04:20.320> when<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:21.519> how<00:04:21.750> you

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
example of where when and how you

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.560 
example of where when and how you
actually<00:04:22.960> did<00:04:23.410> something<00:04:23.940> so<00:04:24.940> for<00:04:25.120> example

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
actually did something so for example

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.810 
actually did something so for example
you<00:04:25.870> might<00:04:26.080> write<00:04:26.320> something<00:04:26.530> like<00:04:26.820> increased

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
you might write something like increased

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.100 
you might write something like increased
sales<00:04:28.210> by<00:04:29.160> 25%<00:04:30.160> in<00:04:30.370> three<00:04:30.850> months<00:04:31.180> at<00:04:31.390> whatever

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
sales by 25% in three months at whatever

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.370 
sales by 25% in three months at whatever
the<00:04:32.500> company<00:04:32.830> was<00:04:33.010> by<00:04:33.610> implementing<00:04:34.479> whatever

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
the company was by implementing whatever

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.380 
the company was by implementing whatever
strategy<00:04:36.340> you<00:04:36.370> used<00:04:37.650> so<00:04:38.650> an<00:04:38.770> example<00:04:39.210> is<00:04:40.210> the

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
strategy you used so an example is the

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.510 
strategy you used so an example is the
best<00:04:40.630> way<00:04:40.870> to<00:04:41.110> prove<00:04:41.560> that<00:04:41.890> you<00:04:42.220> can<00:04:42.400> do

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
best way to prove that you can do

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.450 
best way to prove that you can do
something<00:04:42.760> and<00:04:43.320> if<00:04:44.320> you<00:04:44.440> can<00:04:44.650> use<00:04:44.830> numbers<00:04:45.250> as

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
something and if you can use numbers as

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.959 
something and if you can use numbers as
in<00:04:45.790> this<00:04:45.940> case<00:04:46.510> so<00:04:47.350> much<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.919> better

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:48.969 
in this case so much the better
