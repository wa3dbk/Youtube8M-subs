was<00:00:27.990> rumored<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.320> come<00:00:28.500> over<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.740> couple<00:00:28.920> of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
was rumored to come over a couple of

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.710 
was rumored to come over a couple of
years<00:00:29.160> ago<00:00:29.279> there<00:00:29.550> was<00:00:29.699> speculation<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.449> and

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
years ago there was speculation and and

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.450 
years ago there was speculation and and
he<00:00:30.960> was<00:00:31.109> linked<00:00:31.320> with<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.529> LA<00:00:31.830> Galaxy<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.430> a

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
he was linked with the LA Galaxy and a

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.459 
he was linked with the LA Galaxy and a
couple<00:00:32.610> other<00:00:32.759> teams<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.719> didn't<00:00:34.079> happen

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
couple other teams that didn't happen

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.080 
couple other teams that didn't happen
and<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:35.040> think<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.550> would<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.820> been<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
and I think that would have been the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.150 
and I think that would have been the
right<00:00:36.239> time<00:00:36.300> now<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:37.230> two<00:00:37.410> years<00:00:37.649> later<00:00:37.920> I

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
right time now to the two years later I

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.889 
right time now to the two years later I
just<00:00:38.219> don't<00:00:38.700> see<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.149> don't<00:00:39.210> think<00:00:39.390> his<00:00:39.660> legs

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
just don't see it I don't think his legs

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.869 
just don't see it I don't think his legs
are<00:00:40.050> there<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.980> guy<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.430> extremely

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
are there it's a guy that is extremely

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.590 
are there it's a guy that is extremely
talented<00:00:42.180> but<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:43.020> also<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.350> guy<00:00:43.590> who<00:00:43.649> has<00:00:44.040> had

years ago and you know when he was at

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.690 
years ago and you know when he was at
his<00:01:07.860> prime<00:01:09.080> DeMarcus<00:01:10.080> Beasley<00:01:10.110> becomes<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.890> DP

we're<00:02:22.960> talking<00:02:23.200> about<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.380> better<00:02:23.530> player<00:02:24.010> how

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
we're talking about a better player how

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.150 
we're talking about a better player how
many<00:02:25.090> years<00:02:25.270> ago<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.800> don't<00:02:26.800> think<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.040> could

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
many years ago I don't think you could

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.800 
many years ago I don't think you could
get<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.340> run<00:02:27.520> in<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.640> field<00:02:27.820> anymore<00:02:27.970> their<00:02:28.360> MLS

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
get a run in the field anymore their MLS

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.810 
get a run in the field anymore their MLS
I<00:02:29.050> think<00:02:29.500> it's<00:02:29.620> going<00:02:29.920> past<00:02:30.190> this<00:02:30.400> type<00:02:30.640> of

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
I think it's going past this type of

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.770 
I think it's going past this type of
player<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.270> really<00:02:32.050> do<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:33.090> get<00:02:34.090> all<00:02:34.210> stands<00:02:34.570> up

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
do it and to me it's more of a question

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.520 
do it and to me it's more of a question
as<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.670> what<00:03:07.000> MLS<00:03:07.600> wants<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.050> do<00:03:08.230> with<00:03:08.410> this

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
as to what MLS wants to do with this

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.740 
as to what MLS wants to do with this
designated<00:03:09.190> players<00:03:09.459> yeah<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.030> I<00:03:10.330> still

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
designated players yeah and I still

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.650 
designated players yeah and I still
think<00:03:11.170> that<00:03:11.380> as<00:03:11.890> Paul<00:03:12.250> said<00:03:12.610> that<00:03:12.820> MLS<00:03:13.420> needs

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
think that as Paul said that MLS needs

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.140 
think that as Paul said that MLS needs
to<00:03:13.810> move<00:03:13.959> past<00:03:14.410> their<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:15.100> idea<00:03:15.670> of<00:03:15.940> bringing

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
to move past their the idea of bringing

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.050 
to move past their the idea of bringing
players<00:03:16.720> at<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.170> end<00:03:17.320> of<00:03:17.470> their<00:03:17.590> career<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:18.850> sec

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
players at the end of their career a sec

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.180 
players at the end of their career a sec
so<00:03:19.269> I<00:03:19.570> I<00:03:19.750> know<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:20.350> but<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.530> think<00:03:20.650> that<00:03:20.950> Frank

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
so I I know that but I think that Frank

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.820 
so I I know that but I think that Frank
Lampard<00:03:21.640> has<00:03:21.730> taken<00:03:22.060> care<00:03:22.209> of<00:03:22.500> in<00:03:23.500> your<00:03:23.620> has

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
Lampard has taken care of in your has

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.289 
Lampard has taken care of in your has
well<00:03:24.130> know<00:03:24.580> Robbie<00:03:24.850> Keane<00:03:25.030> is<00:03:25.120> still<00:03:25.269> a

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
well know Robbie Keane is still a

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.180 
well know Robbie Keane is still a
productive<00:03:25.780> player<00:03:26.019> yeah<00:03:26.380> but<00:03:26.560> if<00:03:26.680> you<00:03:26.739> say<00:03:26.860> it

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
productive player yeah but if you say it

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.530 
productive player yeah but if you say it
was<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.340> wrong<00:03:27.610> end<00:03:27.790> of<00:03:27.940> his<00:03:28.030> career<00:03:28.180> when<00:03:28.420> he

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
was the wrong end of his career when he

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.009 
was the wrong end of his career when he
came<00:03:28.750> but<00:03:30.180> yeah<00:03:31.180> he's<00:03:31.330> a<00:03:31.360> productive<00:03:31.870> player

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
came but yeah he's a productive player

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.830 
came but yeah he's a productive player
and<00:03:32.440> I'm<00:03:32.650> sure<00:03:32.830> Frank<00:03:33.130> will<00:03:33.340> be<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.660> I'm
