00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
so this is the 131 half-court trap so

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.589 
so this is the 131 half-court trap so
the<00:00:03.600> way<00:00:03.750> this<00:00:03.959> is<00:00:04.020> gonna<00:00:04.230> look<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:08.480> it's<00:00:09.480> not

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
the way this is gonna look is it's not

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.570 
the way this is gonna look is it's not
really<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.349> 131<00:00:11.330> to<00:00:12.330> start<00:00:12.630> but<00:00:13.440> it's<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:14.040> same

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
really a 131 to start but it's the same

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.660 
really a 131 to start but it's the same
ideas<00:00:15.030> are<00:00:15.240> half<00:00:15.420> full<00:00:15.599> n31<00:00:16.130> so<00:00:17.130> we're<00:00:17.490> trying

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
ideas are half full n31 so we're trying

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:25.240 
ideas are half full n31 so we're trying
to<00:00:17.789> get<00:00:17.940> traps<00:00:20.119> here<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.449> here<00:00:23.420> five<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
to get traps here and here five is the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.380 
to get traps here and here five is the
sort<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.310> safety<00:00:26.490> guy<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.939> stops<00:00:27.240> layups<00:00:28.279> and

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
sort of safety guy that stops layups and

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.730 
sort of safety guy that stops layups and
one<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.689> trying<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.080> pressure<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> ball<00:00:31.529> other

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
one is trying to pressure the ball other

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.459 
one is trying to pressure the ball other
side<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> end<00:00:32.340> down<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> ball<00:00:33.320> you<00:00:34.320> can

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
side so the end down the ball you can

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.160 
side so the end down the ball you can
only<00:00:34.590> see<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.829> embedder<00:00:35.100> but<00:00:35.340> here's<00:00:36.170> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
only see the embedder but here's the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.660 
only see the embedder but here's the
inbound<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.530> ball<00:00:39.649> and<00:00:40.649> one's<00:00:41.460> not

pressuring<00:00:42.059> super<00:00:42.329> hard

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
pressuring super hard

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.529 
pressuring super hard
he's<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:43.550> funneling<00:00:44.550> face<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.270> funneling

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
he's just funneling face of funneling

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.959 
he's just funneling face of funneling
just<00:00:45.750> means<00:00:45.930> don't<00:00:46.680> let<00:00:46.739> him<00:00:46.920> go<00:00:47.100> right<00:00:47.610> up<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
just means don't let him go right up the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.729 
just means don't let him go right up the
middle<00:00:48.079> because<00:00:49.079> then<00:00:49.230> we're<00:00:49.320> not<00:00:49.379> gonna<00:00:49.500> get

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
middle because then we're not gonna get

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.430 
middle because then we're not gonna get
a<00:00:49.800> trap<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.059> funnel<00:00:51.539> by<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:52.020> getting<00:00:52.170> up

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
a trap so you funnel by just getting up

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.189 
a trap so you funnel by just getting up
on<00:00:52.620> them<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.699> if<00:00:54.690> he<00:00:54.809> starts<00:00:55.020> to

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
on them like this and if he starts to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.760 
on them like this and if he starts to
sprint<00:00:55.530> then<00:00:55.710> go<00:00:55.860> into<00:00:56.070> turn<00:00:56.780> but<00:00:57.780> you're

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
sprint then go into turn but you're

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.200 
sprint then go into turn but you're
funneling<00:00:59.190> following<00:00:59.520> funneling<00:00:59.879> funneling

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
funneling following funneling funneling

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.240 
funneling following funneling funneling
funneling<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.780> three<00:01:01.590> what<00:01:01.800> you're<00:01:01.920> doing<00:01:02.160> is

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
this guy back here right and then what

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.330 
this guy back here right and then what
happens<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.590> as<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.310> guy<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.520> going<00:01:08.880> up<00:01:09.119> here

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
happens is as this guy is going up here

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.850 
happens is as this guy is going up here
okay<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.580> one<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.060> being<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.900> funneling<00:01:13.380> this

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
okay as one is being it's funneling this

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.249 
okay as one is being it's funneling this
is<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.040> ball<00:01:14.189> over<00:01:14.340> here

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
is the ball over here

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.980 
is the ball over here
two<00:01:16.259> should<00:01:16.650> be<00:01:16.740> sneaking<00:01:17.310> down<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.759> way

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
two should be sneaking down this way

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.870 
two should be sneaking down this way
okay<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.460> when<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:23.040> trap<00:01:23.250> happens<00:01:23.700> so

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
okay so that when the trap happens so

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.570 
okay so that when the trap happens so
the<00:01:23.939> ball<00:01:24.150> crosses<00:01:24.509> half-court<00:01:25.280> three<00:01:26.280> goes

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
the ball crosses half-court three goes

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.830 
the ball crosses half-court three goes
this<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.210> all<00:01:27.299> happening<00:01:27.450> at<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.659> same<00:01:27.780> time

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
this is all happening at the same time

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.969 
this is all happening at the same time
it<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.229> really<00:01:28.320> don't<00:01:28.530> have<00:01:28.590> enough<00:01:28.799> hands

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
it can really don't have enough hands

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.390 
it can really don't have enough hands
but<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.329> happening<00:01:30.920> okay<00:01:31.950> four<00:01:32.310> is

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
but we have this happening okay four is

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.100 
but we have this happening okay four is
taking<00:01:32.729> away<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> easy<00:01:33.299> release<00:01:33.540> pass<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
taking away the easy release pass in the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.690 
taking away the easy release pass in the
middle<00:01:34.320> before<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.250> got<00:01:35.340> all<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.610> this

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
sneaks here because that will be how we

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.429 
sneaks here because that will be how we
give<00:01:44.490> up<00:01:44.640> layups<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.689> come<00:01:45.869> into<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.079> trap<00:01:46.290> we

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
give up layups you come into the trap we

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.679 
give up layups you come into the trap we
don't<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.740> trap<00:01:46.920> set<00:01:47.130> beautifully<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.850> a
