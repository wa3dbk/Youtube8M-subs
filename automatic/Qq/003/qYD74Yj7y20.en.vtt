00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
today's the launch event of the

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.990 
today's the launch event of the
microphone<00:00:17.080> to<00:00:17.260> 100<00:00:17.530> speed<00:00:17.950> Edition<00:00:18.369> this<00:00:18.880> is

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
microphone to 100 speed Edition this is

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.359 
microphone to 100 speed Edition this is
the<00:00:19.090> next-generation<00:00:19.949> microphone<00:00:20.949> versions

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
the next-generation microphone versions

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.010 
the next-generation microphone versions
and<00:00:21.640> the<00:00:22.000> step

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
and the step

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:30.960 
and the step
really<00:00:23.740> really<00:00:23.920> fast<00:00:24.450> well<00:00:25.450> bit<00:00:26.020> quick

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.429 

one<00:00:31.570> tell<00:00:31.720> us<00:00:31.750> a<00:00:31.810> bit<00:00:31.900> about<00:00:31.990> the<00:00:32.169> technology

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
one tell us a bit about the technology

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.900 
one tell us a bit about the technology
where<00:00:32.890> it's<00:00:33.010> been<00:00:33.220> engineering<00:00:33.670> stuff

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
where it's been engineering stuff

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.880 
where it's been engineering stuff
because<00:00:34.450> the<00:00:34.690> microphone<00:00:35.140> is<00:00:35.380> a<00:00:35.410> series<00:00:35.860> of

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
because the microphone is a series of

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.440 
because the microphone is a series of
bones<00:00:36.280> that<00:00:36.400> we<00:00:36.580> make<00:00:36.760> in<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.060> last<00:00:37.150> five

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
bones that we make in the last five

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.010 
bones that we make in the last five
years<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.980> is<00:00:39.130> a<00:00:39.160> 6<00:00:39.489> axis<00:00:39.880> gyro<00:00:39.910> that's<00:00:40.750> very

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
years this is a 6 axis gyro that's very

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.710 
years this is a 6 axis gyro that's very
stable<00:00:41.500> and<00:00:42.190> it<00:00:42.309> has<00:00:42.460> very<00:00:42.820> very<00:00:42.850> fast<00:00:43.239> motors

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
stable and it has very very fast motors

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.729 
stable and it has very very fast motors
and<00:00:43.960> senses<00:00:44.770> to<00:00:44.890> stabilize<00:00:45.309> your<00:00:45.700> flying<00:00:45.940> and

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.340 

control<00:00:50.739> a<00:00:51.519> long<00:00:51.730> range<00:00:51.970> of<00:00:52.059> 120<00:00:52.690> meters<00:00:52.930> it

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
control a long range of 120 meters it

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.290 
control a long range of 120 meters it
also<00:00:53.470> makes<00:00:53.800> it<00:00:53.890> very<00:00:53.949> responsive<00:00:54.640> so<00:00:55.059> you<00:00:55.150> go

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
also makes it very responsive so you go

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.450 
also makes it very responsive so you go
outside<00:00:55.480> Anna<00:00:56.050> knocks<00:00:56.290> off<00:00:56.470> and<00:00:56.739> inside<00:00:57.129> we

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
outside Anna knocks off and inside we

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.250 
outside Anna knocks off and inside we
are<00:00:57.489> getting<00:00:57.790> blown<00:00:57.970> away<00:00:58.180> time<00:00:58.449> to<00:00:58.570> get<00:00:58.690> blown

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
are getting blown away time to get blown

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.209 
are getting blown away time to get blown
away<00:00:59.410> by<00:00:59.470> the<00:00:59.590> wind<00:01:00.600> by<00:01:01.600> sunlight<00:01:02.019> Fred<00:01:03.010> does

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
away by the wind by sunlight Fred does

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.799 
away by the wind by sunlight Fred does
okay<00:01:03.910> is<00:01:04.000> there<00:01:04.059> any<00:01:04.210> sort<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:04.509> built-in

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
okay is there any sort of built-in

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.200 
okay is there any sort of built-in
tricks<00:01:05.229> or<00:01:05.500> things<00:01:05.680> that<00:01:05.860> it<00:01:05.979> can<00:01:06.100> do<00:01:06.280> yes<00:01:07.030> so

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
tricks or things that it can do yes so

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.790 
tricks or things that it can do yes so
there's<00:01:07.420> a<00:01:07.509> stunt<00:01:07.899> mode<00:01:08.110> and<00:01:08.290> in<00:01:08.350> regular<00:01:08.649> mode

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
there's a stunt mode and in regular mode

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.740 
there's a stunt mode and in regular mode
since<00:01:09.039> son<00:01:09.310> mode<00:01:09.520> when<00:01:09.940> you<00:01:10.000> pop<00:01:10.240> in<00:01:10.330> some<00:01:10.539> mode

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
since son mode when you pop in some mode

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.410 
since son mode when you pop in some mode
where<00:01:11.140> gives<00:01:11.320> it<00:01:11.410> a<00:01:11.470> back<00:01:11.800> or<00:01:12.340> front<00:01:12.729> lever<00:01:13.060> or

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
where gives it a back or front lever or

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.930 
where gives it a back or front lever or
a<00:01:13.450> left<00:01:13.750> lip<00:01:14.020> or<00:01:14.229> five<00:01:14.530> left<00:01:14.830> and<00:01:15.369> then<00:01:15.490> that's

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
a left lip or five left and then that's

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.150 
a left lip or five left and then that's
automatic<00:01:16.390> but<00:01:16.869> with<00:01:17.289> a<00:01:17.320> speed<00:01:17.680> addition<00:01:17.979> it's

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
automatic but with a speed addition it's

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.700 
automatic but with a speed addition it's
so<00:01:18.369> fast<00:01:18.700> you<00:01:19.000> also<00:01:19.180> do<00:01:19.390> those<00:01:19.570> lips<00:01:20.080> manually

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
so fast you also do those lips manually

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.469 
so fast you also do those lips manually
and<00:01:21.039> nothing's<00:01:21.490> with<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.759> skill<00:01:24.330> what<00:01:25.330> about

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
and nothing's with the skill what about

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.749 
and nothing's with the skill what about
the<00:01:25.570> camera<00:01:25.930> so<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:26.770> camera<00:01:27.160> climbs<00:01:27.640> the

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
the camera so the camera climbs the

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.110 
the camera so the camera climbs the
