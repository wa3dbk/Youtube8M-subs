00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.230
 more than half of all men and four out of ten women suffer 

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:08.880
 some form of hair loss during your life while there are countless 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.160
 treatments that prevent hair loss there is none that makes 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.309
 grow back 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.000
 but for those who fight baldness 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.080
 the help could be on the way 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.500
 researchers from the University of California said that interview mind 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.210
 They came up with a powerful compound to grow their hair while they examined 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.859
 stress in mice 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.500
 Dr. Miguel Monay Diet says that he and his team were studying how 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.440
 stress affects gastrointestinal function 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.270
 with mice that had been genetically modified to produce 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.570
 in excess a stress hormone called the releasing factor 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.870
 corticotropin 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.510
 the genetically modified mice lost their hair on their backs like 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.540
 if they were staying charges 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.150
 but while the researchers monitored the treatment of 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.760
 animals made an amazing find a few we realized 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.489
 that some of these mice that were decorated with a blocker 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.210
 stress hormone receptor three months after agreeing that 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.670
 be completely the lane 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.939
 that was a surprise for us we were not prepared 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.990
 the stress hormone blocker known as as trencin de 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.350
 has strong and lasting effects on hair growth among mice 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.990
 bald was so effective that they could no longer distinguish themselves from the rest of 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.290
 winchester starters the antagonist that we injected was minimal 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.780
 the tc micrograms 100 million and more than a gram a single injection per 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.469
 day for five days 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:41.469
 they were enough to reverse hair loss 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.460
 reinforced the question now is whether the castria synde will have the same 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.520
 results in humans because the time because it is a stroke and functions 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.840
 human beings 1 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.730
 it's something that we're very interested in knowing 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.900
 for now we do not know it 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.500
 but some evidence gives us hope that the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.090
 jorge ortiz pieces but for all the causes of hair loss but 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.630
 at least for those that are related to stress that are 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.249
 other councilors etc 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:12.329
 to do it 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.930
 this is enough says the doctor eta world to justify a greater 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.999
 research he says that while an effective treatment for baldness 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:24.080
 can be found many years away 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.500
 his lab mice have opened a new door for his research
