00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.660
 good let's apply vale is a cost 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:11.480
 of base layers is worth what we do is 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.480
 do a session with the line in between 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.550
 and now let's take from the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.550
 line one finger to the right 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.960
 and one finger to the left 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.680
 we're going to take it up to 90 degrees 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.180
 and we mark our nightmare 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.690
 we go back to the part of the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.690
 fingers above the crown 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.320
 this will be our goal mine now 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.320
 let's go back to the lesson 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.400
 now we take a partition of a finger and 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.430
 medium and we're going to raise it up to 90 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.430
 degrees 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.920
 our goal we do 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.000
 come on and now we take old wick 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.900
 let's comment to 26 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.300
 old wick 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.300
 with that new 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.880
 until we got to the back 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.880
 of the bees 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.910
 now the monthly payment we have made 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.910
 before we take 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.140
 and we passed it to the right side 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.350
 same 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.190
 we touch the wrist 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.190
 and the same 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.260
 but we're going 90 degrees 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.140
 provided that our goal day is in the 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.560
 tip so that the cut is cleaner and 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.560
 more straight 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.130
 we leave 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.380
 of those old news 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.420
 same old 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.970
 and you'll always have a message to share 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.800
 of the bad central guide table 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.140
 transparency then always stop 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.670
 suspense towards then by themes the evil 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.319
 perfect weather 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.319
 same the couple 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.330
 if we raise 6 raise both sides 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.390
 yes 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:59.070
 it is a perfect cut perfect cut the 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.070
 two sides even cut people 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:07.110
 now when sex calls the sides 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.110
 let's take it back 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:16.709
 in the middle 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:19.670
 we mark it and we are going to open a kind 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.670
 of triangulito 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.310
 and we will take it 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.310
 up now let's have the mer left 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.880
 from before just what 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.180
 we do is match it 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.180
 to the place 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.410
 if they were low orange 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.370
 we're going to go with two sections 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.130
 very finite remember is always very 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.620
 finite because when you get a lot 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.300
 amount of hair when wearing everything for 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.340
 the middle the sides that are going to be 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.080
 longer then the sections 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.340
 always be a finger and a half like 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.340
 much 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.340
 two 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.790
 we do not follow 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.790
 of that old immense new 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:18.319
 we go 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.860
 old new wick 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:30.719
 and one doubt that everyone has is 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.060
 that we pass the hair that is down 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:37.349
 the hair that falls down as it is already 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.629
 shorter it's worth the same fall you already 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:41.460
 it is gradually worth you can you 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:43.729
 force it up if it does not reach you not you 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.729
 you arrive 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.689
 and because I know what it's like to be always at 90 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.229
 degrees 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:54.989
 because to raise everything up when 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:59.759
 loose the hair falls naturally 

00:05:54.989 --> 00:06:01.349
 if you catch it if you're not altering 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.779
 its natural shape then the layers are 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:06.150
 my part is highlighted as other 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:08.900
 flowers 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.900
 to the back of the ear 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.940
 we are going to 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.370
 the same and now we take wick well 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.810
 made new before the ear to 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.810
 see if it matches the other side 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.080
 match 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.830
 and now the same the other operation for 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.830
 the same side 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.160
 we go 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.490
 instead of this old new wick 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.220
 we leave them 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:17.389
 We've already arrived here kicked out of the gate and 

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:17.389
 let's see match the result 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:31.289
 and we already have a cut of caparrÃ³s 

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:34.039
 look how I feel the sides of everything 

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:34.039
 everything matches 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.740
 and it's a cut that always matches and 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.740
 always has two wicks dayz vale
