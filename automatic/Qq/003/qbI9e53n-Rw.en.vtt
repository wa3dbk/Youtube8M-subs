we're going to go in the third one this
is<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.209> third<00:03:40.419> space<00:03:42.569> and<00:03:44.340> that's<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.549> fourth

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
is the third space and that's the fourth

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.069 
is the third space and that's the fourth
one<00:03:45.940> now<00:03:46.599> when<00:03:47.109> you<00:03:47.290> create<00:03:47.530> a<00:03:48.069> block<00:03:49.079> you're

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
one now when you create a block you're

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.409 
one now when you create a block you're
going<00:03:50.379> to<00:03:50.500> go<00:03:50.650> into<00:03:50.919> because<00:03:51.730> this<00:03:52.060> is<00:03:52.239> going

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
going to go into because this is going

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.960 
going to go into because this is going
to<00:03:52.510> be<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.720> block<00:03:53.109> over<00:03:53.349> a<00:03:53.560> space<00:03:53.949> so<00:03:54.730> you're

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
to be a block over a space so you're

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.449 
to be a block over a space so you're
going<00:03:55.209> to<00:03:55.389> use<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:55.810> chain<00:03:56.319> space<00:03:56.650> as<00:03:56.859> your

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
going to use that chain space as your

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.770 
going to use that chain space as your
stitch<00:03:57.819> so<00:03:58.449> you're<00:03:58.599> going<00:03:58.780> to<00:03:58.930> double<00:03:59.230> crochet

piece you just keep repeating it so you

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.909 
piece you just keep repeating it so you
see<00:05:03.070> where<00:05:03.250> your<00:05:03.400> repeat<00:05:03.790> is<00:05:04.120> and<00:05:04.410> going<00:05:05.410> going

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
see where your repeat is and going going

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.379 
see where your repeat is and going going
across<00:05:06.160> the<00:05:06.430> bottom<00:05:06.729> for<00:05:06.880> your<00:05:06.940> stitches<00:05:07.360> and

the<00:05:07.630> repeat<00:05:07.990> up<00:05:08.200> here<00:05:08.530> so<00:05:08.770> if<00:05:09.070> we<00:05:09.280> would<00:05:09.669> have

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
the repeat up here so if we would have

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.580 
the repeat up here so if we would have
gone<00:05:10.150> on<00:05:10.510> we<00:05:10.780> would<00:05:10.930> have<00:05:10.960> flipped<00:05:11.260> the<00:05:11.380> bunny

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
gone on we would have flipped the bunny
