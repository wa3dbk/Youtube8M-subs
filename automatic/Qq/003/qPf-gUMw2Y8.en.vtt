00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
well now when I first started I started

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.500 
well now when I first started I started
off<00:00:52.199> with<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.559> cylindrical<00:00:52.890> bucket<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:54.300> this

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
off with a cylindrical bucket now this

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.869 
off with a cylindrical bucket now this
bucket<00:00:54.930> doesn't<00:00:55.379> really<00:00:55.710> serve<00:00:56.399> any<00:00:56.610> other

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
purpose except to hold water and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.420 
purpose except to hold water and
solution<00:00:59.609> I<00:01:00.739> didn't<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> bucket<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
solution I didn't have a bucket on a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.939

felt<00:01:02.760> when<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.059> first<00:01:03.390> started<00:01:03.799> just<00:01:04.799> like

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
felt when I first started just like

usually<00:01:05.610> most<00:01:06.060> people<00:01:06.450> don't<00:01:06.630> they<00:01:06.930> just<00:01:07.080> get

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
usually most people don't they just get

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.920 
usually most people don't they just get
some<00:01:08.460> squeegees<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.240> bucket<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.659> they<00:01:09.750> just

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
some squeegees in a bucket and they just

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.350 
some squeegees in a bucket and they just
go<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> town<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.710> as<00:01:11.100> they<00:01:11.220> learn<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.790> know

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
go to town and as they learn you know

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.149 
go to town and as they learn you know
it's<00:01:12.930> good<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.170> get<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.409> bucket<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.860> belt<00:01:14.070> but

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
it's good to get a bucket on a belt but

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.749 
it's good to get a bucket on a belt but
this<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.400> what<00:01:14.549> I've<00:01:14.640> started<00:01:14.909> with<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:16.759> you

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
this is what I've started with and you

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.520 
this is what I've started with and you
know<00:01:17.880> besides<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.570> holding<00:01:18.930> solutions<00:01:19.409> you

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
know besides just holding solutions you

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.319 
know besides just holding solutions you
might

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.940 

for<00:01:25.329> the<00:01:25.390> most<00:01:25.539> part<00:01:25.659> this<00:01:25.899> is<00:01:26.020> very<00:01:26.259> basic<00:01:26.469> I

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
for the most part this is very basic I

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.840 
for the most part this is very basic I
wouldn't<00:01:27.609> suggest<00:01:27.850> this<00:01:28.390> kind<00:01:28.659> of<00:01:28.719> bucket

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
wouldn't suggest this kind of bucket

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.280 
wouldn't suggest this kind of bucket
now<00:01:31.850> this<00:01:32.150> bug<00:01:32.390> it<00:01:32.570> might<00:01:32.780> serve<00:01:33.049> a<00:01:33.080> good

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
now this bug it might serve a good

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.810 
now this bug it might serve a good

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.610 
quick access
so<00:04:23.670> I'm<00:04:23.790> time<00:04:24.030> to<00:04:24.150> just<00:04:24.330> pop<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.170> off

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
so I'm time to just pop it off

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.570 
so I'm time to just pop it off
go<00:04:26.310> get<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.610> handle<00:04:27.650> and<00:04:28.650> with<00:04:28.950> this<00:04:29.130> one

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
go get the handle and with this one

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.250 
go get the handle and with this one
I'm<00:04:29.670> using<00:04:30.030> at<00:04:30.330> or<00:04:30.450> wide<00:04:30.630> channels<00:04:31.050> for<00:04:31.200> the

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
I'm using at or wide channels for the

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.750 
I'm using at or wide channels for the
most<00:04:31.410> part<00:04:31.740> they<00:04:31.920> fill<00:04:32.310> up<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.850> entire<00:04:33.240> slot

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
most part they fill up the entire slot

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.780 
most part they fill up the entire slot
you<00:04:35.760> can<00:04:35.820> see<00:04:36.440> these<00:04:37.440> slots<00:04:37.950> are<00:04:38.250> pretty<00:04:38.520> big

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
you can see these slots are pretty big

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.370 
you can see these slots are pretty big
so<00:04:39.390> if<00:04:39.510> you<00:04:39.660> had<00:04:39.840> regular<00:04:40.320> channels<00:04:42.140> you<00:04:43.140> could

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
so if you had regular channels you could

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.960 
so if you had regular channels you could
fit<00:04:45.050> about<00:04:46.050> two<00:04:46.530> channel<00:04:47.100> regular<00:04:47.580> channels

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
fit about two channel regular channels

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.940 
fit about two channel regular channels
in<00:04:48.120> each<00:04:48.300> slot<00:04:48.690> so<00:04:49.080> if<00:04:49.230> you<00:04:49.350> wanted<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.740> put

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
in each slot so if you wanted to put

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.860 
in each slot so if you wanted to put
your<00:04:50.160> other<00:04:50.640> channels<00:04:51.120> in<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.330> slot<00:04:51.570> and

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
your other channels in the slot and

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.600 
your other channels in the slot and
carry<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.740> one<00:04:52.890> with<00:04:53.040> the<00:04:53.160> handle<00:04:53.490> right

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
carry the one with the handle right

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.020 
carry the one with the handle right
there<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:54.390> could<00:04:54.660> and<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:55.650> can<00:04:55.830> hold<00:04:56.070> I<00:04:56.370> put

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
there you could and you can hold I put

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.000 
there you could and you can hold I put
it<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.540> farther<00:04:57.810> side<00:04:58.050> go<00:04:58.230> up<00:04:58.260> in<00:04:58.440> size<00:04:58.650> is<00:04:58.890> an

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
it the farther side go up in size is an

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.180 
it the farther side go up in size is an
18<00:04:59.370> inch<00:04:59.490> scrubber<00:04:59.910> and<00:05:00.300> then<00:05:00.830> you<00:05:01.830> might<00:05:02.040> be

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
18 inch scrubber and then you might be

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.640 
18 inch scrubber and then you might be
able<00:05:02.250> to<00:05:02.370> go<00:05:02.910> bigger<00:05:03.470> but

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
able to go bigger but

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.000 
able to go bigger but
her<00:05:05.860> support<00:05:06.190> bucket

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.040 

that's<00:05:09.640> pretty<00:05:09.880> much<00:05:10.060> it<00:05:10.540> these<00:05:10.750> are<00:05:10.930> your
