00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.479
 Now the beans are washed. 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.689
 leave it here on the separate side 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.610
 We'll get the garlic and fry it already. 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.259

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.610

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.030
 he will put the beans is the people 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.890
 chose white beans ac because we 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:49.479

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.479
 black on the back of the water thing 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.579
 the amount of water will vary from 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.560
 according to the number of games was 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.489
 cooked here we go with a team 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.069

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.810
 starts now that the noise has started already in the 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.160
 pressure cooker that will lower a 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.690
 little fire 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.709
 You're seeing this bay leaf here. 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.730

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:36.069

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.670
 I do the rice in the packaging of the 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.650
 rice already has a way of preparation 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.209

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.380

 I'll take the rice first and you'll wash it first. 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:26.659
 Put the face in the pan 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.470
 now you put a cup and a half of 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:33.090

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.180
 important part of this recipe is 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.020

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.270

 of our the end the 5 little snout 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.940
 I think it will fall 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.919

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:39.050
