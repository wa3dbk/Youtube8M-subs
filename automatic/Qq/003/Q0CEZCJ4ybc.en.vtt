video<00:00:02.300> today<00:00:03.300> I'm<00:00:03.389> working<00:00:03.659> on<00:00:03.720> my<00:00:03.870> 99<00:00:04.410> Mazda

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.570 
video today I'm working on my 99 Mazda
Miata<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.779> I'm<00:00:06.779> replacing<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.859> cap<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:10.580> has

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
Miata and I'm replacing a cap that has

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.140 
Miata and I'm replacing a cap that has
been<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.509> believe<00:00:13.110> supposedly<00:00:14.040> causing<00:00:14.610> an<00:00:14.820> oil

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
been I believe supposedly causing an oil

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.290 
been I believe supposedly causing an oil
leak<00:00:15.450> leak<00:00:15.870> on<00:00:16.560> my<00:00:16.740> 99<00:00:17.250> yacht<00:00:17.490> it's<00:00:17.789> not<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.000> huge

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
leak leak on my 99 yacht it's not a huge

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.960 
leak leak on my 99 yacht it's not a huge
one<00:00:18.480> you'll<00:00:18.690> see<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> little<00:00:19.140> drop<00:00:19.850> here<00:00:20.850> and

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
one you'll see a little drop here and

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.870 
one you'll see a little drop here and
there<00:00:21.150> but<00:00:21.500> still<00:00:22.500> it's<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.430> leaky<00:00:23.609> nonetheless

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
there but still it's a leaky nonetheless

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.310 
there but still it's a leaky nonetheless
and<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.510> kind<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.779> want<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.990> get<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.170> fixed

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
and I kind of want to get it fixed

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.820 
and I kind of want to get it fixed
because<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:26.099> might<00:00:26.609> be<00:00:26.640> losing<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.150> little<00:00:27.240> oil

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
because I might be losing a little oil

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.729 
because I might be losing a little oil
between<00:00:28.830> every<00:00:29.099> oil<00:00:29.250> change<00:00:30.890> so<00:00:32.360> the<00:00:33.360> part<00:00:34.290> is

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
between every oil change so the part is

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.670 
between every oil change so the part is
actually<00:00:35.489> right<00:00:36.360> here<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> culprit

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
actually right here this is the culprit

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.770 
actually right here this is the culprit
and<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.850> believe<00:00:39.329> so

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
and I believe so

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
and I believe so
at<00:00:39.840> least<00:00:40.550> I'm<00:00:41.550> replacing<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.210> now<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.800> if

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
at least I'm replacing it now so if

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.490 
at least I'm replacing it now so if
there's<00:00:44.250> no<00:00:44.430> leak<00:00:44.670> afterwards<00:00:45.329> all<00:00:46.050> assume

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
there's no leak afterwards all assume

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.900 
there's no leak afterwards all assume
that<00:00:46.710> was<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.039> but<00:00:47.870> this<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.050> actually<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.469> cat

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
that was it but this is actually a cat

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.819 
that was it but this is actually a cat
where<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.590> cam<00:00:52.610> angle<00:00:53.610> sensor<00:00:54.030> used<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.199> on

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
where the cam angle sensor used to be on

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.250 
where the cam angle sensor used to be on
these<00:00:56.070> engines<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.699> 99<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> 2005<00:00:58.230> I

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
these engines the 99 to the 2005 I

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.349 
these engines the 99 to the 2005 I
believe<00:00:58.789> they<00:00:59.789> just<00:01:00.300> replaced<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:02.760> part<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
believe they just replaced the part the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.030 
believe they just replaced the part the
exhaust<00:01:03.719> side<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> engine<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.739> little

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
exhaust side of the engine with little

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.840 
exhaust side of the engine with little
cap<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:06.320> on<00:01:07.320> further<00:01:07.770> inspection<00:01:08.189> when<00:01:08.790> I

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
cap and on further inspection when I

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.370 
cap and on further inspection when I
took<00:01:09.060> out<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.420> cap<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.840> could<00:01:10.020> see<00:01:10.200> like

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
took out this cap I could see like

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.710 
took out this cap I could see like
towards<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> bottom<00:01:11.460> there<00:01:12.119> was<00:01:12.299> definitely

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
towards the bottom there was definitely

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.260 
towards the bottom there was definitely
oil<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.200> went<00:01:13.560> all<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.770> way<00:01:13.920> down<00:01:14.220> there<00:01:14.490> so

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
oil that went all the way down there so

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.620 
oil that went all the way down there so
I<00:01:15.299> believe<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> culprit<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.570> how<00:01:18.570> to

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
I believe this is the culprit but how to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.770 
I believe this is the culprit but how to
get<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.909> I'll<00:01:20.909> show<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.540> right<00:01:21.720> now

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
get to it I'll show you right now

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.810 
get to it I'll show you right now
actually<00:01:22.290> I'll<00:01:23.250> be<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.549> just<00:01:23.909> got<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.270> out<00:01:24.509> but

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
actually I'll be I just got this out but

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:33.350 
actually I'll be I just got this out but
so<00:01:27.229> don't<00:01:28.229> want<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.439> get<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.299> okay<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.360> had

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
so don't want to get that okay so I had

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.929 
so don't want to get that okay so I had
to<00:01:33.630> take<00:01:33.869> out<00:01:34.110> let's<00:01:35.009> see<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:35.579> going<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.820> be

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
to take out let's see it's going to be

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.490 
to take out let's see it's going to be
right<00:01:36.150> here<00:01:38.479> there's<00:01:39.479> two<00:01:39.900> bolts<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.350> go

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
right here there's two bolts that go

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.310 
right here there's two bolts that go
right<00:01:40.950> here<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.700> see<00:01:41.880> one<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.689> then<00:01:43.020> two

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
right here you can see one and then two

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.710 
right here you can see one and then two
and<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.649> think<00:01:43.860> these<00:01:44.009> are<00:01:44.390> twelve<00:01:45.390> millimeter

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
and I think these are twelve millimeter

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.940 
and I think these are twelve millimeter
I<00:01:46.049> believe<00:01:46.409> or<00:01:47.009> 10<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.670> then<00:01:48.680> that's<00:01:49.680> these

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
I believe or 10 and then that's these

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.520 
I believe or 10 and then that's these
two<00:01:50.220> bolts<00:01:50.520> right<00:01:50.579> here<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.180> then<00:01:51.899> there<00:01:52.350> is

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
two bolts right here and then there is

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.070 
two bolts right here and then there is
also

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
also

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:03.410 
also
this<00:01:55.800> bracket<00:02:00.350> sorry<00:02:01.520> this<00:02:02.520> bracket<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.360> is

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
this bracket sorry this bracket that is

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.520 
this bracket sorry this bracket that is
situated<00:02:04.580> right<00:02:05.580> behind<00:02:05.940> here<00:02:06.360> actually<00:02:07.350> goes

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
situated right behind here actually goes

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.730 
situated right behind here actually goes
right<00:02:07.830> behind<00:02:08.070> here<00:02:08.780> it<00:02:09.780> just<00:02:09.930> sits<00:02:10.229> there<00:02:10.350> so

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
right behind here it just sits there so

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.800 
right behind here it just sits there so
you<00:02:10.800> got<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.100> get<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.340> out<00:02:11.610> I'm<00:02:12.420> just<00:02:12.480> using

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
you got to get this out I'm just using

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.320 
you got to get this out I'm just using
the<00:02:12.990> open-ended<00:02:13.320> wrench<00:02:13.710> for<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.760> I

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
the open-ended wrench for that and I

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.570 
the open-ended wrench for that and I
believe<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.720> 12<00:02:16.110> millimeters<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:20.100> once

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
believe this is 12 millimeters and once

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.720 
believe this is 12 millimeters and once
you<00:02:20.700> get<00:02:20.820> those<00:02:21.030> out<00:02:21.270> then<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.170> just<00:02:22.380> need<00:02:22.500> to

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
you get those out then you just need to

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.790 
you get those out then you just need to
kind<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.850> pry<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.180> cap<00:02:24.570> up<00:02:24.840> because<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.530> cap

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
kind of pry the cap up because the cap

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.180 
kind of pry the cap up because the cap
is<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.250> engine<00:02:26.640> I'm<00:02:27.090> facing<00:02:27.570> this<00:02:27.870> way<00:02:27.930> and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.770 

the<00:02:32.190> easiest<00:02:32.550> way<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.730> do<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.300> know<00:02:33.420> it's

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.939 
sorry and no problems there but anyhow
that<00:04:48.580> is<00:04:48.610> it<00:04:48.940> you'll<00:04:49.930> know<00:04:50.139> that<00:04:50.169> it's<00:04:50.500> leaking

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
that is it you'll know that it's leaking

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.020 
that is it you'll know that it's leaking
because<00:04:52.380> I'm<00:04:53.380> not<00:04:53.650> quite<00:04:53.919> sure<00:04:54.070> yet<00:04:54.550> but

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
because I'm not quite sure yet but

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.409 
because I'm not quite sure yet but
you'll<00:04:55.780> see<00:04:56.050> a<00:04:56.080> little<00:04:56.410> oil<00:04:56.650> down<00:04:56.979> there

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
you'll see a little oil down there

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.710 
you'll see a little oil down there
there's<00:04:58.419> little<00:04:58.720> oil<00:04:58.979> under<00:05:00.030> right<00:05:01.030> under<00:05:01.479> the

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
there's little oil under right under the

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.430 
there's little oil under right under the
ignition<00:05:02.680> system<00:05:02.919> right<00:05:03.310> there<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:04.440> those

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
ignition system right there and those

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.189 
ignition system right there and those
coils<00:05:05.800> and<00:05:07.259> it<00:05:08.259> just<00:05:08.590> seems<00:05:08.860> like<00:05:09.750> it<00:05:10.750> might<00:05:11.050> be

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
coils and it just seems like it might be

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.310 
coils and it just seems like it might be
from<00:05:11.440> that<00:05:11.650> not<00:05:12.280> quite<00:05:12.520> sure<00:05:13.050> but<00:05:14.050> we're<00:05:14.199> gonna

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
from that not quite sure but we're gonna

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.029 
from that not quite sure but we're gonna
see<00:05:14.590> it<00:05:14.740> could<00:05:14.949> be<00:05:15.099> from<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.669> valve<00:05:16.330> cover

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
see it could be from the valve cover

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.409 
see it could be from the valve cover
actually<00:05:18.039> you<00:05:18.370> know<00:05:18.490> what<00:05:18.759> I'm<00:05:19.030> seeing<00:05:19.270> right

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
actually you know what I'm seeing right

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:20.689 
actually you know what I'm seeing right
now<00:05:19.479> that<00:05:19.810> might<00:05:19.960> be<00:05:19.990> from<00:05:20.289> the<00:05:20.320> valve<00:05:20.560> cover

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
now that might be from the valve cover

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.050 
now that might be from the valve cover
but<00:05:21.699> we'll<00:05:22.389> get<00:05:22.539> that<00:05:22.690> replaced<00:05:22.990> another<00:05:23.409> day

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
but we'll get that replaced another day

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.089 
but we'll get that replaced another day
and<00:05:25.060> if<00:05:25.539> you<00:05:25.659> have<00:05:25.810> any<00:05:25.960> questions<00:05:26.500> let<00:05:27.039> me

anything<00:05:27.970> I<00:05:28.060> can<00:05:28.240> do<00:05:28.449> to<00:05:28.570> make<00:05:28.750> the

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
anything I can do to make the

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.270 
anything I can do to make the
installation<00:05:29.169> easier<00:05:29.740> if<00:05:29.860> you're<00:05:29.949> gonna<00:05:30.070> do

installation easier if you're gonna do

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.849 
installation easier if you're gonna do
this<00:05:30.430> yourself
