00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
more info checking that all at once will

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.920 
more info checking that all at once will
allow<00:04:03.430> you<00:04:03.489> to<00:04:03.700> type<00:04:03.970> C<00:04:04.269> we<00:04:04.390> have<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.540> cursor

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
allow you to type C we have the cursor

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.890 
allow you to type C we have the cursor
now<00:04:05.280> without<00:04:06.280> it<00:04:06.430> we<00:04:06.550> don't<00:04:07.410> with<00:04:08.410> it<00:04:08.620> we<00:04:08.769> do<00:04:09.900> at

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
now without it we don't with it we do at

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.449 
now without it we don't with it we do at
this<00:04:11.080> point<00:04:11.380> when<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:11.560> touch<00:04:11.860> here<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.280> box

this point when you touch here the box
will<00:04:12.700> come<00:04:12.849> up

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:34.629 

and<00:04:25.010> when<00:04:25.340> we're<00:04:25.490> done

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.149 

power<00:04:35.270> buttons<00:04:35.659> to<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:35.930> locks<00:04:36.289> that's<00:04:36.919> a<00:04:37.009> good

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:37.159 
power buttons to the locks that's a good

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:39.640 
power buttons to the locks that's a good
idea<00:04:37.580> enable<00:04:38.180> widgets<00:04:38.539> so<00:04:38.990> we<00:04:39.110> can<00:04:39.259> see<00:04:39.439> things

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
idea enable widgets so we can see things

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.649 
idea enable widgets so we can see things
like<00:04:40.240> location<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.860> calendar<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.659> encrypt

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:44.659 
like location and calendar and encrypt

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.089 
like location and calendar and encrypt
if<00:04:44.960> you're<00:04:45.169> worried<00:04:45.439> about<00:04:45.499> it<00:04:45.710> getting<00:04:45.860> lost

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
if you're worried about it getting lost

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.059 
if you're worried about it getting lost
you<00:04:46.310> should<00:04:46.550> turn<00:04:46.669> it<00:04:46.849> on<00:04:47.590> passwords<00:04:48.590> visible

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 
you should turn it on passwords visible

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.040 
you should turn it on passwords visible
probably<00:04:49.550> it's<00:04:49.699> not<00:04:49.759> a<00:04:49.909> good<00:04:50.120> idea<00:04:50.270> probably

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
probably it's not a good idea probably

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.989 
probably it's not a good idea probably
you<00:04:51.319> should<00:04:51.560> turn<00:04:51.680> passwords<00:04:52.249> visible<00:04:54.849> and

00:04:57.989 --> 00:04:57.999 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:02.050 

that's<00:04:58.999> it<00:04:59.270> for<00:04:59.509> security<00:05:00.159> in<00:05:01.159> the<00:05:01.669> event<00:05:01.999> that

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
that's it for security in the event that

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.249 
that's it for security in the event that
