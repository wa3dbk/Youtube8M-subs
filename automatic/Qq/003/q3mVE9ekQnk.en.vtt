00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
used for cooking this is because all

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.479 
used for cooking this is because all
oils<00:00:45.260> begin<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.410> break<00:00:46.620> down<00:00:46.649> when<00:00:47.190> they<00:00:47.280> reach

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.389 
oils begin to break down when they reach
their<00:00:47.700> smoking<00:00:48.360> point<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.260> oils<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.920> get<00:00:50.129> hot

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
their smoking point so oils that get hot

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.430 
their smoking point so oils that get hot
very<00:00:50.760> quickly<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.480> reach<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.780> smoking<00:00:52.199> point
