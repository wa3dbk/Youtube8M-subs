00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:11.549 
earlier that I look very good at

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.650 
earlier that I look very good at
training<00:00:12.450> but<00:00:13.190> she<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.250> serious<00:00:14.849> enthusiasm

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
training but she is serious enthusiasm

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
a pretty good start I don't think my

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.820 
a pretty good start I don't think my
bull<00:01:46.119> should<00:01:46.540> mind<00:01:46.840> that<00:01:47.080> it<00:01:47.470> was<00:01:47.560> a<00:01:47.619> good

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830

delivery<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:49.659> short<00:01:50.170> I<00:01:50.320> would<00:01:50.500> say

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
delivery for short I would say

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.910 
delivery for short I would say
the<00:01:53.240> length<00:01:53.450> was<00:01:53.689> good<00:01:53.899> line<00:01:54.289> was<00:01:54.560> good<00:01:54.770> it

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
the length was good line was good it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.160 
the length was good line was good it
should<00:01:55.070> feel<00:01:55.280> that<00:01:55.420> okay<00:01:56.450> respond<00:01:56.899> for<00:01:57.109> a

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
boundary fair enough but I still stands

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.139 
boundary fair enough but I still stands
a<00:01:59.780> chance<00:02:00.020> if<00:02:00.229> I<00:02:00.320> ball<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:00.649> again<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:02.060> the
