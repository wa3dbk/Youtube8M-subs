00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.250 
showing them and of course we have to
see<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.230> final<00:00:34.680> hardware<00:00:35.190> cuz<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.670> too

see the final hardware cuz it's too

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.590 
see the final hardware cuz it's too
difficult<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.410> find<00:00:37.590> no<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.790> what<00:00:39.420> made<00:00:39.570> you

support project Morpheus on ps4 and we
support<00:00:52.860> oculus<00:00:53.219> rift<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.879> PC<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.469> are<00:00:55.620> not

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
support oculus rift on PC so we are not

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.240 
support oculus rift on PC so we are not
it's<00:00:56.670> not<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.260> that<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> choice<00:00:58.920> we

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.600 

the<00:01:07.260> ours

version is available for both PC and ps4
so<00:01:12.630> what<00:01:12.810> were<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.049> challenges<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:14.040> working

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
so what were the challenges of working

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.830 
so what were the challenges of working
the<00:01:14.970> VR<00:01:15.330> into<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.439> into<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> game<00:01:17.600> they<00:01:18.600> few

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the VR into the into the game they few

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.539 
the VR into the into the game they few
of<00:01:18.960> them<00:01:19.400> first<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.520> all<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.119> ice<00:01:21.270> because

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
of them first of all is you ice because

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.940 
of them first of all is you ice because
current<00:01:23.549> resolution<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.689> still<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.680> enough

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
current resolution is still not enough

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.850 
current resolution is still not enough
for<00:01:26.220> having<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.820> same<00:01:27.320> size<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> feature

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
for having the same size of the feature

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.260 
for having the same size of the feature
a<00:01:29.250> UI<00:01:29.579> feature<00:01:29.850> as<00:01:30.710> on<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.950> real<00:01:32.369> TV<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.150> real

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
a UI feature as on a real TV on the real

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.920 
a UI feature as on a real TV on the real
monitor<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.290> need<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> bigger<00:01:35.460> scale<00:01:36.060> size

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
monitor so you need a bigger scale size

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.380 
monitor so you need a bigger scale size
of<00:01:37.229> fonts<00:01:37.619> bigger<00:01:37.890> UI<00:01:38.250> elements<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.880> at<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
of fonts bigger UI elements and at the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.700 
of fonts bigger UI elements and at the
same<00:01:39.540> time<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.960> need<00:01:40.110> them<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.320> be<00:01:40.560> like

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
same time you need them to be like

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.670 
same time you need them to be like
weighted<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.369> real<00:01:41.549> space<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.439> need<00:01:43.560> to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
weighted in a real space so you need to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.440 
weighted in a real space so you need to
put<00:01:43.860> them<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.100> cylinder<00:01:44.579> beautiful<00:01:45.240> sitting

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
put them on cylinder beautiful sitting

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.960 
put them on cylinder beautiful sitting
around<00:01:45.780> or<00:01:46.049> something<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.970> otherwise

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
around or something like that otherwise

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.850 
around or something like that otherwise
it's<00:01:48.270> not<00:01:48.360> easy<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.840> use<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.350> not<00:01:49.439> easy<00:01:49.649> to

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
it's not easy to use and not easy to

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.830 
it's not easy to use and not easy to
navigate<00:01:50.180> so<00:01:51.180> that's<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.200> them

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
navigate so that's one of them

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.499 
navigate so that's one of them
issues<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.469> second<00:01:55.770> one<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.880> that's<00:01:57.299> pretty

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
issues the second one and that's pretty

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.709 
issues the second one and that's pretty
obvious<00:01:57.899> we<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.189> maintain<00:01:59.460> higher<00:02:00.390> frame

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
obvious we have to maintain higher frame

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.810 
obvious we have to maintain higher frame
rate<00:02:01.520> bigger<00:02:02.520> resolution<00:02:02.929> and<00:02:03.929> for<00:02:04.380> both<00:02:04.530> eyes

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
rate bigger resolution and for both eyes

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
rate bigger resolution and for both eyes
so<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:06.270> need<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.569> render<00:02:06.780> more<00:02:07.340> in<00:02:08.340> less<00:02:08.580> time

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
so you need to render more in less time

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.509 
so you need to render more in less time
that's<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:10.019> technical<00:02:10.470> challenge<00:02:11.150> which<00:02:12.150> is

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
that's a technical challenge which is

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.690 
that's a technical challenge which is
can<00:02:14.519> be<00:02:14.670> easily<00:02:14.879> solved<00:02:15.269> on<00:02:15.390> PC<00:02:15.780> by<00:02:15.959> basically

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
can be easily solved on PC by basically

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.580 
can be easily solved on PC by basically
asking<00:02:17.700> players<00:02:17.849> to<00:02:18.239> using<00:02:18.900> more<00:02:19.049> horsepower

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
asking players to using more horsepower

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.199 
asking players to using more horsepower
but<00:02:20.160> on<00:02:20.640> peaceful<00:02:21.269> which<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.569> fix-it<00:02:21.930> platform

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
but on peaceful which is fix-it platform

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.110 
but on peaceful which is fix-it platform
requires<00:02:24.209> force<00:02:25.200> from<00:02:25.470> engineering<00:02:25.890> side<00:02:26.310> so

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
requires force from engineering side so

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.360 
requires force from engineering side so
that<00:02:27.299> was<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.630> biggest<00:02:27.900> challenge<00:02:28.290> was<00:02:29.160> there

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
that was the biggest challenge was there

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.039 
that was the biggest challenge was there
any<00:02:29.549> difference<00:02:29.819> in<00:02:30.239> developing<00:02:30.750> for<00:02:30.930> the

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
any difference in developing for the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
different for different systems also was

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.170 
different for different systems also was
it<00:03:04.290> necessary<00:03:04.410> more<00:03:05.400> difficult<00:03:05.819> or<00:03:05.970> less

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
it necessary more difficult or less

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.930 
it necessary more difficult or less
difficult<00:03:06.389> on<00:03:07.109> other<00:03:07.500> Morpheus<00:03:07.980> it's<00:03:08.639> just

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
difficult on other Morpheus it's just

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.819 
difficult on other Morpheus it's just
different<00:03:10.310> not<00:03:11.310> first<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.239> all<00:03:12.440> oculus<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.560> not

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
different not first of all oculus is not

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.879 
different not first of all oculus is not
again<00:03:14.819> it's<00:03:15.030> not<00:03:15.150> finalized<00:03:15.720> yet<00:03:15.870> we<00:03:16.530> can<00:03:16.739> work

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
again it's not finalized yet we can work

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.910 
again it's not finalized yet we can work
immediately<00:03:17.160> one<00:03:17.910> then<00:03:18.299> decade<00:03:18.810> two<00:03:19.079> now<00:03:19.590> with

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.040 

remember<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.370> current<00:03:23.209> name<00:03:23.420> was<00:03:23.720> Christian

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
remember the current name was Christian

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.979 
remember the current name was Christian
Bay<00:03:24.290> now<00:03:24.500> is<00:03:24.730> briefed<00:03:25.750> enough

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
Bay now is briefed enough

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.920 
Bay now is briefed enough
so<00:03:27.550> we<00:03:28.550> working<00:03:28.940> with<00:03:28.970> three<00:03:29.270> different<00:03:29.420> and

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
so we working with three different and

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.110 
so we working with three different and
they<00:03:30.110> have<00:03:30.260> changed<00:03:30.530> in<00:03:30.890> api's<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:32.170> sdk<00:03:33.170> and

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
they have changed in api's and sdk and

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.380 
they have changed in api's and sdk and
hardware<00:03:35.120> aspects<00:03:35.660> of<00:03:35.959> all<00:03:36.170> of<00:03:36.290> them<00:03:36.470> same<00:03:37.459> the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
hardware aspects of all of them same the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.979 
hardware aspects of all of them same the
same<00:03:38.569> wasn't<00:03:39.110> with<00:03:39.350> more<00:03:39.560> project<00:03:39.950> morphus

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
same wasn't with more project morphus

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.970 
same wasn't with more project morphus
current<00:03:41.989> version<00:03:42.410> maybe<00:03:42.980> is<00:03:43.130> not<00:03:43.160> final<00:03:43.760> but

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
current version maybe is not final but

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.550 
current version maybe is not final but
definitely<00:03:45.980> not<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.489> first<00:03:46.520> one<00:03:47.120> so<00:03:47.560> they

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
definitely not the first one so they

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.710 
definitely not the first one so they
have<00:03:48.769> been<00:03:48.950> changes<00:03:49.400> working<00:03:50.330> with<00:03:50.510> their

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
have been changes working with their

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.229 
have been changes working with their
with<00:03:51.110> them<00:03:51.290> each<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.250> VR<00:03:52.430> system<00:03:52.870> so<00:03:53.870> it's

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
with them each of the VR system so it's

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.320 
with them each of the VR system so it's
not<00:03:56.260> easier<00:03:57.260> not<00:03:57.590> hard<00:03:57.950> it's<00:03:58.130> just<00:03:58.280> in<00:03:58.819> making

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
not easier not hard it's just in making

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.130 
not easier not hard it's just in making
for<00:03:59.660> different<00:04:00.519> it's<00:04:01.519> like<00:04:01.670> only<00:04:02.060> although<00:04:03.019> it

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
for different it's like only although it

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.050 
for different it's like only although it
looks<00:04:03.500> like<00:04:03.709> it's<00:04:03.860> the<00:04:03.980> only<00:04:04.010> two<00:04:04.370> system<00:04:04.850> but

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
looks like it's the only two system but

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.559 
looks like it's the only two system but
each<00:04:05.480> of<00:04:05.750> them<00:04:05.930> had<00:04:06.140> a<00:04:06.170> lot<00:04:06.410> of<00:04:06.470> generations<00:04:07.220> so

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
each of them had a lot of generations so

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.960 
each of them had a lot of generations so
it's<00:04:08.569> more<00:04:09.110> like<00:04:09.319> six<00:04:09.709> extra<00:04:10.130> door<00:04:10.310> systems

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
it's more like six extra door systems

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.539 
it's more like six extra door systems
alright<00:04:11.900> so<00:04:12.080> warfare<00:04:12.470> has<00:04:12.650> been<00:04:12.769> around<00:04:13.340> for<00:04:13.519> a

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
alright so warfare has been around for a

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.670 
alright so warfare has been around for a
while<00:04:13.610> now<00:04:13.910> but<00:04:13.970> how<00:04:14.239> long<00:04:14.420> has<00:04:14.660> this<00:04:14.989> has<00:04:15.590> this

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
while now but how long has this has this

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.759 
while now but how long has this has this
VR<00:04:15.890> part<00:04:16.340> been<00:04:16.880> in<00:04:17.109> in<00:04:18.109> development<00:04:18.560> for<00:04:18.650> you

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
VR part been in in development for you

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
their VR systems in general we backed on

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.450 
their VR systems in general we backed on
Kickstarter<00:04:29.840> varicose<00:04:30.440> poets<00:04:30.800> was<00:04:31.039> just

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
Kickstarter varicose poets was just

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.820 
Kickstarter varicose poets was just
announced<00:04:31.910> we<00:04:32.720> stopped<00:04:32.990> working<00:04:33.320> with<00:04:33.470> a<00:04:33.620> key

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
announced we stopped working with a key

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.320 
announced we stopped working with a key
one<00:04:34.039> as<00:04:34.190> soon<00:04:34.370> as<00:04:34.520> we<00:04:34.640> got<00:04:35.210> one<00:04:35.979> we<00:04:36.979> take<00:04:37.669> some

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
one as soon as we got one we take some

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.390 
one as soon as we got one we take some
time<00:04:38.570> because<00:04:39.080> there<00:04:39.380> was<00:04:39.500> so<00:04:39.740> many<00:04:39.919> big

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
time because there was so many big

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.380 
time because there was so many big
demand<00:04:40.760> that<00:04:40.970> but<00:04:41.930> still<00:04:42.340> is<00:04:43.340> being<00:04:43.729> like

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
demand that but still is being like

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.279 
demand that but still is being like
stuff<00:04:44.990> since<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.650> launch<00:04:46.370> of<00:04:46.580> DK<00:04:46.910> 1<00:04:47.120> we<00:04:47.780> start

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
stuff since the launch of DK 1 we start

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.870 
stuff since the launch of DK 1 we start
implementing<00:04:48.740> support<00:04:49.280> of<00:04:50.140> work<00:04:51.140> on<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.950> VR

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
implementing support of work on the VR

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.300 
implementing support of work on the VR
of<00:04:53.630> course<00:04:53.930> it<00:04:54.169> was<00:04:54.350> preliminary<00:04:55.010> support

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
of course it was preliminary support

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.040 
of course it was preliminary support
because<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.640> dk1<00:04:56.000> resolution<00:04:56.090> was<00:04:56.720> obviously

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
because the dk1 resolution was obviously

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.010 
because the dk1 resolution was obviously
not<00:04:57.320> enough<00:04:57.470> we<00:04:57.860> haven't<00:04:58.430> even<00:04:58.610> tried<00:04:58.940> to<00:04:59.300> make

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
a UI working on that because it

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.659 
a UI working on that because it
obviously<00:05:02.750> has

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
obviously has

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.879 
obviously has
since<00:05:03.969> then<00:05:04.300> but<00:05:04.539> we<00:05:04.599> made<00:05:05.080> support<00:05:05.680> for

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
since then but we made support for

urs now we are working a lot on that on
that<00:05:15.490> aspect<00:05:16.180> of<00:05:16.389> the<00:05:16.509> game<00:05:16.539> so<00:05:17.199> we've<00:05:17.409> been

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
that aspect of the game so we've been

there from the very early begin moreover

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.570 
there from the very early begin moreover
even<00:05:20.259> before<00:05:21.060> oculus<00:05:22.319> been<00:05:23.319> announced<00:05:23.830> we've

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
even before oculus been announced we've

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.939 
even before oculus been announced we've
been<00:05:24.729> supporting<00:05:25.210> track<00:05:25.509> iron<00:05:26.050> which<00:05:26.680> is<00:05:26.710> hep

it<00:05:34.479> wasn't<00:05:34.810> very<00:05:34.960> hard<00:05:35.110> for<00:05:35.529> us<00:05:35.590> to<00:05:35.710> jumped

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
it wasn't very hard for us to jumped

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.350 
it wasn't very hard for us to jumped
into<00:05:37.000> it<00:05:37.180> and<00:05:37.830> which<00:05:38.830> is<00:05:38.860> more<00:05:39.360> the

for the our systems out of current
generous<00:05:50.139> being<00:05:50.680> generous<00:05:51.069> because<00:05:51.370> it's

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
generous being generous because it's

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.860 
generous being generous because it's
very<00:05:51.639> natural<00:05:52.210> so<00:05:53.610> that's<00:05:54.610> why<00:05:54.759> again<00:05:55.509> that's

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
very natural so that's why again that's

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.709 
very natural so that's why again that's
why<00:05:55.990> we<00:05:56.169> made<00:05:56.710> it<00:05:56.949> and<00:05:57.189> that's<00:05:57.699> why<00:05:57.909> he<00:05:57.939> it

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
why we made it and that's why he it

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.320 
why we made it and that's why he it
wasn't<00:05:59.050> very<00:05:59.259> hard<00:05:59.620> for<00:05:59.919> us<00:05:59.979> but<00:06:00.729> because<00:06:01.180> we

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
wasn't very hard for us but because we

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.309 
wasn't very hard for us but because we
spend<00:06:01.689> some<00:06:01.839> amount<00:06:02.529> of<00:06:02.919> time<00:06:03.129> to<00:06:03.370> adopt<00:06:03.939> a<00:06:04.150> new

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 
spend some amount of time to adopt a new

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:09.570 
spend some amount of time to adopt a new
gifted<00:06:05.319> new<00:06:05.919> version<00:06:06.550> so<00:06:07.539> VR<00:06:08.409> is<00:06:08.560> not<00:06:08.830> like<00:06:09.039> the

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
gifted new version so VR is not like the

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.820 
gifted new version so VR is not like the
only<00:06:09.939> technology<00:06:10.300> that's<00:06:10.719> been<00:06:10.870> recently<00:06:11.560> hot

tapping into that as well with like
Morpheus<00:06:21.669> is<00:06:21.759> obviously<00:06:22.120> just<00:06:22.419> what<00:06:22.539> PS<00:06:22.779> were

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 
have very big fans of digital reality

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:42.029 
have very big fans of digital reality
and<00:06:40.240> augmented<00:06:40.389> well<00:06:40.990> to<00:06:41.199> mix<00:06:41.409> the<00:06:41.560> reality

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 
and augmented well to mix the reality

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:44.939 
and augmented well to mix the reality
things<00:06:42.789> so<00:06:43.060> we're<00:06:43.330> making<00:06:43.689> a<00:06:44.020> lot<00:06:44.289> of<00:06:44.439> force<00:06:44.800> on

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:44.949 
things so we're making a lot of force on

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:46.649 
things so we're making a lot of force on
that<00:06:45.009> not<00:06:45.339> only<00:06:45.430> in<00:06:45.610> war<00:06:45.819> fund<00:06:46.089> but<00:06:46.389> we<00:06:46.509> also

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:46.659 
that not only in war fund but we also

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:49.369 
that not only in war fund but we also
make<00:06:46.930> some<00:06:47.199> internal<00:06:47.830> prototypes<00:06:48.430> and

00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:49.379 
make some internal prototypes and

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:54.059 
make some internal prototypes and
unannounced<00:06:50.379> things<00:06:50.860> we're<00:06:51.460> doing<00:06:52.389> so<00:06:53.069> again

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:54.069 
unannounced things we're doing so again

unannounced things we're doing so again
there's<00:06:54.339> now<00:06:54.789> we<00:06:54.849> are<00:06:55.180> mixed<00:06:56.050> reality<00:06:57.180> system

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 
there's now we are mixed reality system

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.469 
there's now we are mixed reality system
on<00:06:58.360> the<00:06:58.479> market<00:06:58.509> in<00:06:58.930> the<00:06:59.020> moment
