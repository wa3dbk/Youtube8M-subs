hey<00:00:01.140> guys<00:00:01.760> thought<00:00:02.760> make<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:03.030> video<00:00:03.240> of<00:00:03.300> the

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
hey guys thought make a video of the

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.680 
hey guys thought make a video of the
sump<00:00:04.259> or<00:00:04.440> oil<00:00:05.400> pan<00:00:05.700> removed<00:00:06.270> on<00:00:06.839> aperture<00:00:07.379> 206

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690 
sump or oil pan removed on aperture 206

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.400 
sump or oil pan removed on aperture 206
this<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.900> 1.40<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.620> petrol<00:00:11.070> engine<00:00:12.230> are<00:00:13.230> to

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
this is the 1.40 a petrol engine are to

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.410 
this is the 1.40 a petrol engine are to
remove<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.710> sump<00:00:13.920> because<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.849> old<00:00:15.000> dipstick

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
remove the sump because the old dipstick

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.609 
remove the sump because the old dipstick
broke<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.730> it<00:00:17.730> wouldn't<00:00:18.029> allow<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.410> new<00:00:19.410> one

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
broke and it wouldn't allow the new one

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.189 
broke and it wouldn't allow the new one
to<00:00:20.039> go<00:00:20.189> all<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.400> way<00:00:20.430> in<00:00:20.670> by<00:00:21.570> about<00:00:21.689> half<00:00:22.050> an

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
to go all the way in by about half an

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.109 
to go all the way in by about half an
inch<00:00:23.570> I<00:00:24.570> mean<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.260> dipsticks<00:00:25.800> will

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
inch I mean that dipsticks will

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.929 
inch I mean that dipsticks will
poorly-designed<00:00:27.119> them<00:00:27.480> out<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.689> plastic<00:00:28.140> and

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
poorly-designed them out of plastic and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.160 
poorly-designed them out of plastic and
over<00:00:29.939> time<00:00:30.289> because<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.470> hot<00:00:31.619> oil<00:00:33.079> temp<00:00:34.079> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
over time because of the hot oil temp to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.770 
over time because of the hot oil temp to
degrade<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.770> eventually<00:00:34.950> breaks<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:36.360> if

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
degrade and it eventually breaks so if

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.450 
degrade and it eventually breaks so if
you<00:00:37.260> run<00:00:37.440> into<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> same<00:00:37.829> problem<00:00:38.280> then

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
you run into the same problem then

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.110 
you run into the same problem then
unfortunately<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.390> all<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.600> have<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.840> do

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
unfortunately this is all you have to do

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.510 
unfortunately this is all you have to do
this<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> dipstick<00:00:42.629> tube

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
this is a dipstick tube

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.090 
this is a dipstick tube
I<00:00:44.550> believe<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.989> old<00:00:46.170> dipstick<00:00:46.590> got<00:00:46.770> stuck

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
I believe it the old dipstick got stuck

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.660 
I believe it the old dipstick got stuck
somewhere<00:00:47.700> near<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.180> end<00:00:49.550> that's<00:00:50.550> what

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
somewhere near the end that's what

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.400 
somewhere near the end that's what
stopped<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> new<00:00:51.210> one<00:00:51.360> from<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:51.960> boy

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
stopped the new one from going in boy

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.180 
stopped the new one from going in boy
it's<00:00:53.160> only<00:00:53.280> about<00:00:53.430> half<00:00:53.699> an<00:00:53.910> inch<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:55.070> you<00:00:56.070> have

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
it's only about half an inch so you have

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.290 
it's only about half an inch so you have
to<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.300> that

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
to do all this just for that

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.830 
to do all this just for that
that's<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.870> pickup<00:01:01.940> this<00:01:02.940> whole<00:01:03.180> assembly<00:01:03.449> is

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
that's the pickup this whole assembly is

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.630 
that's the pickup this whole assembly is
the<00:01:04.110> oil<00:01:04.589> pump<00:01:05.420> not<00:01:06.420> quite<00:01:06.689> sure<00:01:07.430> what<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.580> is

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
the oil pump not quite sure what this is

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.590 
the oil pump not quite sure what this is
I<00:01:08.850> believe<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.830> oil<00:01:10.830> level<00:01:11.220> sensor<00:01:11.640> but

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
I believe it's a oil level sensor but

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.780 
I believe it's a oil level sensor but
there's<00:01:12.780> no<00:01:12.869> indication<00:01:13.049> inside<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.280> car<00:01:14.490> to

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
there's no indication inside the car to

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.060 
there's no indication inside the car to
tell<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.000> what<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> oil<00:01:15.240> level<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:16.070> believe

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
tell you what the oil level is I believe

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.859 
tell you what the oil level is I believe
if<00:01:17.310> they<00:01:17.460> all<00:01:17.549> ever<00:01:17.759> got<00:01:17.970> low<00:01:18.150> then<00:01:18.479> you'll

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
if they all ever got low then you'll

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.380 
if they all ever got low then you'll
come<00:01:19.110> up<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.500> red<00:01:19.920> stop<00:01:20.430> light<00:01:20.700> which<00:01:21.210> is

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
come up with the red stop light which is

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.170 
come up with the red stop light which is
located<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.930> bottom<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.799> speedo<00:01:26.180> to

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
located on the bottom of the speedo to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.010 
located on the bottom of the speedo to
remove<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.990> sump<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:29.060> not<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.240> hard<00:01:30.479> it's

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
remove the sump it's not that hard it's

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.050 
remove the sump it's not that hard it's
just<00:01:31.340> it's<00:01:32.340> not<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.490> difficult<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.030> just

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
just it's not that difficult you just

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.499 
just it's not that difficult you just
remove<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.990> 10mm<00:01:34.290> bolts<00:01:34.829> all<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> round<00:01:35.509> part

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
remove the 10mm bolts all the round part

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.649 
remove the 10mm bolts all the round part
from<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.960> studs<00:01:37.770> there's<00:01:38.400> one<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.329> side

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
from the studs there's one on that side

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:47.080 
from the studs there's one on that side
and<00:01:41.750> one<00:01:42.750> over<00:01:42.899> here<00:01:44.090> they<00:01:45.090> are<00:01:45.810> ten<00:01:46.320> mil<00:01:46.560> knots

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
and one over here they are ten mil knots

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.580 
and one over here they are ten mil knots
but<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.229> stud<00:01:49.229> also<00:01:49.880> holds<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.909> wari<00:01:51.329> loom

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.590 

after<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:57.149> difficult

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
after that you have to the difficult

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.370 
after that you have to the difficult
part<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:58.189> removing<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.310> pan<00:01:59.670> out<00:01:59.939> because<00:02:00.380> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
part is removing the pan out because the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.940 
part is removing the pan out because the
exhaust<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.920> way<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:03.439> you<00:02:04.439> also<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.799> to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
exhaust is the way and you also have to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.059 
exhaust is the way and you also have to
be<00:02:05.070> wary<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.659> you<00:02:06.659> pick<00:02:06.899> up<00:02:07.079> in<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.380> dipstick

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
be wary of you pick up in the dipstick

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.080 
be wary of you pick up in the dipstick
tube<00:02:08.450> when<00:02:09.450> trying<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.780> remove<00:02:10.020> it

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
tube when trying to remove it

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.550 
tube when trying to remove it
you<00:02:12.090> have<00:02:12.210> to<00:02:12.330> tell<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.660> about<00:02:12.960> 50<00:02:13.710> or<00:02:13.830> degrees

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
you have to tell it about 50 or degrees

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.400 
you have to tell it about 50 or degrees
this<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.800> pun<00:02:16.950> itself<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:18.110> mean<00:02:19.110> even

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
this is the pun itself I mean even

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.350 
this is the pun itself I mean even
though<00:02:19.470> you've<00:02:19.650> drained<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.760> drain<00:02:21.180> all<00:02:21.300> the

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
though you've drained you drain all the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.290 
though you've drained you drain all the
oil<00:02:21.800> via<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.980> sump<00:02:23.310> plug<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:24.000> how<00:02:24.120> much

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
oil via the sump plug this is how much

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.780 
oil via the sump plug this is how much
oil<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:25.380> actually<00:02:25.680> left<00:02:25.860> I<00:02:26.160> mean<00:02:26.520> it's<00:02:26.640> quite

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
oil is actually left I mean it's quite

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.540 
oil is actually left I mean it's quite
bare<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.270> have<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.480> be<00:02:28.010> wary<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.250> as

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
bare so you have to be wary of that as

it's<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.160> bit<00:02:38.280> difficult<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.700> remove<00:02:38.940> because

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
it's a bit difficult to remove because

it's pretty much sticks or glue so you

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.199

why<00:05:27.040> tends<00:05:27.280> to<00:05:27.430> snap<00:05:27.700> is<00:05:28.320> because<00:05:29.320> as<00:05:29.530> you<00:05:30.010> can

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
why tends to snap is because as you can

breaks and then after that it goes

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:09.140 
breaks and then after that it goes
straight<00:06:02.140> down<00:06:05.760> over<00:06:06.760> time<00:06:06.990> because<00:06:07.990> it<00:06:08.110> bends

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150

that's<00:06:10.150> what<00:06:10.240> causes<00:06:10.450> it<00:06:10.690> to<00:06:10.720> eventually<00:06:11.140> snap

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.230 
that's what causes it to eventually snap

the reason why the dipstick gets stuck
and<00:06:18.870> it<00:06:19.560> won't<00:06:19.710> allow<00:06:19.860> then<00:06:20.039> you<00:06:20.099> want<00:06:20.280> to<00:06:20.370> go

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
and it won't allow then you want to go

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.330 
and it won't allow then you want to go
through<00:06:20.870> it<00:06:21.870> normally<00:06:22.139> gets<00:06:22.289> stuck<00:06:22.710> in<00:06:23.189> the

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
through it normally gets stuck in the

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.939 
through it normally gets stuck in the
end<00:06:23.490> of<00:06:23.639> the<00:06:23.729> dipstick<00:06:24.000> tube<00:06:24.240> here<00:06:24.449> and<00:06:24.949> even

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 
end of the dipstick tube here and even

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:27.589 
end of the dipstick tube here and even
if<00:06:26.099> you<00:06:26.159> push<00:06:26.370> your<00:06:26.789> new<00:06:26.939> dipstick<00:06:27.270> through

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 
if you push your new dipstick through

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:30.830 
if you push your new dipstick through
and<00:06:28.110> it<00:06:28.229> won't<00:06:28.409> go<00:06:28.560> all<00:06:29.039> the<00:06:29.250> way<00:06:29.280> down<00:06:29.840> it's

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
and it won't go all the way down it's

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.659 
and it won't go all the way down it's
because<00:06:31.169> there's<00:06:31.620> not<00:06:31.740> enough<00:06:31.949> clearance<00:06:32.099> for

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
because there's not enough clearance for

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.149 
because there's not enough clearance for
the<00:06:33.210> old<00:06:33.360> piece<00:06:33.840> to<00:06:34.169> push<00:06:34.349> through<00:06:34.560> through

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:35.159 
the old piece to push through through

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:36.790 
the old piece to push through through
get<00:06:35.340> through<00:06:35.669> the<00:06:35.759> end<00:06:35.879> of<00:06:35.969> the<00:06:36.060> dipstick<00:06:36.270> tube

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
get through the end of the dipstick tube

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.570 
get through the end of the dipstick tube
there<00:06:37.800> not<00:06:37.889> enough<00:06:38.069> clearance<00:06:38.250> between<00:06:38.430> the

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
there not enough clearance between the

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.159 
there not enough clearance between the
bottom<00:06:38.729> of<00:06:38.909> here<00:06:39.120> and<00:06:39.629> the<00:06:40.169> oil<00:06:40.289> pan<00:06:41.990> so<00:06:42.990> as<00:06:43.080> you

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.169 
bottom of here and the oil pan so as you

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.189 
bottom of here and the oil pan so as you
can<00:06:43.319> see<00:06:43.530> the<00:06:44.219> pickup<00:06:44.550> normally<00:06:45.270> sits<00:06:45.539> close

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 
can see the pickup normally sits close

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:48.469 
can see the pickup normally sits close
to<00:06:46.229> the<00:06:46.409> bottom<00:06:46.560> of<00:06:46.680> the<00:06:46.830> oil<00:06:46.860> pan<00:06:47.099> to<00:06:47.479> gather

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
to the bottom of the oil pan to gather

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:50.930 
to the bottom of the oil pan to gather
as<00:06:48.599> much<00:06:48.780> oil<00:06:48.900> as<00:06:49.050> possible<00:06:49.139> and<00:06:49.669> the<00:06:50.669> dipstick

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
as much oil as possible and the dipstick

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.749 
as much oil as possible and the dipstick
tube<00:06:51.650> goes<00:06:52.650> down<00:06:52.919> as<00:06:53.159> far<00:06:53.400> as<00:06:54.979> the<00:06:55.979> pickup

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 
tube goes down as far as the pickup

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:59.749 
tube goes down as far as the pickup
itself<00:06:57.440> so<00:06:58.440> that's<00:06:58.560> why<00:06:58.770> it<00:06:58.830> tends<00:06:59.039> to<00:06:59.159> get

00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 
itself so that's why it tends to get

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:03.469 
itself so that's why it tends to get
stuck<00:07:01.250> so<00:07:02.250> if<00:07:02.759> you<00:07:02.909> do<00:07:03.000> want<00:07:03.150> to<00:07:03.180> the<00:07:03.300> side

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 
stuck so if you do want to the side

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:06.080 
stuck so if you do want to the side
problem<00:07:03.690> then<00:07:04.050> you<00:07:04.409> have<00:07:04.620> to<00:07:04.800> pull<00:07:05.550> off<00:07:05.669> the

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
problem then you have to pull off the

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.949 
problem then you have to pull off the
sump<00:07:06.330> just<00:07:07.319> to<00:07:07.409> tear<00:07:07.529> the<00:07:07.620> piece<00:07:07.740> out
