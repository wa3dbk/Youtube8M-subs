right<00:01:43.020> here<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.500> system<00:01:43.950> type<00:01:44.299> 64-bit

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
right here it's a system type 64-bit

right here it's a system type 64-bit
operating<00:01:45.600> system<00:01:46.490> x64<00:01:47.490> based<00:01:47.939> processors<00:01:48.780> so

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
operating system x64 based processors so

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.069 
operating system x64 based processors so
remember<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.100> your<00:01:50.340> 64-bit<00:01:51.180> as<00:01:51.390> well<00:01:51.540> so

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
remember that your 64-bit as well so

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.169 
remember that your 64-bit as well so
basically<00:01:52.710> what<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> would<00:01:53.130> do<00:01:53.310> is

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
basically what I would do is

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.609 
basically what I would do is
look<00:01:54.600> for<00:01:54.929> the<00:01:55.500> driver<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.280> nvidia<00:01:57.149> geforce

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
look for the driver the nvidia geforce

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
example i'm going to pretend that i have

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.660

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
chipset family which most of you

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.880 
chipset family which most of you
probably<00:02:10.590> have<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.940> since<00:02:12.569> i'm<00:02:12.720> 64-bit<00:02:13.500> i<00:02:13.650> will

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
probably have so since i'm 64-bit i will

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.610 
probably have so since i'm 64-bit i will
download<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.310> 64<00:02:14.849> if<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.420> was<00:02:15.569> 32-bit<00:02:16.230> i<00:02:16.410> would

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
download the 64 if I was 32-bit i would

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.830 
download the 64 if I was 32-bit i would
download<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:17.099> 32-bit<00:02:17.549> so<00:02:18.450> we're<00:02:18.569> gonna<00:02:18.660> go

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
download the 32-bit so we're gonna go

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.759 
download the 32-bit so we're gonna go
ahead<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.200> download<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:20.629> 64-bit<00:02:21.769> click

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
ahead and download the 64-bit click

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.559 
ahead and download the 64-bit click
download<00:02:23.220> we'll<00:02:23.760> just<00:02:23.940> go<00:02:24.060> ahead<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.330> save<00:02:24.540> it
