stories<00:01:53.659> are<00:01:53.810> important<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:01.670> people<00:02:01.849> join<00:02:02.659> our

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989 
stories are important so people join our

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:06.940 
stories are important so people join our
activity<00:02:03.679> and<00:02:04.659> become<00:02:05.659> customers<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.470> they

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
activity and become customers and they

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.309 
activity and become customers and they
bring<00:02:07.429> their<00:02:07.610> friends<00:02:07.819> who<00:02:08.509> become<00:02:08.840> customers

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
so obviously the next step is to become

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.470 
so obviously the next step is to become
a<00:02:12.079> distributor
