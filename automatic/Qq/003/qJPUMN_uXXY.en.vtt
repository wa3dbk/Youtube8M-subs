00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
what we're going to be using today is

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.459 
what we're going to be using today is
actually<00:00:59.680> a<00:01:00.280> combination<00:01:00.909> of<00:01:01.539> almond<00:01:02.260> milk

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
actually a combination of almond milk

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.979 
actually a combination of almond milk
and<00:01:02.949> coconut<00:01:03.370> milk<00:01:03.850> because<00:01:04.629> I<00:01:04.720> didn't<00:01:04.960> want

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
and coconut milk because I didn't want

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.320 
and coconut milk because I didn't want
to<00:01:05.140> add<00:01:05.379> extra<00:01:05.619> ice<00:01:06.009> or<00:01:06.310> water<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.640> dilute<00:01:06.940> the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
to add extra ice or water to dilute the

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.660 
to add extra ice or water to dilute the
flavor<00:01:07.630> what<00:01:08.350> I<00:01:08.409> did<00:01:08.619> was<00:01:08.740> I<00:01:08.830> took<00:01:08.860> my<00:01:09.190> coconut

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
flavor what I did was I took my coconut

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.180 
flavor what I did was I took my coconut
back<00:01:09.880> and<00:01:10.240> I<00:01:10.450> put<00:01:10.780> it<00:01:10.930> in<00:01:11.140> an<00:01:11.409> ice<00:01:11.590> cube<00:01:11.860> tray

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
back and I put it in an ice cube tray

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.219 
back and I put it in an ice cube tray
and<00:01:12.490> it<00:01:13.119> made<00:01:13.270> little<00:01:13.390> ice<00:01:13.659> cubes<00:01:13.990> of<00:01:14.080> the

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
and it made little ice cubes of the

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.510 
and it made little ice cubes of the
coconut<00:01:14.440> milk<00:01:14.830> so<00:01:14.950> that's<00:01:15.130> what's<00:01:15.340> going<00:01:15.460> to

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
coconut milk so that's what's going to

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.730 
coconut milk so that's what's going to
help<00:01:15.580> create<00:01:16.060> that<00:01:16.680> frozen<00:01:17.680> without

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
help create that frozen without

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.340 
help create that frozen without
flavor<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:20.000> i've<00:01:20.090> got<00:01:20.329> probably<00:01:20.810> three

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
flavor so i've got probably three

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.139
