another<00:00:07.799> so<00:00:08.490> here<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.760> have<00:00:08.970> two<00:00:09.210> images<00:00:09.360> that

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
another so here I have two images that

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.810 
another so here I have two images that
have<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:09.960> drastically<00:00:10.769> different<00:00:10.889> color<00:00:11.460> tone

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
have a drastically different color tone

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.270 
have a drastically different color tone
and<00:00:12.179> feel<00:00:12.509> so<00:00:13.110> what<00:00:13.410> if<00:00:13.500> we<00:00:13.590> wanted<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:13.980> first

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
and feel so what if we wanted this first

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.250 
and feel so what if we wanted this first
image<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:14.880> path<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.509> look<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.809> lot<00:00:15.990> more

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
image of this path to look a lot more

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.230 
image of this path to look a lot more
like<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.859> color<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.279> tone<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.880> second

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
like the color and tone of the second

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.269 
like the color and tone of the second
image<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> barn<00:00:19.080> now<00:00:19.320> your<00:00:19.980> initial

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
image of the barn now your initial

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.769 
image of the barn now your initial
thought<00:00:20.490> might<00:00:20.699> be<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.970> spend<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.330> decent<00:00:21.660> chunk

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
thought might be to spend a decent chunk

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.660 
thought might be to spend a decent chunk
of<00:00:21.930> time<00:00:22.170> with<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> few<00:00:22.680> different<00:00:23.070> adjustment

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
of time with a few different adjustment

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.400 
of time with a few different adjustment
layers<00:00:23.850> or<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.689> could<00:00:24.840> go<00:00:24.960> ahead<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.170> start

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
layers or you could go ahead and start

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.620 
layers or you could go ahead and start
by<00:00:25.769> trying<00:00:26.010> out<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.460> match<00:00:26.699> color<00:00:27.000> adjustment

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
by trying out the match color adjustment

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.790 
by trying out the match color adjustment
which<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.840> what<00:00:28.080> we're<00:00:28.199> going<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.410> be<00:00:28.560> doing

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
which is what we're going to be doing

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.439 
which is what we're going to be doing
today<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.699> I'm<00:00:29.760> just<00:00:29.910> going<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.090> flip<00:00:30.330> back

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
today so I'm just going to flip back

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.630 
today so I'm just going to flip back
over<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.170> first<00:00:31.439> image<00:00:31.800> here<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.099> then<00:00:32.520> go

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
over to the first image here and then go

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.150 
over to the first image here and then go
up<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.790> image<00:00:33.270> down<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.960> adjustments<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.739> then

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
up to image down to adjustments and then

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.819 
up to image down to adjustments and then
down<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.399> match<00:00:35.940> color<00:00:36.410> now<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.500> first<00:00:37.710> thing

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
down to match color now the first thing

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.200 
down to match color now the first thing
that<00:00:37.980> we're<00:00:38.070> going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.309> look<00:00:38.460> at<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.910> this

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
that we're going to look at in this

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.030 
that we're going to look at in this
dialogue<00:00:39.719> box<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.410> option<00:00:40.829> called

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
dialogue box is this option called

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.190 
dialogue box is this option called

source down here under image statistics
now<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.800> where<00:00:43.950> you're<00:00:44.070> actually<00:00:44.219> going

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
now this is where you're actually going

now this is where you're actually going
to<00:00:44.579> select<00:00:44.910> your<00:00:45.030> second<00:00:45.450> image<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.110> you

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
to select your second image that you

to select your second image that you
want<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.620> steal<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:46.980> color<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.640> tone<00:00:47.940> from<00:00:48.329> so

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
want to steal the color and tone from so

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.240 
want to steal the color and tone from so
we're<00:00:48.989> going<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.230> select<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.680> image<00:00:50.070> and

we're going to select that image and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.740 
we're going to select that image and
mine<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.760> going<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.270> bottom<00:00:51.629> image

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
mine is going to be this bottom image

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.569 
mine is going to be this bottom image
right<00:00:52.050> here<00:00:52.079> another<00:00:52.469> file<00:00:52.800> that's<00:00:53.100> open<00:00:53.399> and

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
right here another file that's open and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.279 
right here another file that's open and
you'll<00:00:54.180> immediately<00:00:54.329> see<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.930> pulls<00:00:55.140> up

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
you'll immediately see that it pulls up

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.869 
you'll immediately see that it pulls up
the<00:00:55.410> picture<00:00:55.710> here<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.039> starts<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.520> apply<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the picture here and starts to apply the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.240 
the picture here and starts to apply the
effect<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.449> your<00:00:57.780> image<00:00:58.140> now<00:00:58.649> some<00:00:58.890> images

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
effect to your image now some images

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.130 
effect to your image now some images
will<00:00:59.399> look<00:00:59.430> good<00:00:59.699> right<00:01:00.000> off<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.300> bat<00:01:00.449> this

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
will look good right off the bat this

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.779 
will look good right off the bat this
one<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.530> not<00:01:01.710> one<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.949> those<00:01:02.129> images<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.670> we're

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
one is not one of those images so we're

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.219 
one is not one of those images so we're
going<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.030> need<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.329> use<00:01:03.359> some<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.750> these<00:01:03.809> image

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
going to need to use some of these image

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.340 
going to need to use some of these image
options<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.860> really<00:01:05.010> refine<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.670> effect<00:01:06.090> so

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
options to really refine this effect so

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.660 
options to really refine this effect so
with<00:01:07.350> these<00:01:07.500> effects<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.040> luminance

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
with these effects we have luminance

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.370 
with these effects we have luminance
here<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.060> luminance<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.659> going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.990> control

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
here and luminance is going to control

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.910 
here and luminance is going to control
the<00:01:10.560> perceived<00:01:11.100> brightness<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.780> image

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
the perceived brightness of the image

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.590 
the perceived brightness of the image
the<00:01:13.920> color<00:01:14.280> intensity<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.240> control

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
the color intensity is going to control

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.539 
the color intensity is going to control
the<00:01:15.780> vibrance<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.920> fade<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.490> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
the vibrance and the fade is going to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.219 
the vibrance and the fade is going to
control<00:01:17.909> how<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.210> color<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.630> faded<00:01:19.049> from<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
control how the color is faded from the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.200 
control how the color is faded from the
new<00:01:19.500> image<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:19.950> brought<00:01:20.189> over<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> barn<00:01:20.970> on

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
new image we brought over of the barn on

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.719 
new image we brought over of the barn on
to<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> original<00:01:22.259> image<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.770> path<00:01:23.100> now

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
to the original image of the path now

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.609 
to the original image of the path now
with<00:01:23.880> all<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.210> these<00:01:24.330> image<00:01:24.780> options<00:01:25.320> when<00:01:25.500> we

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
with all of these image options when we

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.530 
with all of these image options when we
adjust<00:01:26.009> these<00:01:26.189> we're<00:01:26.729> actually<00:01:27.119> adjusting

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
adjust these we're actually adjusting

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.539 
adjust these we're actually adjusting
the<00:01:27.630> properties<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.500> new<00:01:28.650> image<00:01:29.070> since<00:01:29.369> we

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
the properties of the new image since we

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.670 
the properties of the new image since we
selected<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:30.119> source<00:01:30.450> if<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.020> hadn't<00:01:31.320> selected

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
selected a source if we hadn't selected

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.260 
selected a source if we hadn't selected
a<00:01:31.770> source<00:01:32.040> then<00:01:32.310> these<00:01:32.430> image<00:01:32.759> options<00:01:33.150> would

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
a source then these image options would

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.480 
a source then these image options would
then<00:01:33.420> apply<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.810> our<00:01:34.140> old<00:01:34.409> original<00:01:35.040> image<00:01:35.310> of

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
then apply to our old original image of

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.429 
then apply to our old original image of
the<00:01:35.729> path<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.450> since<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:36.780> do<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.140> source

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
the path but since we do have a source

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.410 
the path but since we do have a source
then<00:01:37.650> they're<00:01:37.770> going<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.100> apply<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:39.180> how<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
then they're going to apply to how the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.359 
then they're going to apply to how the
color<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:40.020> brought<00:01:40.259> over<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.619> blended<00:01:41.040> from

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
color is brought over and blended from

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.760 
color is brought over and blended from
the<00:01:41.549> image<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.180> barn<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.899> lastly<00:01:43.439> we<00:01:43.619> have

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
the image of the barn so lastly we have

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.499 
the image of the barn so lastly we have
this<00:01:43.920> neutralized<00:01:44.520> checkbox<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.360> is

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
this neutralized checkbox and this is

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.600 
this neutralized checkbox and this is
going<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.869> neutralize<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.770> main<00:01:47.009> color<00:01:47.340> that

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
going to neutralize the main color that

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.910 
going to neutralize the main color that
is<00:01:47.700> being<00:01:47.880> cast<00:01:48.270> by<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.170> selected<00:01:49.649> photo

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
is being cast by the selected photo

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.170 
is being cast by the selected photo
which<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.430> barn<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.090> to

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
which is the barn so it's going to

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.819 
which is the barn so it's going to
neutralize<00:01:51.360> any<00:01:51.810> kind<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.170> major<00:01:52.439> color

at about 125 I'm going to put the color
intensity<00:02:01.290> at<00:02:01.590> about<00:02:01.799> 70<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.520> I'm<00:02:03.030> going<00:02:03.210> to

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
intensity at about 70 and I'm going to

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.260

going to go ahead and check the

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.059 
going to go ahead and check the
neutralize<00:02:07.890> color<00:02:08.369> box<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:10.110> if<00:02:10.349> we<00:02:10.530> then<00:02:10.709> go<00:02:10.860> up

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
neutralize color box so if we then go up

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.040 
neutralize color box so if we then go up
to<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.430> preview<00:02:11.849> we<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.030> see<00:02:12.239> how<00:02:12.780> this

to the preview we can see how this

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.760 
to the preview we can see how this
change<00:02:13.290> has

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
change has

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.320 
change has
an<00:02:13.830> effect<00:02:14.130> on<00:02:14.280> our<00:02:14.340> image<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:15.060> can<00:02:15.150> see

the before and after and that's pretty a
pretty<00:02:18.300> drastic<00:02:18.930> change<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.380> if<00:02:19.440> we<00:02:19.530> go<00:02:19.650> ahead

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
pretty drastic change so if we go ahead

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.070 
pretty drastic change so if we go ahead
and<00:02:19.860> click<00:02:20.220> OK<00:02:20.640> we<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.210> flip<00:02:21.450> between<00:02:21.600> these

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.060 
images after it's gone ahead and taken
effect<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.260> can<00:02:25.290> see<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.710> these<00:02:25.800> images

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
effect and you can see that these images

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.130 
effect and you can see that these images
now<00:02:26.310> seem<00:02:26.610> like<00:02:26.790> they<00:02:26.910> fit<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.150> lot<00:02:27.570> better<00:02:27.870> into

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
now seem like they fit a lot better into

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.050 
now seem like they fit a lot better into
the<00:02:28.410> same<00:02:28.620> kind<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.010> feel<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.430> seems<00:02:29.640> like<00:02:29.850> they

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
the same kind of feel it seems like they

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.180 
the same kind of feel it seems like they
have<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.900> same<00:02:31.080> tone<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.590> them<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.920> lot<00:02:32.070> of

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
have the same tone to them and a lot of

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.710 
have the same tone to them and a lot of
the<00:02:32.310> same<00:02:32.520> colors<00:02:32.880> have<00:02:33.060> been<00:02:33.180> matched<00:02:33.420> from

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
the same colors have been matched from

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.960 
the same colors have been matched from
the<00:02:33.840> original<00:02:34.230> image<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:35.340> this<00:02:35.490> is<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.670> great

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
the original image so this is a great

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.090 
the original image so this is a great
tool<00:02:36.180> for<00:02:36.210> stealing<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.990> tone<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.410> an<00:02:37.710> image

it's<00:02:38.310> not<00:02:38.700> always<00:02:38.970> going<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.420> be<00:02:39.480> perfect<00:02:39.990> but

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
it's not always going to be perfect but

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.930 
it's not always going to be perfect but
you<00:02:40.200> can<00:02:40.500> refine<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.220> even<00:02:41.430> use<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.790> as<00:02:41.910> a

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
you can refine it and even use it as a

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.070 
you can refine it and even use it as a
huge<00:02:42.330> head<00:02:42.570> start

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
huge head start

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.020
