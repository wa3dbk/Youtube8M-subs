00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.540
 hello everyone my name is stas and in 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.150
 once again this company is a soft club 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.370
 so today i decided to tell for very 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.830
 cool calculator that I use 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.350
 already a huge amount of time very 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.840
 happy though he is quite expensive but 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.670
 nevertheless it is worth it this is the best 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.230
 calculator I've ever seen 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.300
 for ipod 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.119
 that is not important to this iphone or ipad on 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.730
 this case, too, then I'll show it just but 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.860
 It is the best but it is the same again 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.899
 h3 with dear but nevertheless it is 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.940
 worth it after i bought this 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.550
 calculator I deleted absolutely everything 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.770
 who ever installed so in 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.020
 what is the essence of that is how well why 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.090
 I was impressed by this particular calculator 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.559
 but on the ipad it looks somewhat better 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.629
 he has tabs 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.579
 huge there that is you can create 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.829
 sheet and miscalculations and much more on 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.719
 iPhone unfortunately it is not there but not 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.370
 less let's see from that 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.180
 functional which are here already 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.370
 present 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.680
 I'll start first we have a calculator 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.390
 as they say yes and if you 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.400
 Swipe to the right 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.049
 additional functions that us 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.420
 Do many students there students 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.790
 schoolchildren will like it anyway 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.200
 let's 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:22.380
 65 multiply by 98 equals 6370 further we 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.700
 we consider for example some other number 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.390
 for example there 69 divided by 8 equals 8 1000 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.640
 before love is nothing as much as 8 to 625 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.040
 Well , first you will see what could be 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.049
 already created sheet miscalculation that is, in fact 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.060
 all that you think is further here at 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.320
 you can always be saved 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.570
 you can return at any time 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.530
 see what's on your screen 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.570
 Now 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.329
 what else can you do but again you 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.049
 you can let's change the number 65 just 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.299
 clicking on it and select 69 automatically 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.329
 solved press is exactly the same 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.770
 can change let's say there 96 on again 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.049
 same 69 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.790
 here either remove some digit or 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.610
 multiply by 6 percent 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.469
 he immediately thinks that it is 006 and on the left 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.920
 sides we have but much 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.720
 other 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.780
 further you can clamp in the same way 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.540
 so say tsiferku and insert this number 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.140
 already where you want either on a separate 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.140
 place for example here and fold to 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.550
 For example, here are these two numbers again. 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.100
 we push it is equal to us 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.660
 such a figure is a very convenient thing 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.060
 have you understood yes if you are here 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.920
 change 56 you change absolutely 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.340
 the whole miscalculation is very, very convenient 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.640
 Now let's say you have the first miscalculations from 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.220
 56 multiply by 6 percent this applies 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.860
 there for example your there but for example 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.950
 work yes you just do with your left 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.440
 side svayp line and write what 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.170
 This for example there work environment Yes 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.420
 some kind of click here that is 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.010
 enter yes and you still have a comment 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.230
 the same thing you can do absolutely in 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.200
 any line that is where you are 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.970
 just want with wipe means and I, too 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.250
 I think that it is much more convenient 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.860
 and of course you can 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.680
 select again all copy and 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.170
 send where you want means 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.160
 further if you for example yes here 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.920
 save some miscalculation so multiply 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.459
 on like this go out 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.950
 then every time you let's even 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.900
 unload the application if you are still in it 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.330
 once you come back, it remains completely all 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.370
 the story is also very very convenient but 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.590
 at least I think so if you 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.660
 click delete one digit then this 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.000
 understandable yes if you pinch this 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.700
 the key is completely removed from you 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.890
 the whole miscalculation that is the whole miscalculation sheet 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.840
 if you want to return pay attention 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.790
 the removal arrow shows 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.190
 look at return function 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.110
 much repeating is the best 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.870
 calculator that I used 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.790
 ever but naturally standard 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.860
 I can not delete but nevertheless it is here 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.860
 present therefore i use exactly 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.019
 rock ram I gave for him in my opinion whether 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.640
 five or six dollars here but if 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.890
 again take into account the fact that 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.019
 how much is a regular calculator on and 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.370
 button which stands on the table and yes I am 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.750
 I think that in principle, the same costs and 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.580
 day 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.310
 so it makes sense to think about buying 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.930
 exactly this calculator again 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.370
 I repeat for ipad I also did 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.680
 separate review there is much more 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.420
 cooler so if you have this this 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.220
 application is universal it costs she 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.020
 It becomes both on the iphone and on the ipad 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.910
 so I think you are very, very 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.590
