00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.939
 today we are going to prepare these delicious 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.939
 mini lemon pie 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.050
 the ingredients for the base are 100 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.480
 grams of tulip margarine 90 grams of 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.260
 wheat flour 90 grams of cornstarch and 2 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.260
 tablespoons of honey 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.690
 and here we have the tulip margarine 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.450
 cornstarch honey and flour what are we going 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:36.930
 to do is put cornstarch in a bowl 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.930
 the flour the margarine and the honey 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.160
 in this recipe I use margarine 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.840
 tulip since it has a lower content 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.760
 in saturated fat than butter 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.190
 due to the vegetable oils that 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.350
 contain and with the help of a blender 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.100
 We are going to beat it until we 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.100
 there is a mass 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.810
 when we have a homogeneous mass and that 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.080
 do not stick we're going to put it between two 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.940
 sheets of baking paper we make a 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.100
 little bit of pressure and with the help of a 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.650
 roll let's pass it 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.299
 when we have the desired thickness 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:23.990
 let's cool one hour in the 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:26.000
 refrigerator passed at the time we remove 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.070
 a part of the vegetal paper and with a 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.090
 groove cutter we are going to cut the 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:38.110
 mass then let's go removing 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.110
 little by little the leftover 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.380
 then we take a mold for flan 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.450
 and we are going to introduce the cookie which 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.680
 let's go down little by little to give 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.680
 shape our tart 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.290
 when we have them all we are going to 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.290
 Bake for 20 minutes at 180 degrees 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.920
 and when they do not burn we unmold them and 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.920
 we reserve them 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.530
 Y 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.750
 on the other hand we are going to prepare the cream 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.019
 of lemon and we're going to need 3 eggs 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.690
 150 grams of sugar juice 80 ml 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.610
 lemon 55 grams of tulip margarine and 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.500
 zest of a lemon and here we have the 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.560
 margarine tulip eggs 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.420
 zest sugar and lemon juice 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.870
 to begin with let's put the eggs in 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.870
 a bowl 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.800
 and with the help of manual rods 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.640
 let's beat them when they start 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.050
 foam 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.050
 let's go adding the sugar 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.720
 and then also the lemon juice 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.670
 Now we put a saucepan in the water bath and 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.769
 let's dump our mix and 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.129
 We will stir until it starts to 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.129
 thicken 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.930
 when you see is that you already have a 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:18.790
 thicker consistency we remove it from 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.860
 fire and let's add the margarine 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.220
 tulip and let's mix until it 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.220
 sheath 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.400
 and finally we also add the 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.390
 lemon zest and now we're going to 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.390
 let it cool 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.390
 82 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.560
 for the set we are going to need 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.420
 Italian meringue if you want 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.260
 learn to do it you just have to do 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.260
 click on the video 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.810
 now we are going through the assembly so 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.310
 we take our tartlets and let's go 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.700
 adding the lemon cream in the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.700
 inside 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.829
 and when we already have them all with help 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.660
 where you eat 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.009
 let's go putting some meringue 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.009
 Italian on the top 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.680
 Y 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.340
 and I to give it a personal touch I'm going to 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.620
 add some poppy seeds like this 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.370
 It gives that elegant touch and they are 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.370
 cool 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.570
 as you can see they are families and more to do and 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.570
 perfect for any occasion 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.650
