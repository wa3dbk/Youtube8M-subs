00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
process for the children and then the

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:59.789 
process for the children and then the
children<00:01:58.209> can<00:01:58.600> take<00:01:58.719> over<00:01:59.079> madellaine<00:01:59.560> oh<00:01:59.679> if

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
children can take over madellaine oh if

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.080 
children can take over madellaine oh if
I<00:01:59.890> can<00:02:00.069> get<00:02:00.189> you<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.459> then<00:02:00.609> use<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:00.880> claw

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
I can get you to then use the claw

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.120 
I can get you to then use the claw
technique<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.630> slice<00:02:01.869> down<00:02:02.170> into<00:02:02.890> little

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
technique to slice down into little

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.679 
technique to slice down into little
pieces<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.549> then<00:02:03.849> we<00:02:03.939> can<00:02:04.090> put<00:02:04.209> that<00:02:04.329> into<00:02:04.539> the

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
pieces and then we can put that into the

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.990 
pieces and then we can put that into the
jug<00:02:04.840> when<00:02:04.959> you're<00:02:05.110> ready<00:02:05.289> you're<00:02:05.649> right<00:02:05.969> back

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
jug when you're ready you're right back

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.999 
jug when you're ready you're right back
Milo<00:02:07.599> we<00:02:08.019> need<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.259> get<00:02:08.349> you<00:02:08.530> measuring

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
Milo we need to get you measuring

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.550 
Milo we need to get you measuring
measuring<00:02:09.970> now<00:02:10.360> is<00:02:10.509> really<00:02:10.780> important<00:02:11.349> to<00:02:11.470> get

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
measuring now is really important to get

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.199 
measuring now is really important to get
the<00:02:11.680> quantities<00:02:12.130> right<00:02:12.310> we're<00:02:12.940> going<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.120> do

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
the quantities right we're going to do

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.030 
the quantities right we're going to do
400<00:02:13.720> mils<00:02:13.900> of<00:02:14.019> cranberry<00:02:14.349> juice<00:02:14.379> into<00:02:14.950> the

400 mils of cranberry juice into the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.130 
400 mils of cranberry juice into the
measuring<00:02:15.190> jug<00:02:15.519> of<00:02:15.700> Milo<00:02:16.030> we<00:02:16.629> need<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.870> find

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
measuring jug of Milo we need to find

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.250 
measuring jug of Milo we need to find
the<00:02:18.010> line<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.400> 400<00:02:18.940> on<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.299> one<00:02:19.510> we've<00:02:20.140> got

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
the line of 400 on this one we've got

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.780 
the line of 400 on this one we've got
several<00:02:20.590> different<00:02:20.650> types<00:02:21.099> of<00:02:21.340> measuring

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
several different types of measuring

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.619 
several different types of measuring
units<00:02:22.269> find<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.290> millimeter<00:02:23.860> lines<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:25.060> we

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
units find the millimeter lines and we

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.089 
units find the millimeter lines and we
need<00:02:25.780> 400<00:02:26.319> which<00:02:26.440> means<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.799> we<00:02:26.890> need<00:02:27.040> to

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
need 400 which means that we need to

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.030 
need 400 which means that we need to
lots<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.879> 200<00:02:28.629> can<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.349> fill<00:02:29.769> up<00:02:29.920> the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
lots of 200 can you fill up the

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.039 
lots of 200 can you fill up the
cranberry<00:02:30.370> juice<00:02:30.549> for<00:02:30.579> me<00:02:30.849> Milo<00:02:31.180> up<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.930> this

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
cranberry juice for me Milo up to this

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.319 
cranberry juice for me Milo up to this
line<00:02:32.260> it's<00:02:32.799> much<00:02:32.980> easier<00:02:33.370> if<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:33.880> child<00:02:34.120> can

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
line it's much easier if the child can

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.030 
line it's much easier if the child can
see<00:02:34.510> from<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.019> side<00:02:35.230> rather<00:02:35.500> than<00:02:35.620> from<00:02:35.920> the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
see from the side rather than from the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.400 
see from the side rather than from the
top<00:02:36.329> because<00:02:37.329> they<00:02:37.450> tend<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.810> look<00:02:37.930> over<00:02:38.230> the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
top because they tend to look over the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.440 
top because they tend to look over the
top<00:02:38.560> when<00:02:38.739> they're<00:02:38.859> pouring<00:02:39.209> but<00:02:40.209> if<00:02:40.329> you

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
top when they're pouring but if you

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.360 
top when they're pouring but if you
guide<00:02:40.720> them<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.230> show<00:02:41.709> them<00:02:41.739> from<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.160> side

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
guide them and show them from the side

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.740 
guide them and show them from the side
then<00:02:42.880> they<00:02:43.030> can<00:02:43.239> use<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.569> lines

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
then they can use the lines

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.860 
then they can use the lines
appropriately<00:02:44.470> that's<00:02:45.190> it

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
appropriately that's it

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:54.809 
appropriately that's it
stop<00:02:47.730> let's<00:02:48.730> put<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.060> in<00:02:49.209> here<00:02:51.810> Eddie<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:54.310> do

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
stop let's put it in here Eddie and do

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.610 
stop let's put it in here Eddie and do
the<00:02:54.970> same<00:02:55.120> again<00:02:55.389> fill<00:02:56.049> it<00:02:56.170> up<00:02:56.260> for<00:02:56.470> me<00:02:56.590> again

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
the same again fill it up for me again

bit tricky again yes please
there<00:03:01.840> we<00:03:01.900> go<00:03:02.049> we've<00:03:02.200> used<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.650> bridge

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
there we go we've used the bridge

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.800 
there we go we've used the bridge
technique<00:03:03.250> again<00:03:03.549> just<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.209> that<00:03:04.239> we<00:03:04.540> can<00:03:04.690> get

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
technique again just so that we can get

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.539 
technique again just so that we can get
those<00:03:04.900> final<00:03:05.290> bits<00:03:05.470> minding<00:03:05.950> our<00:03:06.040> fingers<00:03:06.400> as

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
those final bits minding our fingers as

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.759 
those final bits minding our fingers as

lemon for me I'll get you to use the

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.210 
lemon for me I'll get you to use the
bridge<00:03:33.310> technique<00:03:33.790> so<00:03:34.359> you<00:03:34.450> bridge<00:03:34.750> over

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
bridge technique so you bridge over

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.599 
bridge technique so you bridge over
that's<00:03:36.220> it

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
that's it

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.309 
that's it
stabilise<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.360> item<00:03:37.659> push<00:03:37.870> down<00:03:38.110> on<00:03:38.140> it

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
stabilise the item push down on it

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.589 
stabilise the item push down on it
that's<00:03:38.829> it<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.189> then<00:03:39.700> you<00:03:39.849> can<00:03:40.030> cut<00:03:40.209> it<00:03:40.390> and

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
that's it and then you can cut it and

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.250 
that's it and then you can cut it and
then<00:03:41.230> you<00:03:41.379> do<00:03:41.500> too

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
then you do too

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.899 
then you do too
hundred<00:03:42.470> milliliters<00:03:43.069> so<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.640> same

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
hundred milliliters so the same
