 Chinese constructed designed developed in 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.570
 China marketed in China and so 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.100
 necessarily you will need one worn by the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.590
 specialized shops in 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.550
 France in particular so it is here more 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.560
 especially and I hold hands 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.090
 it's the cool grout shop that got me 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.320
 allowed to get it so that does not allow 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.730
 of course to make this video of 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.650
 unpacking in a first time and more 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.640
 late but very quickly since you 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.920
 have understood I am the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.329
 test so very soon soon the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.290
 test video 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.000
 the package has only to v6 is a 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.219
 mobile I tell you right away who 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.539
 has rather high specifications 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.770
 rather upmarket and 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.280
 yet that marketed at a price 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.350
 very aggressive 160 euros tax free 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.579
 delivery included in December 2014 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.320
 while he's just been 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.210
 marketed you see it all from 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.520
 Following the Chinese builders 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.230
 Chinese are extremely pissed off offers 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.399
 phones with very nice steak 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.840
 I wanted detailed from here a few 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.369
 moments but I'll come back on it well 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.200
 sure during the test so with very 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.210
 nice spec but at very very low prices 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.350
 very very low and this is the case here of the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.360
 hill at 400 plus v6 so the mobile 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.369
 So here it is a mobile with a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.840
 metal back shell apparently this is 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.240
 month magnesium james and aluminum 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.640
 anodized simply good very classy 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.560
 very elegant a little style a little 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.729
 iphone 6 we are not in the copy no 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.750
 more huh we are not in the strict 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.939
 copies we are not in 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.530
 counterfeits is not in cloning 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.979
 but we are in some way aspiring to 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.329
 iphone 6 inspiration after good 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.439
 it's true that all phones that 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.909
 are a little bit rounded with costco 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.170
 metal quarries have their tendency to 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.030
 to say that it looks like the iphone 6 good 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.070
 is it if you're on a phone that 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.840
 has a screen 5 25 inches a screen 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.280
 full hd that's what is also very 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.720
 interesting full hd screen on a 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.670
 phone less than 160 euros out 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.229
 taxes freddy loyson included eh well you 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.490
 you will have noticed it you see it yourself 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.409
 you do not see yourself it's very 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.490
 aggressive good for once i let the 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.560
 phone aside you'll have noticed 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.240
 also the back of the phone is protected 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.680
 by a plastic film if not this 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.450
 central square why because that 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.100
 it's a sensitive area so that's 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.810
 that's the vote of the words so it is 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.129
 well a protective film on the back that 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.879
 you can remove since the number of 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.259
 series etc 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.209
 there will be a protective film on the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.200
 front but it's a protective film 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.280
 temporary 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.360
 no kind of protective film that you 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.440
 can be left throughout 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.280
 the use of the mobile because it is 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.319
 rather opaque 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.750
 so the box here is rather elegant 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.830
 rather classy so on the front side of 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.170
 the box we have what we have 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.700
 simply the inscription without more so 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.810
 this is the brand his models in fact he 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.819
 must know that without more it's a sit 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.440
 ins is a sales site especially in 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.760
 China 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.730
 then the brand is the brand 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.380
 coleen enough the colina breaks more and 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.290
 so this is the model specifically of 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.489
 600 cw well that's not very interesting 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.099
 in itself but know it so this is the 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.620
 sample this is the case without more it's a 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.390
 octas body so an 8 hearts octo cores 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.010
 in french octo coeur speaks in french 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.750
 so here has the connection 3g wcdma 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.310
 know that this phone is available 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.620
 in two versions there is a version 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.150
 which is an international version it's 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.440
 this one wcd m 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.390
 with the two necessary frequencies 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.650
 for France in particular and then at a 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.310
 version that is really specific 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.170
 China with the Chinese 3g so know the 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.849
 there are two versions of this phone does 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.750
 you're wrong pretend if you're 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.810
 interested in this phone 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.310
 take the version w cdma but I believe 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.930
 that on the cool grout site precisely 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.609
 Well, there is only this version 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.630
 is offered good is a mobile phone 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.280
 quad-band on it there is no 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.840
 worries we will come back of course on 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.329
 all these elements when testing a lace 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.829
 quick fast specs detail 32 gigas 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.079
 because this phone also exists in 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.400
 16 giga but on cool coulis it me 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.019
 seems that there is no 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.380
 marketed proposed that in 32 gigas 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.209
 so oct ok the 8 hearts so ceded 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.920
 8 hearts what an old gigahert of giga 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.400
 of ram 32 gigas of rome that you have it 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.900
 well understood 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.889
 seeing the boss of when you 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.690
 turn on the phone for the first time 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.519
 Once there was a little me 5 inch screen 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.930
 I tell you I told you 5.5 everything to 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.980
 the hour is a stupid dumpling years and 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.290
 5-inch resolution 1920 by 1080p 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.730
 it's a ip s full hd screen that you 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.269
 will have included rear camera 13 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.650
 megapixel 50 megapixel front camera 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.450
 3200 min lost then you see it 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.519
 it's described and it's a double sim 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.560
 and yes there are two sim cards 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.790
 there is a sensitive area at the back 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.700
 I tell you all art and android and 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.590
 android here 4.2.2 h internet connection 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.480
 more spa with both frequencies 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.950
 necessary for France in particular 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.919
 what would I have forgotten about you 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.000
 to say here ben nothing we see it w-cdma 900 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.710
 and 2000 100 billion that's the 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.020
 frequencies that we need here in France 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.300
 so there 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.560
 So the heavy township box is you 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.639
 notice there is no one of protection 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.440
 we are on a box that happens to you 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.490
 like that so the phone will play 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.699
 especially when it is completely new 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.379
 it will be seen then the box when we 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.000
 creates their well be aware that the 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:39.409
 phone so you are delivered so with 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.610
 this little protective film and when I 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:42.229
 you said it's opaque so you do not 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.150
 can not leave it on the front 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.770
 mobile it would not be very nice 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.210
 for you there is also a 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.970
 pocket under the phone because 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.810
 telephony pose here on this cover 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.400
 you have to know that when they 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.110
 send cool course get the 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.099
 pouch with small assets 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.800
 pins that simply allows you 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:00.949
 is good to remove because extracting the 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.710
 small hatch on which you can 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.520
 pass one where one or two sim cards 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.669
 there she is 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.470
 so this is mini format so that's the 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.970
 small the little paperclip that allows you 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.370
 to extract that little bit 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.919
 ok this is obviously provided to you 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.330
 in this little box but after to 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.620
 the rest there is not much because 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.539
 that normally this iphone phone with 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.860
 Chinese documentation and for the 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.150
 you do not have the documentation 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.440
 not the doc against you have a good 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.849
 guarantee if you ever have a glitch 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.659
 and it's written in Chinese 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:31.310
 good so totally unworkable for 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:33.319
 we dear European who we did not 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.490
 not Chinese in general it's a little 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:36.229
 difficult for us we are not 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.419
 many to know about it myself I 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.819
 do not know for a few not good the box 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.770
 break from parenthesis to the box so the 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.930
 here is finally the box the cradle on 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.860
 which is posed phone here on 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.539
 each of the two sides you will have 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.830
 noticed there are little pictos then 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.580
 if we invest this right side what is it 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.770
 that we find everywhere 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:57.949
 the micro usb cable sd in his little 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.500
 this bag is just going to 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:03.469
 brushes are fully expected to confirm 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.909
 via this usb cable micro usb round cable 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:06.319
 nothing very surprising it is a cable 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:06.860
 really lambda a basic of home 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:10.430
 basic 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.020
 here and on the left side of the box 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.849
 at least not what is hoop 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.919
 we do we find an adapter 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:17.509
 sector 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:22.009
 which is at the bottom I would say English 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:23.240
 chinese jia nice english me but me no 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:23.779
 I'm wrong here 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.330
 it's Chinese 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:28.039
 so the only one of the parenthesis on 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.750
 this AC adapter is we see 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:32.690
 it is that it has the mark without any more 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.889
 he is also without further back and we 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.960
 will also harel him from the mark 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:41.360
 we see it here 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:42.889
 it's without gia point csn for china and 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.960
 to be between other students 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:46.190
 breton but this is provided by grout 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.599
 cool because it's not in the way 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.460
 basic well find yourself a 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:51.020
 AC adapter to fit 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.090
 the adapter to plug it into a 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.400
 taken fr so here is simply very 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.599
 classic so to the Chinese adapter I 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.500
 believe it's Chinese that's me 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:59.900
 would not seem surprising 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.550
 since the telephonist and china with 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.460
 adapter adapter for 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.300
 europe and more specifically with regard to 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.819
 France concerns me 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.169
 so you'll have noticed there 

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:11.120
 not much in the box 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:12.650
 there are not many other things there 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.270
 there is no pedestrian kit for example everything 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.470
 simply because I recall them 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.090
 phones that are marketed in 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.130
 China are not enough not a 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.780
 obligation marketed with kits 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.830
 pedestrian it is at the free will of the brand 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.660
 this is the goodwill of the brand 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.789
 so recap of what their turn 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.470
 in the parcel box only has to 

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:29.720
 more v6 so we find a usb cable 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.759
 micro usb an AC adapter 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.250
 probably ford for recovery 

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:36.949
 formal tricks china an adapter 

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.840

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:41.389

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.789
 small cardboard in which we find hop 

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:45.770
 the small paper clip to remove the hatch 

00:07:43.789 --> 00:07:47.000
 of the two sim cards pipes that's good 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.460
