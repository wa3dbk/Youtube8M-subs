00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
diamond away from the rail and it's at

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.940 
diamond away from the rail and it's at
the<00:01:01.820> second<00:01:02.180> diamond<00:01:02.360> gonna<00:01:03.170> make<00:01:03.290> this<00:01:03.440> keep

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
the second diamond gonna make this keep

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:04.890 
the second diamond gonna make this keep
it<00:01:04.040> simple

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
it simple

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.820 
it simple
okay<00:01:06.430> I'm<00:01:07.430> gonna<00:01:07.549> separate<00:01:07.970> these<00:01:08.259> balls<00:01:09.259> but

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
okay I'm gonna separate these balls but

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.460 
okay I'm gonna separate these balls but
it<00:01:10.009> looks<00:01:10.189> like<00:01:10.540> one<00:01:11.540> two<00:01:11.810> three<00:01:12.229> four

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
it looks like one two three four

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.599 
it looks like one two three four
diamonds<00:01:14.590> now<00:01:15.590> you<00:01:15.710> need<00:01:15.829> to<00:01:15.920> mark<00:01:16.159> your<00:01:16.310> cue

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609 
diamonds now you need to mark your cue

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.440 
diamonds now you need to mark your cue
at<00:01:16.759> home<00:01:17.770> or<00:01:18.770> you<00:01:19.009> wrap<00:01:19.249> or<00:01:19.609> a<00:01:19.640> pick<00:01:19.880> a<00:01:19.909> spot<00:01:20.240> or

away from the rail is how much you
multiply<00:01:56.749> that<00:01:56.899> sixteenth<00:01:57.380> by<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:57.829> like<00:01:58.189> living

for example if that one ball was on that
this<00:02:01.459> diamond<00:02:01.789> right<00:02:01.880> here<00:02:01.999> against<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.329> rail

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
this diamond right here against the rail

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:03.699 
this diamond right here against the rail
I<00:02:02.539> would<00:02:02.810> just<00:02:02.929> double<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.259> distance<00:02:03.439> from

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
I would just double the distance from

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.769 
I would just double the distance from
the<00:02:03.859> one<00:02:04.039> ball<00:02:04.219> to<00:02:04.459> the<00:02:04.549> rail<00:02:04.729> which<00:02:05.450> I've<00:02:05.600> got

00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:05.779 
the one ball to the rail which I've got

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:08.469 
the one ball to the rail which I've got
done<00:02:05.990> right<00:02:06.170> here<00:02:06.350> with<00:02:07.130> my<00:02:07.279> thumb<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:07.789> just

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
done right here with my thumb I just

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.170 
done right here with my thumb I just

one ball is a diamond away from the rail

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.990 
one ball is a diamond away from the rail
and<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.629> one<00:02:17.810> ball<00:02:18.049> were<00:02:18.200> surrounded<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.010> we

here this is going to like I said it's a

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.729 
here this is going to like I said it's a
sixteenth<00:04:03.599> of<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.840> diamond<00:04:04.079> for<00:04:04.380> every<00:04:04.530> diamond

sixteenth of a diamond for every diamond

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.210 
sixteenth of a diamond for every diamond
they<00:04:05.459> are<00:04:05.639> apart<00:04:06.000> so<00:04:06.599> if<00:04:06.690> they're<00:04:06.870> in<00:04:06.989> this

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
they are apart so if they're in this

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.390 
they are apart so if they're in this
area<00:04:08.220> here<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:08.849> want<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.030> go<00:04:09.090> two<00:04:09.150> rails

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
area here and you want to go two rails

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.490 
area here and you want to go two rails
you<00:04:11.400> know<00:04:11.519> it's<00:04:11.700> just<00:04:12.139> sixteenth<00:04:13.139> over<00:04:13.380> there

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
you know it's just sixteenth over there

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.479 
you know it's just sixteenth over there
it's<00:04:13.620> going<00:04:13.739> to<00:04:13.799> be<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:13.950> same<00:04:14.160> exact

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
it's going to be the same exact

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.060 
it's going to be the same exact
measurement<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.870> know<00:04:15.989> they're<00:04:16.200> one<00:04:16.380> diamond

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
measurement you know they're one diamond

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.360 
measurement you know they're one diamond
of<00:04:17.280> parts<00:04:17.489> 1/16<00:04:18.289> which<00:04:19.289> is<00:04:19.440> 3/4<00:04:19.919> of<00:04:19.979> an<00:04:20.099> inch

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
of parts 1/16 which is 3/4 of an inch

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.240 
of parts 1/16 which is 3/4 of an inch
you<00:04:20.639> just<00:04:20.789> take<00:04:20.880> 3/4<00:04:21.329> inch<00:04:21.479> above<00:04:21.690> over<00:04:21.959> there

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
you just take 3/4 inch above over there

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.860 
you just take 3/4 inch above over there
to<00:04:23.250> come<00:04:23.340> back<00:04:23.550> here<00:04:23.789> if<00:04:24.150> it's<00:04:24.330> in<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.780> middle

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
to come back here if it's in the middle

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.710 
to come back here if it's in the middle
of<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.080> table<00:04:25.410> would<00:04:25.650> be<00:04:26.150> two<00:04:27.150> times<00:04:27.419> that

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
of the table would be two times that

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.550 
of the table would be two times that
because<00:04:28.139> that<00:04:29.039> was<00:04:29.130> only<00:04:29.250> one<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.520> be<00:04:29.610> 1/16

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
because that was only one to be 1/16

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.620 
because that was only one to be 1/16
