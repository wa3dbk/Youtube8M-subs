00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and you're really far into the game say

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.360

you have 400 gems do not use this hack
because<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.030> does<00:02:06.210> not<00:02:06.240> add<00:02:06.660> on<00:02:06.960> Jim's<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
because it does not add on Jim's it

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.710 
because it does not add on Jim's it
replaces<00:02:08.280> them<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:09.479> right<00:02:10.050> now<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.710> had<00:02:11.010> a

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
replaces them so right now if I had a

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.180 
replaces them so right now if I had a
thousand<00:02:12.720> gems<00:02:12.960> that<00:02:13.350> I've<00:02:13.470> just<00:02:13.500> paid<00:02:14.130> for

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
thousand gems that I've just paid for

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.660 
thousand gems that I've just paid for
and<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:15.060> did<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:15.480> hack<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:16.110> would<00:02:16.400> replace<00:02:17.400> all

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
and I did this hack it would replace all

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.500 
and I did this hack it would replace all
of<00:02:17.940> those<00:02:18.120> gyms<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.840> lose<00:02:20.000> 190<00:02:21.000> gems<00:02:21.239> so

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
of those gyms and you lose 190 gems so

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.260 
of those gyms and you lose 190 gems so
make<00:02:21.720> sure<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:22.080> don't<00:02:22.230> do<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.459> so<00:02:23.459> what<00:02:24.150> you

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
make sure you don't do that so what you

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.199 
make sure you don't do that so what you
can<00:02:24.420> do<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.630> can<00:02:24.900> just<00:02:25.200> go<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:25.830> spend<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.690> and

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
can do you can just go and spend it and

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.880 
can do you can just go and spend it and
you<00:02:30.209> know<00:02:30.330> just<00:02:30.360> keep<00:02:30.720> spending<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.380> and

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
you know just keep spending it and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.220 
you know just keep spending it and
you'll<00:02:32.070> be<00:02:32.220> good<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:35.630> then<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.930> can<00:02:37.080> do<00:02:37.200> the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
you'll be good and then you can do the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.040 
you'll be good and then you can do the
hack<00:02:37.500> again<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.100> it'll<00:02:38.310> replace<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:39.050> so

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050
