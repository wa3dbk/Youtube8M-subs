00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
is your low beam this is your high beam

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.049 
is your low beam this is your high beam
this<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.770> closer<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.399> grilles<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.969> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
floor and then I you just got your

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.420 
floor and then I you just got your
mounting<00:01:47.040> points<00:01:47.990> very<00:01:48.990> simple<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:50.100> your

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
mounting points very simple this is your

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.969 
mounting points very simple this is your
angel<00:01:50.759> eye<00:01:50.880> wiring<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.470> needs<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.770> have

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
angel eye wiring so this needs to have

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.920 
angel eye wiring so this needs to have
power<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.640> for<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.909> angel<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.600> order<00:01:54.810> for

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
power to it for the angel in order for

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.109 
power to it for the angel in order for
the<00:01:54.990> angel<00:01:55.200> eyes<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.439> turn<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.009> then<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.539 
whole kit comes with an angel eye wiring
kit<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:01.290> connects<00:02:01.829> right<00:02:02.009> into<00:02:02.040> here

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
kit so this connects right into here

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.550 
kit so this connects right into here
plug-and-play<00:02:03.479> very<00:02:04.049> easy

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
