00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:02.815
 Let's say you're looking at kids 

00:00:02.815 --> 00:00:06.430
 and you want to keep notes for every child you look at. 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.069
 She cared for 6 children in the last month 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:13.666
 and you have records of the age of all 6 children. 

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.137
 But when you review your notes, you notice, 

00:00:15.137 --> 00:00:18.297
 that some blue ink spilled over one of the numbers, 

00:00:18.297 --> 00:00:21.632
 and you do not remember how great this child was. 

00:00:21.632 --> 00:00:22.898
 At first you really wonder, 

00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:27.450
 the entire record keeping system looks like ... 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.433
 You know that information is lost. 

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:31.084
 But then you remember that every time, 

00:00:31.084 --> 00:00:34.350
 when you record a new age in that month, 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.334
 you recalculate the average value. 

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:38.668
 Here you have that the average value is 4, 

00:00:38.668 --> 00:00:41.801
 the average age is 4 for the six children. 

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:44.802
 Knowing the average value 

00:00:44.802 --> 00:00:47.301
 and the age of 5 of the 6 children, 

00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:50.037
 can you find out what is the age of the sixth child? 

00:00:50.037 --> 00:00:51.750
 I recommend that you pause the video 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.234
 and try to find her alone. 

00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:56.628
 I assume she already tried. 

00:00:56.628 --> 00:00:58.612
 Let's call it just the unknown age, 

00:00:58.612 --> 00:01:00.547
 let's call it a question mark. 

00:01:00.547 --> 00:01:02.580
 Think about how to calculate 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.918
 avarage value, 

00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:06.605
 if we know how much this question mark is. 

00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:08.415
 Yes, we would have taken the sum. 

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:10.892
 We would take the sum of everyone 

00:01:11.643 --> 00:01:13.619
 ages 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.194
 and then divide them 

00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:18.508
 of the number of children. 

00:01:18.508 --> 00:01:21.583
 Then we divide it into a number 

00:01:21.583 --> 00:01:24.217
 of the ages we have, 

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:26.532
 and this will be equal 

00:01:26.532 --> 00:01:29.281
 of the average. 

00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:30.416
 Another possibility is 

00:01:30.416 --> 00:01:33.954
 to multiply both sides by the number of ages 

00:01:33.954 --> 00:01:37.802
 from this country 

00:01:37.802 --> 00:01:42.329
 and the number of ages of that country. 

00:01:43.087 --> 00:01:44.921
 This will be shortened, 

00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:46.880
 and we shall remain with the assembly. 

00:01:47.887 --> 00:01:51.615
 The sum will be equal to 

00:01:51.615 --> 00:01:53.528
 avarage value 

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:57.073
 by age. 

00:01:57.073 --> 00:02:00.103
 The average value by 

00:02:00.103 --> 00:02:03.006
 by the number of data points, 

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:05.671
 or the number of ages. 

00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:07.187
 We will be able to use this information, 

00:02:07.187 --> 00:02:08.624
 because we only have this one 

00:02:08.624 --> 00:02:09.938
 an unknown question mark here, 

00:02:09.938 --> 00:02:12.080
 but we know the average and the number of ages. 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.937
 We just have to find out what the question mark is. 

00:02:13.937 --> 00:02:15.037
 Let's do it. 

00:02:15.037 --> 00:02:16.338
 Let's get back to the beginning, 

00:02:16.338 --> 00:02:18.838
 to make sense of all this with some numbers. 

00:02:18.838 --> 00:02:21.696
 The sum of the ages will be 

00:02:21.696 --> 00:02:25.992
 5 plus 2, 

00:02:25.992 --> 00:02:27.827
 plus a question mark, 

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:32.990
 plus 2, 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.241
 plus 4, plus 8. 

00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:40.157
 We will divide this 

00:02:40.157 --> 00:02:42.076
 of the number of ages. 

00:02:42.076 --> 00:02:43.638
 We have 6 ages. 

00:02:43.638 --> 00:02:46.156
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 

00:02:46.156 --> 00:02:47.340
 6 ages. 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.193
 And this will be equal 

00:02:49.926 --> 00:02:52.394
 of the average. 

00:02:52.394 --> 00:02:54.845
 The average value is 4. 

00:02:54.845 --> 00:02:57.375
 This is how we calculate the average value. 

00:02:57.375 --> 00:03:00.126
 Let's see if we can simplify. 

00:03:00.126 --> 00:03:03.558
 5 plus 2 is 7. 

00:03:04.844 --> 00:03:06.795
 Let me write it with ... That's another color. 

00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:10.378
 5 plus 2 is 7. 

00:03:10.378 --> 00:03:12.948
 2 plus 4 is 6, plus 8 

00:03:13.682 --> 00:03:14.347
 is 14. 

00:03:14.347 --> 00:03:16.734
 Then 7 plus 14 is 21. 

00:03:17.768 --> 00:03:20.252
 We reached 21 plus a question mark 

00:03:20.252 --> 00:03:22.351
 on 6 is equal to 4. 

00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:24.917
 Now we can do what we did at the beginning of the recording. 

00:03:24.917 --> 00:03:27.752
 We can multiply both sides by the number of ages, 

00:03:27.752 --> 00:03:28.936
 the number of data points we have. 

00:03:28.936 --> 00:03:31.209
 We can multiply 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.060
 both sides 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.658
 6. 

00:03:36.658 --> 00:03:39.893
 6 from this country, 6 from this country. 

00:03:39.893 --> 00:03:42.942
 6 in the numerator, 6 in the denominator, these are abbreviated. 

00:03:42.942 --> 00:03:44.610
 What's left to us? 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.125
 On the left side, we still have 21 plus a question mark. 

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:51.340
 The green numbers 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.274
 we have simplified them - 

00:03:52.274 --> 00:03:55.208
 5 plus 2, plus 2, plus 4, plus 8 is 21. 

00:03:55.208 --> 00:03:56.520
 And we still have the question mark. 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.804
 We get 21 plus a question mark, 

00:03:59.804 --> 00:04:01.147
 I want to write this with the green, 

00:04:02.392 --> 00:04:05.357
 21 plus this question mark - 

00:04:05.357 --> 00:04:06.871
 the thing we are trying to find, 

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:10.460
 the unknown number will be 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.272
 equal to 

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.353
 4 at 6. 

00:04:15.353 --> 00:04:16.885
 How many 4 in 6? 

00:04:16.885 --> 00:04:18.536
 24. 

00:04:19.203 --> 00:04:20.587
 And how much is the question mark? 

00:04:20.587 --> 00:04:23.705
 21 plus how much is equal to 24? 

00:04:23.705 --> 00:04:24.721
 Of course you can, 

00:04:24.721 --> 00:04:27.105
 just say that it will be 3. 

00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:28.404
 Or if you want, you can say, 

00:04:28.404 --> 00:04:30.205
 that the question mark 

00:04:30.205 --> 00:04:32.915
 will be equal 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.729
 at 24 minus 21, 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.307
 which of course is 3. 

00:04:40.116 --> 00:04:42.367
 Just to write it down, 

00:04:42.367 --> 00:04:46.116
 the question mark is equal to 3. 

00:04:46.116 --> 00:04:48.431
 We were able to find the unknown age 

00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:49.900
 based on the information we had, 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.165
 because we had the average value. 

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:54.067
 We have succeeded in finding that behind this spot, 

00:04:54.067 --> 00:04:58.240
 was written 3. 

00:04:58.994 --> 00:05:00.443
 It's very exciting.
