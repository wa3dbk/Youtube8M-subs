00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.500
 this is a presentation from the ministry 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.730
 gotti castings 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.010
 The question is Jesus the only way to 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.750
 the sky 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:38.800
 basically I'm a good person 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.379
 so I'm going to heaven ok then do 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.309
 some bad things but I do more 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:47.229
 good things so I'm going to heaven 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.269
 God is not going to send to hell 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.199
 just because I do not live according to 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.320
 Bible 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.750
 times have changed only people 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.489
 really but as 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.469
 children and murderers go to hell 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.560
 all these are common conclusions 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.740
 most people but the truth is 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.350
 that they are all sold as satan who 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.770
 have power over the world plant these 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.259
 thoughts in our minds he and 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.050
 anyone who follows his ways 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:23.649
 is an enemy of god first Pedro 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.200
 chapter 5 verse 8 satan always 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:29.290
 disguise as good according to Corinthians 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.509
 chapter 11 verse 14 but he has 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.930
 control over all minds that do not 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:39.159
 They belong to God in accordance with the Corinthians 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.750
 chapter 4 verse 4 we read satan 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.570
 god of this century 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.310
 come the understanding of unbelievers 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.189
 so that they do not shine 2 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.789
 gospel of the glory of Christ which is the 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.799
 image of god is a lie believe 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.890
 God does not care about sins of 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:00.310
 names and that hell is destined to 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.549
 people but every sin separates us from 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.039
 God even a little lie 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.019
 all have sinned and no one is good 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.039
 enough to go to heaven for his 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:13.209
 own account 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.700
 Romans chapter 3 verse 23 enter 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.790
 in heaven is not based on our good 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.120
 overcome our evil we will all lose and 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.440
 this little case and if it is by grace no longer 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.160
 it's for the works 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.220
 otherwise grace is not grace romans 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.040
 chapter 11 10 56 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.160
 there's nothing good we can do 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:40.410
 to gain our entrance into heaven 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:44.130
 chapter 3 verse 5 enter by 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.260
 narrow door because wide is the door and 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.200
 the path leading to 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.830
 and those who enter by 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.850
 she 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.650
 Chapter 7 of 53 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.350
 even if everyone is living in a 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.160
 life of sin and believe in God is not 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.130
 Popular god will not forgive this we read 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.040
 in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 2 in 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.300
 which floors were formerly the second course 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.030
 of this world 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.459
 according to the principle of the power of water 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.720
 the spirit that now acts in the children of 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.420
 disobedience 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.350
 when god created the world this was 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.340
 Perfect 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.709
 everything was good so he made Adam and Eve and 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.170
 gave them their own free will 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:32.940
 so that they would have a choice of 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.660
 continue to obey God or but Adam and Eve 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.090
 the first people God thinks 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:44.220
 were tempted by Satan to disobey 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.200
 God and they sinned it prevented them and 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.810
 to all who came after them 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.370
 including us having a relationship 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.980
 intimate with God he is perfect and not 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.150
 may be in the midst of sin as 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.580
 sinners 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.989
 we could not get there for our 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.739
 own will 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.750
 So God created a way by which 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.480
 we could be united with him in heaven 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.630
 because god loved the world in such a way 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.060
 who gave his only begotten son 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.470
 whoever believes in him shall not perish but have 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.880
 eternal life 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:24.030
 John 3 16 because the wages of sin is the 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.820
 death but the gift of God is the 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.260
 eternal life in christ jesus our lord 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.150
 Romans chapter 6 verse 23 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.669
 Jesus was born so that he could 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.160
 teach the way and die for our 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.419
 sins so that we would not have to 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.729
 do 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.810
 three days after his death he 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.020
 resurrected 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.510
 The Roman Club Chapter 4 Verse 25 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.080
 provoking even victorious over the 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.240
 show 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.310
 he completed the path between god and 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.380
 so that he could have a 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.980
 personal relationship with him 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.250
 just needing to believe and life 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.190
 this eternal who knows you a tir the 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:08.790
 the only true god and the 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.050
 who sent John chapter 17 verse 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.050
 3 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.510
 Most people believe in God. 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.200
 even satan believes 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.960
 but to receive salvation you need to be 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.200
 back to god form a relationship 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.560
 with him to return to the 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.410
 our sins and follow him. 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:35.340
 believe in Jesus with everything we have and 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:39.150
 in everything we do Romans chapter 3 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.610
 verse 22 justice of God through 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.610
 faith in Jesus Christ to all who 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.039
 believe because there is no distinction 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.169
 The Bible teaches us that there is no other 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:52.110
 the way to salvation 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:54.720
 through jesus christ say john 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.750
 chapter 14 verse 6 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.530
 I'm the way, the truth and the life 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.400
 No one comes to the Father except through me. 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.680
 Jesus is the only way to salvation 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.410
 because he is the only one who can afford the 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.750
 price for our Roman sins 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.690
 chapter 6 verse 23 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.760
 no other religion teaches 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.650
 depth or seriousness of sin and 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.810
 of its consequences 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.360
 no other religion offers the 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.910
 infinite payment that only Jesus could 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.030
 give for sin no other founder 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.400
 religious was Jesus coming as a man 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.039
 the only way a debt 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.070
 infinite could be paid jesus had 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:39.060
 that being god so he could pay 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.580
 our technician 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.690
 Jesus had to be a man so that he 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.450
 could die 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:49.440
 salvation is only available through 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:52.340
 faith in Jesus Christ and there is no salvation in 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.860
 another because below the sky 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.830
 there is no other name given among the 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:01.250
 men that it matters that we are the
