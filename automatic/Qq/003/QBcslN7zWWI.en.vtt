had<00:02:52.710> let<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.400> go<00:02:53.660> or<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.890> trimmed<00:02:55.890> off<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.070> fat

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
had let it go or I trimmed off the fat

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.310 
had let it go or I trimmed off the fat
took<00:02:56.910> off<00:02:57.060> some<00:02:57.270> of<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.420> membrane<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.110> stuff

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
took off some of the membrane and stuff

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.930 
took off some of the membrane and stuff
like<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.740> and<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.190> don't<00:02:59.280> know<00:02:59.550> if<00:02:59.670> you're

lamb most everybody I've seen has

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.580 
lamb most everybody I've seen has
actually<00:03:04.560> cooked<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.040> pretty<00:03:06.140> pretty<00:03:07.140> much<00:03:07.350> as

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
actually cooked it pretty pretty much as

is Buffalo so we'll see see how check
out<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:16.470> other<00:03:16.620> thing<00:03:16.770> I<00:03:16.890> did<00:03:17.280> was<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.890> drip

out the other thing I did was and drip
pan<00:03:20.100> there<00:03:21.260> instead<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.320> just<00:03:22.380> putting<00:03:22.680> water

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
pan there instead of just putting water

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.280 
pan there instead of just putting water
I<00:03:23.130> put<00:03:23.430> vegetable<00:03:24.030> broth<00:03:24.239> chopped<00:03:24.870> up<00:03:25.050> some

we'll see how that turns out I'm on the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.949 
we'll see how that turns out I'm on the
fat<00:03:35.459> drippings<00:03:35.970> dripped<00:03:36.720> down<00:03:36.780> into<00:03:37.140> there

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
fat drippings dripped down into there

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.740 
fat drippings dripped down into there
just<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.170> see<00:03:40.470> what<00:03:41.209> see<00:03:42.209> how<00:03:42.270> that<00:03:42.450> turns<00:03:42.630> out

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
just to see what see how that turns out

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.040 
just to see what see how that turns out

couple others I stuffed in some fresh
thyme<00:04:12.850> so<00:04:13.720> we'll<00:04:14.680> see<00:04:14.830> how<00:04:14.920> this<00:04:15.040> all<00:04:15.220> turns

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
thyme so we'll see how this all turns

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.699 
thyme so we'll see how this all turns
out<00:04:15.700> here<00:04:16.150> come<00:04:16.810> back<00:04:17.020> in<00:04:17.230> a<00:04:17.290> little<00:04:17.410> bit<00:04:17.620> and

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
out here come back in a little bit and

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.979 
out here come back in a little bit and
take<00:04:17.890> a<00:04:17.920> look<00:04:18.190> I<00:04:18.310> don't<00:04:18.370> want<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:18.760> pull<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.120> lid

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
take a look I don't want to pull the lid

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.660 
take a look I don't want to pull the lid
off<00:04:20.200> like<00:04:20.530> I<00:04:20.560> said<00:04:20.830> it's<00:04:20.920> breezy<00:04:21.310> out<00:04:21.430> here

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
off like I said it's breezy out here

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.010 
off like I said it's breezy out here
it's<00:04:21.910> hard<00:04:22.090> enough<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.390> keep<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.630> temperature

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
it's hard enough to keep the temperature

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.380 
it's hard enough to keep the temperature
down<00:04:23.050> pulling<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.680> lid<00:04:23.920> off<00:04:24.070> will<00:04:24.280> just<00:04:24.490> cause

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
down pulling the lid off will just cause

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.800 
down pulling the lid off will just cause
a<00:04:25.420> nice<00:04:25.720> big<00:04:25.990> flare<00:04:26.350> up<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:27.330> not<00:04:28.330> necessarily

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
a nice big flare up and not necessarily

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.450 
a nice big flare up and not necessarily
of<00:04:28.900> flames<00:04:29.230> but<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.710> temperature<00:04:30.100> will<00:04:30.130> shoot

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
of flames but the temperature will shoot

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.150 
of flames but the temperature will shoot
right<00:04:30.670> up<00:04:30.820> that's<00:04:31.090> one<00:04:31.810> of<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:31.960> reasons<00:04:32.200> my

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
right up that's one of the reasons my

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.680 
right up that's one of the reasons my
temperature<00:04:33.520> controls<00:04:33.940> so<00:04:34.120> hard<00:04:34.390> with<00:04:34.510> these

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
temperature controls so hard with these

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.960 
temperature controls so hard with these
I<00:04:35.200> have<00:04:35.950> so<00:04:36.130> much<00:04:36.220> trouble<00:04:36.460> at<00:04:36.640> least<00:04:36.790> with

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
I have so much trouble at least with

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.090 
I have so much trouble at least with
these<00:04:37.090> things<00:04:37.390> but<00:04:37.660> you<00:04:37.930> know<00:04:38.050> miss<00:04:38.770> my<00:04:38.950> first

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
these things but you know miss my first

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.580 
these things but you know miss my first
charcoal<00:04:39.670> grill<00:04:39.940> is<00:04:40.180> and<00:04:40.750> I<00:04:41.050> only<00:04:41.230> had<00:04:41.440> it<00:04:41.470> for

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
charcoal grill is and I only had it for

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.270 
charcoal grill is and I only had it for
a<00:04:41.740> few<00:04:41.920> months<00:04:42.070> so<00:04:42.370> I'm<00:04:42.490> slowly<00:04:42.820> learning<00:04:43.180> but

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
a few months so I'm slowly learning but

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.770 
a few months so I'm slowly learning but
we'll<00:04:45.280> come<00:04:45.430> back<00:04:45.460> may<00:04:45.880> pull<00:04:46.150> it<00:04:46.360> off<00:04:46.510> in<00:04:46.690> a

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
we'll come back may pull it off in a

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.440 
we'll come back may pull it off in a
little<00:04:46.870> bit<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:48.070> so<00:04:48.370> about<00:04:48.610> three<00:04:48.970> hours<00:04:49.090> into

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
little bit and so about three hours into

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:59.670 
little bit and so about three hours into
this<00:04:49.660> cook<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:54.480> meat<00:04:55.480> temperature<00:04:56.430> at<00:04:58.680> 154

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
this cook the meat temperature at 154

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.330 
this cook the meat temperature at 154
here<00:05:01.860> finally<00:05:02.860> got<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:04.050> temperature<00:05:05.050> to<00:05:05.680> be

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
here finally got the temperature to be

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.330 
here finally got the temperature to be
controllable<00:05:07.000> here<00:05:07.480> with<00:05:08.040> holding<00:05:09.040> steady

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
controllable here with holding steady

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.660

like<00:05:31.810> I<00:05:31.840> said<00:05:32.140> I<00:05:32.170> want<00:05:32.380> to<00:05:32.500> get<00:05:32.650> in<00:05:32.800> there<00:05:33.040> at

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
like I said I want to get in there at

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.670 
like I said I want to get in there at
about<00:05:35.550> mmm<00:05:36.550> maybe<00:05:37.480> 165

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
about mmm maybe 165

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.470 
about mmm maybe 165
I<00:05:38.710> think<00:05:39.300> should<00:05:40.300> hold<00:05:40.540> hold<00:05:41.170> steady<00:05:41.500> there

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
I think should hold hold steady there

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.840 
I think should hold hold steady there
and<00:05:43.560> we'll<00:05:44.560> check<00:05:44.770> back<00:05:44.830> again<00:05:45.100> a<00:05:45.460> little<00:05:45.730> bit

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
and we'll check back again a little bit

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:51.480 
and we'll check back again a little bit
later<00:05:46.530> so<00:05:48.000> there<00:05:49.000> you<00:05:49.090> go<00:05:49.650> so<00:05:50.650> right<00:05:51.100> at<00:05:51.250> four

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
later so there you go so right at four

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.260 
later so there you go so right at four
hours<00:05:52.410> 163<00:05:55.320> bumped<00:05:56.320> up<00:05:56.410> the<00:05:56.560> temperature<00:05:56.980> to

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
hours 163 bumped up the temperature to

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.930 
hours 163 bumped up the temperature to
300<00:05:58.270> there<00:05:59.200> jump<00:05:59.500> back<00:05:59.680> to<00:05:59.710> fifth<00:06:00.190> back<00:06:00.760> down

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
300 there jump back to fifth back down

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.749 
300 there jump back to fifth back down
to<00:06:01.120> 50<00:06:01.420> so<00:06:01.600> I<00:06:01.630> think<00:06:01.720> the<00:06:02.020> calls<00:06:02.260> are<00:06:02.470> probably

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 
to 50 so I think the calls are probably

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:07.419 
to 50 so I think the calls are probably
