 we present one 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.199
 the photo booth to the operation below 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.609
 difficult conditions adapted 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.680
 thanks to which as are all 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.570
 to document events by using 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.220
 conventional equipment is not 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.579
 could be recorded 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.540
 in the set there are camera modules 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.280
 instructions for use esm module with 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.390
 additional batteries and bag belt 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.089
 with bracket usb cable tv cable cd-rom 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.589
 with software to start the operation 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.269
 put the batteries in the 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:54.000
 Battery compartment on the bottom of the 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.610
 device under the flap are 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.010
 also a power button 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.489
 memory card slot usb slot audio output 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.830
 to insert the charger plug after inserting 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.110
 sd card and you turn it on the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.439
 test mode appears on the above 2 inches 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.970
 great display to rate the camera image 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.770
 the gaze of the device and 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.530
 Rethinking are the final placement 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.110
 the photo booth below the displays 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.090
 is the navigation buttons in 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.610
 which you after leaving the menu 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 Parameters of image motion editorial 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.229
 date and time renewed 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.210
 motion reaction or whether both 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.429
 Detection of a rain stand is just one 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.729
 photo a video or both in parallel 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.109
 should be created recording time and 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.929
 photo number are also 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.759
 programmable test mode you can 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.560
 also recognize in which moment the 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.280
 Motion detect something 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.889
 the led diodes on the account panel you 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.090
 To activate the broad or skin 

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:53.100
 motion 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.710
 in their scope are also 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.750
 a light sensor and infrared diodes 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.090
 For a long time, the device can also be used at night 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.219
 working below is the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.740
 objective and india of the skin 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.069
 Motion detector two additional 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.840
 are a little deeper where they are in 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.879
 stay in test mode you can move up 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.810
 the corresponding button photos and 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.060
 create videos 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.459
 However, if one or beets and 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.209
 should opt for automatic detection 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.799
 the device will be switched to the mode 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.930
 The display goes outside the device is 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:28.380
 everything without imitating noises or 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.299
 register light signals if you have the 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.829
 leave the device for a longer time 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.290
 you may want the extra 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.329
 battery compartment then be its 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.519
 You can see the function of the presenter and 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:42.150
 mms messages to a specified 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.950
 phone number or e mail to bonuses it 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.049
 a sim card in the web is sufficient 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.160
 place and the whole module to the 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.079
 device to connect 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.690
 the photo is falling memorandum 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.340
 the specified time intervals send the 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.440
 operating time can with additional 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.780
 supply source up to six months 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.209
 the standby mode is guaranteed 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.430
 Saving energy and signals the operation 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.760
 The device will not be images in 12 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.299
 or 5 megapixel resolution saved 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:13.220
 video recordings 640 x 480 maximum 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:16.170
 memory card capacity is 32 gb 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.790
 of the attached belt can be the device 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.380
 easy in hard to reach places 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.030
 to be placed 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.240
 Housing cable ensures effects 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.310
 remove cover and open the 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.410
 memory card or close it 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.500
 Connects to a pc for the materials 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.540
 By seeing the device is called 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.820
 Removable disk detected and they have 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.590
 access to the data 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.900
 and there asked a face equipment 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.640
 ideal for long-term monitoring even 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.280
 under difficult weather around not 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.260
 The photocall is operated by 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.000
 hunters who monitor animal behavior 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.110
 and promoted the tree theft 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.110
 used in a controlled manner
