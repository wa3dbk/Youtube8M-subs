00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.409
 hello everyone today dances 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.870
 video 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:09.469
 if I'm going to show you how to do 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.980
 an outdoor rink so to have 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.829
 results like those with ice there 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.529
 There are several steps to follow before 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:22.039
 can skate on it so the first 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:26.390
 step is to limit the outline of its 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:30.259
 rink with either bus as I lÃ© 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:34.760
 do it here or with preconceived tapes 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.770
 sending it must be careful of not 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.190
 kept too much blood spaces that 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.360
 stuffy 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.210
 otherwise louvre pierced at work then 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.750
 your rink therefore includes the second 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.840
 step here to buy placed a canvas of 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.109
 plastic trail tripolitan like 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.109
 right here 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.180
 is that they sell in all 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.160
 exits building halls or either 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.250
 if you want a language there are some 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:11.650
 other blank sections in this day 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:16.030
 so you have to cut the polythene about 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:19.570
 1 which does not exceed total costs for 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.720
 can the facts of the past in the 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.790
 banks is bypassed the logs not that 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.780
 water escapes 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:32.560
 when she goes up like this 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.590
 we can see here the starting canvas of the 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.930
 station 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.350
 no time that the expanse everywhere one 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.940
 can begin to dew the flood a 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.780
 first time so we leave that to 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:51.300
 needs a good good 30 minutes for 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:55.990
 to raise the water it is necessary to water 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.100
 when it is between - 2 and - 20 for 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.450
 that crystallizes well then face to buddy 2 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.840
 so really secret of a good dough 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.340
 mans it's put it there polythene center 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.819
 they pay attention when it was the 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.080
 snow the first time why that 12 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.880
 are your worst you have bullshit 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.090
 so that a household was found one 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.260
 pearls well when there is a foot of two 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.599
 ice creams are not cleared with a map 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.360
 for buses when there is this ice cream 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.880
 which is worth its trade and high on 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.459
 can dig in the snow 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:37.569
 thank you goal outside the rink 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:40.450
 to maximize the space of play so we 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.000
 eat it anywhere about a foot ten 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.030
 people have one foot of 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.819
 people once knows reached 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.140
 not very weathered for the first time there 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.970
 had fun with all his family 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.650
 after having skated 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.020
 must have must have watered 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.650
