now<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:01.890> mentioned<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.460> microwave<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:02.939> hydrogen

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
now I mentioned the microwave a hydrogen

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.369 
now I mentioned the microwave a hydrogen
cracker<00:00:04.339> that's<00:00:05.339> this<00:00:05.700> device<00:00:06.089> here<00:00:06.450> and<00:00:06.690> let

the technology this could be the sub
device<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:52.020> kind<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.590> looks<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:53.010> strange

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
device that kind of looks like a strange

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.750 
device that kind of looks like a strange
alien<00:00:53.610> device<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:56.190> appears<00:00:56.520> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
alien device but it appears to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.450 
alien device but it appears to
disassociate<00:00:57.829> hydrogen<00:00:58.829> from<00:00:59.100> water

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
disassociate hydrogen from water

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.880 
disassociate hydrogen from water
molecules<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.750> only<00:01:00.840> takes<00:01:01.050> up<00:01:01.260> about<00:01:01.410> 60

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
molecules and it only takes up about 60

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.460 
molecules and it only takes up about 60
watts<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.850> apparently<00:01:03.390> uses<00:01:04.019> some<00:01:04.260> type

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
watts and it apparently uses some type

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.980 
watts and it apparently uses some type
of<00:01:05.299> magnetron<00:01:06.299> device<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:07.140> maybe<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.990> maybe

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
of magnetron device that maybe the maybe

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.270 
of magnetron device that maybe the maybe
to<00:01:10.260> magnetrons<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.990> use<00:01:13.010> microwaves<00:01:14.010> to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
to magnetrons that use microwaves to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.999 
to magnetrons that use microwaves to
disassociate<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.600> water<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.409> hydrogen<00:01:16.530> from

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
disassociate the water the hydrogen from

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.600 
disassociate the water the hydrogen from
the<00:01:17.100> front<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.820> water<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.390> basically<00:01:18.990> fed

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
the front of water so it's basically fed

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.090 
the front of water so it's basically fed
direct<00:01:20.610> tap<00:01:21.540> water<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.930> think<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.320> may<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.740> to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
direct tap water I think it may have to

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.330 
direct tap water I think it may have to
be<00:01:23.130> filtered<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.030> purified<00:01:24.860> don't<00:01:25.860> believe

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
be filtered and purified don't believe

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.590 
be filtered and purified don't believe
there's<00:01:26.490> any<00:01:26.610> electrolytes<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.390> but<00:01:27.509> it's

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
there's any electrolytes to it but it's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.880 
there's any electrolytes to it but it's
quite<00:01:27.750> interesting<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.350> want<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.590> look<00:01:28.770> at

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
quite interesting if you want to look at

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.429 
quite interesting if you want to look at
it<00:01:29.119> just<00:01:30.119> just<00:01:30.450> type<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.960> these<00:01:31.170> keywords

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
it just just type in these keywords

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.410 
it just just type in these keywords

I'm<00:02:24.230> going<00:02:24.379> to<00:02:24.469> zoom<00:02:24.500> in<00:02:25.010> we<00:02:25.340> find<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.879> good

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
I'm going to zoom in we find a good

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:34.059 
I'm going to zoom in we find a good
explanation<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.769> technology<00:02:28.400> here<00:02:33.069> I'm

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
explanation of the technology here I'm

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.379 
explanation of the technology here I'm
going<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:35.109> stop<00:02:36.109> the<00:02:36.260> music<00:02:36.560> for<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:36.799> second<00:02:37.389> and

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:38.389 
going to stop the music for a second and

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.190 
going to stop the music for a second and
let<00:02:39.349> me<00:02:39.469> find<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.739> animation<00:02:40.430> here<00:02:41.180> we<00:02:41.269> go<00:02:41.419> let

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
let me find the animation here we go let

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.619 
let me find the animation here we go let
me<00:02:42.319> zoom<00:02:42.530> in<00:02:42.879> so<00:02:43.879> you<00:02:43.939> can<00:02:44.030> see<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.299> animation

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
me zoom in so you can see the animation

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:53.339 
me zoom in so you can see the animation
of<00:02:44.959> this<00:02:48.370> now<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:50.180> Kwazii<00:02:50.419> turban<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:50.989> really

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
of this now the Kwazii turban is really

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.089 
of this now the Kwazii turban is really
quite<00:02:54.349> fascinating<00:02:54.549> it's<00:02:55.549> a<00:02:55.700> very<00:02:56.030> simple

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
quite fascinating it's a very simple

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.550 
quite fascinating it's a very simple
internal<00:02:58.099> combustion<00:02:58.489> engine<00:02:58.879> gas<00:02:59.629> is<00:03:00.049> fed<00:03:00.290> in

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
internal combustion engine gas is fed in

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.110 
internal combustion engine gas is fed in
through<00:03:01.370> here<00:03:01.579> and<00:03:01.760> i'm<00:03:01.849> assuming

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
through here and i'm assuming

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.869 
through here and i'm assuming
oxy-hydrogen<00:03:03.019> would<00:03:03.560> be<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.709> good<00:03:03.919> candidate

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
oxy-hydrogen would be a good candidate

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.300 
oxy-hydrogen would be a good candidate
for<00:03:04.939> this<00:03:05.269> it's<00:03:06.049> compressed<00:03:06.680> as<00:03:06.829> it<00:03:06.950> travels

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
for this it's compressed as it travels

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.679 
for this it's compressed as it travels
up<00:03:07.489> here<00:03:07.819> I'm<00:03:07.879> going<00:03:07.969> to<00:03:08.060> follow<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.299> mouse<00:03:08.450> up

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
up here I'm going to follow the mouse up

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.360 
up here I'm going to follow the mouse up
and<00:03:08.810> here's<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.349> spark<00:03:09.709> plug<00:03:09.889> it<00:03:10.010> could<00:03:10.129> also<00:03:10.250> be

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
and here's a spark plug it could also be

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.619 
and here's a spark plug it could also be
a<00:03:10.519> laser<00:03:11.329> it<00:03:12.109> ignites<00:03:12.439> the<00:03:12.620> gas<00:03:12.799> and<00:03:13.250> are<00:03:14.239> in

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
a laser it ignites the gas and are in

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.629 
a laser it ignites the gas and are in
which<00:03:14.930> case<00:03:15.260> an<00:03:15.440> implosion<00:03:15.769> would<00:03:16.069> occur<00:03:16.370> and

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
which case an implosion would occur and

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.280 
which case an implosion would occur and
I'm<00:03:16.729> assuming<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.269> would<00:03:17.329> still<00:03:17.690> force<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:18.139> in

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
I'm assuming it would still force it in

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.159 
I'm assuming it would still force it in
this<00:03:18.409> direction<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:19.190> then<00:03:19.909> down<00:03:20.629> here<00:03:20.659> the

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
this direction and then down here the

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.009 
this direction and then down here the
water<00:03:21.650> would<00:03:22.430> condense<00:03:22.819> and<00:03:23.090> just<00:03:23.359> go<00:03:23.810> back

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
water would condense and just go back

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.710 
water would condense and just go back
outside<00:03:24.229> of<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:25.250> engine<00:03:25.609> you<00:03:26.329> could<00:03:26.569> use

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
outside of the the engine you could use

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.349 
outside of the the engine you could use
the<00:03:26.900> micro<00:03:27.229> turbine<00:03:27.650> micro<00:03:28.340> turbines<00:03:28.669> looks

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
the micro turbine micro turbines looks

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.179 
the micro turbine micro turbines looks
like<00:03:29.569> they<00:03:29.750> might<00:03:29.900> be<00:03:30.079> fairly<00:03:30.470> expensive<00:03:30.859> for

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.189 
like they might be fairly expensive for

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:32.589 
like they might be fairly expensive for
a<00:03:31.220> residential<00:03:31.609> unit<00:03:32.030> that's<00:03:32.180> why<00:03:32.359> I<00:03:32.389> picked

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
a residential unit that's why I picked

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.460 
a residential unit that's why I picked
the<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:33.019> Kwazii<00:03:33.470> turban<00:03:34.449> as<00:03:35.449> the<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.290> main

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
the the Kwazii turban as the the main

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.309 
the the Kwazii turban as the the main
component<00:03:36.739> of<00:03:37.040> this<00:03:37.159> the<00:03:37.939> system<00:03:38.359> that<00:03:38.389> I<00:03:38.569> that

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
component of this the system that I that

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.140 
component of this the system that I that
I<00:03:39.470> designed<00:03:39.889> I'm<00:03:40.099> going<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:40.489> close<00:03:40.669> this<00:03:40.729> out

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
I designed I'm going to close this out

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.759 
I designed I'm going to close this out
and<00:03:41.979> go<00:03:42.979> back<00:03:43.129> to<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.370> schematic<00:03:43.819> again<00:03:44.739> the

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:54.849 

now<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:48.829> the<00:03:52.659> the<00:03:53.659> Hydra<00:03:54.079> sonic<00:03:54.379> pump<00:03:54.650> is

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
now the the the Hydra sonic pump is

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:59.679 
now the the the Hydra sonic pump is
quite<00:03:55.099> interesting<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:55.609> I<00:03:56.409> found<00:03:57.409> this<00:03:57.739> a<00:03:58.689> by

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
quite interesting and I found this a by

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.110 
quite interesting and I found this a by
accident<00:04:00.379> actually<00:04:00.560> in<00:04:00.949> head<00:04:01.159> which<00:04:01.370> is<00:04:01.400> that

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
accident actually in head which is that

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.089 
accident actually in head which is that
it<00:04:02.449> was<00:04:02.659> on<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.900> video<00:04:03.199> that<00:04:03.409> was<00:04:03.500> posted<00:04:03.709> and

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
it was on the video that was posted and

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.039 
it was on the video that was posted and
I<00:04:04.459> was<00:04:04.579> called<00:04:04.849> it<00:04:05.000> runs<00:04:05.209> on<00:04:05.359> water<00:04:05.629> it<00:04:05.900> was<00:04:05.989> a

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
I was called it runs on water it was a

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.270 
I was called it runs on water it was a
British<00:04:06.439> made<00:04:07.040> television<00:04:07.699> program<00:04:08.419> that<00:04:09.280> was

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
British made television program that was

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.569 
British made television program that was
produced<00:04:10.549> and<00:04:10.819> I<00:04:11.090> think<00:04:11.329> 1995<00:04:12.259> and<00:04:12.560> in<00:04:13.340> it

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
produced and I think 1995 and in it

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.670 
produced and I think 1995 and in it
there<00:04:14.030> were<00:04:14.150> several<00:04:14.569> technologies<00:04:15.049> the<00:04:15.530> one

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
there were several technologies the one

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.019 
there were several technologies the one
was<00:04:15.859> a<00:04:15.889> water<00:04:16.099> fuel<00:04:16.310> cell<00:04:16.609> but<00:04:16.820> the<00:04:16.880> first

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:17.029 
was a water fuel cell but the first

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.069 
was a water fuel cell but the first
technology<00:04:17.690> that<00:04:17.840> they<00:04:17.900> described<00:04:18.320> on<00:04:18.500> here

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
technology that they described on here

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.969 
technology that they described on here
was<00:04:20.009> the<00:04:20.729> hydro<00:04:21.239> sonic<00:04:21.509> pump<00:04:21.780> invented<00:04:22.590> by<00:04:22.680> Jim

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
was the hydro sonic pump invented by Jim

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.610 
was the hydro sonic pump invented by Jim
grits<00:04:23.340> out<00:04:23.729> of<00:04:23.909> I<00:04:24.509> think<00:04:25.080> it's<00:04:25.199> not<00:04:25.349> about

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
grits out of I think it's not about

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.379 
grits out of I think it's not about
Georgia<00:04:26.129> I<00:04:26.280> was<00:04:26.550> i<00:04:26.669> I<00:04:26.879> think<00:04:27.439> Athens<00:04:28.439> and<00:04:29.400> the

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
Georgia I was i I think Athens and the

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.689 
Georgia I was i I think Athens and the
company<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:31.110> still<00:04:31.830> in<00:04:31.919> business<00:04:32.069> here's<00:04:32.550> the

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
company is still in business here's the

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.939 
company is still in business here's the
video<00:04:32.819> that<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:33.300> did<00:04:33.509> I<00:04:33.659> mention<00:04:34.139> I<00:04:34.319> think<00:04:34.830> it's

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
video that I did I mention I think it's

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.770 
video that I did I mention I think it's
a<00:04:35.039> strong<00:04:35.310> possibility<00:04:35.340> Zartha<00:04:36.330> secret<00:04:36.659> are

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
a strong possibility Zartha secret are

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.689 
a strong possibility Zartha secret are
at<00:04:37.080> a<00:04:37.110> turning<00:04:37.500> point<00:04:37.740> in<00:04:38.009> history<00:04:38.219> and<00:04:38.520> i'ma

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
at a turning point in history and i'ma

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.790 
at a turning point in history and i'ma
turn<00:04:38.879> it<00:04:39.030> down<00:04:39.419> so<00:04:39.719> I<00:04:39.780> English<00:04:40.259> you<00:04:40.379> need<00:04:40.500> human

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
turn it down so I English you need human

technologies<00:05:07.289> are<00:05:07.560> discussed<00:05:08.340> the<00:05:08.789> first<00:05:09.030> one

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
technologies are discussed the first one

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.540 
technologies are discussed the first one
is<00:05:09.599> the<00:05:10.139> Hydra<00:05:10.409> sonic<00:05:10.710> pump<00:05:11.039> and<00:05:13.550> well

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
is the Hydra sonic pump and well

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.300 
is the Hydra sonic pump and well
actually<00:05:14.759> it's<00:05:15.090> just<00:05:15.210> probably<00:05:16.129> it's<00:05:17.129> going

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
actually it's just probably it's going

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.070 
actually it's just probably it's going
to<00:05:17.370> be<00:05:17.430> a<00:05:17.460> while<00:05:17.639> before<00:05:17.789> I<00:05:18.029> can<00:05:18.090> stream<00:05:19.050> the

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
to be a while before I can stream the

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.110 
to be a while before I can stream the
video<00:05:19.289> so<00:05:19.800> I'm<00:05:19.949> going<00:05:20.099> to<00:05:20.129> close<00:05:20.310> this<00:05:20.370> out<00:05:20.789> but

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
video so I'm going to close this out but

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.809 
video so I'm going to close this out but
I<00:05:21.150> encourage<00:05:21.629> everyone<00:05:21.870> to<00:05:22.020> walk<00:05:22.259> to<00:05:22.580> to<00:05:23.580> watch

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:23.819 
I encourage everyone to walk to to watch

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:26.749 
I encourage everyone to walk to to watch
this<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:24.509> find<00:05:25.469> it<00:05:25.590> online<00:05:25.710> and<00:05:26.190> see<00:05:26.580> for

this and find it online and see for

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.610 
this and find it online and see for
yourself<00:05:27.120> but<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.419> hydro<00:05:27.690> sonic<00:05:27.930> pump<00:05:28.139> I<00:05:28.259> do

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
yourself but the hydro sonic pump I do

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.510 
yourself but the hydro sonic pump I do
have<00:05:28.889> their<00:05:29.330> it's<00:05:30.330> hydro<00:05:30.629> dynamics<00:05:31.190> com<00:05:32.190> is

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
have their it's hydro dynamics com is

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.339 
have their it's hydro dynamics com is
that<00:05:32.699> is<00:05:32.819> the<00:05:33.000> website<00:05:33.180> you<00:05:33.629> can<00:05:33.990> go<00:05:34.020> there

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
that is the website you can go there

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.680 
that is the website you can go there
look<00:05:34.589> at<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:34.740> technology<00:05:35.370> you<00:05:36.029> can<00:05:36.150> also<00:05:36.330> see

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
look at the technology you can also see

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.140 
look at the technology you can also see
it<00:05:36.810> in<00:05:36.990> in<00:05:37.620> that<00:05:37.830> video<00:05:38.099> that<00:05:38.250> i<00:05:38.460> just<00:05:38.550> showed

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:49.970 

and<00:05:42.150> here's<00:05:42.509> the<00:05:42.629> website<00:05:42.750> it's<00:05:44.960> coming<00:05:45.960> up

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.300 

well<00:05:50.580> it's<00:05:50.820> taking<00:05:51.270> a<00:05:51.360> little<00:05:51.450> while<00:05:51.570> so

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
well it's taking a little while so

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.840 
well it's taking a little while so
anyway<00:05:53.310> I<00:05:53.720> hope<00:05:54.720> you<00:05:54.810> I<00:05:55.530> hope<00:05:56.160> to<00:05:56.460> post<00:05:56.610> a

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
anyway I hope you I hope to post a

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.450 
anyway I hope you I hope to post a
somehow<00:05:57.240> online<00:05:57.660> and<00:05:57.990> send<00:05:58.470> the<00:05:58.560> link<00:05:58.800> but<00:05:59.070> I

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
somehow online and send the link but I

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.280 
somehow online and send the link but I
think<00:06:00.030> this<00:06:00.240> is<00:06:00.420> this<00:06:00.660> system<00:06:01.050> is<00:06:01.200> a<00:06:01.890> pretty

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
think this is this system is a pretty

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.870 
think this is this system is a pretty
it's<00:06:04.290> pretty<00:06:04.770> accurate<00:06:05.190> I'm<00:06:05.550> not<00:06:05.700> sure<00:06:05.850> about

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
it's pretty accurate I'm not sure about

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.620 
it's pretty accurate I'm not sure about
the<00:06:06.150> number<00:06:06.480> so<00:06:06.720> I<00:06:06.750> know<00:06:07.110> I<00:06:07.970> soo<00:06:08.970> min<00:06:09.120> one<00:06:09.480> more

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
the number so I know I soo min one more

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.440 
the number so I know I soo min one more
time<00:06:09.900> and<00:06:10.140> see<00:06:11.010> if<00:06:11.340> I<00:06:11.400> can<00:06:11.550> show<00:06:12.150> you<00:06:12.210> what<00:06:12.420> I

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
time and see if I can show you what I

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.900 
time and see if I can show you what I
what<00:06:12.840> I've<00:06:12.960> done<00:06:13.140> at<00:06:13.290> the<00:06:13.350> top<00:06:13.620> as<00:06:13.920> far<00:06:14.640> as<00:06:14.760> the

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
what I've done at the top as far as the

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.970 
what I've done at the top as far as the
electrical<00:06:15.360> input<00:06:15.570> I'm<00:06:16.200> assuming<00:06:16.830> that<00:06:16.950> each

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
electrical input I'm assuming that each

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.820 
electrical input I'm assuming that each
water<00:06:17.310> fuel<00:06:17.580> cell<00:06:17.850> might<00:06:18.090> take<00:06:18.330> up<00:06:18.930> as<00:06:19.200> many<00:06:19.410> as

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
water fuel cell might take up as many as

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.930 
water fuel cell might take up as many as
100<00:06:20.520> watts<00:06:20.730> per<00:06:21.060> unit<00:06:21.480> and<00:06:22.340> let<00:06:23.340> me<00:06:23.430> scroll

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
100 watts per unit and let me scroll

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.040 
100 watts per unit and let me scroll
over<00:06:24.000> here<00:06:24.480> and<00:06:25.370> so<00:06:26.370> and<00:06:26.670> if<00:06:26.970> you<00:06:27.060> and<00:06:27.330> if<00:06:27.480> we<00:06:27.690> if

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
over here and so and if you and if we if

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.110 
over here and so and if you and if we if
you<00:06:28.170> be<00:06:28.470> able<00:06:28.530> to<00:06:28.620> get<00:06:28.800> a<00:06:28.830> microwave<00:06:29.310> hydrogen

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
you be able to get a microwave hydrogen

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.360 
you be able to get a microwave hydrogen
skimmer<00:06:30.420> that's<00:06:31.170> probably<00:06:31.650> taking<00:06:32.040> up<00:06:32.160> about

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
skimmer that's probably taking up about

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:38.200 
skimmer that's probably taking up about
60<00:06:32.730> watts<00:06:32.930> so<00:06:33.930> if<00:06:34.080> it's<00:06:34.230> running<00:06:34.410> a<00:06:34.830> system<00:06:35.580> a

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.760 

10,000<00:06:39.210> watt<00:06:40.020> generate<00:06:40.740> an<00:06:40.860> alternator<00:06:42.770> it's

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
10,000 watt generate an alternator it's

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.410 
10,000 watt generate an alternator it's
basically<00:06:44.160> you're<00:06:44.400> getting<00:06:44.700> 10<00:06:44.880> times<00:06:45.120> more

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:45.420 
basically you're getting 10 times more

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.030 
basically you're getting 10 times more
uh<00:06:45.920> sorry<00:06:46.920> hundred<00:06:47.190> times<00:06:47.340> more<00:06:48.650> power<00:06:49.650> that

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
uh sorry hundred times more power that

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.470 
uh sorry hundred times more power that
your<00:06:50.220> then<00:06:50.460> you're<00:06:50.580> putting<00:06:50.880> into<00:06:51.030> it<00:06:51.180> now<00:06:51.450> I

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480 
your then you're putting into it now I

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.580 
your then you're putting into it now I
don't<00:06:51.630> know<00:06:51.840> if<00:06:51.870> that's<00:06:52.170> actually<00:06:54.590> possible

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
don't know if that's actually possible

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.260 
don't know if that's actually possible
or<00:06:55.980> not<00:06:56.100> I<00:06:56.160> need<00:06:56.430> to<00:06:56.520> look<00:06:56.670> at<00:06:56.790> the<00:06:56.880> numbers<00:06:57.240> and

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
or not I need to look at the numbers and

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.870 
or not I need to look at the numbers and
and<00:06:57.800> somebody<00:06:58.800> probably<00:06:59.130> has<00:06:59.400> to<00:06:59.520> build<00:06:59.670> such

00:06:59.870 --> 00:06:59.880 
and somebody probably has to build such

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.330 
and somebody probably has to build such
a<00:06:59.910> system<00:07:00.270> but<00:07:00.530> such<00:07:01.530> a<00:07:01.590> system<00:07:01.980> i<00:07:02.100> think

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
a system but such a system i think

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.260 
a system but such a system i think
really<00:07:02.520> is<00:07:02.790> feasible<00:07:03.000> to<00:07:03.330> me<00:07:03.660> and<00:07:03.960> so

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270 
really is feasible to me and so

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.520 
really is feasible to me and so
hopefully<00:07:06.270> someone<00:07:06.600> out<00:07:06.990> there<00:07:07.170> might<00:07:07.350> make

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530 
hopefully someone out there might make

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:12.010 
hopefully someone out there might make
something<00:07:07.860> like<00:07:08.010> this<00:07:08.450> the<00:07:09.950> now<00:07:10.950> the<00:07:11.010> the<00:07:11.790> dish

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020 
something like this the now the the dish

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.400 
something like this the now the the dish
the<00:07:13.020> solar<00:07:13.260> dish<00:07:13.500> that<00:07:13.740> I<00:07:13.770> made<00:07:14.720> it<00:07:15.720> doesn't

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.410 
the solar dish that I made it doesn't

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.930 
the solar dish that I made it doesn't
really<00:07:16.530> exist<00:07:16.740> it<00:07:17.160> there's<00:07:17.340> a<00:07:17.400> sort<00:07:17.790> of<00:07:17.850> a

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 
really exist it there's a sort of a

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.790 
really exist it there's a sort of a
conceptual<00:07:18.450> design<00:07:18.750> is<00:07:18.930> similar<00:07:19.140> to<00:07:19.380> this<00:07:19.530> on

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
conceptual design is similar to this on

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.320 
conceptual design is similar to this on
the<00:07:20.160> quasi<00:07:20.400> turban<00:07:20.820> site<00:07:21.030> that<00:07:21.180> you<00:07:21.300> might

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330 
the quasi turban site that you might

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.590 
the quasi turban site that you might
want<00:07:21.630> to<00:07:21.690> check<00:07:21.870> out<00:07:22.080> but<00:07:22.970> none<00:07:23.970> so<00:07:24.180> far<00:07:24.210> that

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:24.600 
want to check out but none so far that

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.800 
want to check out but none so far that
I've<00:07:24.720> seen<00:07:24.990> is<00:07:25.260> really<00:07:25.860> a<00:07:25.890> hybrid<00:07:26.430> system<00:07:26.820> dish

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:27.810 
I've seen is really a hybrid system dish

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.600 
I've seen is really a hybrid system dish
like<00:07:28.050> what<00:07:28.290> I've<00:07:28.380> made<00:07:28.560> here<00:07:28.620> for<00:07:29.220> residential

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610 
like what I've made here for residential

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.070 
like what I've made here for residential
use<00:07:29.790> and<00:07:30.240> and<00:07:30.420> I<00:07:31.350> plan<00:07:32.220> to<00:07:32.250> make<00:07:33.090> this

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 
use and and I plan to make this

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.980 
use and and I plan to make this
component<00:07:34.800> online<00:07:35.700> and<00:07:36.090> design<00:07:36.600> it<00:07:36.720> further

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:36.990 
component online and design it further

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.700 
component online and design it further
but<00:07:37.910> really<00:07:38.910> you<00:07:39.030> don't<00:07:39.230> with<00:07:40.230> all<00:07:40.350> the<00:07:40.470> energy

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:40.710 
but really you don't with all the energy

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.020 
but really you don't with all the energy
that<00:07:40.800> you're<00:07:41.070> getting<00:07:41.160> from<00:07:41.310> a<00:07:41.490> 10<00:07:41.670> kilowatt

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.030 
that you're getting from a 10 kilowatt

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.110 
that you're getting from a 10 kilowatt
generator<00:07:42.060> I<00:07:42.860> and<00:07:43.860> from<00:07:44.430> the<00:07:44.520> water<00:07:44.670> fuel<00:07:44.820> cell

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 
generator I and from the water fuel cell

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.390 
generator I and from the water fuel cell
this<00:07:45.690> device<00:07:46.080> probably<00:07:46.380> really<00:07:47.070> isn't<00:07:47.370> that

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 
this device probably really isn't that

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.680 
this device probably really isn't that
necessary<00:07:48.060> so<00:07:49.310> anyway<00:07:50.310> thanks<00:07:50.820> for<00:07:50.880> looking

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:51.690 
necessary so anyway thanks for looking

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.170 
necessary so anyway thanks for looking
and<00:07:51.930> I<00:07:52.380> hope<00:07:52.830> this<00:07:53.490> sparked<00:07:53.880> some<00:07:54.030> interest

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.180 
and I hope this sparked some interest

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.260 
and I hope this sparked some interest
out<00:07:54.480> there<00:07:54.510> thanks
