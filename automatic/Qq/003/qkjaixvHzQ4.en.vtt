see<00:00:57.300> refineries<00:00:57.870> after<00:00:58.170> that's<00:00:58.379> now<00:00:58.500> add<00:00:58.710> this

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
see refineries after that's now add this

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.250 
see refineries after that's now add this
is<00:00:59.039> happening<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.760> single<00:01:00.510> boot<00:01:00.719> camp<00:01:01.020> is

placed by sovereign el along with a dog

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.929 
placed by sovereign el along with a dog
and<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.769> looks<00:01:04.949> like<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.309> speed<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.820> that

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
and it looks like the speed of that

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.670 
and it looks like the speed of that
production<00:01:06.270> will<00:01:06.540> be<00:01:06.659> an<00:01:06.780> engineer<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> dog

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
production will be an engineer so a dog

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.500 
production will be an engineer so a dog
is<00:01:07.860> an<00:01:07.979> engineer

at the same time technique is producing

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.110 
at the same time technique is producing
dude<00:01:11.210> or<00:01:11.750> refineries<00:01:12.620> and<00:01:12.770> a<00:01:13.580> third<00:01:13.940> oil

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
dude or refineries and a third oil

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.700 
dude or refineries and a third oil
refinery<00:01:14.510> so<00:01:14.720> we're<00:01:14.840> seeing<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:15.050> free<00:01:15.290> refinery

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710

the Apollo fighter and the vindicator

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.080 
the Apollo fighter and the vindicator
sit<00:04:25.020> there<00:04:25.139> and<00:04:25.229> the<00:04:25.320> vindicator<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:26.729> sends

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.659 
sit there and the vindicator it sends
out<00:04:27.180> one<00:04:27.419> ball<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:28.130> think<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.220> still<00:04:29.400> have<00:04:29.520> one

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
out one ball I think the still have one

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.830 
out one ball I think the still have one
bomb<00:04:29.700> huh

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
bomb huh

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.760 
bomb huh
and<00:04:32.169> so<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:34.150> we're<00:04:34.300> seeing<00:04:34.530> contraction<00:04:35.530> here

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
and so and we're seeing contraction here

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.170 
and so and we're seeing contraction here
as<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:36.880> proud<00:04:37.240> topper<00:04:37.540> is<00:04:37.720> following<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.970> two

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
as a proud topper is following the two

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.480 
as a proud topper is following the two
strikers<00:04:40.479> vs<00:04:40.720> mail<00:04:41.229> address<00:04:41.650> where<00:04:42.100> I<00:04:42.130> think

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
strikers vs mail address where I think

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
strikers vs mail address where I think
is<00:04:42.580> going<00:04:42.850> on

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
is going on

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.750 
is going on
technique<00:04:44.320> MCD<00:04:44.920> is<00:04:44.950> moved<00:04:45.190> up<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.520> center

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
technique MCD is moved up to the center

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.230 
technique MCD is moved up to the center
ridge<00:04:47.190> he<00:04:48.190> has<00:04:48.310> looked<00:04:48.580> like<00:04:48.670> he<00:04:48.790> attempted<00:04:49.210> to

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
ridge he has looked like he attempted to

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.240 
ridge he has looked like he attempted to
do<00:04:49.420> some<00:04:49.600> bombing<00:04:49.990> his<00:04:50.440> indicator<00:04:50.890> will<00:04:51.070> live

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
do some bombing his indicator will live

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.760 
do some bombing his indicator will live
so<00:04:52.000> at<00:04:52.090> this<00:04:52.210> point<00:04:52.480> technique<00:04:52.930> is<00:04:53.140> sitting

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
so at this point technique is sitting

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.140 
so at this point technique is sitting
with<00:04:53.800> two<00:04:54.250> striker<00:04:54.550> of<00:04:54.730> the<00:04:54.790> axes<00:04:55.180> for

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
with two striker of the axes for

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.570 
with two striker of the axes for
imperial<00:04:58.150> warriors<00:04:58.540> and<00:04:58.870> he<00:04:59.080> has<00:04:59.350> a<00:04:59.650> instant

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
imperial warriors and he has a instant

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.360 
imperial warriors and he has a instant
dojo<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:01.150> it<00:05:01.330> has<00:05:01.450> hockey<00:05:01.990> oil<00:05:02.380> derrick<00:05:02.770> so

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
dojo and it has hockey oil derrick so

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.450 
dojo and it has hockey oil derrick so
although<00:05:03.520> technique<00:05:04.030> lost<00:05:04.300> to<00:05:05.460> fourteen

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
although technique lost to fourteen

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.240 
although technique lost to fourteen
hundred<00:05:06.550> dollar<00:05:06.910> or<00:05:07.900> collectors<00:05:08.500> in<00:05:08.980> the

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
hundred dollar or collectors in the

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.390 
hundred dollar or collectors in the
process<00:05:09.520> he<00:05:09.880> and<00:05:10.720> he<00:05:10.870> sold<00:05:11.200> an<00:05:11.380> mtv<00:05:11.770> as<00:05:11.890> well<00:05:12.100> so

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
process he and he sold an mtv as well so

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.070 
process he and he sold an mtv as well so
that's<00:05:12.520> another<00:05:12.790> 2500

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
that's another 2500

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.200 
that's another 2500
people<00:05:15.590> have<00:05:15.740> in<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.430> engineering<00:05:16.819> headed

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
people have in the engineering headed

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.830 
people have in the engineering headed
