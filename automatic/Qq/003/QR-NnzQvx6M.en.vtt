00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.100
 Welcome to the Glanzer Explosions 2 2 0 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.710
 Sarah is 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.090
 we should not practice standing still St x 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:15.909
 and by actually adding any objects you can 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:20.619
 some do not take what you want I take this case some nasty 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.309
 Holidays because you can see the explosion on the lake best 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.239
 Now we'll do it first 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.609
 the explosion 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.440
 in addition the animals take particles 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.300
 Trichet Nyon 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.440
 and the partly heavily painted 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.770
 30 be one 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.770
 also defiant as the end 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.040
 Well 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.230
 he realizes that he does not do that for so long, of course he's always better 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.230
 the Ticino the estimated 300 one 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.440
 as normal 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.440
 that's later, in principle, would be speed 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.040
 until now 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.760
 two races 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.710
 tease 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.850
 he was 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.220
 actually enough 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.600
 0 Comments 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.680
 so 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.630
 now next 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.740
 You see, if I go as a doctor now 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.180
 cashed 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.420
 almost nothing 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.090
 around though 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.950
 spraying louder in case the community but we want that victory and yes 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.230
 explodes 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.870
 that means the go 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.870
 here on this percent engin 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.560
 AP here occur only the animals and as the name implies 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.720
 Experts | 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.700
 so 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.350
 yes, appear below wrap up 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.450
 we enter the quintet is 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.510
 if something happens again 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.510
 and from franc 30th 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.230
 Yes 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.459
 You here 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.569
 broken next to Kiedis Iliev Wiesbaden 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.569
 and breaks up in different ages 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:19.999
 now if the work maybe they're talking about yelling 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:22.849
 no deficits now 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.969
 that means the initiative in our article system 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.800
 and rain Jürgen on 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.539
 that means that 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:35.549
 So there are also the British investigators 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.730
 It was so you see 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.669
 Eschweiler 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:42.829
 Objections determine who now wants to make millions unavoidable 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.229
 would 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:46.179
 then that means a mistake 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:49.179
 that the forced use of the local system 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:53.599
 but he has no objects in principle 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:54.419
 Beck will 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.229
 this is how you can choose 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:03:00.289
 You can say Laumann fly around later, not even the last ones 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:02.559
 Points 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:04.289
 so 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:06.729
 "Now we can only look after the women's wm 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:08.799
 at first 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.279
 of course I would be encouraged now 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.839
 that the downturn and looks 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:16.019
 after that 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.019
 can you mention, for example? 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:22.979
 Do Jacob Roth 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:25.039
 and then you always wake up 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:26.779
 the 6 2 

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:28.769
 Remove red 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.639
 and now you can 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.699
 For example, insert a picture 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:37.469
 that managed indymedia on the back that I could upload now 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.389
 I take my seriously 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.759
 Of course he does not have one 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:47.209
 that could be a little nickeliness in Zurich around it 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.939
 I take this worrying reason is a picture 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.119
 around 

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:57.119
 Year under it also agree no more nothing 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:03:59.440
 thanks 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.589
 and those on top of it, my knee Jun 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:04.599
 I am here but in the match 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.139
 Clarus 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.049
 simply means that 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.089
 four later two women have pence 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:14.229
 and they just mix and bridge 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.769
 then the order expands 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.809
 there is no band 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:22.049
 and now you can get your two wives out of the 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.020
 for example, the one woman is bringing now 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.419
 take a photo 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.460
 Suhl 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.460
 You can see that they are now 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.039
 funny I crawl 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:38.870
 the loan losses 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.999
 and here we do it for example 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:44.270
 Grote again 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.539
 so she goes here 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.629
 has been the guest act 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:51.499
 so 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:54.499
 Snowden Industry Now offered like yellow 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.860
 Minden the FCL expresses he could quite right now look at it 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.330
 as Erhard already adopted a little color «Now look at the whole 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
 Related to simply accept in Saada 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.920
 Sun 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.409
 the plus to Freeman 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.409
 30 come 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.879
 OK 

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:26.159
 Well, that's pretty good 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.490
 so the TSG could go back 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.930
 and indeed very high and down for the remaining ten each for ins 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.009
 exile 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:36.189
 then pick a nice picture 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:38.370
 in the 12th 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.370
 and we'll see each other all the time 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.729
 that looks a bit like starting from middle points now 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.719
 but 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.910
 yes, either yourself between them 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.710
 two associations 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.300
 he could have expired the whole thing as a water explosion 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:01.629
 and 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.629
 loud it was later synonymous scenes 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.080
 around 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.849
 which maybe I like to take with us now, for example 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.740
 10 against 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.090
 and if now again at the very beginning for the 1 he despised and then 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.419
 we see 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:26.199
 once the ball is 34 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:28.379
 it gets a lot harder 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:31.479
 that is, if he wants a quick expansion 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:33.789
 makes a high number one normal 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:35.499
 and the other way as well 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:38.499
 like that is not working anymore 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.309
 and 

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:46.370
 just what the objection again I've had enough deck 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.569
 around 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:52.569
 otherwise offers the change and only a few friends 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.860
 and 6 the windows of the also as GT race cars no comment 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.129
 can 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:59.619
 Thank Kuenz and see you next
