00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 gustl month knows this name well 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.899
 Everyone here in Germany has us 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.189
 this case for weeks and months 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.320
 Maybe he's busy too 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.700
 fears aroused in us in this 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.910
 ask what would actually happen 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.619
 if I suddenly just go in 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.190
 a closed psychiatry land 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.500
 would 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.000
 no idea about my sake coast 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.430
 Monat was admitted as a criminal 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.380
 but also those who did not commit delinquency 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.210
 can become against his will 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.800
 for some time for longer time in the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.480
 land psychiatry and then at the latest 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.920
 when you are in it is quite nice 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.110
 hard to get out of ours again 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.030
 Reporter Engelberg has had people 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.030
 met because exactly that happened 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.320
 I 'm on the way to a special one 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.450
 self-help group meet in this house 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.010
 some people spend some months in 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.309
 the closed psychiatry were 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:59.820
 as well as Michael he was forcibly admitted 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:01:01.640
 against his will have the same 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.979
 pictures for you and everyone else too and 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.299
 Also had to go with the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.490
 situation have to cope like that 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.710
 crazy where we actually go before 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.210
 the citizens were the ten minutes yet 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.790
 Most of them were in a life crisis 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.130
 her nerves provoked her 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.110
 fellow citizens until they called the police 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.240
 In the clinic, Michael gets first 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.759
 Medicines so it was a cocktail off 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.409
 various sedative tablets the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.540
 So also very strong side effects 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.369
 and it was like that afterwards 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.900
 six weeks in the closed sa 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.400
 Bank through the hallway I'm with 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.990
 february always where and so that was the 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.890
 side effects where the psychiatrist says 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.860
 we have to do that a few more now 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.270
 Watch weeks until the leave many 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.009
 at this table have similar 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.540
 now they are helping each other 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.630
 to finish each other with the consequences 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.630
 become 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.530
 we would like to make our own picture 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.110
 and drive to a big one 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.000
 psychiatric clinic after thirst 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.979
 the closed recording station come 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.969
 also all those patients like michael 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.969
 be forced to attend 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.489
 the head physician norbert weis i shows us 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.890
 the ward the corridors are sterile 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.989
 is remarkably quiet in the courtyard 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.450
 we tristan too he is against his 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.489
 I'll shoot it here though it does 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.220
 I've got everything in there totally 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.349
 I lost you in there I've got the um 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.150
 corner came and she impressed saw I have everything 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.340
 I'm still a bit inside 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.549
 scratched why are they here because of it 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.440
 a computer nerd what does that mean 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.920
 I have called my whole life keller 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.110
 spent and only computer game world of 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.340
 warcraft alpha black &amp; white chalk 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.870
 Tristan was with the police in the 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.090
 closed brought in handcuffs 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.709
 he tells me he was always back 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.310
 driving cars had jumped and had 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.019
 to endanger yourself and others 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.750
 then we suddenly experience one ourselves 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.250
 Forced induction with this man he has 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.260
 having a waiter in a cafe 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.780
 beaten and is according to statement of dr 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.410
 I am very confused at this moment 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.130
 he is shown to the judge 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.139
 within the next few minutes 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.819
 decides if the man on the 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.310
 closed station must stay or 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.500
 Not 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:24.120
 A woman at the window gestures laughs 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.980
 i feel alien to me here 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.260
 ten minutes the verdict is two 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.709
 closed weeks what happens now 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.590
 with him 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.660
 he will give his opinion to the doctor 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.329
 standards are treated there 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.280
 I had made examinations 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.319
 times such confusion states more unclear 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.549
 cause and must be clarified here 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.290
 because I can not do it that way 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.109
 running around outside is more at risk 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.639
 yourself and others very much here 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.349
 he probably gets inside as well 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.989
 at some point like almost all medications 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.690
 Tristan will be released in a few days 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.630
 first set down the tablets again 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.940
 you like to see somebody or someone else 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.940
 film to normal when the train is waiting 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:15.090
 but they take these medications white 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:17.549
 I think that's what the doctors say 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.650
 we are with the chief physician dr 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.150
 I know I want to date him 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.650
 statement of Michael from the 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.650
 self-help group play 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:48.570
 we have heard from patients more often 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:49.110
 lie so that we can come out again 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.080
 his 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.700
 the linkage i have the untruth 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:59.300
 say to come out again 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:01.770
 that's a big deal so then 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.050
 Did something go wrong? 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.250
 valuables do not interest any 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.580
 keeping patients here is that 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.340
 nonsense to arrange on the clinic area 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.090
 We consult with a lawyer 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.640
 Forced admissions looks very critical 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.700
 He works here more often than lawyer 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.380
 Patients otherwise made in 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.200
 Germany too much too fast 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.870
 often too long people become 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.250
 often held for a day 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.900
 before you even see a judge 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.150
 and now with psychotropic drugs 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.160
 so the judge then treated often 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.190
 can not help but the people for 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.900
 to accommodate several weeks 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:39.270
 How often does it happen that after one 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.669
 such hearing the patients again 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.110
 can go home 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:48.870
 I do not have any in my practice 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:50.250
 Yes, I'm relieved that 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.660
 I'm back out there but I think so 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.460
 also very difficult a final 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.020
 on the one hand I know 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.419
 that many clinics do an important job 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.010
 but make it just as depressing 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:02.450
 me that people here against hers 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.450
 will be detained
