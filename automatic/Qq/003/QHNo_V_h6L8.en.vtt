 your house some piece that was your grandmother's 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.450
 and do not know what to do with her because 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.880
 she thinks she is very old because she knows 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.250

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.990
 Pieces that you put in to make 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.869

 having much greater emphasis is no more nor 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.890
 antique furniture is called retro 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.230
 usually is to give a shock 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.219
 in decoration maybe a floor of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.290
 and install a mortar and pestle. 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.329
 wood is very much in focus so 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.100
 happened by chance as you said 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.510
 the focus of my business completely 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.910
 different 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.219
 there I ornament in my store with that 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.680
 people were looking for I sold 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.680
 today I practically live from renting 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.559
 these retro pieces this decorator teaches 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.619
 like panning curios and furniture and 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.229
 states that the older the value 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.420
 The garment usually has the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.659
 antiquarian as a furniture emporium 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.450
 rustic are places that are full right

 they have many piece many pieces together 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.119

 times are signed has a provenance 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.770
 It is to say the pedigree which meets 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.140

 the market that is increasingly 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.840
 consolidated and valued also makes a 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.790
 redemption of cultures and traditions first 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.170
 We want to make an important place. 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.149
 Of course we have to know a little 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.369
 from the history of the art of 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.960
 parts if you do not know 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.180

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.969
 the shop owner on the 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.880
 the date of which style is 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.890
