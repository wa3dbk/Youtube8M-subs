00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.180
 Y 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.110
 hello how are coaches and are 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.930
 Welcome once again to the laboratory 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.850
 Professor pokemon am facing halo 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.129
 battle and thanks to the mass of 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.680
 comments emerged the pokemon of the day 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.879
 today is galei so let's see 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.879
 your data in the pokÃ©dex 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.220
 and the evolved form of the raid the 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.290
 law extends its arms as if they were 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.650
 swords and when someone has 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.320
 fight fiercely and what can you tell me 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.559
 of the species data 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.920
 the egg group of the law is love and 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.110
 primary ability impossible however 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.680
 some coaches claimed to have seen 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.690
 galets with justice this pokemon not 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.640
 gender gap has since 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.300
 only found in March this 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.940
 species 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.890
 here are two very good skills and 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.550
 I will explain what each of them consists of 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.680
 we start with impassive this 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.900
 skill increases speed a 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.110
 level when the pokemon goes back or 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.170
 In other words, when it is punctured 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.910
 and justiciero that increases a level the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.690
 User attack when hit 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.550
 for an attack of sinister type wales is 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.340
 a teacher of courtesy and a 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.680
 honorable swordsman his arms are 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.180
 they extend like swords and these are so 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.820
 sharp that can cut almost everything 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.370
 as their psychic powers evolve they do not 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.070
 they increase their powers too much 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.500
 melee combat strength and 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.060
 their speed increase so 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.640
 surprising 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.530
 it is thought that the old and 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.050
 Experienced people can extend 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.679
 your elbows at your whim but 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.810
 for his honor 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.860
 they will only spread them in combat or 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.980
 training 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.050
 like its provisions the law is 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.570
 able to perceive the thoughts of his 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.290
 coach which will influence your mood 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.170
 and his power 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.030
 the galets were formerly used by 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.250
 the knights as well as the luck 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.560
 Aryans were the pokemon of the nobility and 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.100
 justice and in turn the law 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.710
 they value the locals a lot and vice versa 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.290
 this pokemon has a great idealism of 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.660
 honor and is unable to abandon the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.550
 he will defend them and fight for them 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.100
 until I can not anymore 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.650
 now let's talk about the evolutionary line of 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.590
 the law this pokemon has two pro 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.500
 evolution is icarly rats 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.019
 rals evolves meat to level 20 and 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.200
 Carly evolves the law only if Carla is 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.780
 male and he is given a alba stone since 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.970
 the law is always male as opposed to 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.420
 its counterpart garde boas that can be 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.300
 female or male 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.430
 the law also adopted a mega evolution 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.130
 like other pokemon in the region 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.800
 as a young man and thanks to the gallerist 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.530
 galette is capable of mega evolve and 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.739
 become mega galei is winning 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.319
 a new internal focus skill which 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.819
 avoids the recoil also known as 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.790
 fringe eo 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.340
 his speed his attack and his defense 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.930
 they increase considerably by doing 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.930
 that this pokemon becomes almost 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.750
 unstoppable 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.030
 but as you already know guys the world is 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.090
 very big and there are still many mysteries 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.370
 to solve so it would be all for this 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.750
 Occasion and do not forget to leave the comment 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.340
 of the pokemon they want us to talk about 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.639
 on the next occasion 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.769
 remember that it must be one of one goes without 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.769
 nothing more to clarify see you
