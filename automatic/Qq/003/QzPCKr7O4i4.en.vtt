00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 for girls I'm super in allow here 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.359
 in my house I have no voice and I was in the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.309
 bathroom because as I tell you when I left 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.040
 from my house today is the bathroom was 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.660
 painting and suddenly this logo came out 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.400
 I do not know and found it extremely merits of the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.289
 I wanted to teach is something super easy 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.000
 using blue tones so that we 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.670
 Let's risk a little more with colors 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.230
 different to the white and brown coffees 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.330
 black that goes very well for coffee 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.580
 like mine or also blue greens 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.800
 honey color should look spectacular 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.090
 rather all eyes forgiveness for the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.369
 disorder she goes wrong is in the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.140
 university today I did not plan to record but 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.329
 good things that are well provided 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.340
 and they come out super good and they've already heard 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.559
 my melodious voice and let's start with the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.360
 tutorial the first one that I will do will be 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.879
 place a metallic blue pencil on 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.020
 all my mobile eyelid so I had like 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.020
 base of the shadows 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.570
 i 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.760
 now I had a flat brush too what 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.070
 you can do with your video I'm going to 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.230
 Blur this pencil to create a base 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.030
 a little more homogeneous and that a shadow 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.920
 coffee I'm going to start giving warmth to the 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.230
 basin of my eye using a brush 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.820
 closed very soft and separated for 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.820
 make it look very blurry 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.010
 on the basis of the skin to start 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.200
 place a metallic blue shadow this 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.670
 it's called midnight and it's sigma 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.290
 likewise, Avalos will leave all 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.090
 names of all products I will 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.040
 start compacting this color because 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.250
 I want this effect to be noticed very well 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.250
 metallic 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.970
 and do not forget to blur a bit of this 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.750
 shadow on the bottom to join 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.750
 all your eye 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.580
 with a little more brown and brochita 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.530
 floppy I'm going to start blurring the 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.030
 edge these two colors to accentuate 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.030
 much more the smoky effect 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.200
 now it takes a bit of black from a 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.330
 pencil brush and blur this in the 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.860
 lower part and in the outer corner 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.799
 of your eye to create much more 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.479
 depth with that of 25 and start 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.430
 blur this black so it's not 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.530
 as a smudge if it does not look like a shadow 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.670
 very slight on the outside that is 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.670
 diffuse inwards 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.320
 unfortunately this part was erased 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.780
 of the video but here take a blue color 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.910
 royal and review it over the blue each 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.090
 put before to emphasize much more that 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.250
 blue tone and it look super vibrant and 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.200
 a palette of 88 colors I'm going to take a 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.480
 Celestial color a color as well as green 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.010
 quoted and I will apply on the internal part 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.540
 in the lacrimal, this is something that 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.090
 normally we do not do but it looks 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.740
 very cool and also gives a super effect 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.810
 special eyes and we're going to 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.340
 blur it and then below the eyebrow 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.090
 let's place a cream color or 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.890
 white to illuminate 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.840
 if you feel that you missed a bit the 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.900
 hand reviewing with a little brown and 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.819
 we 're going to uncheck our eyes I'm going to 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.160
 start using a black pencil that 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.989
 is very very pigmented and I'm going to 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.370
 apply over the water line in the 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.140
 internal part you also have to 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.970
 make sure you get well and you 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.620
 gently lift the eyelashes and you 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.620
 you are going to paint the upper water line 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.349
 I'm going to put these false eyelashes 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.239
 that are a bit dramatic for me 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.829
 taste but good and now let's place 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.829
 many but many layers of mask 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.690
 never forget your lower lashes and 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.459
 that gives a lot of expression to your eyes 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.880
 and they make them look much bigger and 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.880
 open 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.880
 for the skin I'm using the base 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.160
 revlon color stay which is a base for 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.290
 over for oily skin and I'm going to 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.540
 blur with a sponge that I put it 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.250
 in water and drain and it remains as well as 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.760
 softer for a lot application 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.760
 lighter 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.570
 this concealer is called flash glamor and 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.130
 from the brand hard candy covers a 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.140
 level level to apply below the 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.150
 eyes and as you can see is some tones 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.800
 lighter than my skin color then 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.410
 I will be super lit and this 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.030
 I love the effect, I recommend that you 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.860
 Blur with a brush to achieve 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.420
 more precision and some very lines 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.430
 clean and you have your eyes well 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.090
 illuminated below and now let's move on 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.459
 with the other eye 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.200
 Now let's seal everything with a powder 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.849
 compact and this time I'm using the 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.860
 I vomit because I want to have one 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.370
 layer very thick and make it super skin 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.370
 perfect 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.420
 I'll take steal the holidays book in 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.340
 the Tuscan color that is a color like 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.500
 tanned terracotta and complements very 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.270
 ok the blues now I'm going to apply the 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.950
 Sigma lip concealer to cover 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.780
 a little natural pink color and 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.150
 apply over a new color that is called 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.070

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.950
 nix that has as some pink visitos 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.420
 It's super nice and it's also doing very well 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.430
 to this color of shadows and we have finished 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.410
