a more balanced approach to the game

that was healthier racket to play with I

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.040 
that was healthier racket to play with I

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
found that I'm the very left hand

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.870 
found that I'm the very left hand
dominant<00:02:26.620> but<00:02:26.890> as<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.160> played<00:02:27.430> with<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.610> racket

dominant but as I played with the racket
I<00:02:27.910> start<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.239> hit<00:02:28.360> shots<00:02:28.570> with<00:02:28.750> my<00:02:28.810> right<00:02:29.080> hand

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
I start to hit shots with my right hand

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.070 
I start to hit shots with my right hand
just<00:02:30.100> because<00:02:30.310> it's<00:02:30.489> you<00:02:31.239> know<00:02:31.299> a<00:02:31.360> high<00:02:31.810> left

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080

tough<00:02:33.940> but<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.209> same<00:02:34.450> shot<00:02:34.750> without<00:02:35.110> ever

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410

sometimes a harder time adjusting
because<00:03:38.069> it's<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:38.580> little<00:03:38.910> bit<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.090> an

because it's a little bit of an

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.360 
because it's a little bit of an
adjustment<00:03:39.269> so<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:39.959> may<00:03:40.080> take<00:03:40.290> them<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.769> few

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
adjustment so it may take them a few

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.699 
adjustment so it may take them a few
extra<00:03:41.910> minutes<00:03:41.940> or<00:03:42.390> hours<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.959> learn<00:03:43.140> shots

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
extra minutes or hours to learn shots

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.979 
extra minutes or hours to learn shots
where<00:03:44.120> players<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.330> are<00:03:45.420> more<00:03:45.540> beginners

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
where players that are more beginners

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.780 
where players that are more beginners
they<00:03:46.530> can<00:03:46.709> pick<00:03:46.859> up<00:03:46.980> this<00:03:47.100> racquet<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:47.700> it

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
they can pick up this racquet and it

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.370 
they can pick up this racquet and it
really<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.150> natural<00:03:48.570> for<00:03:48.690> them<00:03:48.810> so<00:03:49.049> using<00:03:49.350> both

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
really is natural for them so using both

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.440 
really is natural for them so using both
sides<00:03:49.530> of<00:03:49.920> their<00:03:50.040> body<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.790> they<00:03:51.090> can<00:03:51.209> pick<00:03:51.359> it

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
sides of their body and they can pick it

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.539 
sides of their body and they can pick it
up<00:03:51.540> with<00:03:51.660> two<00:03:51.840> two<00:03:52.200> hands<00:03:52.470> two<00:03:52.799> handles<00:03:53.250> and

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
up with two two hands two handles and

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
match play on a more likely to let go

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.759 
match play on a more likely to let go
and<00:04:12.000> hit<00:04:12.120> left-handed<00:04:12.600> shots<00:04:12.900> at<00:04:13.109> times<00:04:13.350> left

and hit left-handed shots at times left

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.259 
and hit left-handed shots at times left
hand<00:04:13.980> overhead<00:04:14.370> if<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.640> ball<00:04:14.820> goes<00:04:15.000> over<00:04:15.239> my

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269

left side he's starting to do it more
and<00:04:17.700> more<00:04:17.910> in<00:04:18.000> practice<00:04:18.180> and<00:04:18.600> he's<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:19.289> know

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
and more in practice and he's you know

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.289 
and more in practice and he's you know
as<00:04:19.470> we've<00:04:19.979> kind<00:04:20.280> of<00:04:20.340> progressed<00:04:20.820> these<00:04:21.060> last

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
as we've kind of progressed these last

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.180 
as we've kind of progressed these last
nine<00:04:21.810> months

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
nine months

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.600 
nine months
more<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:25.290> two<00:04:25.440> hand<00:04:25.650> shots<00:04:25.920> on<00:04:26.160> his<00:04:26.280> left<00:04:26.520> side

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
more the two hand shots on his left side

more the two hand shots on his left side
in<00:04:27.030> certain<00:04:27.330> situations<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.140> even

in certain situations and even
right-handed<00:04:29.190> shots<00:04:29.400> occasionally<00:04:30.000> so<00:04:30.180> it's

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
right-handed shots occasionally so it's

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.080 
right-handed shots occasionally so it's
it's<00:04:30.840> a<00:04:30.960> natural<00:04:31.350> progression<00:04:31.620> that<00:04:32.280> that<00:04:33.000> we

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
it's a natural progression that that we

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.050 
it's a natural progression that that we
