of<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> lot<00:00:51.140> but<00:00:52.140> um<00:00:53.239> yeah<00:00:54.239> all<00:00:54.510> all<00:00:54.989> my<00:00:55.200> hair<00:00:55.440> is

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
of a lot but um yeah all all my hair is

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.420 
of a lot but um yeah all all my hair is
locked<00:00:56.510> most<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.660> my<00:00:57.750> locs<00:00:57.960> about<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.649> half<00:00:59.399> a

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
locked most of my locs about a half a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.590 
locked most of my locs about a half a
lot<00:00:59.789> or<00:01:00.239> some<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:02.300> guess<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.449> for

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
lot or some like that I guess one for

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.119 
lot or some like that I guess one for
example<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.140> one's<00:01:04.350> locked<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.829> a<00:01:04.860> bell

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
example this one's locked to a bell

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.529 
example this one's locked to a bell
right<00:01:05.579> here<00:01:05.969> I<00:01:05.999> think<00:01:06.119> all<00:01:07.819> that<00:01:08.819> up<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.270> locked

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
right here I think all that up is locked

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.459 
right here I think all that up is locked
I<00:01:09.899> believe<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:11.219> not<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> niche<00:01:11.999> I<00:01:12.359> have<00:01:12.929> my<00:01:13.079> locks

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:13.469 
I believe so not a niche I have my locks

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:18.169 
I believe so not a niche I have my locks
or<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.829> lot<00:01:14.179> so<00:01:15.289> that's<00:01:16.289> great<00:01:16.529> um<00:01:16.909> just<00:01:17.909> an

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
or a lot so that's great um just an

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.039 
or a lot so that's great um just an
example<00:01:18.329> even<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.079> tiny<00:01:19.380> one<00:01:19.619> right<00:01:19.770> here

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
example even this tiny one right here

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.879 
example even this tiny one right here
and<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.109> was<00:01:22.200> thinking<00:01:22.380> I'll<00:01:22.439> cutting<00:01:22.679> off<00:01:22.770> this
