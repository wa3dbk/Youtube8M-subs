00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.320 

well<00:00:31.680> being<00:00:31.860> Canadian<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.340> guess<00:00:32.520> it's<00:00:33.270> a

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.330 
well being Canadian I guess it's a

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.820 
well being Canadian I guess it's a
mishmash<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.930> pretty<00:00:34.110> much<00:00:34.230> everything<00:00:34.559> just

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
mishmash and pretty much everything just

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.410 
mishmash and pretty much everything just
like<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.040> country

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
like the country

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.350 
like the country
I<00:00:36.590> guess<00:00:37.590> I'm<00:00:37.710> Scottish<00:00:38.340> by<00:00:38.610> descent<00:00:39.000> although

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
I guess I'm Scottish by descent although

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.700 
I guess I'm Scottish by descent although
I<00:00:39.570> would<00:00:39.750> never<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:40.110> caught<00:00:40.290> dead<00:00:40.440> eating

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
I would never be caught dead eating

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.290 
I would never be caught dead eating
haggis<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:42.559> think<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:44.040> mean<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.030> grew<00:00:45.120> up<00:00:45.210> in

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
haggis I think that I mean I grew up in

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.299 
haggis I think that I mean I grew up in
the<00:00:45.360> country<00:00:45.720> so<00:00:45.930> mostly<00:00:46.620> just<00:00:46.830> fresh<00:00:47.040> fruits

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the country so mostly just fresh fruits

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.640 
the country so mostly just fresh fruits
and<00:00:47.430> vegetables<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:48.120> more<00:00:48.269> of<00:00:48.360> a

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
and vegetables it's more of a

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.320 
and vegetables it's more of a
environmental<00:00:49.650> thing<00:00:50.129> rather<00:00:50.790> than<00:00:51.000> sort<00:00:51.300> of

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
environmental thing rather than sort of

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.180 
environmental thing rather than sort of
cultural<00:00:51.840> like<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.140> guess<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.470> I<00:00:52.530> guess<00:00:52.739> that's

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
cultural like I guess but I guess that's

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.340 
cultural like I guess but I guess that's
part<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> culture<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:54.030> which<00:00:54.150> I<00:00:54.269> think

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
part of the culture in which I think

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:04.009 
part of the culture in which I think
much<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.379> all<00:00:55.680> soup<00:00:56.360> and<00:00:57.360> bagels<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.470> shmear
