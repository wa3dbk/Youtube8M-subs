the Road to Glory series after using him
as<00:05:21.880> well<00:05:22.030> probably<00:05:22.539> take<00:05:22.690> out<00:05:22.870> Abu<00:05:23.139> Bakr

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580

Griezmann<00:05:24.580> I<00:05:24.729> think<00:05:25.360> he<00:05:25.509> needs<00:05:25.539> to<00:05:25.750> be<00:05:25.810> further

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
Griezmann I think he needs to be further

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.990 
Griezmann I think he needs to be further
up<00:05:26.199> the<00:05:26.319> field<00:05:26.560> to<00:05:26.740> be<00:05:26.860> effective<00:05:27.400> in<00:05:27.610> it<00:05:27.819> the

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
up the field to be effective in it the

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.969 
up the field to be effective in it the
seven<00:05:28.360> games<00:05:28.539> we<00:05:28.690> played<00:05:28.900> get<00:05:29.380> four<00:05:29.680> goals

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
seven games we played get four goals

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.459 
seven games we played get four goals
which<00:05:30.430> is<00:05:30.460> not<00:05:30.729> a<00:05:30.759> lot<00:05:30.819> really<00:05:31.330> and<00:05:31.719> but<00:05:32.409> I

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:32.469 
which is not a lot really and but I

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:33.570 
which is not a lot really and but I
would<00:05:32.590> have<00:05:32.680> preferred<00:05:32.770> him<00:05:33.099> higher<00:05:33.280> up<00:05:33.460> the

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
has been 91 him being it but Perez is

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:12.959 
has been 91 him being it but Perez is
definitely<00:06:11.800> the<00:06:11.889> cheaper<00:06:12.250> version<00:06:12.400> of
