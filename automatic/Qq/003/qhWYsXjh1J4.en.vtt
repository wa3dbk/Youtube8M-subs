00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270 

what<00:00:00.570> do<00:00:00.690> you<00:00:00.780> think<00:00:00.840> of<00:00:00.989> the<00:00:01.079> fine<00:00:01.260> I<00:00:01.589> think

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
what do you think of the fine I think

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.910 
what do you think of the fine I think
that<00:00:02.490> um<00:00:03.110> Miguel<00:00:04.110> Cotto<00:00:04.350> at<00:00:04.620> one<00:00:04.770> particular

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
that um Miguel Cotto at one particular

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.889 
that um Miguel Cotto at one particular
time<00:00:05.250> was<00:00:05.700> one<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.120> best<00:00:06.270> water<00:00:06.509> weights

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
time was one of the best water weights

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.830 
time was one of the best water weights
but<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:07.620> think<00:00:07.950> with<00:00:08.220> him<00:00:09.150> fighting<00:00:09.420> Margaret

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
but I think with him fighting Margaret

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.410 
but I think with him fighting Margaret
margarita<00:00:10.440> took<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.280> lot<00:00:11.519> out<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.700> him<00:00:12.240> in

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
margarita took a lot out of him in

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.740 
margarita took a lot out of him in
another<00:00:12.630> war<00:00:12.900> with<00:00:13.139> Zab<00:00:13.559> Judah<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:14.750> with

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
another war with Zab Judah and with

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.570 
another war with Zab Judah and with
cloudy<00:00:16.049> he's<00:00:16.350> been<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.680> lot<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.890> wars<00:00:17.190> lately

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
cloudy he's been in a lot of wars lately

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.609 
cloudy he's been in a lot of wars lately
so<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.000> don't<00:00:18.480> think<00:00:18.660> he's<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.020> same<00:00:19.260> Miguel

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
so I don't think he's the same Miguel

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.650 
so I don't think he's the same Miguel
Cotto<00:00:19.890> not<00:00:20.789> taking<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.210> nothing<00:00:21.449> away<00:00:21.539> from

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
Cotto not taking the nothing away from

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.660 
Cotto not taking the nothing away from
not<00:00:22.050> saying<00:00:22.289> they<00:00:22.500> don't<00:00:22.560> he<00:00:23.130> still<00:00:23.369> can't

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
not saying they don't he still can't

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.939 
not saying they don't he still can't
beat<00:00:24.269> certain<00:00:25.140> fighters<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.590> sport<00:00:25.650> of
