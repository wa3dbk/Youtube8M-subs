changes<00:00:55.999> to<00:00:56.179> the<00:00:56.359> bike<00:00:56.890> most<00:00:57.890> notably

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
changes to the bike most notably

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.029 
changes to the bike most notably
probably<00:00:59.120> took<00:00:59.690> all<00:00:59.839> of<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.109> reflectors<00:01:00.710> and

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
probably took all of the reflectors and

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.890 
probably took all of the reflectors and
the<00:01:01.940> stickers<00:01:02.479> off<00:01:02.690> no<00:01:03.350> need<00:01:03.530> for<00:01:03.769> any<00:01:03.949> of<00:01:04.129> that

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
the stickers off no need for any of that

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.420 
the stickers off no need for any of that
going<00:01:05.900> for<00:01:06.050> a<00:01:06.110> more<00:01:06.290> cleaner<00:01:06.560> look

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
going for a more cleaner look

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.040 
going for a more cleaner look
next<00:01:08.270> up<00:01:08.420> probably<00:01:08.690> would<00:01:09.380> be<00:01:09.620> the<00:01:11.050> license

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
next up probably would be the license

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.929 
next up probably would be the license
plate<00:01:12.229> holder<00:01:12.470> some<00:01:13.280> people<00:01:13.490> like<00:01:13.640> them<00:01:13.790> some

people don't you can see that the arm is
still<00:01:17.570> there<00:01:17.780> on<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.110> bike<00:01:18.290> we<00:01:19.100> did<00:01:19.310> leave

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
still there on the bike we did leave

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.990 
still there on the bike we did leave
that<00:01:19.549> intact<00:01:19.990> but<00:01:20.990> what<00:01:21.200> we<00:01:21.350> did<00:01:21.590> do<00:01:21.860> I<00:01:22.130> took<00:01:22.520> a

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
that intact but what we did do I took a

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.440 
that intact but what we did do I took a
hair<00:01:23.479> tool<00:01:24.520> cutoff<00:01:25.520> wheel<00:01:25.759> and<00:01:28.180> hack<00:01:29.180> the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
hair tool cutoff wheel and hack the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.440 
hair tool cutoff wheel and hack the
little<00:01:29.719> reflectors<00:01:30.350> off<00:01:31.119> when<00:01:32.119> we<00:01:32.210> took<00:01:32.360> a

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
little reflectors off when we took a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.350 
little reflectors off when we took a
couple<00:01:32.659> of<00:01:32.780> minutes<00:01:33.049> to<00:01:33.200> do<00:01:33.789> fairly<00:01:34.789> simple

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
couple of minutes to do fairly simple

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.870 
couple of minutes to do fairly simple
and<00:01:35.509> now<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.110> license<00:01:36.710> plate<00:01:36.890> mounts<00:01:37.430> just<00:01:37.729> as

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
and now the license plate mounts just as

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.279 
and now the license plate mounts just as
it<00:01:38.000> should<00:01:38.240> but<00:01:39.079> a<00:01:39.140> much<00:01:39.350> cleaner<00:01:39.649> look<00:01:41.289> next

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
it should but a much cleaner look next

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:48.190
