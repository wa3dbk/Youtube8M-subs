00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.620 
take the back bar and you'll take this
right<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:27.660> pull<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.050> away<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.630> I'll

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
right and you just pull it away and I'll

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.580 
right and you just pull it away and I'll
make<00:02:30.870> two<00:02:31.710> different<00:02:32.300> shuttles<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:34.700> see

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
make two different shuttles and see

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.440 
make two different shuttles and see
right<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.640> wings<00:02:38.880> fold<00:02:39.270> out

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
right here the wings fold out

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.770 
right here the wings fold out
automatically<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.440> then<00:02:41.280> here's<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.670> older<00:02:42.300> it

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
automatically and then here's a older it

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.260 
automatically and then here's a older it
looks<00:02:42.990> like<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.350> rots<00:02:43.830> version<00:02:44.520> for<00:02:45.000> going<00:02:45.150> to

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
looks like the rots version for going to

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.300 
looks like the rots version for going to
the<00:02:45.390> subversion<00:02:45.780> because<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.800> glass<00:02:46.980> and

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the subversion because of the glass and

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.370 
the subversion because of the glass and
the<00:02:47.370> separator<00:02:48.000> wings<00:02:50.630> it's<00:02:51.630> an<00:02:51.810> okay<00:02:52.080> fighter

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
the separator wings it's an okay fighter

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.840 
the separator wings it's an okay fighter
I<00:02:52.530> guess<00:02:55.040> some<00:02:56.040> people<00:02:56.310> are<00:02:56.340> complaining<00:02:56.670> that

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
I guess some people are complaining that

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.210 
I guess some people are complaining that
it's<00:02:57.209> falling<00:02:57.630> apart<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:58.950> part

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
it's falling apart and like this part

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.830 
it's falling apart and like this part
where<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.700> connects<00:03:00.000> together<00:03:00.209> it<00:03:00.600> will<00:03:00.660> just

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
where it connects together it will just

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.040 
where it connects together it will just
fall<00:03:01.110> right<00:03:01.140> off<00:03:01.459> but<00:03:02.459> Marta<00:03:03.450> seems<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.959> be

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
fall right off but Marta seems to be

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.240 
fall right off but Marta seems to be
very<00:03:04.080> good<00:03:05.000> see<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.120> detail<00:03:06.510> now<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.320> also<00:03:07.680> on

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
very good see the detail now and also on

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.670 
very good see the detail now and also on
the<00:03:08.340> bottom<00:03:08.670> where<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.450> is<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:10.910> plaster<00:03:12.680> which

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
the bottom where it is a plaster which

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.229 
the bottom where it is a plaster which
is<00:03:14.390> actually<00:03:15.470> circumstances<00:03:16.470> like<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.650> cannon

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
is actually circumstances like a cannon

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.300 
is actually circumstances like a cannon
just<00:03:18.239> pull<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.600> out<00:03:18.860> it's<00:03:19.860> like<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.040> little

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
just pull it out it's like a little

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.209 
just pull it out it's like a little
rocket<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:23.209> addresses
