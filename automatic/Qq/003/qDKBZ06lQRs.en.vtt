00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
realizing was you know they're in the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.830 
realizing was you know they're in the
ancient<00:03:07.189> Egyptian<00:03:07.760> room<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.389> in<00:03:08.629> ancient

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
ancient Egyptian room and in ancient

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.869 
ancient Egyptian room and in ancient
Egypt<00:03:09.379> you<00:03:09.650> know<00:03:09.739> board<00:03:09.980> games<00:03:10.220> were<00:03:10.519> very

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
Egypt you know board games were very

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.569 
Egypt you know board games were very
popular<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.599> and<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:12.379> know<00:03:12.409> and<00:03:13.159> sometimes

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
popular and and you know and sometimes

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:14.949 
popular and and you know and sometimes
people<00:03:14.000> were<00:03:14.090> buried<00:03:14.239> with<00:03:14.480> them<00:03:14.659> in<00:03:14.750> tombs

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
people were buried with them in tombs

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.229 
people were buried with them in tombs
and<00:03:15.319> stuff<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:15.859> I<00:03:16.099> found<00:03:16.489> this<00:03:16.700> one<00:03:16.760> man

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
and stuff and so I found this one man

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.629 
and stuff and so I found this one man
that<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:18.290> rules<00:03:18.650> are<00:03:18.799> lost<00:03:19.069> nobody<00:03:19.519> knows

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
that the rules are lost nobody knows

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.430 
that the rules are lost nobody knows
what<00:03:19.910> it<00:03:19.940> was<00:03:20.090> about<00:03:20.209> but<00:03:20.959> essentially<00:03:21.349> the

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
what it was about but essentially the

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.140 
what it was about but essentially the
game<00:03:21.769> board<00:03:22.040> is<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.250> snake<00:03:22.579> that<00:03:22.819> goes<00:03:22.970> like

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
game board is a snake that goes like

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.849 
game board is a snake that goes like
this<00:03:23.299> and<00:03:23.599> because<00:03:24.019> that's<00:03:24.199> also<00:03:24.379> sort<00:03:24.709> of

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
this and because that's also sort of

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.619 
this and because that's also sort of
reference<00:03:25.310> in<00:03:25.549> Grant<00:03:25.879> Morrison<00:03:26.239> stuff<00:03:26.480> you

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:26.629 
reference in Grant Morrison stuff you

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.449 
reference in Grant Morrison stuff you
know<00:03:26.720> there<00:03:26.870> were<00:03:26.930> boys<00:03:27.139> and<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:28.010> idea<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.400> the

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
know there were boys and the idea of the

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.220 
know there were boys and the idea of the
or<00:03:28.609> Boris<00:03:28.849> being<00:03:29.030> a<00:03:29.090> snake<00:03:29.269> that<00:03:29.329> destroys<00:03:29.959> and

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
or Boris being a snake that destroys and

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.659 
or Boris being a snake that destroys and
recreates<00:03:30.620> itself<00:03:30.859> it<00:03:31.190> was<00:03:31.280> like<00:03:31.400> a<00:03:31.430> perfect

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
recreates itself it was like a perfect

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.030 
recreates itself it was like a perfect
symbol<00:03:32.269> for<00:03:32.329> the<00:03:32.510> story<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.109> a<00:03:33.500> nod<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:33.709> what

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
symbol for the story and a nod to what

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.129 
symbol for the story and a nod to what
grants<00:03:34.370> done<00:03:34.519> so<00:03:34.730> brilliantly<00:03:34.879> here<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:35.900> and

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
grants done so brilliantly here and and

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.129 
grants done so brilliantly here and and
in<00:03:36.709> Batman<00:03:37.400> so<00:03:37.699> you<00:03:38.269> know<00:03:38.359> that<00:03:38.840> was<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.049> idea

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139

the truth is really in 1938 the American
military<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:10.060> scientists<00:04:11.060> when<00:04:11.239> the<00:04:11.329> world's

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
military and scientists when the world's

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.030 
military and scientists when the world's
kind<00:04:11.780> of<00:04:11.930> on<00:04:12.019> the<00:04:12.049> brink<00:04:12.290> of<00:04:12.379> war<00:04:12.590> sent<00:04:12.979> a

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
kind of on the brink of war sent a

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.890 
kind of on the brink of war sent a
message<00:04:13.370> into<00:04:13.519> space<00:04:13.849> its<00:04:14.090> this<00:04:14.239> mathematical

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
message into space its this mathematical

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.689 
message into space its this mathematical
equation<00:04:15.349> and<00:04:15.530> essentially<00:04:15.949> the<00:04:16.070> equation<00:04:16.519> is

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
equation and essentially the equation is

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.849 
equation and essentially the equation is
a<00:04:16.760> adds<00:04:17.239> up<00:04:17.810> to<00:04:17.840> more<00:04:17.989> than<00:04:18.169> its<00:04:18.440> supposed<00:04:18.530> to

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
a adds up to more than its supposed to

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.379 
a adds up to more than its supposed to
and<00:04:19.039> the<00:04:19.099> message<00:04:19.400> is<00:04:19.519> supposed<00:04:19.820> to<00:04:19.970> say<00:04:20.120> help

and the message is supposed to say help

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.450 
and the message is supposed to say help
us<00:04:20.570> be<00:04:21.139> better<00:04:21.169> help<00:04:21.650> us<00:04:21.799> add<00:04:21.979> up<00:04:22.130> to<00:04:22.250> more<00:04:22.400> than

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
us be better help us add up to more than

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.600 
us be better help us add up to more than
we<00:04:22.639> should<00:04:22.880> at<00:04:23.000> this<00:04:23.090> moment

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
we should at this moment

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.119 
we should at this moment
the<00:04:23.729> world's<00:04:24.000> about<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.210> fall<00:04:24.330> apart<00:04:24.599> and<00:04:25.050> just

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:25.129 
the world's about to fall apart and just

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:27.379 
the world's about to fall apart and just
seconds<00:04:26.129> after<00:04:26.219> they<00:04:26.520> send<00:04:26.759> it<00:04:26.879> a<00:04:26.969> ship<00:04:27.180> comes

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
seconds after they send it a ship comes

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.480 
seconds after they send it a ship comes
down<00:04:27.659> so<00:04:28.050> it's<00:04:28.379> as<00:04:28.590> very<00:04:28.770> mysterious<00:04:29.250> thing

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
down so it's as very mysterious thing

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.700 
down so it's as very mysterious thing
and<00:04:29.520> it<00:04:30.360> lands<00:04:30.569> the<00:04:30.719> Year<00:04:30.870> Superman<00:04:31.319> was<00:04:31.500> also
