00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 today we are going to travel very far we are going to 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.220
 go to brac bread in south africa 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.950
 it is here where a couple has adopted 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.099
 a tiger as a pet as you can see in 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.100
 the pictures I'm not inventing anything to 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.070
 today and more in africa is very very 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.840
 easy to adopt a tiger the only thing 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.390
 what to have is a sufficient budget 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.000
 to give him enough kilos of 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.080
 meat since a tiger eats a large 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.630
 amount of food 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.200
 this great cat has been baptized as 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:39.430
 I enzo and live in the house with their owners 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.080
 jacqui smith and with 14 dogs at 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.710
 which for the moment it has not been 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.780
 eaten none the couple bought it then 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.730
 when I was quite young but to day of 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.550
 today, I already say that they are living with 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:55.399
 a tiger in adult status 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.040
 already live with him for over a year 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.410
 and they eat more than four kilos of meat at 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.380
 day 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.540
 michael the owner of the tiger said that he 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.060
 He is happy living with us but 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.860
 we have to remember that it is still a 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.140
 ti ti ay it seems a true 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.810
 nonsense mix these animals 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.090
 wild with human life at last, 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.369
 out there can happen any kind of 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.890
 disaster let's not forget that the instincts 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.440
 in these animals because they are very strong 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.740
 much stronger than in the case of 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.710
 dogs that are already socialized no no 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.229
 they are pets are wild beings and in the 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.229
 case of having them stuck inside the house 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.700
 In case of any oversight, there may be 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.700
 any type of accident
