00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.060
 gameplay today's release i 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.460
 I'll start with a game called don-tr onvif 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.650
 and plasma sword is quite an epic game and 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.230
 behind this epic the name is revealed not 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.809
 less epic early but this radar is not 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.880
 fairly standard it will hang and with 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.590
 small plot com you need 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.140
 save the world from aliens 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.840
 so let's start here he is our main character 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.550
 actually running a plasma sword that runs 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.859
 he knows how to do he knows how to jump and 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.560
 slip under the obstacles as well 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.880
 strike a crushing blow and their 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.070
 plasma sword 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.110
 so here it looks to us here 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.790
 it is necessary to run to collect such 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.680
 postcard asterisks 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.430
 and along the way there are various 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.039
 bonuses that will help us 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.440
 pass missions accelerate us and accelerate 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.989
 make more cheerful more vigorous and 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.329
 clockwork guys and also in the game 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.699
 There are various bonuses that 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.870
 rather not a bonus on the socks you are you 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.940
 can pump 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.820
 is it you can pump your sword 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.040
 can choose a mask for your hero 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.729
 to run in it as well 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.040
 pump over and more useful things like 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.580
 how speed force hitting height 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.350
 jump and slipping time after 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.500
 as you pass the section to you 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.030
 put stars for you 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.890
 completed certain tasks for it 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.869
 you are given the experience of the actual experience here 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.540
 is the currency to which you sweat 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.610
 shopitsya be able to store and also 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.340
 pump all your skills 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.009
 I did not like this runner 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.060
 the atmosphere in it is something there is something 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.350
 such a spiritual something a little bit 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.630
 brainwashing in general to whom the game 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.990
 I liked to download, but we went 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.659
 next 2 granization me down and this 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.939
 stunning beautiful india arcades 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.850
 which you have to play for some 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.130
 whether a fairy or some kind of fly let's 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.020
 look at all the chapters that we 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.600
 submit pass here it all 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.310
 described what we need to do in what 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.100
 chapter by the way pay it all 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.439
 attention began then there will be problems with 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.800
 understanding this game I originally 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.570
 he did not understand the meaning of this game at about 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.810
 here they are produced using here 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.600
 such a long tap we press and 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.120
 ours is this fairy flying and so here's the first 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.730
 chapter what we need to do is us 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.490
 need to perform a song to perform 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.550
 song you need to click on found this one 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.280
 from the fairies q and keep it for a long time 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.650
 after that she will take the upper hand 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.530
 some kind of solar energy will bring it 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.410
 back to earth and grow in that place 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.230
 beautiful green tree second mission 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.510
 it seems to be that you 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.960
 will need to find flying fish and 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.720
 with them they fly up where they 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.760
 will be waiting for the fish here 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.580
 non-standard mission in this game and 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.830
 by the way the developers themselves in this group 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.750
 queen play with headphones here but i have them 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.240
 I understand because the music is here too 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.860
 really at the height of course i 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.510
 I understand that this game probably 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.880
 like a little because she 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.790
 quite specific and original here 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:15.110
 by the way the second chapter is written by flights of 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:18.110
 same screw fishes i.e. air fish 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.680
 let's try to find them so here 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.230
 the river we have fish as we do 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.330
 their air can be us too 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.200
 it is necessary to sing all this song 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.600
 after that then the fish will fly no 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.239
 for some reason the state of the fish is not flying right now 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.880
 want by the way here if you fly by 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.930
 weed out of that weed 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.730
 some flies and what awaits us 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.640
 usually when i played my first time 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.430
 night came and only at night these 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.709
 the fish became flying I followed them 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.140
 rushed up there waiting for the fisherman 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.800
 in fact in this and was given 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:01.010
 mission a little brain-bearing toy 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.470
 it is necessary to puzzle sometimes 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.190
 freak out to figure out what's wrong with you 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.890
 required 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.530
 who likes these games download 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.350
 on we move on to something simpler 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.540
 By simpler, I understood the arcade. 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.980
 name alliance like milk that is 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.109
 aliens or 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.479
 milk and let's look at this 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.729
 This version of the game is free but in 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.760
 the free version is not all available 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.199
 mission we have several packs with 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.510
 level 3 specifically 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.280
 in each you can play after 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.270
 earn a certain debt 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.820
 number of stars 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.340
 let's play Let's go pack 1 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.710
 several missions and see what's here 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.590
 in general there is in every park in the free 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.620
 versions available only 10 missions and more 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.270
 20 or how many here unfortunately will be 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.410
 only available if you purchase 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.229
 full version 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.660
 let's play the third mission let's see what's from 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.840
 we are required by the developers they are from us 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.490
 requires that we deliver cows 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.039
 in the alien plate 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.590
 so what do we need to do let's 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:06.410
 Now let go of the cow let it 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.600
 collect all these green stars 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.090
 fungus to our cow reduces thanks 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.820
 what she slipped freely here in 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.580
 This hole here and hit the flying 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.949
 the plate is now our alien having drunk 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.280
 milk is very happy and hugged everyone 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:24.740
 their cows and actually happy 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.960
 this is also present here such 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.660
 here are no barrels in any case 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.849
 so that they fall into a flying saucer 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.150
 otherwise we lose so let's 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.979
 First we eliminate this bull and by the way 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.680
 bundle will help you create one of 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:42.560
 collect 1 stars and now absolutely 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.020
 calmly go to the flying saucer 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.180
 Here is such a simple arcade to 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.960
 she reminds me very much 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.260
 cat ze roup 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.630
 but this is in principle not even a minus 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:57.380
 plus because the graphics here are real 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.389
 I generally advise you to have a nice toy 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.330
 basically liked and seemed 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:05.419
 very nice last game 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.610
 Case is called thin torso this game 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.590
 I have never seen but read in 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.610
 on the internet that this game is based on 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.530
 some incredible hit 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:18.530
 1983 so who loves retro games 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.310
 who wants to shake off the old mercy 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.650
 I beg 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.840
 It's so that's not the entire screen I 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.340
 played it so as you see here 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.760
 still appeared and 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.650
 how to say red such cartridges from 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.440
 which you need to dodge if 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.540
 they will get you then time is taken away 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.060
 which you are assigned to 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.430
 catch an escaped criminal like you 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.680
 understand you are playing for english 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.590
 the cop is easy to understand by his 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.590
 cap and in general form what it is 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.180
 cop we need to get 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.690
 catch up with the prisoner who committed 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.000
 the escape 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.760
 we can run to collect various 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.229
 bags that give us glasses and also 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.300
 another time bonus 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:02.540
 the name is necessary to dodge from these 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.050
 here are the red shells carrying ordinary 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.600
 bounce 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.870
 Now I expect that I still have 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.820
 get to catch up to catch up with this white 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.070
 white prisoner because he is white 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:16.070
 marked on the map and pass this mission 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:18.440
 yes we passed the mission and now we crossed 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.810
 at exactly the next step it is the same but 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.510
 only here new species have appeared 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.430
 obstacles new types of bonuses in general 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:28.490
 Here is such a catchy toy 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:32.389
 despite the fact that it is monotonous and in 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:34.580
 she has a spirit of this here in 1983 

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:37.310
 if someone is playing this game probably 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:40.039
 they generally rejoice and slap low-fat 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.320
 Lois on this for today all big
