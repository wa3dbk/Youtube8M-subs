00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.370
 mh yes yes 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.930
 there are 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.170
 and usually for home I live in winschoten 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.400
 by nature i am publishing publisher amd many king of 6 just once 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.400
 soccer championship 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.630
 opera 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.759
 but i still don't understand their banning wezeperbrug 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.060
 and I became fourth in the last year 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.449
 Drenthe champion 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.980
 what lose those are 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.980
 you may not give a chance 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.930
 this week start playing love 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.100
 he says he will play 2 this week 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.110
 I don't like that 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.560
 I have a playing style that is completely gone 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.560
 what kind of playing style it has 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.100
 thank you but what to think 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.140
 always in front of the house and tons of schaik the preliminaries already played each other 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.430
 and then found for the house 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.520
 voorthuizen is someone who does not need preparation and is right straight away 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.700
 is in his game 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.700
 van schaik is someone who needs to get going 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.310
 and we can see that at the start of the final 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.480
 it does not make a difference that Schiet also thinks it is 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.480
 I think that's a bad thing for Bayern 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.850
 it is 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.850
 in fact a billiards billiards afterwards 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.140
 if it gets behind 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.140
 that is why I can refuse all reasons 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.450
 voorthuizen a lead of 80 in forest 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.450
 this is to the annoyance of van schaik 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.840
 But in my eyes you want to make sure you don't know what we are up to the top of Tokyo 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.340
 then it became the limit 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.960
 and you want to share it means that if you promise so you immediately 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.330
 with the choice to put the ball if it already touches the second ball 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.690
 the guard know an explanation 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.930
 but the arbitrator to see it nothing 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.520
 he probably has to do it himself and he does 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.290
 he is sitting a few good series quickly catches up and shows 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.289
 the first 24 caroms 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.829
 one more carom m from schaik is out 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.189
 the trend make the 25th 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:25.179
 and then the house still has to be aligned 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.639
 but that extra turn is not spent for the home 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.949
 and so are the achievements delivering new champion three cushion drent 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.269
 is estimated 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.439
 the products that are not 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.089
 the match between 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:49.799
 it was very exciting 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.539
 yes I have to understand the whole race in the tub 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.900
 that is not so bad what proposes what 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.189
 you have to park again four points next year 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.189
 and ticket sales in the next few weeks 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.949
 underneath 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.299
 became an actress
