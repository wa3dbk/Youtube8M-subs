00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:05.080
 Hi guys and welcome to a tutorial I am Solidus from Janam 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.700
 einkÃ¶pfte 0 11 I'll show you today like a secret hiding place for the procedure 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.229
 Multiplayer or single player can build 

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:15.699
 for that we presented a new world I would have said as expected he told the world 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.699
 I'm wary of these world hits 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.039
 Please do not be surprised if I used dictatorial to meals but he has to 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.989
 later episodes on the net puffs videos and there namely cheesy but 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.989
 all pike built 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.980
 have in sections and mostly went 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.610
 until then 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.610
 while her on the falls it is easier 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.240
 then he takes off while a block 2 is damaged I'm going up 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.870
 that's normal then you need 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.020
 counter 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.020
 Pictures and a door 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.900
 then you build up today expensive to buy 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.210
 that's what the grandparents wanted their troupe to put in there something 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.550
 leaving one free for a door 9 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.219
 b 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:17.430
 b 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.430
 because 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.320
 Bonn 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.920
 then the door is going to drive to the finish 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.119
 net-m failed was up to them that the riots could then 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.930
 so and now he is a picture and directly trying to get such a big picture 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.130
 and that always depends on the Kissinger Escada "on everyone else 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.650
 Pictures from Schmitten 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.690
 Sound around 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.690
 Percent Greifswald determined that the door opens 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.880
 then i could go through this picture i more out of pini walks this 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.770
 Room and 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.890
 we hid the freestyle of the agency and of those came after 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.420
 outside Copenhagen 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.060
 but not talking from the outside that's the beautiful then you can give yours 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.460
 Although it also showed off wavy parts in a factory you can also 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.129
 just 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.559
 It is also exciting to make a wall 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:23.040
 so he includes it so if you then correct images of Saab 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:24.969
 Texture Bechtle thanks 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.309
 So then textures 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:30.309
 yes and then get stuck for their troop and 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.719
 the wars 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:38.009
 so if have fun with this table and 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:40.649
 there will be further episodes under pressure until next time
