00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.990
 it is a just phrase not 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.610
 I think that many times the player 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.100
 You need the support of the coach but 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.540
 also the coach needs the 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.129
 backing from the player I do not always say 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.240
 that he is totally grateful to him 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.580
 to his coaching staff and my colleagues 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.720
 for the trust they give me for 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.310
 the quiet that they give me at the time of 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.810
 go out and play knowing that they are my club 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.670
 out there I do not have that continuity that 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.150
 I need 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.800
 and in that case the backing of towards me 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.619
 I have to go back inside the field 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.720
 where the backup relies on what 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.460
 I'm fine that I feel good that 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.840
 I train hard to play that all the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.309
 days I train as if on Sunday I 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.230
 will play and disappointed when 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.500
 when I do not play with moments that go to 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.629
 bank but thank god the last 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.880
 party went out went well came out what was 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.560
 I expected 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.660
 and we would have liked very much 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.070
 win because actually what we were 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.410
 face was that but good 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.940
 have covered two balls that have not 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:03.220
 made goals that the team continues adding 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.100
 in that phase of growth that we have 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.660
 keep adding minutes keep adding 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.960
 matches over four months ago that 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.570
 we did not see each other having taken a 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.670
 Romagna draw has not been bad for 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.950
 the fact that after so much time 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.400
 that the team was not together that did not 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.170
 they saw the boys r was going to be difficult 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.090
 that game more with Romania that 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.500
 I played my life because as they were not in 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.539
 the world cup had to make a good 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.880
 party against us and thank God 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.440
 it came out a nice game the thing is 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.780
 who spoke with Mascherano on this tour 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.550
 for europe and he told me not to think more 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.009
 in being champions of the world let's think about 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.780
 enter the first four by the 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.119
 fact that 24 years ago we did not 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.710
 we come to an end and I think it's 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.289
 moment that the objectives are more 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.790
 short coincide or you have to go by the 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.460
 championship 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.380
 I always say the same thing I say 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.450
 we are there to take 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.670
 Argentines as high as possible I think 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.020
 that the last two worlds came out in 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.520
 rooms it 's time to pass that stage now 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.230
 well what he did rather than get to the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.370
 first four to which Argentina returns to 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.280
 be in the first planes because 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.980
 came a semifinal and that's where God 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.270
 You want it to be the best not follow up 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.960
 the end we arrive until the last day 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.400
 to try to bring the goal or 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.630
 what is so precious that all 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.130
 Argentines we want it to be a long time 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.130
 we do not see it that the world cup 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.370
 we know that our image has to 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.720
 be the best and we know that once and for all 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.240
 for all we have to return to our 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.940
 country the first plane of the world 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.500
 I wonder what it would be for you to play your 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.150
 second world as a way holder 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.820
 consecutive 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.220
 something unthinkable some thought a truth 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.590
 what 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.960
 always had the illusion from the first 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.240
 day my name is the coconut I think it was in 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.640
 caterpillar who called me what we 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.990
 the coconut the pat the baker all his 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.790
 coaching staff and they gave me the 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.900
 opportunity to share what was the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.599
 group of the senior team 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.459
 always from that day my goal was to go 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.349
 to the senior team is to train me 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.310
 try to do your best in the 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.650
 matches to be in the national team 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.269
 older did not put me the goal of playing 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.250
 he just wanted to share the 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.320
 moment with the group 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.530
 with the steps stopped when it arrives 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.820
 diego and gives me the opportunity to play me 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.810
 I realized that it was the opportunity not to 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.400
 talk about weapons of the selection bow 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.800
 Argentina that I had to work on 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.900
 triple to always be there 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.820
 and the fact of having the backing 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.070
 of the trainers that passed as the 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.040
 checho like now alejandro the truth 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.350
 that generates a confidence in me 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.880
 impressive positive that I do not feel the 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.500
 inactivity but on the contrary I 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.850
 Feeds the desire to train each 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.100
 stronger time thinking that on Sunday 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.990
 I'm going to play and that makes one when 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.530
 when he goes to the national team he will be seen 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.450
 a tranquility 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.160
 that things are going to work out well 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.230
 something that is very important as 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.640
 Good digit is a little bit confidence 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.680
 of the player trainer and trust the 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.989
 player the coach 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.150
 is the base and I go with a quiet 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.430
 and it got there and it gives me more 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.319
 tranquility and confidence from the 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.450
 Alejandra all my companions that one 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.000
 the truth that says I have to be 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.349
 privileged and I want to continue in this 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.989
 place I want to continue training very 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.639
 strong to be here and god 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.739
 want that in these two months that are left 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.540
 we have the possibility to play in the 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.370
 Monaco to get even more more 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.440
 still calm the moment I think 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.109
 not that you should think about when the 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.300
 critical because it does not give to say but 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.820
 play with basile game maradona play 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.090
 with batista I played with knows how bad 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.090
 I am not 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.009
 football soccer today does not happen 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:37.830
 it does not happen if one thinks or does not think towards 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.689
 a ball or soccer pass that when one 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.150
 is playing and things are coming out 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:44.580
 well nothing happens happens that when one 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.100
 he makes a mistake he is going to criticize me 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.350
 they criticize me because I do not play 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.900
 thank god when I speak with rangers 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.390
 and he tells me that he looks good to me 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.740
 quiet that eye the cup of france the 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.330
 problem that the cup france plays 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.610
 is practically played every month and 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.500
 now if we pass this stage at the end of 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.689
 March the match more often because it 's 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.610
 here a little but 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:09.429
 as I already tell you and the tranquility that 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.259
 you have the knowledge that one when you go in 

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:12.879
 field is always trained at a hundred 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.559
 a hundred percent more than you have an annoyance of 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:16.569
 something is trained one hundred percent no no 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:18.939
 let a day pass try not to jump 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:20.439
 No training to meet 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:23.739
 the other goal that has outside of what 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:25.869
 which is the club makes one be with the 

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:27.129
 head put on the objective and that one 

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:29.399
 you train how you have to train 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.399
 everyday
