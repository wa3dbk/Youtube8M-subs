all right today we have a deluxe memory
man<00:00:13.590> tap<00:00:14.309> tempo<00:00:14.660> by<00:00:15.660> electro-harmonix<00:00:16.699> so

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
man tap tempo by electro-harmonix so

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.050 
man tap tempo by electro-harmonix so
let's<00:00:18.150> start<00:00:19.080> with<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> clean<00:00:19.500> signal<00:00:21.890> and

I have everything down it has the the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.600 
I have everything down it has the the
rate<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.899> depth<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.380> sort<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.920> chorus

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
rate in the depth is sort of the chorus

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.260 
rate in the depth is sort of the chorus
for<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> repeats<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.100> tap<00:00:38.489> tempo<00:00:38.850> on

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
for the repeats and we have tap tempo on

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.500 
for the repeats and we have tap tempo on
the<00:00:40.110> left<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.770> we<00:00:40.890> have<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.510> subdivisions

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the left and we have the subdivisions

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.580 
the left and we have the subdivisions
the<00:00:42.809> tap<00:00:43.170> divided<00:00:43.649> here<00:00:44.420> as<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.960> go<00:00:46.200> through

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
the tap divided here as you go through

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.420 
the tap divided here as you go through
them<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.329> have<00:00:48.329> expression<00:00:49.289> pedal<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.190> we

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
them and we have expression pedal and we

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.750 
them and we have expression pedal and we
can<00:00:51.350> we<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:52.530> choose<00:00:53.210> what<00:00:54.210> we<00:00:54.239> want<00:00:54.449> to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
control so that is really cool very

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.540 
control so that is really cool very
versatile<00:00:59.550> Pelle<00:00:59.879> even<00:01:00.840> has<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> send<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.160> a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
versatile Pelle even has a send and a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.509 
versatile Pelle even has a send and a
return<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.420> basically<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.500> run<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
return so basically you can run the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.000 
return so basically you can run the
repeats<00:01:06.119> through<00:01:06.360> anything<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.869> want<00:01:07.080> and

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
repeats through anything you want and

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.929 
repeats through anything you want and
filter<00:01:08.670> them<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.810> all<00:01:09.869> kinds<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.380> stuff<00:01:10.619> so

and<00:02:11.820> let's<00:02:12.820> go<00:02:13.060> through<00:02:13.300> our<00:02:13.350> subdivisions<00:02:14.640> we

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
and let's go through our subdivisions we

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.440 
and let's go through our subdivisions we
have<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.590> dot<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:18.010> don't<00:02:18.730> know<00:02:18.820> exactly<00:02:18.940> what

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
have the dot I don't know exactly what

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.170 
have the dot I don't know exactly what
all<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.990> names<00:02:20.260> are<00:02:20.560> here<00:02:20.830> for<00:02:21.130> them<00:02:21.310> but<00:02:22.000> on

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
all the names are here for them but on

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.930 
all the names are here for them but on
this<00:02:22.480> one<00:02:22.720> basically<00:02:23.260> if<00:02:24.220> we<00:02:24.280> have<00:02:24.430> a<00:02:24.610> beat

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
this one basically if we have a beat

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:34.890 
this one basically if we have a beat
like<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:28.420> do<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:32.820> D<00:02:33.820> standard<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.780> we

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
like this and do the D standard and we

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:45.210 
like this and do the D standard and we
go<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.320> first<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.860> dot<00:02:43.770> alright<00:02:44.770> we<00:02:45.040> go<00:02:45.190> to

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
go to the first the dot alright we go to

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:54.360 
go to the first the dot alright we go to
the<00:02:45.520> three<00:02:52.470> basically<00:02:53.470> what<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.680> does<00:02:53.890> then

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
the three basically what that does then

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.150 
the three basically what that does then
we<00:02:55.270> have<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.840> full<00:02:56.140> note<00:02:56.410> which<00:02:56.710> is<00:02:56.740> like<00:02:57.130> a

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
we have the full note which is like a

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
we have the full note which is like a
double<00:02:57.850> time<00:03:03.600> we<00:03:04.600> have<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.900> three<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:13.060> we

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
double time we have the three and we

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.340 
double time we have the three and we
have<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.450> last<00:03:13.690> one<00:03:18.210> and<00:03:19.210> basically<00:03:19.750> that's

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
have the last one and basically that's

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.660 
have the last one and basically that's
what<00:03:20.680> those<00:03:21.010> do

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.580 

and<00:03:24.670> there<00:03:25.000> is<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.150> trick<00:03:25.540> here<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:26.080> read<00:03:26.380> on<00:03:26.500> a

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
and there is a trick here I read on a

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.040 
and there is a trick here I read on a
manual<00:03:26.920> by<00:03:27.160> holding<00:03:27.580> this<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.810> will

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
manual by holding this and it will

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.270 
manual by holding this and it will
actually<00:03:29.849> cycle<00:03:30.849> through<00:03:31.360> all<00:03:31.660> of<00:03:32.280> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
actually cycle through all of the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.960 
actually cycle through all of the
divided<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.450> with<00:03:35.319> the<00:03:35.560> rate<00:03:35.980> knob<00:03:36.280> we<00:03:36.760> can

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
divided and with the rate knob we can

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.330 
divided and with the rate knob we can
control<00:03:37.330> how<00:03:37.510> fast<00:03:37.810> it's<00:03:38.110> whoop<00:03:38.620> swoops

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
control how fast it's whoop swoops

00:03:39.340 --> 00:04:00.870 
control how fast it's whoop swoops
through<00:03:39.670> them<00:03:58.890> that's<00:03:59.890> kind<00:04:00.010> of<00:04:00.220> cool<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.700> get

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
through them that's kind of cool to get

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.330 
through them that's kind of cool to get
out<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.299> you<00:04:01.330> hold<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:01.900> again<00:04:02.170> and<00:04:02.440> it<00:04:03.220> will

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
out of it you hold it again and it will

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.670 
out of it you hold it again and it will
go<00:04:03.489> back<00:04:03.519> to<00:04:03.760> normal

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
go back to normal

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.460 
go back to normal
another<00:04:06.420> cool<00:04:07.420> feature<00:04:07.480> is<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:10.480> can<00:04:10.510> actually

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
another cool feature is you can actually

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.740 
another cool feature is you can actually
set<00:04:12.340> a<00:04:13.349> sort<00:04:14.349> of<00:04:14.410> a<00:04:14.790> when<00:04:15.790> you<00:04:15.880> hold<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.450> tap

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
set a sort of a when you hold the tap

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.860 
set a sort of a when you hold the tap
button

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
delay so basically kind of goes through

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.529 
delay so basically kind of goes through
all<00:05:05.660> of<00:05:05.690> these<00:05:06.050> functions<00:05:07.000> can't<00:05:08.000> control<00:05:08.419> the
