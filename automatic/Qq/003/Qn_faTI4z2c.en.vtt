00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.420 
that's not true barbecue true barbecue
involves<00:00:24.269> cooking<00:00:24.990> meat<00:00:25.410> with<00:00:25.619> indirect<00:00:26.160> heat

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
involves cooking meat with indirect heat

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.120 
involves cooking meat with indirect heat
at<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.760> low<00:00:27.269> temperature<00:00:27.960> for<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.289> long<00:00:28.590> period

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
at a low temperature for a long period

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.830 
at a low temperature for a long period
of<00:00:29.189> time<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.640> that's<00:00:29.789> exactly<00:00:30.119> what<00:00:30.599> this

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
of time and that's exactly what this

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.510 
of time and that's exactly what this
does

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
does

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.040 
does
today<00:00:33.120> I'm<00:00:33.390> barbecuing<00:00:34.110> ribs<00:00:35.809> now<00:00:36.809> what<00:00:36.930> this

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
today I'm barbecuing ribs now what this

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.549 
today I'm barbecuing ribs now what this
does<00:00:37.110> over<00:00:37.680> here<00:00:37.890> if<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.100> look<00:00:38.309> there's<00:00:38.610> a

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
does over here if you look there's a

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.400 
does over here if you look there's a
fire<00:00:40.559> box<00:00:40.829> over<00:00:41.250> here<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.730> side<00:00:41.969> I

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
fire box over here on this side I

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.670 
fire box over here on this side I
usually<00:00:43.410> put<00:00:44.420> wood<00:00:45.420> briquettes<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.110> there<00:00:46.379> and

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
usually put wood briquettes in there and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.860 
usually put wood briquettes in there and
that's<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.190> source<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.610> heat<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.450> heat<00:00:48.629> goes

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that's the source of heat the heat goes

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.510 
that's the source of heat the heat goes
through<00:00:49.170> here<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.950> cooking<00:00:50.280> chamber

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
through here this is the cooking chamber

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.389 
through here this is the cooking chamber
and<00:00:51.199> goes<00:00:52.199> up<00:00:52.410> through<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.649> chimney<00:00:53.190> right

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
and goes up through that chimney right

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.490 
and goes up through that chimney right
there

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
there

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.189 
there
so<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.039> meat<00:00:56.250> never<00:00:57.090> once<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.629> exposed<00:00:58.020> to

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
so the meat never once is exposed to

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.599 
so the meat never once is exposed to
direct<00:00:58.440> heat<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:58.890> always<00:00:59.100> cooked<00:00:59.370> by

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
direct heat it's always cooked by

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.180 
direct heat it's always cooked by
indirect<00:01:00.239> heat<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:01.350> keep<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.710> temperature

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
indirect heat and I keep the temperature

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.719 
indirect heat and I keep the temperature
at<00:01:02.460> around<00:01:02.789> around<00:01:03.780> 200<00:01:04.409> degrees<00:01:04.610> what<00:01:05.610> you

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
at around around 200 degrees what you

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.160 
at around around 200 degrees what you
see<00:01:05.909> right<00:01:05.939> above<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.570> sitting<00:01:06.900> on<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
see right above here sitting on the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.420 
see right above here sitting on the
ledge<00:01:07.380> these<00:01:07.710> two<00:01:07.920> things<00:01:08.189> these<00:01:08.369> are

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
ledge these two things these are

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.210 
ledge these two things these are
charcoal<00:01:08.970> chimneys<00:01:09.680> that's<00:01:10.680> what<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.890> use<00:01:11.040> to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
charcoal chimneys that's what I use to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.460 
charcoal chimneys that's what I use to

that way any of the impurities are burnt

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.520 
that way any of the impurities are burnt
off<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.430> there<00:01:35.700> before<00:01:36.600> they<00:01:36.750> go<00:01:36.930> in<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
off in there before they go in so the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.160 
off in there before they go in so the
meat<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.890> not<00:01:38.180> exposed<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.390> any<00:01:39.450> impurities

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
from the briquettes as I said I will

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.850 
from the briquettes as I said I will
cook<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.820> around<00:01:45.000> five<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.200> six<00:01:46.500> hours

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
cook this for around five to six hours

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.160 
cook this for around five to six hours
at<00:01:47.070> 200<00:01:47.549> degrees<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.119> have<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> thermometer

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
at 200 degrees I have a thermometer

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.130 
at 200 degrees I have a thermometer
right<00:01:50.070> up<00:01:50.220> here<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.850> white<00:01:51.390> circle<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:51.960> doubt

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
right up here this white circle I doubt

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.719 
right up here this white circle I doubt
you<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.470> see<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.770> numbers<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.399> that's<00:01:53.610> a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
you can see the numbers on it that's a

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.060 
you can see the numbers on it that's a
thermometer<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.680> I<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.829> another

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
thermometer and I have another

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.880 
thermometer and I have another
thermometer<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.850> installed<00:01:57.329> myself<00:01:57.710> down<00:01:58.710> in

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
thermometer I installed myself down in

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.609 
thermometer I installed myself down in
this<00:01:59.009> end<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.579> that's<00:02:00.360> right<00:02:00.780> at<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.020> level

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
this end and that's right at the level

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.139 
this end and that's right at the level
of<00:02:01.969> the<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.869> grates<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.439> have<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
of the of the grates that I have the
