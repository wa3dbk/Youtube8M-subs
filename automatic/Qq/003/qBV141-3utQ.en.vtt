00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
it got a split this motor looks like it

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.600 
it got a split this motor looks like it
was<00:01:09.180> built<00:01:09.330> by<00:01:09.479> aliens<00:01:10.080> or<00:01:10.229> something<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:11.460> was

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
was built by aliens or something it was

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.910 
was built by aliens or something it was
pretty<00:01:12.000> sophisticated<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.799> know

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
pretty sophisticated but you know

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.580 
pretty sophisticated but you know
nothing<00:01:14.490> beats<00:01:14.640> me<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:15.450> got<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> TZ<00:01:15.990> bearing

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
nothing beats me it's got the TZ bearing

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.410 
nothing beats me it's got the TZ bearing
in<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.830> just<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.070> they<00:01:17.460> sell<00:01:17.670> for<00:01:17.790> banshees<00:01:18.210> I

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
in it just like they sell for banshees I

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.030 
in it just like they sell for banshees I
thought<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.080> was<00:01:19.200> pretty<00:01:19.350> cool<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.830> side

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
thought that was pretty cool this side

thought that was pretty cool this side
over<00:01:20.159> here<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.490> got<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> normal<00:01:21.000> bearing

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
over here is just got a normal bearing

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.200 
over here is just got a normal bearing
in<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.630> took<00:01:22.080> out<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.619> counter<00:01:23.310> balancer

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
in it I took out the counter balancer

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.219 
in it I took out the counter balancer
which<00:01:24.420> also<00:01:25.409> drives<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.040> water<00:01:26.159> pump<00:01:26.869> so<00:01:27.869> tip

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
which also drives the water pump so tip

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.550 
which also drives the water pump so tip
that<00:01:28.380> out<00:01:28.729> start<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.790> clutch<00:01:29.970> right<00:01:30.180> here

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560

so<00:01:48.509> basically<00:01:48.780> when<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.470> got<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.829> had<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> blown

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
gear blown third gear when I drained the

gear blown third gear when I drained the
oil<00:01:52.770> on<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.430> actually<00:01:53.640> got<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.380> out<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.590> it

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
oil on it I actually got this out of it

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.800 
oil on it I actually got this out of it
I<00:01:55.920> did<00:01:56.460> not<00:01:56.610> know<00:01:56.700> what<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.939> was<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.329> at<00:01:57.630> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
I did not know what it was the at the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.030 
I did not know what it was the at the
moment<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.290> thought<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.530> was<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.770> piece<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
moment I thought it was a piece of the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.170 
moment I thought it was a piece of the
training<00:01:59.399> reason<00:01:59.670> why<00:01:59.729> my<00:01:59.820> hands<00:02:00.000> are<00:02:00.060> so

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
training reason why my hands are so

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.249 
training reason why my hands are so
clean<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.450> because<00:02:00.600> I've<00:02:00.719> been<00:02:00.869> learning<00:02:01.229> to

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
clean is because I've been learning to

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.609 
clean is because I've been learning to
use<00:02:01.439> gloves<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:03.600> yeah<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.960> came<00:02:04.140> out<00:02:04.290> with<00:02:04.469> it

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
use gloves so yeah this came out with it

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.679 
use gloves so yeah this came out with it
then<00:02:05.340> when<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.670> pulled<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.030> clutch<00:02:06.240> cover<00:02:06.420> off

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
then when I pulled the clutch cover off

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.260 
then when I pulled the clutch cover off
I<00:02:07.049> got<00:02:07.829> this<00:02:08.280> right<00:02:08.520> here<00:02:09.440> this<00:02:10.440> right<00:02:10.679> here

yeah well that's it so basically what

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.580 
yeah well that's it so basically what
happened<00:02:18.689> here<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:18.900> third<00:02:19.140> gear

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
happened here is third gear

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.160 
happened here is third gear
I<00:02:20.510> forgot<00:02:21.510> what<00:02:21.629> these<00:02:21.720> are<00:02:21.840> called<00:02:21.870> they

engine gasket set OOP no one loser got
axle<00:03:27.959> bearings<00:03:28.489> swing<00:03:29.489> arm<00:03:29.639> bearings<00:03:29.970> and

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
axle bearings swing arm bearings and

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.720 
axle bearings swing arm bearings and
these<00:03:31.169> should<00:03:31.349> be<00:03:31.409> wheel<00:03:31.680> bearings<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:35.310> I

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
these should be wheel bearings so I

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.369 
these should be wheel bearings so I
basically<00:03:36.599> got<00:03:36.750> everything<00:03:37.079> I<00:03:37.139> need<00:03:37.290> to

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
pulling out the piston I broke a circlip

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.259 
pulling out the piston I broke a circlip
so<00:03:41.190> now<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.340> got<00:03:41.489> a<00:03:41.519> way<00:03:41.639> to<00:03:41.699> wait<00:03:41.879> for<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:42.150> to
