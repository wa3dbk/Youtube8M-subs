00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.870
 yes 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.630
 hello everyone from David, so it's a bit 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.090
 that or these speakers I decided then 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.900
 to make a video since I'm not 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.360
 so conventional to explain a little 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.380
 like how they go and Lombard we talk about 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.720
 audi via audi bible is wanted Italian 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.300
 which makes products we say only of di 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:11.570
 high end quality and these are the 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:14.970
 skilled and Belgian are diffusers that mount 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.010
 of the speakers on their turn 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.130
 fight of the very particular firm 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:25.350
 made with very high efficiency speakers 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:27.600
 they are built with practically one 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.910
 leaf should be papyrus are 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.610
 the membrane is also very particular 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.060
 and very particular very much 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.450
 sensitive we speak of 98 of b therefore 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.210
 suitable for valves, even small 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.740
 this size in this model here 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.330
 especially in this 2 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.990
 front we see good 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.539
 size and is also changed 1 above 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.569
 Smaller both large-size 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:01.289
 band 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:04.440
 but what happens to me honestly is not 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:07.410
 that is to say, beasts speakers 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:11.310
 very suitable to very suitable entries to 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:14.910
 jazz and very sensitive however in the end the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.150
 result is not that then I tried to 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.560
 replacing the said speaking ones 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.620
 let's say they are just friends 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.650
 in fact in Naples so superior with gods 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.080
 wide sends from 15 centimeters and is not up 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.920
 a small coil to remove medium 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:38.590
 high because they were for my taste 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:41.860
 too much too clear entries was very 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.019
 the better there was so much better 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.420
 say what result convinced me 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.470
 very much because with these 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.380
 speakers here and there or why they are 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:58.239
 sensational for the voices came out a 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:03.069
 union that I really liked 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:07.090
 much the speakers are built a lot 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.940
 very good are the cherry massage 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:14.290
 national so beautiful beautiful beautiful they have 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.510
 see a reflex above and 1 below 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.549
 however as a whole positioning 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.910
 irs are prior therefore they do not have 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:25.410
 problems that can come up to cost 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.790
 on the wall without any problem 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.000
 here are also its covers 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.980
 see this and the top e 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.609
 this and the front one 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:42.100
 no I'm not want to see said 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:44.410
 speaking as they are as I was saying 98 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.560
 I'm even doing it here 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.010
 go with the audio sun that shook and 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.010
 half 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.670
 March slightly the volume or take that 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.940
 it is a marvel 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.940
 as I said, very suitable for everything 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.210
 what voice is reproduced in a manner 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.190
 amazing and now I have to tell you that too 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.380
 that low respond well with 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.000
 speaker that I put in have a 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.490
 used value 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.140
 I would say very very affordable now I 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.540

 ok this is the mass if one wants 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:39.840

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.040
 forgotten cuddly 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.580
