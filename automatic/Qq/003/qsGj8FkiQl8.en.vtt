actually<00:01:16.890> spits<00:01:17.189> over<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.119> kind<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.810> inner

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
actually spits over the kind of inner

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.300 
actually spits over the kind of inner
part<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.560> you're<00:01:19.680> actually<00:01:19.770> getting<00:01:19.979> two

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
part so you're actually getting two

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
cases in one so that fits over and then

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.609 
cases in one so that fits over and then
this<00:01:23.220> part<00:01:23.460> locks<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.030> nice<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.450> easily<00:01:24.810> all

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
this part locks on nice and easily all
