00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.680
 d 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:41.980
 a turn in this new mini 5doors 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.980
 Cooper's to accompany us please 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.799
 We started because you've seen it 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.340
 out 4 meters just for good 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.140
 for this mini 5 doors cooper s of 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.270
 we are of the three diesel versions that 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.360
 there is then we are with the one with the most 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.460
 powerful with which it has 170 horses and 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.670
 the truth is that not only at the level of 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.860
 power but at the level of good then of 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.560
 dynamic magnet experience and about 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.780
 all good then with this with these 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.810
 finishes that we handle that is the top 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.670
 range with a lot of extras and such is 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.479
 particular unit of the mini cooper s 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.750
 the truth is that it is something that could 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.380
 fit with dignity in the struggle of 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.390
 any premium brand to be made 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.369
 with with the services of any 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.470
 client looking for a car about 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.780
 four meters that is then that in the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.119
 segment b and so look for the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.049
 excellence and evidently this mini does not 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.720
 I'm going to tell you that it borders on excellence 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.690
 but it is on its own merits 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.250
 within this excellence in those four 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.119
 meters well, you could see some 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.030
 white tires 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.680
 18 inch serial comes 16 and has 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.550
 seen that everything is matching that the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.590
 mirrors the roof 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.150
 the own high ones are of a white color 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.910
 Well, the truth is that there 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.950
 configured this chapo unit because what 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.410
 has done phenomenally and inside since 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.730
 you see we are at the top of the range 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:36.300
 look where you see elements that are 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:39.250
 from a multifunction steering wheel in leather 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.430
 perforated with borders in red 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.560
 to a browser that has this style of 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.360
 read that changes color depending as 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.360
 For example, it has three modes of 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.960
 Driving green medium and sport and going to 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.280
 see for example how the light changes if 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.830
 we put the drier mode because it gets 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.980
 green if we go in the normal in the same 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.410
 it's yellow and if we bet on red 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.840
 which is the sport, well, well, here 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.110
 accelerations are more compelling and the 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.640
 truth is that the engine works very well 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.610
 but not only because it works very well 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.670
 but in this unit we assemble the 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.650
 automatic sports change this change 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.810
 automatic sports is worth just 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.910
 experience in your little euros more than the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.489
 normal automatic change and has this 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.070
 way that the truth produces a 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.260
 feeling when driving a 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.200
 acceleration and a pretty reaction 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.660
 quite more reactive so to speak 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.000
 worth the redundancy that an engine if there 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.670
 a normal automatic change 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.540
 I also want you to look good you should 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.940
 say the price 27,650 euros 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.800
 this engine and this matiko championship 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.680
 series not with the automatic change over 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.980
 1800 euros more forgiveness 27 250 is for you 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.770
 my five- seater manual to europe back and 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.820
 you'll see how good the rear seats 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.350
 they are pretty quite compressed at 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.480
 better on the sides you can go more or 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.420
 less but the central square also with 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.850
 that armrest that's there or there 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.390
 be the repose of drinks the truth is 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.569
 that it's not a good idea to bring in the 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.180
 entry plaza 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.340
 more things I can tell you 278 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.039
 liters of boot at last a mini well 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:27.270
 a more or less decent boot is more 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:29.550
 small than those of all of their almost 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.009
 all your rivals but good is something 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.660
 more than more coherent management follows 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.720
 being mini is still that the sky 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.490
 for example to this double glove box that 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.620
 As you see, it hardly fits anything but good 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.930
 remains true to that I also want 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.639
 get used to the idea that a car 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.139
 four meters I want you to see that you can 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.990
 bring it latest technology and in 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:52.229
 security this button here you will see 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.449
 that if we press it right away we see that 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.789
 has the collision warning and is 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.789
 activated and has also the novelty 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:04.979
 notice of the presence of pedestrians from day 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:07.620
 in case the visibility conditions do not 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.280
 they are the best and you decide well 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.889
 well 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.410
 let's say it's a plus of security and 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.150
 and of responsibility above all for the 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.190
 rest of the occupants of the road and 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.290
 of the and the way 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.270
 we are missing the professional browser 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.340
 also it is to stop the party so 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.040
 this unit is around 10,000 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.870
 euros mounted on extras and there is no shortage of 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.070
 cams for the automatic change do not we 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.500
 lack cruising speed 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:36.040
 adaptive you have all the information in 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:39.190
 in that in that little display where 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.630
 no lack absolutely nothing worth 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.610
 sorry man if you have the money 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.160
 Of course it's worth a car 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.570
 this feels very nice the 170 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.260
 horses allow you an acceleration 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:52.030
 fantastic super fast and especially 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.770
 let's say that the driving touch is not 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.720
 as extreme as the mini three doors the 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.090
 difference are 16 17 centimeters 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.770
 between one and another and is much more nervous 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.390
 three doors this five doors follows 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.760
 being a mini is still nervous 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.530
 still reactions as very 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.330
 well, very car kart car 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.740
 but stuck to the ground but it's a 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.360
 little bit more stable than the three doors 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.770
 then what produces you is a 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.380
 driving feeling much better 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.720
 because he still has that sportiness 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.090
 has a little more stability and 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.810
 more than rational feeling so 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.940
 say it as you see I am giving very fast 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.590
 it's a passion what I feel about this and 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.130
 with if I would be talking hours and hours of 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:32.170
 this mini five doors is cooper sd 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.760
 but this video is going to end here already 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.380
 you know that if you want to know all the 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.630
 excess the extensive analysis we do 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.370
 it is always on portal coches.net page 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.420
 reference web to the world the engine and 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.280
 you know that and you will find the 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.720
 analysis of your favorite cars or
