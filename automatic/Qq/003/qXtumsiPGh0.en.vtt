as<00:00:00.410> you<00:00:01.410> can<00:00:01.650> see<00:00:03.560> the<00:00:04.560> edges<00:00:04.890> that<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.759> the

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
as you can see the edges that the the

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.520 
as you can see the edges that the the
binding<00:00:07.259> didn't<00:00:07.620> turn<00:00:07.830> out<00:00:08.780> quite<00:00:09.780> as<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.380> had

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
binding didn't turn out quite as I had

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.749 
binding didn't turn out quite as I had
planned<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:11.490> just<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.809> tape<00:00:13.080> wasn't<00:00:13.759> nearly

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
planned it just the tape wasn't nearly

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.390 
planned it just the tape wasn't nearly
sticky<00:00:15.240> enough<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.960> just<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.859> just<00:00:17.130> ran<00:00:17.369> up

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
sticky enough and it just it just ran up

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.510 
sticky enough and it just it just ran up
under<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:19.109> what<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.560> means<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.010> now<00:00:20.250> I'll

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
under it so what that means is now I'll

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.500 
under it so what that means is now I'll
have<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.910> extend<00:00:21.890> the<00:00:22.890> stain<00:00:23.250> all<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.060> way<00:00:24.210> out

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
have to extend the stain all the way out

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.900 
have to extend the stain all the way out
to<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.869> edge<00:00:25.080> like<00:00:25.830> like<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.910> guy<00:00:27.240> basically

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
to the edge like like this guy basically

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.750 
to the edge like like this guy basically
and<00:00:30.470> so<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.890> think<00:00:32.700> as<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.840> precaution<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.950> might

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and so I think as a precaution I might

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.119 
and so I think as a precaution I might
get<00:00:35.940> some<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.329> liquid<00:00:36.570> latex<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:39.050> a

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
get some of this liquid latex and a

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.690 
get some of this liquid latex and a
paintbrush<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.969> run<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.930> at<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.309> side

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
paintbrush and just run the at the side

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.100 
paintbrush and just run the at the side
of<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.180> paintbrush<00:00:45.719> along<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.590> outer<00:00:46.950> edge

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
of the paintbrush along this outer edge

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.500 
of the paintbrush along this outer edge
just<00:00:49.110> flush<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.520> corner<00:00:51.289> like<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.620> and

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
just flush with the corner like that and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.270 
just flush with the corner like that and
then<00:00:54.510> let<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.750> dry<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.800> way<00:00:55.980> when<00:00:56.250> I

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
then let it dry and that way when I

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.819 
then let it dry and that way when I
start<00:00:56.789> staining<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> q-tip<00:00:58.079> right<00:00:58.350> here

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
start staining with the q-tip right here

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.710 
start staining with the q-tip right here
it<00:00:59.399> won't<00:01:00.859> be<00:01:01.859> able<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.239> go<00:01:03.420> around<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
it won't be able to to go around and

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.480 
it won't be able to to go around and
stain<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.049> side<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.340> know<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
stain the side of the you know the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.850 
stain the side of the you know the
actual<00:01:08.970> back<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.420> neck<00:01:09.689> because<00:01:10.560> that

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
actual back of the neck because that

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.820 
actual back of the neck because that
latex<00:01:11.369> will<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.850> there<00:01:12.140> so<00:01:13.140> even<00:01:13.409> if<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.619> did

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
latex will be on there so even if I did

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.399 
latex will be on there so even if I did
get<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.100> too<00:01:14.280> runny<00:01:14.840> it<00:01:15.840> would<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.200> get<00:01:16.350> on

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
get it too runny it would just get on

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.820 
get it too runny it would just get on
the<00:01:16.650> latex<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.400> then<00:01:17.490> when<00:01:18.060> I'm<00:01:18.210> done<00:01:18.830> I'll

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
the latex and then when I'm done I'll

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.830 
the latex and then when I'm done I'll
I'll<00:01:20.369> pull<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.759> later<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.570> know<00:01:21.689> I'll<00:01:21.810> just

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
I'll pull that later you know I'll just

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.670 
I'll pull that later you know I'll just
rub<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.380> latex<00:01:23.009> it'll<00:01:23.340> come<00:01:23.549> right<00:01:23.580> off<00:01:24.680> so

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
rub that latex it'll come right off so

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.249 
rub that latex it'll come right off so
that's<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.369> looks<00:01:29.329> it<00:01:30.329> looks<00:01:30.570> okay<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.200> just

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
that's it it looks it looks okay it just

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.679 
that's it it looks it looks okay it just
looks<00:01:31.590> kind<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.070> crappy<00:01:32.310> right<00:01:33.210> now<00:01:33.420> because

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
looks kind of crappy right now because

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.510 
looks kind of crappy right now because
the<00:01:33.840> edges<00:01:34.290> are<00:01:34.579> we're<00:01:35.579> all<00:01:35.750> irregular<00:01:37.520> but

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the edges are we're all irregular but

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.340 
the edges are we're all irregular but
once<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.820> get<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.210> done<00:01:39.509> it'll<00:01:39.869> look<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.170> lot

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
once I get that done it'll look a lot

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.609 
once I get that done it'll look a lot
better<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:41.119> still<00:01:42.119> don't<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.329> these<00:01:42.689> inlays

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
better I still don't like these inlays

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.920 
better I still don't like these inlays
way<00:01:44.009> up<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.430> top<00:01:44.759> like<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.420> wish<00:01:45.750> they

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
way up on the top like that I wish they

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.660 
way up on the top like that I wish they
had<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.200> put<00:01:46.439> standard<00:01:46.979> ones<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> middle

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
had just put standard ones in the middle

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.969 
had just put standard ones in the middle
I<00:01:48.229> don't<00:01:49.229> know<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.350> guess<00:01:49.530> they're<00:01:49.710> trying<00:01:49.740> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
I don't know I guess they're trying to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.499 
I don't know I guess they're trying to
do<00:01:50.159> new<00:01:50.700> things<00:01:52.189> if<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.430> could<00:01:53.579> wave<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> wand<00:01:54.180> I'd

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
do new things if I could wave a wand I'd

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.069 
do new things if I could wave a wand I'd
remove<00:01:55.020> them<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:56.240> put<00:01:57.240> real<00:01:57.540> ones<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.960> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
remove them and put real ones in the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.810 
remove them and put real ones in the
middle<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.560> think<00:01:59.009> what<00:01:59.369> I'm<00:01:59.460> going<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.610> do<00:01:59.700> is

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
middle I think what I'm going to do is

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.230 
middle I think what I'm going to do is
buy<00:01:59.939> some<00:01:59.969> decals<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.259> stick<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.310> you

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
buy some decals and stick in the you

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.080 
buy some decals and stick in the you
know<00:02:03.329> fake<00:02:03.659> fret<00:02:04.530> markers<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.579> just<00:02:05.820> stick

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
know fake fret markers and just stick

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.630 
know fake fret markers and just stick
where<00:02:06.420> they<00:02:06.540> should<00:02:06.810> be<00:02:07.039> leave<00:02:08.039> these<00:02:08.280> alone

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
where they should be leave these alone

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.660 
where they should be leave these alone
just

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
just

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.510 
just
let<00:02:10.390> it<00:02:10.509> be<00:02:10.660> I<00:02:10.930> don't<00:02:11.110> know<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:12.750> don't<00:02:13.750> know<00:02:14.520> I'll

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
let it be I don't know I don't know I'll

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.230 
let it be I don't know I don't know I'll
put<00:02:16.210> another<00:02:16.330> one<00:02:16.690> on<00:02:16.780> this<00:02:16.960> side<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.910> kind<00:02:19.150> of

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
put another one on this side to kind of

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.740 
put another one on this side to kind of
mirror<00:02:20.110> image<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:22.030> that's<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.420> result

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
mirror image it so that's the result

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.900 
mirror image it so that's the result
right<00:02:22.930> now<00:02:23.110> I'll<00:02:23.500> do<00:02:24.070> another<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.700> know<00:02:24.790> I'll

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
right now I'll do another you know I'll

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.810 
right now I'll do another you know I'll
film<00:02:25.240> it<00:02:25.330> again<00:02:25.860> once<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:26.980> actually<00:02:27.220> get<00:02:27.610> the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
film it again once I actually get the

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.020 
film it again once I actually get the
stain<00:02:28.150> all<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.510> way<00:02:28.600> out<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.050> edge

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
stain all the way out to the edge

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.950 
stain all the way out to the edge
that'll<00:02:31.030> look<00:02:31.180> better<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.600> mean<00:02:31.720> it'll

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
that'll look better I mean it'll

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.290 
that'll look better I mean it'll
basically<00:02:32.110> look<00:02:32.560> kind<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:32.950> like<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.300> but

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
basically look kind of like that but

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.300 
basically look kind of like that but
even<00:02:34.720> without<00:02:35.080> those<00:02:35.440> little<00:02:35.740> chip<00:02:35.980> mark

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
even without those little chip mark

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.520 
even without those little chip mark
looking<00:02:36.670> things<00:02:36.970> there<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:38.050> mean<00:02:38.350> it's

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
looking things there that I mean it's

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.490 
looking things there that I mean it's
not<00:02:38.680> really<00:02:39.010> totally<00:02:39.459> black<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:41.020> can<00:02:41.170> see<00:02:41.200> the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
not really totally black you can see the

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.920 
not really totally black you can see the
difference<00:02:41.860> between<00:02:42.060> how<00:02:43.060> black<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:43.570> and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
difference between how black it is and

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.460 
difference between how black it is and
how<00:02:44.020> black<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.440> pickup<00:02:44.800> is<00:02:45.990> but<00:02:46.990> I<00:02:47.020> think<00:02:47.320> it

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
how black the pickup is but I think it

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.620 
how black the pickup is but I think it
you<00:02:47.770> know<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:48.220> think<00:02:48.459> it's<00:02:48.700> gonna<00:02:48.850> look<00:02:49.030> nice
