00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.980
 i'm half-nun sergey let's say that time 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.920
 doing different things and what i do 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.190
 now represent synthesis up big 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.430
 Seen this of what I once did 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.199
 what I met there and so on with 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.869
 childhood engaged in wrestling yes 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.779
 then I studied myself and combat sambo then 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.090
 and karate and wushu and everything found light after 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.789
 the meeting with the laurel 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.619
 Kadochnikov 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.260
 Kadochnikov Alexei Evseich let's say 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.149
 slightly gave a different direction we long 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.390
 collaborated with him there and so on then 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.450
 with many let's say that by ear can 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.829
 which someone doesn't know it and 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.920
 Miroshnichenko Evgeny expects and 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.520
 On Makarov Sergei Stanislavovich and you this 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.690
 system then I Miroshnichenko 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.399
 what kind of master longtime claude 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.100
 called retyunsky alexander ivanich yes 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.379
 this growth we are old let's say so 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.270
 such friends laurels alexander leonidovich 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:10.710
 it is a flurry then many many others yes 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:12.990
 plus I worked for a long time since school 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.960
 networks on and learned a lot in principle from 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.570
 children themselves children are the biggest 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.000
 teachers and they can learn much 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.920
 more than even some famous 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.200
 masters yes and 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.330
 networks on you can remember michael 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.460
 Petrovich before her around to school was 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.890
 a lot of people who came 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.439
 who gave something to open something 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.350
 new there and so on here is what i give 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.729
 it is a synthesis of everything plus is needed here 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.860
 remember the ganze on which being say 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.619
 so by education physicist he defended 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.439
 doctorate in psychology yes that is his 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.329
 on developing systems thinking 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.670
 system perception of the world 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.119
 then Nikolay's trump cards too now 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.700
 the late astrophysicist and then there are hundreds of him 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.530
 development by 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.310
 directly interacting time and 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.590
 energy yes well and need to remember all 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.140
 physiologists probably 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.120
 one plus school kadochnikova who 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.970
 there was a time when Kuban 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.840
 Academy of Physical Education and 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.790
 laboratory who headed 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.940
 Vishnevetskii also now deceased 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.220
 sergey yes this one all taken together 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.440
 aggregate and to this aggregate i 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.610
 added what he put on 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.290
 mathematical coordinate axis on 4 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.019
 precision hanse he imposed gold 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.599
 cross section and superimposed two eights 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.519
 horizontal and vertical and 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.709
 get a complete picture let's say the world 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.170
 and alexander leonidovich all these 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.799
 developments one way or another mentioned his 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.180
 the book 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:49.250
 heavenly mechanics yes there are many 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.360
 download programs like 40 days from me 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.459
 up to 40 days but it's true to start every 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.560
 40 seconds we have a reboot yes 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.950
 every 40 minutes we are fully conscious 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.140
 before rebooting goes and goes to 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.150
 physical level every 40 hours too 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.599
 there is a reboot every 40 days is coming 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.269
 also reloads completely up to say 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.620
 so physiology well and in 40 years goes 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.230
 full reboot 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.600
 at the cellular level even up after 40 years 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.910
 you only have 8 firstborn 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.400
 original cell is more than anything you do not 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.400
 It remains from the fact that we have come with 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.889
 let's say so in this color and therefore also 40 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.290
 days in 40 hours in 40 minutes and so 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.709
 then you can do so many things 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.169
 when you do something you will 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.780
 train there and so on need about 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:40.549
 remember this here these 40 minutes what 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.690
 do let's say some movement 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.489
 which well one way or another lined up 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.669
 one design yes then it goes 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.160
 fixing at the level of your muscles if you 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.109
 40 days doing this darta goes there in 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.419
 pinning literally at organ level 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:04:02.660
 and fabrics already but this is again the people 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:04.669
 always known for up to 40 days there is a wake there and 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.000
 so on why because in 40 days 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:12.230
 still stored information about the person on 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.450
 earthly plan and information let's say 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.709
 this is again proven by scientists when 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.220
 put molecules 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.959
 dna shielded tube then 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.680
 molecules cleaned the information they 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.789
 40 days are saved so here it is 40 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.270
 again 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:33.840
 if you etymology of the word look it 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:37.830
 the term that is the term for which something 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.229
 happens so here is this moment i like 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.400
 would put it again means what we will 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:47.130
 to be engaged yes already many even who 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.560
 first time to think what it is 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.060
 there shamanism something incomprehensible what 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.500
 energy there and so on and so 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:58.229
 like really all spawn 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.080
 our consciousness and doubts on this 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:04.199
 about the birth of our consciousness too 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.389
 let's say well and immediately we will 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.490
 do exactly what we will learn 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.380
 you need to manage your mind first 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.389
 learn to manage your mind a 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.849
 then expand it to some 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.150
 other areas are the easiest to learn 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.620
 control your mind through the body 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.560
 when we manage our mind through 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.630
 body our body becomes good 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.159
 honed tools of our mind 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:31.460
 Yes, I can already be controlled through the body 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:34.380
 let's say so need consciousness 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.370
 let's say other people yes and so on if 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.259
 they somehow join us 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.870
 so we will begin exactly through 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:44.969
 descending and ascending flows yes through 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.710
 correctness of the movement start him 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:49.380
 chase the mind through your body 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.840
 learn to control first in the body then 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.729
 let's start and now let's say so in 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.039
 near its space yes it is 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:59.849
 space on the outstretched hand here and 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:02.789
 here yes but this is no energy there 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.650
 in its pure form and then they talk a lot about 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:06.870
 no contact no contact no 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.080
 there is just a term without 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.780
 contact is actually full contact 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.699
 up contact on four levels except 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.710
 the physical there is still going mental 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.960
 contact social contact and spiritual 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.719
 contact yes only drive this 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.669
 quaternary interaction yes you can 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:25.949
 physically reduce to 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.580
 let's say work at the level of their muscles 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:30.099
 not touching partner 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.800
 kind of attacks are contracts and powerful 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:36.189
 such content and intermedit let's say so in 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.469
 some shamanic things not being 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:40.870
 spiritually unprepared that is you 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:41.590
 there must be such a spiritual core and not 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.289
 know you should 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.740
 forty years to live a monastery after that 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:49.409
 may be 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.409
 it will be permissible to enter those layers
