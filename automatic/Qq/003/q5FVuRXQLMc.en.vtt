00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.380
 not everyone says I'm funny 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.630
 teacher pupils here are children so 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.770
 speak and I myself but hard myself 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:46.530
 estimate probably the truth of the force down for sure 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.620
 Here's the approach such that it is that I always 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.690
 I try to understand how the student thinks 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.370
 there is now straight climb inside me this 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.230
 it is interesting to understand how would you why so 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.710
 decided why it is not so easy 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.210
 imposes its own namely to trace 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.220
 is the only course it is hard to 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.020
 in group because there are several of them, but we have 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.790
 up to five people that is just me 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.250
 Enough energy for everyone 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.070
 follow what he thinks so I for 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.810
 opened myself like this and with experience 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.540
 Naturally you already know all the mistakes ahead 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.310
 that is, almost now 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.240
 so here it is right all this is wrong 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.830
 know it and how to prevent it 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.470
 Of course some kind of technique was developed. 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.130
 that is, the order in which is better 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.050
 explain 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.830
 but he doesn't care for every student 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.830
 happens different 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.110
 young teachers are more energetic and 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.200
 this is probably the most important thing so what 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.150
 they still have such a spark not alive 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.950
 all more mature teachers and then 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.480
 have they already get tired to 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.380
 certain mid but not before much 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:02.860
 many hours new learners and naturally 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.660
 there is no longer this lively approach young 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:12.460
 teacher is a lot of energy it 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:13.780
 much creativity it's great we are more 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.930
 we are attentive 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.880
 I think I know what school has 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.130
 good teachers but practice 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.800
 shows that somehow here carefully 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.140
 sometimes miss a very good child 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.720
 for example the level is actually a4 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.730
 somehow misses it doesn't notice and in 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.940
 in the end he sits himself in the corner 1 nobody and 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.720
 down does not touch and does not develop this 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.720
 it hurts 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.879
 now answering what's needed here 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.739
 meet certain limits is given 7 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.720
 days definitely yes i like for example we want 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.680
 2 spent all of us during these seven days 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.790
 purposefully 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.620
 go and here is the very principle of difference 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.890
 between the main lessons and the fact that 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.519
 going on intense holidays then and 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.980
 such a vector is set and there is a finish once all 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.349
 passed this very home even to see 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.750
 how do you find work 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.370
 going on with you and so this force is over 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.680
 responsibly in this regard 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.959
 directly enter almost all of them about 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.670
 ready to come sit 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.670
 every day they do everything there 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.150
 five 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.689
 I guess that's why I came here 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.760
 the very first was that young 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:52.769
 I immediately liked the team 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.079
 collective and all people interesting to each 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.239
 personality comes out that you can sit there 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.230
 talk for hours 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.500
 social science 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.629
 date brother survived the physicist told as 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.549
 work quartz watch I'm not for so much 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.250
 all the interesting things you just sit and 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.590
 it really is great for you that all 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.829
 how would the guys smart of seven have anything 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.829
 to talk 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.250
 at 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.740
 that is, the whole pair need to move somehow 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.960
 focus focus yes and 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.730
 calm at the same time immediately beforehand 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.660
 calm down because in the spring will 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.300
 such a panic 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.300
 now I need to direct myself now
