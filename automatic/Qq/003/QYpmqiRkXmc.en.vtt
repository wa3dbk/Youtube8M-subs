00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
right into the buoy and I came to a

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.500 
right into the buoy and I came to a
complete<00:02:24.890> stop<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.700> came<00:02:26.030> up<00:02:26.180> on<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.360> other

side of the buoy and it was a whole

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.930 
side of the buoy and it was a whole
controversy<00:02:30.080> they<00:02:30.620> initially<00:02:31.099> disqualified

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
controversy they initially disqualified

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.509

me but that was silly and there's a lot

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.390 
me but that was silly and there's a lot
of<00:02:34.580> politics<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.269> was<00:02:35.420> involved<00:02:35.900> but<00:02:36.010> I<00:02:37.010> did

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400

I'm sure it'll be policed properly and
everything<00:06:39.510> but<00:06:39.720> I<00:06:39.780> think<00:06:39.900> it's<00:06:40.230> the<00:06:40.950> race<00:06:41.130> is

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
everything but I think it's the race is
