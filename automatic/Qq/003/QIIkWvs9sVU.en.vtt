out<00:01:00.089> the<00:01:00.180> claws<00:01:00.360> you've<00:01:00.869> got<00:01:01.019> to<00:01:01.110> have<00:01:01.259> the

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
out the claws you've got to have the

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.649 
out the claws you've got to have the
face<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.400> the<00:01:02.460> colors<00:01:02.790> and<00:01:02.909> the<00:01:02.970> costumes<00:01:03.180> I

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
face and the colors and the costumes I

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.060 
face and the colors and the costumes I
guess<00:01:03.900> the<00:01:04.019> best<00:01:04.140> way<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.350> describe<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.890> in

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
guess the best way to describe it in

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.710 
guess the best way to describe it in
terms<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.790> something<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:06.509> would<00:01:06.630> do

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
terms of something that you would do

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.999 
terms of something that you would do
practically<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.350> almost<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:07.710> making<00:01:07.920> them

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
practically it's almost like making them

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.649 
practically it's almost like making them
out<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.130> chicken<00:01:08.430> wire<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:09.119> start<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.420> maybe

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
out of chicken wire we start with maybe

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.319 
out of chicken wire we start with maybe
a<00:01:09.780> cube<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.860> start<00:01:11.159> extruding<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.759> arms<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
a cube we start extruding the arms and

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:14.450 
a cube we start extruding the arms and
the<00:01:12.390> legs<00:01:12.450> out<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.079> the<00:01:13.170> cube<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.619> we<00:01:13.950> mold<00:01:14.280> it

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the legs out of the cube and we mold it

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.270 
the legs out of the cube and we mold it
until<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.030> looks<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:15.810> normally<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.950> take

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
until it looks like normally and I take

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.969 
until it looks like normally and I take
the<00:01:17.430> model<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.090> unwrap<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.770> can

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
the model and I unwrap it so that we can

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.219 
the model and I unwrap it so that we can
put<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.310> colors<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.030> make<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:22.200> a

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
put it colors on it make it have a

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.319 
put it colors on it make it have a
texture<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.610> actually<00:01:23.790> looks<00:01:24.180> like

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
texture so that it actually looks like

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.110 
texture so that it actually looks like
the<00:01:24.479> cab<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:25.350> send<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> model<00:01:26.130> back<00:01:26.939> to

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
the cab we send the model back to

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.140 
the cab we send the model back to
Donovan<00:01:27.570> Donovan<00:01:27.780> will<00:01:28.440> take<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.370> put<00:01:30.090> it

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
Donovan Donovan will take it and put it

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.890 
Donovan Donovan will take it and put it
on<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.570> skeleton<00:01:31.260> so<00:01:31.440> we<00:01:31.710> really<00:01:32.570> here<00:01:33.570> tend

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
on the skeleton so we really here tend

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.840 
on the skeleton so we really here tend
to<00:01:33.990> play<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.560> game<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.830> hot<00:01:35.100> potato<00:01:35.430> where<00:01:35.700> one

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
to play a game of hot potato where one

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.670 
to play a game of hot potato where one
person<00:01:36.210> does<00:01:36.360> one<00:01:36.600> piece<00:01:36.840> Constance<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.560> off

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
person does one piece Constance it off

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.030 
person does one piece Constance it off
to<00:01:37.770> somebody<00:01:37.950> else<00:01:38.240> bounces<00:01:39.240> back<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:40.040> that's

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
to somebody else bounces back and that's

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.230 
to somebody else bounces back and that's
actually<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.340> lot<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.549> fun<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.850> really<00:01:41.909> really

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
actually a lot of fun it's really really

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.800 
actually a lot of fun it's really really
cool<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.350> skin<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.950> sculpted

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
cool to have the the skin the sculpted

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.620 
cool to have the the skin the sculpted
geometry<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.200> Donovan<00:01:46.950> gets<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.220> me<00:01:47.340> and

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
geometry that Donovan gets to me and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.469 
geometry that Donovan gets to me and
then<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.870> have<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.280> put<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> skeleton<00:01:50.909> end<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.330> it

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
then I have to put a skeleton end to it

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.210 
then I have to put a skeleton end to it
and<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.780> really<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.470> has<00:01:52.680> literally<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.190> a

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
bones it's got arm bones like though so

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.020 
bones it's got arm bones like though so
if<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.049> never<00:01:58.170> play<00:01:58.409> with<00:01:58.440> any<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.830> the<00:01:59.030> little

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
action figures it gets a little pole

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.410 
action figures it gets a little pole
like<00:02:02.380> that<00:02:02.560> you<00:02:02.740> can<00:02:02.860> set<00:02:03.040> them<00:02:03.159> up<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:03.670> build

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
like that you can set them up and build

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.570 
like that you can set them up and build
them<00:02:04.540> into<00:02:04.630> different<00:02:04.750> poses<00:02:05.080> so<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.369> process

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
them into different poses so the process

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.950 
them into different poses so the process
when<00:02:07.150> we're<00:02:07.299> actually<00:02:07.420> reaching<00:02:07.900> the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
when we're actually reaching the

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.870 
when we're actually reaching the
characters<00:02:08.350> what<00:02:08.560> we<00:02:08.649> do<00:02:08.770> is<00:02:08.890> very<00:02:09.160> similar<00:02:09.729> to

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
characters what we do is very similar to

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.000 
characters what we do is very similar to
that<00:02:10.569> actually<00:02:11.170> we<00:02:11.319> build<00:02:11.590> an<00:02:11.709> armature

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
that actually we build an armature

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.309 
that actually we build an armature
inside<00:02:12.580> our<00:02:13.000> meshes<00:02:13.390> inside<00:02:13.810> our<00:02:13.930> characters

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
inside our meshes inside our characters

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.710 
inside our meshes inside our characters
that<00:02:15.280> allows<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.819> animators<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.330> actually

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
that allows the animators to actually

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.020 
that allows the animators to actually
move<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.920> pose<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.370> character<00:02:18.760> it's

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
move the and pose the character it's

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.390 
move the and pose the character it's
very<00:02:19.180> much<00:02:19.420> just<00:02:19.630> like<00:02:19.750> building<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.410> little

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
very much just like building a little

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.949 
very much just like building a little
puppet<00:02:21.730> then<00:02:22.120> Donald<00:02:22.450> on<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.630> work<00:02:22.780> together

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
puppet then Donald on that work together

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.770 
puppet then Donald on that work together
to<00:02:23.290> get<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:24.090> skeleton<00:02:25.090> bound<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.660> the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
to get that skeleton bound to the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.870 
to get that skeleton bound to the
geometry<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:26.470> created<00:02:26.800> once<00:02:27.610> the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
geometry that you created once the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.460 
geometry that you created once the
character<00:02:28.569> is<00:02:28.630> actually<00:02:28.959> rigged<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.319> comes

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
character is actually rigged it comes

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.860 
character is actually rigged it comes
back<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.800> me<00:02:29.830> and<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.100> take<00:02:30.250> care<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.870> what's

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
back to me and I take care of what's

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.020 
back to me and I take care of what's
called<00:02:32.020> skinny<00:02:32.650> which<00:02:33.250> is<00:02:33.430> once<00:02:33.610> an<00:02:33.730> armature

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
called skinny which is once an armature

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.080 
called skinny which is once an armature
is<00:02:34.209> put<00:02:34.390> inside<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.810> character<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:36.130> will<00:02:36.730> set

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
is put inside the character I will set

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.330 
is put inside the character I will set
everything<00:02:37.180> up<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.830> will<00:02:38.950> deform

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
everything up so that it will deform

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.220 
everything up so that it will deform
properly<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.000> then<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.480> actually<00:02:40.630> goes<00:02:40.930> back

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
properly and then it actually goes back

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.350 
properly and then it actually goes back
to<00:02:41.380> animation<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.070> our<00:02:42.250> animation<00:02:42.790> team<00:02:43.000> and

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
to animation and our animation team and

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.020 
to animation and our animation team and
they<00:02:43.959> will<00:02:44.140> take<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:44.739> put<00:02:45.670> all<00:02:45.820> the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
they will take it and put all the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.380 
they will take it and put all the
animations<00:02:46.360> on<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:47.640> Wolverine<00:02:48.640> waving<00:02:49.180> and

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
animations on the Wolverine waving and

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.360 
animations on the Wolverine waving and
attack<00:02:49.660> even<00:02:50.019> money<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:50.800> we<00:02:50.920> work<00:02:51.069> out<00:02:51.220> the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
attack even money so we work out the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.940 
attack even money so we work out the
timing<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.480> animation<00:02:52.810> we<00:02:53.260> look<00:02:53.410> at<00:02:53.530> poses

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
timing of the animation we look at poses

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.380 
timing of the animation we look at poses
make<00:02:54.190> sure<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.400> poses<00:02:54.760> are<00:02:54.910> really<00:02:55.120> strong

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
make sure the poses are really strong

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.910 
make sure the poses are really strong
and<00:02:55.660> if<00:02:55.810> they<00:02:55.930> tell<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.260> story<00:02:56.530> of<00:02:56.709> the

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
and if they tell the story of the

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.340 
and if they tell the story of the
animation<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.580> that<00:02:57.700> they<00:02:57.910> are<00:02:58.230> exciting<00:02:59.230> and

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
animation and that they are exciting and

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.960 
animation and that they are exciting and
dynamic<00:02:59.530> to<00:03:00.040> look<00:03:00.190> at<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:00.819> they

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
dynamic to look at and that they

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.640 
dynamic to look at and that they
represent<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.510> character<00:03:01.930> like<00:03:02.200> Wolverine

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
represent the character like Wolverine

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.160 
represent the character like Wolverine
or<00:03:02.860> spider-man<00:03:03.190> or<00:03:03.519> Hulk<00:03:03.700> everybody<00:03:04.630> works<00:03:04.870> so

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
or spider-man or Hulk everybody works so

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.140 
or spider-man or Hulk everybody works so
well<00:03:05.200> together<00:03:05.620> we<00:03:05.950> have<00:03:06.070> a<00:03:06.100> lot<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.310> fun<00:03:06.549> then

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.780 
dev Diaries we talked about art how it
makes<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.709> into<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:11.980> game<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:12.459> how<00:03:12.700> it

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
makes it into the game and how it

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.970 
makes it into the game and how it
affects<00:03:13.060> everything<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:13.810> today<00:03:14.500> we<00:03:14.739> talked

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.299 
us next time we talk about game design
and<00:03:20.140> how<00:03:20.260> we<00:03:20.320> make<00:03:20.560> things<00:03:20.799> fun<00:03:21.090> maybe<00:03:22.090> now
