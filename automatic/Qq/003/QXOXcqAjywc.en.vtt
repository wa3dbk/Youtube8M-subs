00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
and place this in the cage or outside of

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.940 
and place this in the cage or outside of
the<00:01:40.479> cage<00:01:40.630> depending<00:01:41.110> on<00:01:41.200> how<00:01:41.380> friendly<00:01:41.800> your

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
the cage depending on how friendly your

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.010 
the cage depending on how friendly your
Amazon<00:01:42.340> is<00:01:42.520> if<00:01:42.940> he's<00:01:43.150> very<00:01:43.450> friendly<00:01:43.690> and<00:01:43.930> will

Amazon is if he's very friendly and will
come<00:01:44.229> out<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:44.560> can<00:01:44.680> try<00:01:44.860> this<00:01:44.920> out<00:01:45.130> of<00:01:45.310> the

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
come out you can try this out of the

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.160 
come out you can try this out of the
cage<00:01:45.610> go<00:01:46.060> ahead<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.390> do<00:01:46.479> that<00:01:46.630> but<00:01:46.869> if<00:01:46.990> your

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
cage go ahead and do that but if your

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.540 
cage go ahead and do that but if your
bird<00:01:47.380> you<00:01:47.560> can't<00:01:47.770> even<00:01:47.979> take<00:01:48.130> it<00:01:48.250> out<00:01:48.369> of<00:01:48.460> the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
bird you can't even take it out of the

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.460 
bird you can't even take it out of the
cage<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:48.940> can<00:01:49.360> start<00:01:49.600> this<00:01:49.690> process<00:01:49.930> in<00:01:50.290> the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
cage you can start this process in the

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.290 
cage you can start this process in the
cage<00:01:50.649> and<00:01:50.890> use<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:51.250> as<00:01:51.369> a<00:01:51.460> way<00:01:51.610> to<00:01:52.060> get<00:01:52.180> your

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
cage and use it as a way to get your

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.389 
cage and use it as a way to get your
bridge<00:01:52.479> step<00:01:52.780> up<00:01:52.990> what<00:01:53.710> you<00:01:53.830> want<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.040> do<00:01:54.160> is

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:55.859 
bridge step up what you want to do is
literally<00:01:54.700> place<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.240> end<00:01:55.390> of<00:01:55.509> the<00:01:55.570> stick

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
literally place the end of the stick

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.990 
literally place the end of the stick
somewhere<00:01:56.680> where<00:01:56.860> your<00:01:57.009> bird<00:01:57.220> can<00:01:57.580> reach<00:01:57.759> it

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
somewhere where your bird can reach it

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.270 
somewhere where your bird can reach it
and<00:01:58.149> get<00:01:58.600> curious<00:01:58.899> about<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.440> most<00:01:59.770> birds<00:02:00.100> on

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
and get curious about it most birds on

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.100 
and get curious about it most birds on
the<00:02:00.369> first<00:02:00.640> try<00:02:00.940> would<00:02:01.179> be<00:02:01.300> very<00:02:01.630> curious

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
the first try would be very curious

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.440 
the first try would be very curious
about<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.470> stick<00:02:02.710> so<00:02:03.160> let<00:02:03.369> that<00:02:03.399> plane<00:02:03.910> to<00:02:04.330> the

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
about the stick so let that plane to the

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.630 
about the stick so let that plane to the
natural<00:02:04.869> part<00:02:05.259> of<00:02:05.380> your<00:02:05.530> word<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:05.950> just<00:02:06.399> stick

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
natural part of your word and just stick

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.490 
natural part of your word and just stick
it<00:02:06.670> in<00:02:06.880> there<00:02:06.940> when<00:02:07.600> they<00:02:07.690> lightly<00:02:08.020> touch<00:02:08.470> the

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
it in there when they lightly touch the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.090 
it in there when they lightly touch the
tip<00:02:09.009> of<00:02:09.160> stick<00:02:09.459> click<00:02:10.290> like<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.740> give

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
tip of stick click like that and give

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.130 
tip of stick click like that and give
them<00:02:12.250> their<00:02:12.430> favorite<00:02:12.640> treat<00:02:13.030> reward<00:02:13.390> now

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
them their favorite treat reward now

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.240 
them their favorite treat reward now
this<00:02:14.319> should<00:02:14.500> be<00:02:14.590> something<00:02:14.800> that's<00:02:15.069> not

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
this should be something that's not

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.920 
this should be something that's not
always<00:02:15.550> in<00:02:15.850> their<00:02:15.970> diet<00:02:16.180> if<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.600> give<00:02:16.780> your

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
always in their diet if you give your

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.080 
always in their diet if you give your
bird<00:02:17.110> seeds<00:02:17.410> on<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.680> daily<00:02:18.130> basis<00:02:18.490> you<00:02:18.819> need<00:02:18.940> to

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
bird seeds on a daily basis you need to

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.180 
bird seeds on a daily basis you need to
pull<00:02:19.330> those<00:02:19.510> out<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.990> use<00:02:20.260> them<00:02:20.470> strictly<00:02:20.830> for

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
pull those out and use them strictly for

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.309 
pull those out and use them strictly for
training<00:02:21.600> what<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.720> want<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:22.959> teach<00:02:23.140> your

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
training what you want to teach your

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.809 
training what you want to teach your
bird<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.709> basically<00:02:24.220> when<00:02:24.370> he<00:02:24.400> touches<00:02:24.670> the

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
bird is basically when he touches the

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.820 
bird is basically when he touches the
end<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.209> stick<00:02:25.450> he<00:02:25.900> always<00:02:26.110> hears<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.560> click

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
end of the stick he always hears a click

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.160 
end of the stick he always hears a click
which<00:02:27.280> is<00:02:27.459> followed<00:02:27.790> by<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:27.970> reward<00:02:28.450> what<00:02:29.050> your

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
which is followed by a reward what your

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.290 
which is followed by a reward what your
bird<00:02:29.380> will<00:02:29.410> learn<00:02:29.770> is<00:02:30.069> that<00:02:30.459> he<00:02:30.850> can<00:02:31.030> follow

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
bird will learn is that he can follow

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.880 
bird will learn is that he can follow
the<00:02:31.569> stick<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.020> you<00:02:32.140> can<00:02:32.319> direct<00:02:32.590> your<00:02:32.709> bird

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
the stick and you can direct your bird

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.699 
the stick and you can direct your bird
where<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.220> go<00:02:33.340> this<00:02:33.880> is<00:02:33.940> actually<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.709> training

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
where to go this is actually a training

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.290 
where to go this is actually a training
technique<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:36.280> they<00:02:36.370> use<00:02:36.550> for<00:02:36.760> horses<00:02:37.000> to

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
technique that they use for horses to

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.000 
technique that they use for horses to
actually<00:02:37.569> get<00:02:37.720> them<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.050> put<00:02:38.260> themselves<00:02:38.440> in

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
actually get them to put themselves in

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.040 
actually get them to put themselves in
trailers<00:02:39.459> so<00:02:39.880> this<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.120> very<00:02:40.390> great<00:02:40.720> for<00:02:40.870> being

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
trailers so this is very great for being

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.300 
trailers so this is very great for being
able<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.290> get<00:02:41.440> your<00:02:41.500> bird<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:41.770> come<00:02:42.040> out<00:02:42.190> of

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
able to get your bird to come out of

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.790 
able to get your bird to come out of
this<00:02:42.400> cage<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.880> go<00:02:43.599> back<00:02:43.810> in<00:02:44.080> you<00:02:44.530> can<00:02:44.650> also

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
this cage and go back in you can also

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.920 
this cage and go back in you can also
eventually<00:02:45.459> use<00:02:45.819> it<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.209> get<00:02:46.599> the<00:02:46.720> bird<00:02:46.900> to

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
eventually use it to get the bird to

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.720 
eventually use it to get the bird to
walk<00:02:47.349> up<00:02:47.560> on<00:02:47.680> your<00:02:47.860> hand<00:02:48.040> for<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.310> first<00:02:48.550> time

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
walk up on your hand for the first time

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.910 
walk up on your hand for the first time
if<00:02:48.880> your<00:02:49.030> bird<00:02:49.209> doesn't<00:02:49.480> like<00:02:49.599> step<00:02:49.930> up<00:02:49.959> I<00:02:50.319> have

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
if your bird doesn't like step up I have

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.710 
if your bird doesn't like step up I have
a<00:02:50.950> cockatoo<00:02:51.459> who<00:02:51.640> loves<00:02:52.000> this

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
a cockatoo who loves this

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.570 
a cockatoo who loves this
literally<00:02:52.990> won't<00:02:53.350> really<00:02:53.560> step<00:02:53.920> up<00:02:54.100> if<00:02:54.280> I<00:02:54.370> ask

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
literally won't really step up if I ask

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.190 
literally won't really step up if I ask
for<00:02:54.700> two<00:02:54.910> but<00:02:55.120> once<00:02:55.270> I<00:02:55.360> bring<00:02:55.510> up<00:02:55.600> target<00:02:55.990> stick

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
for two but once I bring up target stick

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.840 
for two but once I bring up target stick
she'll<00:02:56.380> do<00:02:56.530> whatever<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.890> want<00:02:57.160> it's<00:02:57.550> just<00:02:57.640> a

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
different mentality when they're in
