 [Music] 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.610
 hello everyone here we are in the part 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.779
 number 7 of the star wars guides 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.390
 battlefront 2 as they see how he hears no 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.369
 listen I think my voice better and be 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.660
 listen better to the audio of all 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.669
 videos that I will upload now of all 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.730
 the guides that I upload as they bought me 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:34.390
 hearing aids with a microphone so it's going to 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.670
 listen much better I believe and good 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.890
 the then that is heard wrong in this 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.739
 video maybe is that I have to see is that 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.010
 the game audio is fine now they are 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:49.040
 with my voice so I'm going to leave this 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.050
 guide to see how it sounds good 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.630
 in the previous part we are in the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.690
 tkacik planet and now we move to 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.760
 pau in an underground ambush the 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.160
 ambush the general of views and his 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.760
 army will be the coup de grace for the 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.810
 dsi wii that is going on break already 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.350
 then we will attack 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.909
 a question for all who play 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.149
 for the front 2 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.770
 1 any of these star wars game 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.299
 is that if they know something about star wars 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.860
 battlefront 3 because I was 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.079
 asking if it's going to come out or not or 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.330
 if it's already gone I do not know is that it's 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:29.049
 looking for things and we do not find anything 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.570
 about that game and they say it should 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.280
 have left 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.500
 but well I know that somebody can 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.510
 inform about the front 3 val 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.390
 I would be very grateful 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.780
 from the command post that is south of 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.430
 execution 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.430
 I'm going to try it differently like this 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.720
 and I do not know how it will be heard in him 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.050
 in the video that you wait 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.819
 are going to drink tea mpm is the post of 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:07.329
 control viewpoint and I still remember 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.329
 I'm a little volume 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:13.290
 before me to me these things as it sounds 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.780
 right with in dominates these guys continue 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.170
 command post we take very well advances 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.030
 down the road and conquer the post 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.939
 of command careful with the forces of 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:42.269
 cscs and I do not know what abbreviations is 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:42.269
 I also know what they know, please tell me 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.239
 and maybe at some point I knew but 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.130
 I forgot with so many games that is 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.050
 player 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.620
 there are many times abbreviations that the 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.620
 I have to learn 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.880
 there 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.880
 the big ones 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.530
 or 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.980
 now it exploded 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.240
 I have a great stay 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.670
 by 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.670
 voice 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.540
 again 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.540
 and think about health and a lot 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.880
 we are going to take this position and I need to go 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.880
 to an rt 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.319
 for those who do not know the star wars 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.040
 battlefront 2 is what happens 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.850
 movie 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.680
 star wars actress 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.959

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.739
 for those who did not know there was what 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.739
 Excellent

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.410
 that already 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.490
 what blue 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.490
 as a stake 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.190
 already 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.400

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.689
 you see that wave 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.039
 it would be sometimes it hits me from nothing 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.860
 and this power serves us 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.010
 there 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.500

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.320
 uy 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:24.030

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.030
 struggle with in general and 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.220
 now well

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.290

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.290
 hangar 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.000
 with laser sword everything makes it simpler 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.930
 Oh 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:22.590

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.590
 destroy generate that generator 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:31.039
 where you say the date is only harassed and 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:34.060
 giant this thing out there giant is not 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.060
 in a lot of player 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.010
 so that it is destroyed 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:51.540
 we do not get the life of this genre ay ay 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.639
 I think it's exploiting explode 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.790
 I walk away better 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:58.770
 and it will not heal 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:03.210
 this is through the expired 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:05.819
 chucho and it seems that the mission was 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.370
 cortita and leave no good here 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:10.909

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.780
 have liked and remember without 

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:14.520
 answer me those two doubts I had 

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.500
 when the bar is going out of the fronton 13 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.560
 is that it will come out or not and that are the 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:23.930
 acronyms of that and that average aggregation 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.930
 rare good until the next goodbye
