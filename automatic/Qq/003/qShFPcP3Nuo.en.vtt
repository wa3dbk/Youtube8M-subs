00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
8100 I think and immediately lost it at

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.770 
8100 I think and immediately lost it at
blackjack<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.720> 20<00:01:22.020> minutes<00:01:22.850> okay<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.600> i<00:01:24.630> was

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
blackjack in 20 minutes okay so i was

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.200 
blackjack in 20 minutes okay so i was
totally<00:01:24.960> broke<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.680> mean<00:01:26.250> well<00:01:26.520> broke<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
totally broke I mean well broke for the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.719 
totally broke I mean well broke for the
real<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.930> vegas<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:30.409> really<00:01:31.409> upset<00:01:31.799> because<00:01:32.460> I

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
real in vegas and really upset because I

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.280 
real in vegas and really upset because I
you<00:01:32.970> know<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.060> thought<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.390> had<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> shot<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.200> I

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you know I thought I had a shot and I

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.050 
you know I thought I had a shot and I
thought<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.560> was<00:01:34.619> really<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.820> know<00:01:35.880> in

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
thought it was really you know in

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.399 
thought it was really you know in
retrospect<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:36.810> she<00:01:36.869> was<00:01:37.079> probably<00:01:37.229> my

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
retrospect is so she was probably my

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.109 
retrospect is so she was probably my
best<00:01:37.619> chance<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.250> win<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.790> main<00:01:39.000> event

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
best chance to win the main event

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.740 
best chance to win the main event
because<00:01:39.560> very<00:01:40.560> few<00:01:40.650> people<00:01:41.070> knew<00:01:41.189> who<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.369> was

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
because very few people knew who I was

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.109 
because very few people knew who I was
so<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.780> flew<00:01:43.290> back<00:01:43.560> home<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.490> played<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.880> was

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
so I flew back home and I played it was

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.760 
so I flew back home and I played it was
