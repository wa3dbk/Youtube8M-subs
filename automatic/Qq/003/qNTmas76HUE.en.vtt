00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:08.029 
really close to home and so it might not

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.970 
really close to home and so it might not
even<00:00:08.180> have<00:00:08.330> to<00:00:08.420> change<00:00:08.960> a<00:00:09.050> lot<00:00:09.140> of<00:00:09.200> things<00:00:09.290> when

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
even have to change a lot of things when

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.650 
even have to change a lot of things when
I<00:00:10.010> come<00:00:10.250> here<00:00:10.370> so<00:00:10.490> I'm<00:00:10.550> settled<00:00:11.090> before<00:00:11.630> I

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
I come here so I'm settled before I

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.990 
I come here so I'm settled before I
start<00:00:12.200> my<00:00:12.290> education<00:00:12.350> I<00:00:12.980> refused<00:00:13.580> to<00:00:13.670> study<00:00:13.880> in

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
start my education I refused to study in

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.359 
start my education I refused to study in
London<00:00:14.060> because<00:00:14.630> it's<00:00:15.260> just<00:00:15.470> ridiculously

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
London because it's just ridiculously

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.290 
London because it's just ridiculously
expensive<00:00:16.730> for<00:00:17.300> everything<00:00:18.100> but<00:00:19.150> Luton<00:00:20.150> is

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
expensive for everything but Luton is

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.950 
expensive for everything but Luton is
not<00:00:21.170> too<00:00:21.350> far<00:00:21.590> from<00:00:21.800> London<00:00:21.920> so<00:00:22.690> it<00:00:23.690> was<00:00:23.840> an

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
not too far from London so it was an

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.460 
not too far from London so it was an
ideal<00:00:24.289> location<00:00:24.850> because<00:00:25.850> it<00:00:26.240> was<00:00:26.510> somewhere

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
ideal location because it was somewhere

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.910 
ideal location because it was somewhere
that<00:00:27.770> was<00:00:27.949> far<00:00:28.310> out<00:00:28.490> and<00:00:28.730> different<00:00:29.210> so<00:00:29.960> it

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
that was far out and different so it

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.889 
that was far out and different so it
would<00:00:31.130> allowed<00:00:31.430> me<00:00:31.640> to<00:00:31.670> stay<00:00:32.029> focused<00:00:32.300> and<00:00:32.689> not

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
would allowed me to stay focused and not

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.160 
would allowed me to stay focused and not
just<00:00:33.199> and<00:00:33.800> get<00:00:34.760> to<00:00:34.910> straight<00:00:35.210> to<00:00:35.390> that<00:00:35.420> home<00:00:35.750> so

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
of it as well the biggest challenge is

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.700 
of it as well the biggest challenge is
probably<00:01:41.140> looking<00:01:42.140> for<00:01:42.320> all<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.590> old

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
stuff like that so because it's really

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.710 
stuff like that so because it's really
old<00:01:48.890> English<00:01:49.280> making<00:01:50.060> sure<00:01:50.240> that<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:50.540> get

they did things and obviously maybe get
connections<00:02:30.239> as<00:02:30.330> well<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.690> get<00:02:30.959> some<00:02:31.080> work

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
connections as well and get some work

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.360 
connections as well and get some work
experience<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.830> because<00:02:32.040> that's<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.250> main

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
experience and because that's the main

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.949 
experience and because that's the main
thing<00:02:32.580> about<00:02:32.610> law<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.060> need<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.330> have<00:02:33.840> the

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
thing about law you need to have the

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.330 
thing about law you need to have the
right<00:02:34.050> connections<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.800> get<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.190> right

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
right connections and get the right

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.979 
right connections and get the right
experience<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:35.970> that's<00:02:36.090> what<00:02:36.270> we<00:02:36.360> try<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:36.840> do

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
experience so that's what we try and do

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.790 
experience so that's what we try and do
because<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.890> nature<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.280> law<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:39.450> think<00:02:39.840> it

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
because of the nature of law I think it

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.960 
because of the nature of law I think it
does<00:02:41.010> prepare<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:41.400> for<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.790> working

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
does prepare you for the working

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.940 
does prepare you for the working
environment<00:02:42.180> because<00:02:43.019> there's<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.769> whole

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
environment because there's a whole

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.820 
environment because there's a whole
range<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.610> jobs<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.569> can<00:02:45.780> do<00:02:45.989> with<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.680> law

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
range of jobs that you can do with a law

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.270 
range of jobs that you can do with a law
degree

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
degree

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.630 
degree
for<00:02:48.180> example<00:02:48.860> journalism<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:50.400> know

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
for example journalism you know

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.350 
for example journalism you know
lecturing<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.860> so<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.489> does<00:02:53.760> prepare<00:02:54.299> you

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
lecturing and so I it does prepare you

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.680 
lecturing and so I it does prepare you
it<00:02:54.810> helps<00:02:55.049> you<00:02:55.140> think<00:02:55.250> critically<00:02:56.250> as<00:02:56.370> well<00:02:56.690> so

making sure that you're ahead of your
studies<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:23.720> just<00:03:24.720> preparing<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.530> for<00:03:25.620> your

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
studies and just preparing you for your

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.560 
studies and just preparing you for your
course<00:03:26.160> as<00:03:26.340> well<00:03:26.519> so<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:26.910> you're<00:03:27.150> on<00:03:27.299> top<00:03:27.540> of

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
course as well so that you're on top of

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.229 
course as well so that you're on top of
it<00:03:27.870> but<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:28.380> think<00:03:28.829> it's<00:03:28.980> mostly<00:03:29.370> down<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:30.120> the

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
it but I think it's mostly down to the

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.090 
it but I think it's mostly down to the
student<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.930> student<00:03:31.079> being<00:03:31.650> prepared

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
student and the student being prepared

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.729 
student and the student being prepared
really<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:32.940> it's<00:03:33.690> not<00:03:33.870> really<00:03:34.260> what<00:03:34.530> the

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
really so it's not really what the

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.650 
really so it's not really what the
course<00:03:35.010> can<00:03:35.280> do<00:03:35.459> for<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.790> it's<00:03:35.940> what<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.450> do

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
course can do for you it's what you do

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.330 
course can do for you it's what you do
for<00:03:36.690> your<00:03:36.959> course<00:03:37.260> for<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:37.890> future<00:03:38.220> I'm
