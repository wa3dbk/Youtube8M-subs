exercises<00:02:33.350> I've<00:02:33.740> ever<00:02:33.920> done<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.420> did<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.960> I

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
exercises I've ever done so I did that I

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.050 
exercises I've ever done so I did that I
would<00:02:36.410> take<00:02:36.590> turns<00:02:36.920> get<00:02:37.460> the<00:02:37.610> three<00:02:37.850> of<00:02:37.940> these

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
would take turns get the three of these

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.320 
would take turns get the three of these
for<00:02:38.570> about<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:39.110> would<00:02:39.980> try<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.460> do<00:02:40.730> six<00:02:41.090> days<00:02:41.180> a

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
for about I would try to do six days a

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.220 
for about I would try to do six days a
week<00:02:41.510> but<00:02:41.690> probably<00:02:42.290> mostly<00:02:42.740> did<00:02:43.010> five<00:02:43.310> and

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
week but probably mostly did five and

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.280 
week but probably mostly did five and
just<00:02:45.230> alternate<00:02:45.830> them<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.940> I<00:02:47.240> just<00:02:47.290> finally

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
just alternate them and I just finally

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.360 
just alternate them and I just finally
were<00:02:48.530> great<00:02:48.770> got<00:02:49.100> rid<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:50.860> quite<00:02:51.860> a<00:02:51.920> bit<00:02:52.160> of

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
were great got rid of quite a bit of

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.730 
were great got rid of quite a bit of
inches<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:52.970> would<00:02:53.000> say<00:02:53.300> I<00:02:53.330> lost<00:02:53.540> about<00:02:53.740> three

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
inches I would say I lost about three

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.980 
inches I would say I lost about three
quarters<00:02:55.100> of<00:02:55.130> an<00:02:55.910> inch<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.240> my<00:02:56.390> waist<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.900> my

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
thighs I must about an inch each but you

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.370 
thighs I must about an inch each but you
have<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.710> be<00:03:00.830> pretty<00:03:01.010> faithful<00:03:01.580> and<00:03:02.080> so<00:03:03.080> from

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
have to be pretty faithful and so from

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.350 
have to be pretty faithful and so from
there<00:03:03.560> I<00:03:03.920> wanted<00:03:04.340> something<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.820> little<00:03:05.090> a

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
there I wanted something a little a

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.570 
there I wanted something a little a
little<00:03:05.960> stronger<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.740> little<00:03:06.950> more<00:03:07.040> cardio

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
little stronger and a little more cardio

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.240 
little stronger and a little more cardio
so<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:09.070> ordered<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.420> p90x<00:03:11.650> which<00:03:12.650> is<00:03:12.860> part<00:03:13.190> of

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
so I ordered the p90x which is part of

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.160 
so I ordered the p90x which is part of
the<00:03:13.430> programs<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:14.000> you<00:03:14.090> might<00:03:14.300> be<00:03:14.450> familiar

with called Beachbody there and a lot of
infomercials<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.130> think<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.490> 90<00:03:19.820> X<00:03:20.000> as

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.870 
infomercials and I think you 90 X as
well<00:03:20.570> but<00:03:21.470> I<00:03:21.530> decided<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.130> try<00:03:22.340> this<00:03:22.430> after<00:03:22.760> I

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
well but I decided to try this after I

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.160 
well but I decided to try this after I
did<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.090> lot<00:03:23.270> of<00:03:23.300> research<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:26.690> kit<00:03:26.900> comes
