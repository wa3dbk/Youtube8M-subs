that<00:00:30.150> big<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> difference<00:00:30.599> but<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.170> like<00:00:31.560> this

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
that big of a difference but I like this

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:32.749

one<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.859> little<00:00:31.980> bit<00:00:32.189> better<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:32.550> I'm<00:00:32.640> just

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
one a little bit better so I'm just

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.750 
one a little bit better so I'm just
gonna<00:00:32.880> probably<00:00:33.149> use<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.510> from<00:00:33.630> now<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.930> um

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.209 
gonna probably use it from now on um
yeah<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.809> CFS<00:00:37.500> kind<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.070> cars

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
yeah so this is the CFS kind of cars

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.790 
yeah so this is the CFS kind of cars
they<00:00:38.430> actually<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:39.290> boxes<00:00:40.290> down<00:00:40.440> they<00:00:40.649> used

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
they actually have boxes down they used

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.319 
they actually have boxes down they used
to<00:00:40.890> have<00:00:41.070> feel<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.520> followed<00:00:41.850> their<00:00:42.000> series

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
to have feel like followed their series

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.639 
to have feel like followed their series
you<00:00:42.660> know<00:00:42.809> they<00:00:42.960> had<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.379> clamshell

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
you know they had like the clamshell

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.209 
you know they had like the clamshell
things<00:00:44.160> which<00:00:44.700> were<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.090> really<00:00:45.390> not<00:00:46.079> very

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
things which were just really not very

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.160 
things which were just really not very
useful<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.489> mean<00:00:47.700> they're<00:00:47.940> hard<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> store<00:00:48.989> and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
useful I mean they're hard to store and

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.260 
useful I mean they're hard to store and
stuff<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.649> they<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.250> didn't<00:00:50.879> look<00:00:50.969> as<00:00:51.149> good

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
stuff and they just didn't look as good

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.689 
stuff and they just didn't look as good
as<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.750> boxes<00:00:52.170> do<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.219> kind<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.460> more

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
as the boxes do so this is kind of more

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.360 
as the boxes do so this is kind of more
like<00:00:53.760> pitstop<00:00:54.510> cars<00:00:54.750> now<00:00:54.930> they<00:00:54.960> look<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:56.129> it

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
like pitstop cars now they look then it

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
in white then red and then there's like

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.930 
in white then red and then there's like
a<00:05:00.720> fuzzy<00:05:00.930> gray<00:05:01.290> line<00:05:01.590> and<00:05:02.070> that<00:05:02.280> just<00:05:02.490> goes<00:05:02.640> all

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
a fuzzy gray line and that just goes all

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.730 
a fuzzy gray line and that just goes all
the<00:05:02.970> way<00:05:03.090> around<00:05:03.270> the<00:05:03.600> sides<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:04.410> all<00:05:04.530> the<00:05:04.650> way

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
the way around the sides and all the way

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.110 
the way around the sides and all the way
around<00:05:05.040> the<00:05:05.130> back<00:05:05.280> so<00:05:05.490> it<00:05:05.580> pretty<00:05:05.760> much<00:05:05.850> just

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
around the back so it pretty much just

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.020 
around the back so it pretty much just
wraps<00:05:06.330> all<00:05:06.570> the<00:05:06.600> way<00:05:06.720> around<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.110> car<00:05:07.320> and

maybe<00:07:12.870> not<00:07:12.960> the<00:07:13.349> best<00:07:13.590> but<00:07:13.830> because<00:07:14.280> there<00:07:15.090> was

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
maybe not the best but because there was

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.850 
maybe not the best but because there was
some<00:07:15.330> really<00:07:15.479> good<00:07:15.659> ones<00:07:15.840> last<00:07:16.080> year<00:07:16.349> Pappas

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 
year but or I mean I've seen it but I

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.499 
year but or I mean I've seen it but I
don't<00:07:24.930> have<00:07:25.139> it<00:07:25.259> so<00:07:26.000> maybe<00:07:27.000> that<00:07:27.240> cars

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:27.509 
don't have it so maybe that cars

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:28.879 
don't have it so maybe that cars
probably<00:07:28.199> it's<00:07:28.440> probably<00:07:28.680> the<00:07:28.740> same

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:28.889 
probably it's probably the same

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:30.439 
probably it's probably the same
qualities<00:07:29.310> this<00:07:29.520> which<00:07:29.729> is<00:07:29.880> actually<00:07:30.030> not<00:07:30.389> bad

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:30.449 
qualities this which is actually not bad

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:32.930 
qualities this which is actually not bad
so<00:07:31.380> yeah<00:07:31.919> definitely<00:07:32.190> recommend<00:07:32.819> getting

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 
so yeah definitely recommend getting

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.170 
so yeah definitely recommend getting
this<00:07:33.150> car<00:07:33.360> you<00:07:33.990> should<00:07:34.099> go<00:07:35.099> get<00:07:35.280> it<00:07:35.430> and<00:07:35.610> yeah
