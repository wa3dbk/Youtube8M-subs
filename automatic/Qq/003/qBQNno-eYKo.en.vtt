00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
important feature to look for on a bait

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.830 
important feature to look for on a bait
holder<00:04:19.800> hook<00:04:20.040> is<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.970> barbs<00:04:21.300> on<00:04:21.480> the<00:04:21.630> side

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
holder hook is the barbs on the side

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.500 
holder hook is the barbs on the side
here<00:04:22.140> this<00:04:22.380> one<00:04:22.590> has<00:04:22.710> two<00:04:23.040> barbs<00:04:23.400> up<00:04:23.580> here<00:04:23.910> one

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
here this one has two barbs up here one

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.270 
here this one has two barbs up here one
down<00:04:24.690> here<00:04:24.930> obviously<00:04:25.110> for<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.710> fish<00:04:25.950> but

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
down here obviously for the fish but

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.120 
down here obviously for the fish but
these<00:04:26.490> two<00:04:26.790> are<00:04:27.060> primarily<00:04:27.750> used<00:04:28.200> when<00:04:29.010> you

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
these two are primarily used when you

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.720 
these two are primarily used when you
slide<00:04:29.370> your<00:04:29.580> worm<00:04:29.790> on<00:04:30.000> it<00:04:30.600> will<00:04:30.840> stay<00:04:31.080> hooked

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
slide your worm on it will stay hooked

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.190 
slide your worm on it will stay hooked
where<00:04:32.730> it<00:04:32.850> is<00:04:32.970> supposed<00:04:33.360> to<00:04:33.480> right<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.110> won't

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
where it is supposed to right it won't

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.050 
where it is supposed to right it won't
slide<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.770> bottom<00:04:34.890> slide<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.730> bottom

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
slide to the bottom slide to the bottom

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.970 
slide to the bottom slide to the bottom
now<00:04:36.270> that<00:04:36.660> size<00:04:36.930> a<00:04:36.960> hook<00:04:37.260> is<00:04:37.410> pretty<00:04:37.710> big<00:04:37.950> so

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
now that size a hook is pretty big so

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.530 
now that size a hook is pretty big so
that<00:04:38.190> would<00:04:38.430> be<00:04:38.550> good<00:04:38.730> for<00:04:38.910> a<00:04:38.970> larger<00:04:39.330> fish

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
that would be good for a larger fish

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.990 
that would be good for a larger fish
like<00:04:39.780> bass<00:04:40.020> walleye<00:04:40.590> pike<00:04:41.100> but<00:04:41.760> if<00:04:41.850> you're

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
like bass walleye pike but if you're

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.370 
like bass walleye pike but if you're
fishing<00:04:42.180> for<00:04:42.360> smaller<00:04:42.780> fish

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
fishing for smaller fish

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.050 
fishing for smaller fish
you<00:04:43.650> should<00:04:43.890> really<00:04:44.040> downsize<00:04:44.700> your<00:04:44.910> hook<00:04:45.030> and

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
you should really downsize your hook and

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.570 
you should really downsize your hook and
what<00:04:45.300> I'm<00:04:45.390> holding<00:04:45.570> up<00:04:45.810> here<00:04:46.110> is<00:04:46.260> a<00:04:46.620> long<00:04:47.040> shaft

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
what I'm holding up here is a long shaft

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.060 
what I'm holding up here is a long shaft
bait<00:04:48.240> holder<00:04:48.630> hook<00:04:48.840> so<00:04:49.380> you<00:04:49.440> can<00:04:49.650> see<00:04:49.830> that

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
bait holder hook so you can see that

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.010 
bait holder hook so you can see that
this<00:04:50.400> hook<00:04:50.610> would<00:04:50.760> be<00:04:50.880> ideal<00:04:51.330> for<00:04:51.390> fish<00:04:51.780> like

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
this hook would be ideal for fish like

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.770 
this hook would be ideal for fish like
sunfish<00:04:52.650> rock<00:04:53.130> bass<00:04:53.400> fish<00:04:54.120> that<00:04:54.330> have<00:04:54.450> smaller

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
sunfish rock bass fish that have smaller

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.170 
sunfish rock bass fish that have smaller
mouths<00:04:55.110> so<00:04:55.590> they<00:04:55.620> would<00:04:56.040> be<00:04:56.190> able<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:56.970> get

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
mouths so they would be able to get

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.670 
mouths so they would be able to get
their<00:04:57.420> mouth<00:04:57.600> around<00:04:57.930> that<00:04:58.080> hook<00:04:58.200> very<00:04:58.440> easily

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
their mouth around that hook very easily

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.160 
their mouth around that hook very easily
but<00:04:59.250> it's<00:04:59.400> got<00:04:59.550> a<00:04:59.580> long<00:04:59.880> shank<00:05:00.360> so<00:05:00.870> that<00:05:01.050> if

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
but it's got a long shank so that if

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.620 
but it's got a long shank so that if
they<00:05:01.350> swallow<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.980> hook<00:05:02.130> halfway<00:05:02.760> you<00:05:03.330> still

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
they swallow the hook halfway you still

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.420 
they swallow the hook halfway you still
have<00:05:03.780> some<00:05:03.990> of<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.170> hook<00:05:04.290> exposed<00:05:04.770> so<00:05:05.100> you<00:05:05.190> can

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
have some of the hook exposed so you can

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.310 
have some of the hook exposed so you can
take<00:05:05.610> the<00:05:05.760> hook<00:05:05.940> out<00:05:06.090> properly<00:05:06.630> so<00:05:07.080> you<00:05:07.170> don't

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
take the hook out properly so you don't

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.780 
take the hook out properly so you don't
want<00:05:07.440> to<00:05:07.530> use<00:05:07.680> a<00:05:07.710> short<00:05:08.070> shank<00:05:08.340> hook<00:05:08.580> when

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
want to use a short shank hook when

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.730 
want to use a short shank hook when
you're<00:05:08.910> using<00:05:09.060> a<00:05:09.360> bait<00:05:09.570> hook<00:05:09.840> for<00:05:10.410> things<00:05:10.650> like

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
you're using a bait hook for things like

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.040 
you're using a bait hook for things like
sunfish<00:05:11.370> so<00:05:11.880> the<00:05:12.030> size<00:05:12.270> is<00:05:12.480> very<00:05:12.540> important

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
sunfish so the size is very important

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.570 
sunfish so the size is very important
and<00:05:13.170> also<00:05:13.290> that<00:05:13.560> it's<00:05:13.680> a<00:05:13.770> good<00:05:13.920> quality<00:05:14.190> hook

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
and also that it's a good quality hook

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.390 
and also that it's a good quality hook
that<00:05:14.700> it's<00:05:14.880> very<00:05:15.060> sharp
