00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.890 
multitasking I've noticed that after the
update<00:00:20.250> it's<00:00:20.609> been<00:00:20.820> pretty<00:00:21.090> good<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.660> been

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900

so you can see that the round use the
moment<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.010> probably<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.580> bit<00:00:26.939> under<00:00:27.300> half<00:00:27.740> you

side-by-side with an iPad I don't have

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.690 
side-by-side with an iPad I don't have
an<00:01:42.180> iPad<00:01:42.479> free<00:01:42.750> anymore<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:44.009> when<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> was

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
an iPad free anymore but when I was

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.749 
an iPad free anymore but when I was
using<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.060> iPad<00:01:45.360> free<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:46.380> feels<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.579> a

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
using the iPad free it feels like it's a

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.789 
using the iPad free it feels like it's a
little<00:01:48.210> bit<00:01:48.329> faster<00:01:48.540> but<00:01:49.020> only<00:01:49.290> by<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> fraction

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
little bit faster but only by a fraction

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.760 
little bit faster but only by a fraction
like<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> fraction<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.939> second<00:01:51.299> faster<00:01:51.770> in

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
like a fraction of a second faster in

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.340 
like a fraction of a second faster in
loading<00:01:53.159> things<00:01:53.340> um<00:01:54.259> and<00:01:56.240> yeah<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:58.020> also<00:01:58.200> I

let's go into um PDF reader is ok so

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.460 
let's go into um PDF reader is ok so
i've<00:03:20.840> been<00:03:20.870> using<00:03:21.410> it<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:21.770> read<00:03:22.010> my<00:03:22.340> cfa<00:03:23.470> books

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
i've been using it to read my cfa books

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.390 
i've been using it to read my cfa books
all<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.190> pdfs<00:03:25.970> are<00:03:26.240> over<00:03:27.110> five<00:03:27.740> megabytes<00:03:28.190> i

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
all the pdfs are over five megabytes i

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.130 
all the pdfs are over five megabytes i
think<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.670> average<00:03:28.790> about<00:03:29.209> eight<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.900> ten

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
think the average about eight to ten

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.470 
think the average about eight to ten
megabytes<00:03:30.700> in<00:03:31.700> size<00:03:31.970> so<00:03:32.750> they're<00:03:32.930> pretty<00:03:33.170> big

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
megabytes in size so they're pretty big

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.960 
megabytes in size so they're pretty big
and<00:03:35.480> i<00:03:36.410> found<00:03:36.680> that<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:36.980> easy<00:03:37.160> PDF<00:03:37.459> is<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:37.820> bit

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
and i found that the easy PDF is a bit

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.590 
and i found that the easy PDF is a bit
laggy<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.540> also<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.959> UM<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:40.850> bar<00:03:41.180> across<00:03:41.480> the

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
laggy and also the UM the bar across the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.670 
laggy and also the UM the bar across the
top<00:03:41.810> with<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.500> ads<00:03:42.650> that's<00:03:43.550> really<00:03:43.880> annoying

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
top with the ads that's really annoying

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.290 
top with the ads that's really annoying
so<00:03:45.680> yes<00:03:45.920> I<00:03:46.130> don't<00:03:46.340> use<00:03:46.489> it<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:46.850> you<00:03:46.970> can<00:03:47.120> see

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
so yes I don't use it and you can see

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.080 
so yes I don't use it and you can see
it's<00:03:47.660> a<00:03:47.870> bit<00:03:48.140> laggy<00:03:48.380> when<00:03:48.739> it<00:03:48.830> comes<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.310> you

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
it's a bit laggy when it comes to you

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.810 
it's a bit laggy when it comes to you
know<00:03:50.120> navigating<00:03:51.080> around<00:03:51.320> and<00:03:51.860> the<00:03:52.250> page<00:03:52.520> and

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
know navigating around and the page and

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.520 
know navigating around and the page and
things<00:03:53.030> like<00:03:53.120> that<00:03:53.180> and<00:03:53.570> I<00:03:53.810> don't<00:03:53.989> like<00:03:54.170> how

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
things like that and I don't like how

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.070 
things like that and I don't like how
you<00:03:55.070> can<00:03:55.220> go<00:03:55.340> beyond<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.970> sides<00:03:56.239> that's<00:03:56.750> I

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
you can go beyond the sides that's I

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.979 
you can go beyond the sides that's I
think<00:03:57.700> yeah<00:03:58.700> like<00:03:59.209> what's<00:03:59.420> this<00:03:59.540> pinkish

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
think yeah like what's this pinkish

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.720 
think yeah like what's this pinkish
thing<00:04:00.260> I<00:04:00.440> think<00:04:00.830> it's<00:04:01.010> for<00:04:01.250> more<00:04:01.520> for

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
thing I think it's for more for

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.090 
thing I think it's for more for
annotations<00:04:02.360> and<00:04:02.570> things<00:04:02.750> like<00:04:02.840> that<00:04:03.100> which

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
annotations and things like that which

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.949 
annotations and things like that which
you<00:04:04.550> know<00:04:04.670> not<00:04:04.910> really<00:04:05.090> that<00:04:05.270> useful<00:04:05.510> for<00:04:05.870> me

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
you know not really that useful for me

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.050 
you know not really that useful for me
because<00:04:06.230> I<00:04:06.260> make<00:04:06.620> my<00:04:06.770> own<00:04:06.800> notes<00:04:07.130> when<00:04:07.940> it

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
because I make my own notes when it

but that's pretty responsive you have to

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.189 
but that's pretty responsive you have to
wait<00:04:31.100> for<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:31.430> text<00:04:31.940> to<00:04:32.060> load<00:04:32.270> probably<00:04:33.169> a

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
wait for the text to load probably a

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.400 
wait for the text to load probably a
second<00:04:33.620> or<00:04:33.710> two<00:04:33.740> like<00:04:34.340> that<00:04:34.840> but<00:04:35.840> I<00:04:36.050> mean<00:04:36.259> it's

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
second or two like that but I mean it's

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.290 
second or two like that but I mean it's
still<00:04:36.440> pretty<00:04:36.740> good<00:04:36.979> the<00:04:37.160> seek<00:04:37.460> time<00:04:37.490> is<00:04:38.000> also

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
still pretty good the seek time is also

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.840 
still pretty good the seek time is also
pretty<00:04:38.509> good<00:04:38.630> too<00:04:38.960> so<00:04:39.229> I<00:04:39.470> think<00:04:39.590> you<00:04:39.850> know

that's<00:04:41.210> to<00:04:41.389> zoom<00:04:41.660> I<00:04:41.990> think<00:04:42.710> you<00:04:42.860> would<00:04:42.979> tap

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
that's to zoom I think you would tap

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.969 
that's to zoom I think you would tap
near<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.699> bottom<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.180> you<00:04:44.630> can<00:04:44.810> slide<00:04:45.199> you

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
near the bottom and you can slide you

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.640 
near the bottom and you can slide you
can<00:04:46.160> then<00:04:46.190> seek<00:04:46.729> that<00:04:47.180> page<00:04:47.509> which<00:04:48.410> is<00:04:48.530> pretty

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
can then seek that page which is pretty

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.740 
can then seek that page which is pretty
good<00:04:48.800> so<00:04:49.039> you<00:04:49.100> can<00:04:49.250> see<00:04:49.370> it<00:04:49.520> takes<00:04:49.639> a<00:04:49.880> second<00:04:50.660> or

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
good so you can see it takes a second or

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.890 
good so you can see it takes a second or
two<00:04:51.220> throw<00:04:52.220> it<00:04:52.280> to<00:04:52.340> load<00:04:52.580> up<00:04:52.789> and<00:04:53.030> it's<00:04:53.840> a
