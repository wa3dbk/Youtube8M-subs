00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.010
 on the screen as you see here is the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.200
 game cover 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.380
 OK 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.530
 from the release date I know it will be 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.030
 the first quarter of 2013 I do not know in what 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.660
 exactly month 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:47.269
 the game you already know what this is about 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:51.449
 set in the space ships aliens 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:53.550
 jose futurists is worth this game try 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.550
 get the most out of the desire 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.480

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.610
 first person nation 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.900
 also many will ask if they have 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.700
 multiplayer mode or not 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.230
 Well yes it has multiplayer mode 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.190
 has new multiplayer and I think they are 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.190
 people against aliens 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.450
 and also has players who are going to 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.729
 able to play from 1 to 4 players 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.520
 and I also think that you can use the 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.649
 wiimote 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.700
 the dealer of this game as already 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.049
 very well 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.049
 down on the cover of sega 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.360
 the age that was not a little like 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.360

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.159

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.400
 this is all 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:51.030
 I will try to put some video of 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:55.400
 something of the game this to see if I find 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.400
 somewhere because you see how it is 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.620
 and I think this game is worth it 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.620
 why 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.220
 this type of game I like because 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.220
 this shots and futuristic 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.400
 and good answer here also the price 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.850
 because moment I do not know but I already 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.430
 I'll look and I'll put it 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.430

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.570

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.620
 we can 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.140
 and they argue 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.760
