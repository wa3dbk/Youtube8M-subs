00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.920 
crochets that's really important because
when<00:02:41.510> I<00:02:41.570> turn<00:02:41.720> I<00:02:42.650> can<00:02:43.580> chain<00:02:43.850> 3<00:02:44.210> and<00:02:44.420> turn<00:02:44.660> or

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
when I turn I can chain 3 and turn or

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.740 
when I turn I can chain 3 and turn or
turn<00:02:45.170> in<00:02:45.380> chain<00:02:45.650> 3<00:02:45.980> either<00:02:46.220> way<00:02:46.490> I<00:02:46.520> want<00:02:46.940> 1<00:02:47.180> 2<00:02:47.420> 3

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
turn in chain 3 either way I want 1 2 3

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.730 
turn in chain 3 either way I want 1 2 3
and<00:02:48.700> turn<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:50.270> gets<00:02:50.510> my<00:02:50.690> hook<00:02:50.959> up<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.620> the

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
and turn that gets my hook up to the

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.920 
and turn that gets my hook up to the
level<00:02:52.160> of<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.400> next<00:02:52.790> row<00:02:53.000> ready<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:53.570> work<00:02:53.750> the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
level of the next row ready to work the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.380 
level of the next row ready to work the
next<00:02:54.110> row<00:02:54.470> but<00:02:55.190> I'm<00:02:55.400> going<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.850> count<00:02:56.060> that

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
next row but I'm going to count that

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.380 
next row but I'm going to count that
chain<00:02:56.720> 3<00:02:57.080> turning<00:02:57.530> chain<00:02:57.860> as<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:58.160> stitch<00:02:59.090> so

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
chain 3 turning chain as a stitch so

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.480 
chain 3 turning chain as a stitch so
instead<00:03:00.050> of<00:03:00.140> working<00:03:00.440> into<00:03:00.950> this<00:03:01.100> first

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
instead of working into this first

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.790 
instead of working into this first
stitch<00:03:01.850> here<00:03:01.880> I'm<00:03:02.510> going<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.230> skip<00:03:03.560> that

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
stitch here I'm going to skip that

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.740 
stitch here I'm going to skip that
stitch<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:04.400> work<00:03:04.700> into<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.120> second<00:03:05.540> stitch

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
stitch and work into the second stitch

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.670 
stitch and work into the second stitch
because<00:03:06.020> that<00:03:06.320> chain<00:03:06.650> 3<00:03:07.100> takes<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:08.090> place<00:03:08.390> of

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
because that chain 3 takes the place of

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.310 
because that chain 3 takes the place of
this<00:03:09.680> stitch<00:03:10.490> here<00:03:10.520> so<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.480> will<00:03:11.780> work<00:03:12.110> the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
this stitch here so I will work the
