00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.610
 we could another subject 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.890
 live with marine species 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.030
 It is a satisfaction and a great satisfaction and tonight we are going to 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.030
 take out a trainer's job 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.140
 rubÃ©n berenblum must provide a great collapse of a bridge at once 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.230
 I'm really not so alone April 20 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.420
 it does not matter if they are inside and outside the eu they show up where they will be able to 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.650
 detect perfectly 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.460
 while the diesel city means that what ultimately is 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.050
 well that is going to conquer this way 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.300
 we support everything we want to be repeated 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.930
 we all hope it is repeated 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.960
 hands and feet to the head 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.200
 in the case of dolphins dolphins dolphins understand everything that we 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.540
 we make 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.280
 so regarding the final 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.890
 the dolphin answers the general 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.890
 is the dolphin did well are you going to use the whistle 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.740
 there is no way to remunerate the dolphins the first is to convert a 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.220
 month of its primary reinforcement 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.230
 the second way is called secondary report that does not mean this the 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.800
 entity was shaken by a god channel can toys 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.800
 germany can accompany percent 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.240
 let's sing some bread 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.970
 min 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.850
 we have a preventive medicine program what does this mean 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.810
 preventive medicine covers everything that is medical training with the 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.660
 dolphins 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.080
 much of our time as coaches 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.800
 we talk penetrate within our reach 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.930
 so that they can voluntarily give us 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.240
 blood in our gait like gastric it's about the year 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.490
 let's give any example of what medical training is 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.030
 this news is called breathe ass for those who want the dolphins I'm going to 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.920
 ask who they are that the work to be able to perform them 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.920
 on this track this view 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.889
 and now if we activate a title 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:27.619
 allows world everything is in perfect view 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.499
 many of those who have Mayan names 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:34.019
 for example jr 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.019
 means firefly in Mayan language 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:39.780
 the second phase and that means clarity 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.129
 also in Mayan language 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.170
 this background is not favorite because it means a 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.739
 in Mayan language 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.560
 Daniel Pineda we recognize basically by the shape of the dorsal fin 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.529
 loyal states such as the fingerprint of the human being 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:54.189
 all biologists 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.029
 week or ten days following photographic records of the fins of 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:01.029
 lots of dolphins 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:14.289
 indeed it is a personal passion that the one that ends in faults with that 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.829
 he has been in st 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.909
 beautifully liquefied work to make it one of the best experiences of 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.909
 my life 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.759
 they are not only social 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:36.759
 finally jun 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.259
 to us from times 

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:43.569
 they are definitely workmates who come to do 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.369
 some very very good friends
