00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.069
 years we open the game small spawn 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.290

 just save Folsom attacks there on there 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.780
 it was displayed more clearly in 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.180
 Generally such a thing is let's say 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.280
 pretty handy thing let's storm is quieter 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.160

 put it so on why not 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.920
 put for example 8 because here 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.380
 There is already a limit, that is, for 9 slots 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.150
 in one interface, well, that is 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.340
 the developers themselves decided so because 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.500
 here would be a little stupid then what is here 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.819
 such an interface here will be you 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.190
 vintera healthy run further there you can 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.310
 restriction to do 9 by 9 like this 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.609
 will hang one maximum and as it were on 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.250
