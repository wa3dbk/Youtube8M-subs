00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.770
 hello how about friends of 2 988 in this 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.170
 I am going to teach you how to place the 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.059
 links to save the partner those 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.029
 people who are now a partner 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.120
 but they do not know how to place in the links to their 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.980
 wine &amp; partner then it is very easy and 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.410
 very simple what we are going to do is 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.740
 teach how to place these links and good 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.210
 to start just what you have to 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.149
 to do is go to the page that leaves them in 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.210
 the description to send to this page 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.649
 that is called Tuesday dotcom image and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.190
 just what are we going to do what 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.829
 next we will select the file 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.039
 be it the banner or the background of your channel 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.260
 and obviously they have to be a partner in 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.149
 this case I select a fund with 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.949
 the banner put and the ninths 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.550
 he selected free here where he says he is 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.550
 mapping 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.920
 and let's wait a moment 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.809
 here load the background with the banner or 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.110
 it can be just the banner if they do not want 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.110
 place 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.460
 and we will give the good here to continue 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.720
 and since it is here, it has already loaded me 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.030
 the bottom of my channel and I want to place 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.189
 links then just what 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.340
 let's do is the following let's go 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.580
 to the right and ends where the 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.659
 rectangle let's give it a rectangle and 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.109
 a rectangular option will appear 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.860
 and we are going to lock where we want 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:40.480
 never 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.720
 we can not change the size 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.170
 and once we have modified 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.979
 just here where the url says 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.240
 we put the exact one we want to 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:58.870
 send us in this case would be 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.360
 facebook.com and now the exact link 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.110
 once they are in the exact simply 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.410
 read here in 6 then save 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:13.180
 and they will be the same process for each 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:16.230
 one of the links returns a rectangle 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.830
 and a new rectangle will appear 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.900
 and they lock up 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.170
 the option that they want to be with the 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.170
 link 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.120
 in this case it would be a YouTube channel 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.080
 it would be youtube.com 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.080
 so they do not have to visit 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.130
 and I wanted to save and so do with 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.740
 all links and once they have 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.590
 just finished what they do 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.890
 they go here to the right side and they just 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.160
 dgp york-mets simply double click 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.160
 there 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.340
 and we get a new window in this 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.360
 new window let's go to the tab 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:02.140
 that says html code 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.260
 and we get an HTML code simply 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.630
 copy all the html code please 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.690
 verify well that they copy everything already 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.470
 which is too long and is simply 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.010
 copy 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.250
 and you are directed to your channel as give 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.760

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.510
 and they're going to paste all the code here in this 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.160
 part is worth then stick it here and a 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.690
