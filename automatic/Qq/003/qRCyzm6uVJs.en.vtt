00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hey here from news.de and we are here 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.030
 in London and look at the new one 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.190
 samsung galaxy s four mini on that we 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.420
 just here first time the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.710
 the public presented the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.599
 technical data and also the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.430
 Product images was already available 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.410
 but now we can finally do that 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.189
 hand must say I like that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.230
 really good 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.010
 I've been with the samsung all the time 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.480
 galaxy s 4 worked but must say it 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.369
 is a little big 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.199
 if I have this in hand now 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.579
 I think I'll have a thumb without 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.840
 I do not have to go further up here 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.710
 first move around up there 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.660
 ranzukommen 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.440
 that is here at the device then already 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.530
 a little bit easier and we have 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.879
 here a 4.3 inches qhd super amoled 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.879
 display android 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.030
 to inside 1 15 105 gigahertz 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.780
 RAM gigabyte memory 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.629
 then from gb and 16 gb memory for the 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.730
 user and can then also by means of 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.450
 micro sd cards will be expanded 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.850
 up to 64 gb on the back we have 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.910
 in eight megapixel autofocus camera with 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.110
 Led light front a 1.9 megapixel 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.740
 camera and as a battery you come to 1900 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.259
 commitment 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.330
 let's see how to say who holds the version 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.680
 the smartphone will be in two 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.800
 different versions enter once 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.600
 lte and without the version will be with lte 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.720
 also have nfc 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:36.220
 We also have wlan b / g / n here 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:40.360
 bluetooth 4.0 and the toe said in the 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.310
 Lte version has some features that 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.070
 Of course, there are four mini not the world too 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.140
 the floating touch will travel the 14th 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.770
 but somewhere must be saved and 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.140
 have to say that there would be too great he is 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.409
 Looks like there is a lot of mini on each one 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.060
 case definitely number is smaller and 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.600
 much better in the hand 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.270
 in my opinion , we have the iphone 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.100
 5 and you see it's four mini from 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.000
 the size is almost as big 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.110
 a little bit of freedom a little bit 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.880
 wider and similar in thickness 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.670
 but definitely has a bigger one 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.200
 Display what most likely 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.569
 like it 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.069
 and yes I like it a lot we go 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.780
 briefly around the device around that we 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.360
 have here and a micro usb port 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.450
 volume buttons on the left side and 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.550

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.560

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.260

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.010

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.180
