it's<00:01:56.009> mid<00:01:56.189> range<00:01:56.399> or<00:01:56.640> three<00:01:56.820> point<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.240> not

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
it's mid range or three point but not

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.209 
it's mid range or three point but not
two<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.689> three<00:01:57.899> point<00:01:58.110> there's<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.009> thing

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
two to three point there's a thing

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.539 
two to three point there's a thing
called<00:01:59.250> max<00:01:59.939> shot<00:02:00.479> success<00:02:00.990> put<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
called max shot success put that on and

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.959 
called max shot success put that on and
your<00:02:03.329> file<00:02:03.659> frequency<00:02:04.259> there's<00:02:04.469> foul<00:02:04.969> sliders

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
your file frequency there's foul sliders

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.669 
your file frequency there's foul sliders
whether<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:07.049> reaching<00:02:07.229> foul<00:02:07.560> so

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
whether to reaching foul so

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.740 
whether to reaching foul so
the<00:02:08.799> minimum<00:02:09.549> file<00:02:09.909> friggin<00:02:10.269> so<00:02:10.390> you<00:02:10.629> will

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
the minimum file friggin so you will

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.899 
the minimum file friggin so you will
basically<00:02:11.230> never<00:02:11.590> get<00:02:11.799> a<00:02:11.829> foul<00:02:12.099> which<00:02:12.519> is<00:02:12.670> kind

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
basically never get a foul which is kind

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.979 
basically never get a foul which is kind
of<00:02:12.939> cool<00:02:13.140> that's<00:02:14.140> for<00:02:14.319> your<00:02:14.469> user<00:02:14.799> and<00:02:15.640> then

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
of cool that's for your user and then

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.410 
of cool that's for your user and then
you<00:02:16.989> go<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.260> your<00:02:17.590> computer<00:02:18.209> this<00:02:19.209> is<00:02:19.329> the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
you go to your computer this is the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.690 
you go to your computer this is the
computers<00:02:19.810> sliders<00:02:20.349> and<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.859> can<00:02:21.040> minshot

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
computers sliders and you can minshot

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.250 
computers sliders and you can minshot
success<00:02:22.180> which<00:02:22.390> means<00:02:22.629> that<00:02:22.780> will<00:02:23.019> basically

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
success which means that will basically

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.979 
success which means that will basically
never<00:02:23.709> make<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.950> shot<00:02:24.280> which<00:02:24.519> is<00:02:24.670> kind<00:02:24.849> of<00:02:24.879> cool

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
never make a shot which is kind of cool

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.629 
never make a shot which is kind of cool
I'll<00:02:25.989> put<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.230> on<00:02:26.409> you<00:02:27.099> could<00:02:27.219> put<00:02:27.340> all<00:02:27.519> those

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:27.639 
I'll put that on you could put all those

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.349 
I'll put that on you could put all those
down<00:02:27.849> to<00:02:28.030> zero<00:02:28.299> which<00:02:28.599> you<00:02:29.170> can<00:02:29.939> basically<00:02:30.939> get

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
down to zero which you can basically get

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.149 
down to zero which you can basically get
20<00:02:31.689> be<00:02:31.780> rounds<00:02:32.109> if<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.260> wanted<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.650> or<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:33.010> can

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
20 be rounds if you wanted to or you can

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.879 
20 be rounds if you wanted to or you can
do<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:33.700> know<00:02:33.819> score<00:02:34.230> 150<00:02:35.230> points<00:02:35.409> within<00:02:35.709> a

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:35.889 
do you know score 150 points within a

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.309 
do you know score 150 points within a
four-minute<00:02:36.340> quarter<00:02:36.639> well<00:02:37.329> like<00:02:37.719> I<00:02:37.840> did<00:02:37.989> in<00:02:38.139> a

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
four-minute quarter well like I did in a

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.009 
four-minute quarter well like I did in a
previous<00:02:38.530> video<00:02:38.889> that<00:02:39.069> I<00:02:39.250> showed<00:02:39.489> um<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.959> this

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
previous video that I showed um so this

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.569 
previous video that I showed um so this
is<00:02:41.139> pretty<00:02:41.260> cool<00:02:41.379> pretty<00:02:41.680> easy<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.189> use<00:02:42.400> I

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
is pretty cool pretty easy to use I

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.849 
is pretty cool pretty easy to use I
