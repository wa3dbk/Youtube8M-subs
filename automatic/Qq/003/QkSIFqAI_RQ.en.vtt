right clay that would be probably the

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.400 
right clay that would be probably the

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
only way they could possibly do that

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.650 
only way they could possibly do that
other<00:03:40.340> than<00:03:40.519> that<00:03:40.700> I<00:03:40.970> don't<00:03:41.120> think<00:03:41.299> you<00:03:41.480> caught
