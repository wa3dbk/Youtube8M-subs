 Four days 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.210
 Peep 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:13.990
 ore 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:15.420
 Since the case of dry skin is totally Yappa dry almost Datte around first with lotion 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.750
 Before putting on 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:24.690
 In this way when you are selfish 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:27.810
 Fairly and obtained from the 3GS at some time about 5 minutes to give in the cotton feather-like 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:33.690
 Since it is moisturizing we give in that way 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.040
 In cotton using a whole one from the give and moisturizing 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.270
 The entire Shinobu 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.820
 I will apply makeup c 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:45.190
 A little diagonally upward from the bottom because the care is facing from top to bottom roughly me 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.680
 Head towards 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.890
 Please put the lotion on the outside 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.390
 I will go to latex next time it is over 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.690
 Because it is better to add a little extra 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.060
 Firmly 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.760
 I'll put the 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.750
 And to write a little sequel 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.370
 Because it is easy to get in the skin if put in the whole 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.270
 Cuckle Kurt 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.270
 Salt abuse 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.020
 When I finished putting on the whole 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.130
 Lightly oil with oil 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.970
 I will 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:29.159
 If it is turned off too much at this time, it also causes drying. 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.140
 Because it is good for me 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.500
 Once you a little high by hand so good in their own hands 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.660
 If you hold back 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.660
 It is easy for moisture to enter 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:52.830
 Then I will put on a makeup base 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:58.490
 Contact Even if you're of the fabric because the thing is good and I'll use something that fairly can be released to use this at 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.490
 We use recommended cosmetic items, so we use them 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.659
 Sky foundation 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.719
 not 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.560
 Foundation in the case of a child of dry skin 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.710
 Cream foundation 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.690
 I will go 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.480
 Odekaku Hanger 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.730
 How To 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:21.920
 Extend to the whole from fried put in the wind that 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.150
 Because cream foundation also has covering power 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.560
 As long as it is not so bad 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:34.790
 I don't think this c needs much 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:35.810
 At this time, as well as the milky lotion, slightly against the pores while putting on roughly 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.160
 like 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.340
 From the bottom to the top 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.680
 It struck with a feeling like Komu put a little in hand 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.980
 Maus 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.540
 If it is stretched to some extent , it will be even with tap 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.299
 Without trio of extra oil when the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.299
 Face to make sure there is no unevenness in feeling 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.890
 Because the dry skin owner is quite easy to dry under the eyes 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.220
 The old fande of a woman 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.920
 I will try to extend it firmly 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:16.410
 Wearing a do Once you have 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:19.530
 If you use something that contains a little pearl for the other party you use at this time 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.280
 Even if it was actually dry 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.000
 It looks shiny in perl so I will use it 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.030
 A little item 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.209
 Oh I made a Lily things 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:36.710
 At this time, if it is used as if it is held down for a while without extending horizontally, foundation 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.580
 It is beautiful without 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.580
 I can do it
