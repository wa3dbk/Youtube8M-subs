00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:20.000
 Today I am very annoyed that the lamp 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:23.769
 very different is stronger than usual 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.769
 someone moved them to my room 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.400
 so come down the other day I spoke with mine 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.640
 friend about what a few years ago 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.950
 twitter was not popular i thought i 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.510
 I don't remember when I started sitting there now 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.340
 i use twitter to 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.860
 tell you when and downloaded video and 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.600
 that i'm still alive but when i just 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.670
 started twitter I wrote quite different 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.720
 tweets 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:50.450
 so I decided to share with you my 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:53.180
 funny old tweets probably minutes 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.740
 go for a laptop start with this i 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.170
 made a screen and I did not display 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.840
 dates but consider that they are from 2010 2011 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.650
 before i started the youtube channel 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.299

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.350

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.920

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.159

 superimposed on my blackberry screen typically 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.430

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.130
 time to change the phone and go to the dark 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.750
