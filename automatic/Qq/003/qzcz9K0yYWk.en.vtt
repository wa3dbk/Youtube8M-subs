00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.590 
all-purpose lens for a DX or FX users as
well<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.520> said<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:05.790> got<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.939> great<00:02:06.149> macro

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
well like I said it's got a great macro

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.309 
well like I said it's got a great macro
setting<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.520> it<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> d<00:02:09.239> series<00:02:09.539> so<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.200> a

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
setting and it is a d series so it's a

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.589 
setting and it is a d series so it's a
screw<00:02:10.590> drive<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.280> if<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.610> have<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> d3<00:02:11.970> thousand

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
screw drive so if you have a d3 thousand

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.170 
screw drive so if you have a d3 thousand
or<00:02:12.690> five

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
or five

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.250 
or five
you<00:02:13.480> need<00:02:13.629> to<00:02:13.719> take<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.079> into<00:02:14.230> consideration

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
you need to take that into consideration

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.140 
you need to take that into consideration
since<00:02:15.159> it's<00:02:15.400> not<00:02:15.549> gonna<00:02:15.700> be<00:02:15.760> able<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:15.969> auto

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
since it's not gonna be able to auto

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.539 
since it's not gonna be able to auto
focus<00:02:16.569> on<00:02:16.719> those<00:02:16.959> so<00:02:17.230> if<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.099> find<00:02:18.280> one<00:02:18.430> of

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
focus on those so if you find one of

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.160 
focus on those so if you find one of
these<00:02:18.700> always<00:02:19.209> grab<00:02:19.450> them<00:02:19.629> if<00:02:19.719> you<00:02:19.810> can<00:02:19.930> find

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
these always grab them if you can find

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.509 
these always grab them if you can find
them<00:02:20.290> cheap<00:02:20.530> because<00:02:20.769> they're<00:02:21.099> great<00:02:21.280> but
