00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.040
 400 euros and for such a small one 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.109
 compact camera that really gives itself 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.970
 common with canon when normal 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.639
 After porsche has one it stands today 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.440
 with the brand new 120 and we 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.960
 look if she finds the euro 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.279
 really worth it 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.289
 Of course you first ask yourself something 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.939
 I get then for 400 euros 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.980
 but still relatively little camera 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.900
 for it from the hardware internees 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.150
 if you have such a market mostly one 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.740
 flat rate 16 you can say but 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.240
 of course you are already objectively everything 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.740
 built a little smaller 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.260
 from the light intensity here only 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.000
 Blender 18 in the wide angle really 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.829
 it will only be bad in the first place 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.390
 there you only have aperture 57 so 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.860
 not anymore but not bright when 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.000
 Get closer to what forest in the evening 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.559
 again a very good one 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.300
 Image stabilizer in it and a very 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.640
 potent processor they are namely 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.930
 Just turn the camera I think 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.329
 I now here in the further the fashion 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.890
 You will notice the school again 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.390
 Face recognition how to get in it 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.550
 actually stays just as fast 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.050
 good at the first cd one has 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.250
 Of course not so much fuzzy where 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.600
 but now have to work the camera 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.399
 Generally it is really good 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.750
 you also see that moves 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.489
 really very fluent in here 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.320
 monitor in there so you have a whole 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.670
 amount of potential already in the hardware 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.960
 but they are also exploited 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.180
 So it can be really nice again 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.350
 We will continue to work with this directly 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.290
 with the next topic and that is 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.090
 of course, the picture quality 400 euro whole 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.950
 a lot of money and now the small one 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.780
 picture sensor that naturally clear as soon as 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.909
 her night shots somehow im 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.840
 Evening concert maybe at night with 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.369
 the family in it 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.380
 Of course everything will not be like that now 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.700
 that's good for that 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.840
 Picture noise and you are too high but 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.700
 tends to be quite normal 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.600
 require daylight or how now 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.340
 in cloudy sky 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.329
 Can you just take a picture? 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.369
 also has a very good one 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.079
 Picture quality is generally a big one 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.479
 advantage on the camera here as well as at 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.130
 the g 16 tested has one more 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.360
 Mode with in it could therefore at the computer 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.409
 also very much for post-processing 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.090
 already support already 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.130
 some rockers and words the files of 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.509
 camera thus tends to be no problem 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.310
 this is the last one on the computer 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.590
 to get a bit of image quality but 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.670
 must of course say 400 euros of it 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.619
 Do you already get the one or the other? 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.850
 other system camera together with good kit 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.740
 Objectively maybe even one more 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.540
 fixed focal length on top takes now 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.890
 Just have the samsung nx 1000 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.319
 We tested it early in the year 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.730
 meanwhile for 250 300 euro if I 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.080
 am not mistaken here gets up 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.270
 even 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.950
 also a solid with and have a lot 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.320
 much more picture quality for the same 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.790
 money and the aps c sensors have that 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.700
 is clear but we just do it 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.710
 continue with the topic video mode in the 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.940
 Video mode, of course, the test directly with 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.550
 the camera goes to the sun 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.540
 problem case, of course, first to 20 man 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.310
 not noticed for so long now 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.960
 great winter is and how beautiful 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.610
 said here again cars also worked 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.470
 Ticks could do that too 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.550
 or other films turn for youtube 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.320
 or what ever 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.540
 which of course is not right 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.160
 fight for 17 small or on one 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.600
 picture rtr 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.310
 that is very clear but as I said 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.380
 In between, no topic in any case 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.670
 there was clearly no external micro 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.690
 can connect the last test 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.160
 Let's do it the same way 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.160
 autofocus compensation 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.420
 was now worth the canon powershot s100 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.560
 20 for just over 400 euro like 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.060
 already mentioned a topic 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.130
 picture quality if you really that 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.170
 maximum optics in matters then want 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.820
 definitely not there gets to him 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.560
 system camera even with the cheapest 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.510
 There are definitely more due 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.250
 the big image sensors if you what her 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.500
 have handy have it currently 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.510
 no great alternative first 120 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.520
 then where are shots that are the size 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.110
 relatively bright lens at least 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.940
 still in wide angle very good video mode 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.860
 you can already see she has some 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.630
 benefits this brings to what you 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.520
 now in brienz when the cold also notes 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.110
 Of course, the battery does not last forever 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.030
 you have the bottom of the liveview below 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.710
 relatively powerful processor that 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.090
 everything counts a bit on the battery 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.470
 then you have to plan on 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.970
 best still a second to buy 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.320
 I would at least recommend you 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.030
 otherwise he is definitely doing this 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.620
 nothing wrong if something small 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.000
 somehow somehow needs to become mandatory 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.060
 but also give away as an aside 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.680
 camera also likes to stop by here 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.810
 Interestingly, it was only at the very end 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.460
 of the video we have already 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.070
 times the canon powershot tested it and 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.690
 Although the s100 if you see it again 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.640
 Want a bit of retro style with one 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.830
 Eighth shave then just look 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.240
 have a look at the video and other fancy things 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.300
 video to a noble compact we have 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.070
 you packed here yes that was it 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.570
 then synonymous for this video and synonymous for 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.220
 this year the last show of the year 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.510
 2014 we are really full 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.260
 pulled through again through the 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.209
 Christmas time 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.209
 I hope you enjoy it as much 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.680
 made like all of us here in the team of 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.300
 In any case, a good slip 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.590
 into the new year 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.860
 we'll meet again directly at the first 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.030
 only in 2014 and thus an unboxing video 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.350
 I do not want exactly what it's all about 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.260
 In any case, also betrayed 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.780
 many individuals to do so on the 11th 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.530
 So have a good slide until then 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.530
 and see you
