 I hope you have well we find ourselves 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.879
 today for an opening pack a 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.370
 little bit special just there 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.500
 had the boxing day on Thursday night or 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.000
 Friday night so for those who do not 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.469
 do not know what it's boxing day I 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.230
 puts you a picture right now 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.850
 boxing day it's just 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.590
 packages that are available every 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.539
 two hours it could be papers 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.189
 50000 consumable packs packs 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.410
 100 miles in the background I put myself some 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.300
 not that I could open it was easter to 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.010
 50 miles for the most part you're going 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.650
 see that I had a lot of luck in 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.640
 a pack especially that I will put you 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.710
 a big chance elsewhere 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.559
 and then there will be some 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.079
 live at the end of the video where I'm going 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.210
 you open four or five packs to 100 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.149
 miles that were available so at 23 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.410
 hours ago there were also 17 packs 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.300
 hours of packs 100 miles to 17 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.430
 hours I wanted to show big gpu 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.989
 it's more like that at 11 pm 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.579
 I had a lot of luck a little bit more 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.020
 luck anyway so we'll see a 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.730
 little xavi it's always a pleasure 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.930
 it was a bit of a war because 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.940
 I know that there are many people who 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.250
 were opening there and so it was very 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.019
 complicated to hit big players but 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.670
 I still managed to get down to 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.060
 to type a small form of small 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.130
 forms 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.020
 you will see that eventually it is a 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.720
 pack opening not too bad I'll get you 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.790
 leave with the biggest packs at 50000 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.350
 that I typed on foot 15 a player 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.439
 really extraordinary let's go the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.439
 guys 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.810
 and yeah I managed the cases to type a 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.360
 silva in cif 89.2 general version 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.030
 I was really happy because 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.470
 it's the biggest players in general 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.090
 this team of the weak and I come to the 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.649
 to type in a pack so really great 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.970
 happy but I put a picture on 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.380
 twitter but if you do not have twitter 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.270
 I'll let you know when even 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.280
 not that I had and for the live packs to 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.840
 100000 I did not put anything on twitter for 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.060
 keep a little surprise 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.470
 I'll show you two packs 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.450
 at 100000 that I could open 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.039
 I did not have a lot of players 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.950
 see that I did not have much 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.929
 from the trip williams if I'm wrong 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.670
 I had alonso late I had some 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.259
 players not too badly done for two 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.429
 packs to 100 miles it really repays 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.689
 not at all I was really disgusted 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.250
 but I think I'm not alone in 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.290
 to have had good sea it's not 400 me 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.269

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.260
 four or five packs to be bored live 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:20.640

 open the last pack at 25000 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.280
 frankly I did not have much 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.250
 I had a bust of jong we go skiing pg 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.050
 manga limits its limits places 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.760
 distinct and hazard but that's the 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.140
 bad I would have preferred to have the good 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.610
 this time we will take the time 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.100
 so we will keep the players 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.690
 yeah I really did not have much 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.230
 sanchez 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.970
 I had jongles otherwise apart from that 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.200
 I did not have big players frankly 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.480
 I can be joined a little bit 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.210
 disgusted but hey we caught up 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.870
 still on the 50-mile pack with 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.620
 david silva version 6 so that's 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.419
 really not bad 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.700
 in any case that was really a 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.900
 video a little bit special because it 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.790
 there were packs every two hours 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.169
 all day I tried to open it 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.060
 the maximum possible 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.380
 it was a bit complicated of you 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.850
 make a video all the time live 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.340
 that's why sometimes there will be the 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.260
 last part this part live and 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.490
 other parties offline I hope 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.950
 that in any case you will have appreciated this 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.440
 small pack opening I finally had 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.620
 boost but compared to what I have 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.669
 open I really did not have much 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.530
 it's true that 50- minute packs 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.250
 I was very lucky with David 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.350
 silva etc 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.330
 I got a concrete refund 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.150
 the packs at 100000 I made myself 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.250
 really really really to do with 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.770
 of the olinga soul all the packs the first 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.140
 times the second time I had that slab 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.880
 apart from that sanchez and rushes 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.940
 great version a shape that I had already 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.470
 so not much but well, that's it 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.210
 I hope that in any case you will have 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.830
 appreciated if to show you that 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.690
 every time I do not have the time to 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.910
 change it from luck to some 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.930
 moments but not all the time I hope 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.340
 you will have appreciated in any case this 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.780
 video the ayguade always in the good 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.030
 mood 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:23.260

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.260
