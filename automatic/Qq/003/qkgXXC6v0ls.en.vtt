I'm going to start making some contact

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:20.370 
I'm going to start making some contact
with<00:01:19.209> this<00:01:19.389> hand<00:01:19.659> so<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:19.899> lady<00:01:20.079> doesn't

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
remove it and from here I meana

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.539 
remove it and from here I meana
hammerlock<00:01:23.259> open<00:01:23.709> and<00:01:23.920> I<00:01:23.950> can<00:01:24.130> just<00:01:24.310> unwind

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
hammerlock open and I can just unwind

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:27.090 
hammerlock open and I can just unwind
the<00:01:25.060> lady<00:01:25.240> into<00:01:25.509> a<00:01:25.689> loop<00:01:26.020> over<00:01:26.139> lock<00:01:26.499> as<00:01:26.679> we've

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
the lady into a loop over lock as we've

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.339 
the lady into a loop over lock as we've
done<00:01:27.219> in<00:01:27.340> previous<00:01:27.369> videos<00:01:27.939> comb<00:01:28.749> over<00:01:29.109> and

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:29.349 
done in previous videos comb over and

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:33.569 
done in previous videos comb over and
then<00:01:30.039> just<00:01:30.340> do<00:01:30.849> a<00:01:30.880> free<00:01:31.779> spin<00:01:32.249> simple<00:01:33.249> okay

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
then just do a free spin simple okay

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.370 
then just do a free spin simple okay
it's<00:01:33.880> all<00:01:34.029> about<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.420> timing<00:01:34.689> of<00:01:34.959> being<00:01:35.319> able

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
it's all about the timing of being able

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.440 
it's all about the timing of being able
to<00:01:35.649> leave<00:01:35.799> those<00:01:35.950> two<00:01:36.130> moves<00:01:36.450> interconnected

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
to leave those two moves interconnected

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.779 
to leave those two moves interconnected
so<00:01:37.840> we'll<00:01:37.929> do<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.139> a<00:01:38.170> little<00:01:38.529> bit<00:01:38.679> faster<00:01:38.859> here

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
so we'll do it a little bit faster here

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:50.909 
so we'll do it a little bit faster here
we<00:01:40.060> go<00:01:40.539> 1<00:01:41.469> 2<00:01:41.920> 3<00:01:42.340> 5<00:01:43.029> 6<00:01:43.090> 7<00:01:43.719> 1<00:01:44.289> 2<00:01:45.039> 3<00:01:45.479> 5<00:01:46.479> 6<00:01:46.709> 7<00:01:47.709> 1<00:01:48.549> 2<00:01:48.939> 3<00:01:49.859> 5<00:01:50.859> 6
