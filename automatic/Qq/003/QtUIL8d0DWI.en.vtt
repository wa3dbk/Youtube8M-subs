when<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.079> was<00:00:58.890> testing<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.520> turning<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.090> motor

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
when I was testing it turning the motor

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.640 
when I was testing it turning the motor
this<00:01:01.620> section<00:01:02.129> here<00:01:02.309> would<00:01:02.760> not<00:01:03.000> turn<00:01:03.650> these

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
this section here would not turn these

this section here would not turn these
two<00:01:04.949> would<00:01:05.220> turn<00:01:05.489> well<00:01:06.420> half<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.020> one

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
two would turn well half of this one

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.429 
two would turn well half of this one
would<00:01:07.439> turn<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.820> that's<00:01:09.689> how<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.869> knew<00:01:10.200> it

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
would turn and that's how I knew it

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.550 
would turn and that's how I knew it
wasn't<00:01:11.310> right<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.060> see<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:13.080> marked

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
wasn't right and you can see it's marked

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.390 
wasn't right and you can see it's marked
different<00:01:16.159> another<00:01:17.159> good<00:01:17.400> tip<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.840> if<00:01:19.250> this<00:01:20.250> is

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
different another good tip is if this is

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.010 
different another good tip is if this is
