 day and here I am mali pana trash for 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.960
 to be 3d video on this video I 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.880
 project a magic trick that is done 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.910
 not with cards but with a 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.270
 book who knows percy jackson robber of 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.579
 lightning 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.550
 I could have taken very well our 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.960
 book that I play as well that's 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.820
 unimportant I could have taken 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.980
 harry potter if I finally want short I 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.280
 can take and workshops you also have 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.690
 need fire and silo me I take 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.610
 just a felt for you to see 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.399
 better but you can take very well 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.110
 a pen here so I made myself like 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:58.260
 usually I will introduce you to the 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:01:05.430
 turn and then explain it to you for this trick 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:11.619
 you will have to start with a grid 1 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:15.250
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 cassette 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.820
 it's very important that it is open 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.500
 who will determine the number of pages 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.210
 and since inevitably that a book a 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.540
 book contains pages we are going to 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.400
 serve 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.290
 this grid to give us the number 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.700
 of game pages when I small 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:33.909

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.510
 departure to choose on the first line 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.840
 that name I would surround him and I bar and 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.130
 the others had to have the valve columns 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.930
 just and 4th passes 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:50.850
 between June 4th beats 8 12 and 16 so 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.229
 as I want onlookers Thursday the four 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.930

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.410
 mandatory after the match if I 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.580
 roll the dice here you will have done six 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:52.020

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:17.820
 a hold addition 4 +7 +10 +13 ethical to 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:22.019
 cat and 7 11 + 10 21 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:27.530
 more 13 34 34 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:30.510
 it will be the number of pages or the page 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:36.769
 that's what I'm going to do is I 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:38.400
 will try to recite the 34th page 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.980
 percy jackson 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.950
 I remained the first line for that 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.579
 go fast I let you do it but I 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.340
 will try to ilaria behind there is 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.049
 here I am not photocopies page I 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.850
 am not a time on the internet I do not 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.680
 not look at the pages you can very 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.810
 well do it outside for example so 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.890
 I try and then I will show this 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.470
 that there is in this page 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:08.379
 I mean there is Roman 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:11.379
 that javier spelled them through 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.379
 comma 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.989
 sir bruner reminded me this is it's 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.500
 that it is on the page 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:27.639
 in fact we will check page 34 I hope 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:31.570
 that's it slice alapage 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:35.530
 I can see you well on September 30 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.880
 there is good 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.520
 I want to play the camera very well but 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.870
 it's good Greek and Roman I had 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.510
 to miss out sir 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:50.240
 brunet fox ap 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:05:00.530
 Here are the explanations of 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:05:03.280
 this tour where the explanations are very 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.710
 simple in fact it's mathematical 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:09.320
 you will of course need a 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.360
 preparation because I did not learn everything 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.990
 the book 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.660
 here you will have many more 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.630
 repairs and this preparation is done 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:22.130
 on page 34 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:23.930
 always page 37 here is the page 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.910
 complete you copy on the whole page 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.190
 it's being brave on the first Ali 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.570
 like me I'm going I told myself she 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.200
 did not move much time it's 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.450
 true I had a lot of time so 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:39.720
 I copied his first bed and I 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:42.070
 copy to a post it on my computer 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.460
 that is to say that at the same time I see 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.200
 but you I say I could have spent the 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.960
 post it may can play squarely 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.790
 remember the good I did not take the risk 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.600
 to make a video fail so I tell him 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:57.220
 to the video is actually what he has 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.590
 past is that it will fall all the 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:04.030
 time on page 37 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:13.210
 I will resume this grid 2 3 4 5 6 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:16.680
 7 and 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 and 16 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:18.490
 here I am going to choose completely 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.390
 different from that keeps blow 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:25.260
 of sponged choose three after they 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.910
 will make this jungle 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.360
 then they make 10 is all 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:33.610
 different from 13 14 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:51.090
 we have the goods the grids and if we 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:51.090
 calculates 3bis 5 9 and 8 + 12 12 20 + 14 37 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.560
 chosen for example I still have a jallet 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:05.700
 unveils to a16 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:09.190
 that makes 7 7 and 11 18 18 16 37 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.090
 so that's always it's still 34 if 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.160
 you make the grid well it falls 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.120
 always on 34 so I do not have a 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.840
 extraordinary memory 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:19.600
 I only took two months to copy 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:22.690
 the first sentence of the father if you know 

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.210
 these, of course, work with all 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:30.640
 books I could have gone around with 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:35.310
 the relics of death and so here 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.310
 will see his ideals and see you soon
