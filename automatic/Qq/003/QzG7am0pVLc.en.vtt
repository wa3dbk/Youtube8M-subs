they<00:01:47.149> are<00:01:47.270> a<00:01:47.299> non<00:01:48.069> hybrid<00:01:49.630> like<00:01:50.630> these

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
they are a non hybrid like these

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.859 
they are a non hybrid like these
cucumbers<00:01:51.970> these<00:01:52.970> are<00:01:53.149> for<00:01:53.390> this<00:01:53.599> these

cucumbers<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:54.560> I<00:01:54.619> just<00:01:54.829> showed<00:01:55.039> you<00:01:55.250> or<00:01:55.399> four

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
cucumbers that I just showed you or four

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.260 
cucumbers that I just showed you or four
generations<00:01:56.539> old<00:01:56.780> I<00:01:57.020> popped<00:01:57.439> the<00:01:57.530> first<00:01:57.770> seeds

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
generations old I popped the first seeds

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.800 
generations old I popped the first seeds
three<00:01:59.270> years<00:01:59.479> ago<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:01.310> I<00:02:01.789> have<00:02:03.159> planted<00:02:04.159> seed

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
three years ago and I have planted seed

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.979 
three years ago and I have planted seed
the<00:02:05.810> first<00:02:06.079> time<00:02:07.179> growing<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.299> cucumbers

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
the first time growing the cucumbers

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.930 
the first time growing the cucumbers
market<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.829> harvested<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.429> seats<00:02:10.670> from<00:02:10.849> the

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
market to harvested the seats from the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.780 
market to harvested the seats from the
cucumbers<00:02:11.540> then<00:02:11.959> planted<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:13.250> harvested

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
cucumbers then planted the harvested

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.699 
cucumbers then planted the harvested
seeds<00:02:15.459> let<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.579> plants<00:02:16.910> grow<00:02:17.560> got<00:02:18.560> the

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
seeds let the plants grow got the

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.819 
seeds let the plants grow got the
cucumber<00:02:19.510> harvested<00:02:20.510> seeds<00:02:20.750> from<00:02:20.989> it<00:02:21.230> did

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
cucumber harvested seeds from it did

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.800 
cucumber harvested seeds from it did
I've<00:02:21.950> done<00:02:22.130> this<00:02:22.310> three<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.910> four<00:02:23.150> times<00:02:23.450> now

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
I've done this three to four times now

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.390 
I've done this three to four times now
so<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:24.650> know<00:02:24.799> that<00:02:24.920> these<00:02:25.280> cucumbers<00:02:26.380> are<00:02:27.380> not<00:02:28.220> a

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
so I know that these cucumbers are not a

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.879 
so I know that these cucumbers are not a
hybrid<00:02:28.930> they<00:02:29.930> are<00:02:29.989> very<00:02:30.290> fertile<00:02:30.819> and

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:32.889
