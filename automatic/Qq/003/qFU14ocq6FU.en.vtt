00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.379
 and good to everyone that thou 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:06.230
 commenting and I bring you a gameplay of 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.330
 modern warfare 3 a gameplay with the p 90 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.060
 carry with extended chargers I think 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.770
 not finished use from say the while 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.630
 world or something like that towards the amount that does not 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.070
 he used this weapon and good as always 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.840
 a pretty good you know that here 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.070
 with a submachine gun, you're fans to kill 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.110
 done practically on any map 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.730
 that makes more one is a short half 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.200
 distance and if not good it will be by bullets 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.330
 I do not carry it with chargers expanded without 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.400
 look at the bullets that I have lying around or 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.630
 be that by bullets it will never do 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.770
 not without any problem 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.880
 the fact is that we are playing 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:37.220
 some counterpart and I think so and 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.500
 well I think is not the agent editor with 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.079
 the one I 've talked about I think very little 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.399
 people have played the campaign of this game 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.230
 I'm not making you do not 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.110
 you played and so on I was thinking 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.399
 that pierces us and whites two of the 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.440
 world says it was accompanied a lot 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.480
 that the black ops 1 campaign was a 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.270
 lot yes I have not played 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.430
 then I do not know I do not know why noses do not 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.800
 I got hooked on this campaign 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.050
 I play the truth as of the ghost 4 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.190
 play of with 5 in cooperative with 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.050
 richard 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.510
 then I played modern warfare2 in fact 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.150
 yes because I had the platinum of the 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.040
 movie 3 so the toy and everything 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.570
 whole but the white one was not and was 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.820
 much less has already been a moment in 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.650
 which to see what I'm going to 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.900
 play it but good it occurred to me that 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.260
 since black ops will come out all in one 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.680
 month 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.750
 I'm just going to do a month 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.540
 it occurred to me to spend the campaign of 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.030
 lake and as according to the people that I have 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.680
 asked by twitter there are many people 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.350
 who has no idea about this campaign 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.940
 well even less than me how good is 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.740
 it is very difficult cases that as I say there 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.500
 many people who have no idea of 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.670
 the white campaign and maybe he will 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.710
 he appreciates playing because he is going to buy more 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.330
 expensive place better strong has been its 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.190
 first call of duty is not going to buy 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.420
 let's just say that the game by 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.340
 play the target's campaign but 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.830
 so good I thought of the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.979
 madness to spend the whole let's say that in 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.869
 one or two days to play it live and 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.880
 Maybe tomorrow is Sunday and 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.649
 tomorrow start in the afternoon let's say 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.500
 we go for the fire and it ran out two or three 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.520
 hours playing live and well like that 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.470
 at least the people who want to play 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.509
 You can take the engraved one in a while 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.700
 for when I want to see now and I for my 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.400
 part then or I at least I find out 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.540
 of the Bell 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.860
 let's say that more prepared for the target 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.660
 all since good as seen that has 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.599
 already left the gameplay 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.040
 you know that first you start with the 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.140
 men on horseback who had a lot of 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.910
 controversial and the world said white is left 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.550
 he says yes there were many more degrees in 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.810
 we propose a streak of 16 will be to draw 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.000
 the horses instead of the dogs and 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.459
 things like that not then well let's say that 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.650
 At this point there were many people 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.599
 he does not trust the campaign too much but he 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.780
 the gameplay has started if a 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.069
 gameplay with one like a suit 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.349
 invisibility let's say it's going to be 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.420
 graphically super cured mine 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.709
 I can not tell you the truth 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.910
 heap and as I tell you, I never get 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.549
 fix on the graphics but when I see 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.799
 some like this especially about the campaigns I 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.269
 flipa much I have multiplayer 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.250
 same but in the campaign that so 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.709
 less will it be when you alone that 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.330
 have some graphics not the case is that 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.010
 as i tell you 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.260
 I will play life will play surely 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.020
 tomorrow as I tell you it will be about I do not know what 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.030
 hour 7 maybe I'll be one or 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.880
 two banks or three hours that are needed 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.950
 and I tell you between morning and past and a 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.350
 day plus maybe the entire campaign 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.550
 live because the animal and so on and 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.570
 good another little thing more that also 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.400
 I wanted to tell you, you know that 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.590
 come out everything that involves zombies not 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.210
 I doubt very much that much more 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.650
 zombies until it's a week before 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.360
 of the game and begin to filter videos 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.740
 as usual, but as usual 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.990
 I doubt very much that they keep pulling 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.960
 already official gameplays already know that 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.760
 have taken out that official employment of 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.590
 zombies and yesterday they took out the first game 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.209
 calls on all the faces are 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.209
 below the description or wherever in the 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.040
 channel uploaded yesterday and today sorry and as 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.690
 that a lot of things have been seen 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.490
 the zombies that I was really looking forward to 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.770
 to find out how I told you I was going to be 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.080
 totally a total zombie mode 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.060
 huge they said etcetera that is to me 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.820
 personally, that makes me pretty cool 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.590
 make the maps we are super judged and 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.720
 huge and as for the map this world and 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.220
 I liked that player a lot, so 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.440
 that you have seen the east map of the yacht 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.730
 that he leaves because if I'm not wrong 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.900
 I personally loved it 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.180
 from what I 've seen 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.470
 of the map is a super elongated map 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.209
 I missed a part they have lengthened 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.280
 say that this would be just a tad 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.560
 longer and only maybe the 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.180
 part of the center or we say that 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.550
 people help us to escape not or 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.960
 whether a team starts killing to kill 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.580
 to kill to start moving towards 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.720
 go ahead and the moment you already get in 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.580
 the restaurant I imagine is back by 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.080
 delays in there can not be problems 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.449
 of respawn and that you appear to one side 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.919
 or the other because I imagine that for a 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.960
 will be well done since it has 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.410
 been professional people who helped 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.520
 develop the game and on the other hand I 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.260
 I imagine that they will have taken this into account 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.580
 since on the target if one does not 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.590
 Responses that were say 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.300
 too bad as I think it has been 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.190
 of the shorts in which they have better 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.300
 been the case well talking and a little 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.530
 more of the gameplay you see I was playing 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.630
 here they kill me like not like grenade launchers 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.400
 the last the only death they make me 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.199
 is with grenade launchers and I was 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.229
 puffing up to kill the truth was one thing 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.699
 incredible began with the pp 90 before 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:07.270
 there were over those of the 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.710
 90 so I told them crazy not 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.690
 start taking helicopters and others and 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.690
 pus that they sting to last a tad 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.760
 helicopters let's say it's super good 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.959
 I also personally love having 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.459
 there the helicopters that is not to take out 

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:24.579
 that is to say take I got my super 

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:26.139
 streak and it arrives thus destroy the truth is 

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:30.399
 that I say no because above always a 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:32.619
 destroys someone that I know 05 or 220 

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:34.209
 and with anything if so nothing 

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:35.859
 said is but they liked this 

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:37.389
 gameplay this game remember that I've 

00:05:35.859 --> 00:05:38.919
 done a white 2 contest on the 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.779
 video that I uploaded this morning asked for 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.099
 the zombies and nothing milk expresses like 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.359
 video that you vote I like favorites of 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.459
 cinema what do you think about the idea of 

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:48.419
 black ops campaign and see you the 

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:48.419
 next god
