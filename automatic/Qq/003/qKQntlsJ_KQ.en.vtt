00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.310 
it helps with understanding the physics
of<00:05:18.910> dropping<00:05:19.510> on<00:05:19.600> egg<00:05:19.750> I<00:05:19.990> think<00:05:20.050> you're

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
of dropping on egg I think you're

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.390 
of dropping on egg I think you're
absolutely<00:05:20.530> right<00:05:20.800> would<00:05:21.010> you<00:05:21.039> look<00:05:21.220> at<00:05:21.310> this

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
absolutely right would you look at this

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.800 
absolutely right would you look at this
over<00:05:21.580> here<00:05:21.610> here<00:05:21.910> we<00:05:22.000> go<00:05:22.120> all<00:05:22.389> right<00:05:22.570> do<00:05:22.720> we

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
over here here we go all right do we

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.210 
over here here we go all right do we
have<00:05:22.960> success<00:05:23.380> yet<00:05:23.620> do<00:05:23.800> we

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
have success yet do we

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.300 
have success yet do we
yeah<00:05:25.020> how<00:05:26.020> do<00:05:26.080> you<00:05:26.169> feel<00:05:28.889> we're<00:05:29.889> going<00:05:30.100> through

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
yeah how do you feel we're going through

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.620 
yeah how do you feel we're going through
let's<00:05:30.639> go<00:05:30.850> over<00:05:30.970> here<00:05:31.060> do<00:05:31.240> we<00:05:31.330> have<00:05:31.450> success

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
let's go over here do we have success

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.360 
let's go over here do we have success
that's<00:05:34.630> okay<00:05:35.020> now<00:05:35.500> you<00:05:35.560> can't<00:05:35.860> change<00:05:36.130> your

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
that's okay now you can't change your

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.710 
that's okay now you can't change your
design<00:05:36.669> for<00:05:36.910> the<00:05:36.970> big<00:05:37.090> drop<00:05:37.300> at<00:05:37.450> Coors<00:05:37.690> Field

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
design for the big drop at Coors Field

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.240 
design for the big drop at Coors Field
but<00:05:38.139> you<00:05:38.260> can<00:05:38.350> go<00:05:38.440> back<00:05:38.620> and<00:05:38.770> gonna<00:05:38.889> rework

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
but you can go back and gonna rework

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.129 
but you can go back and gonna rework
this<00:05:39.510> look<00:05:40.510> at<00:05:40.630> this
