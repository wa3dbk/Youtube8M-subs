00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
fun look sweaty actually but as you can

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.970 
fun look sweaty actually but as you can
see<00:02:14.480> it's<00:02:14.660> kind<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:14.870> like<00:02:14.989> hallways<00:02:15.440> were

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
see it's kind of like hallways were

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.520 
see it's kind of like hallways were
basically<00:02:16.370> in<00:02:16.550> a<00:02:16.610> big<00:02:17.050> college<00:02:18.050> so<00:02:18.350> there's

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
basically in a big college so there's

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.010 
basically in a big college so there's
always<00:02:18.709> as<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.130> can<00:02:19.250> see<00:02:19.370> down<00:02:19.580> their

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
always as you can see down their

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.370 
always as you can see down their
classrooms<00:02:21.020> absolutely<00:02:21.560> everywhere<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:23.380> think

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
classrooms absolutely everywhere I think

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.930 
classrooms absolutely everywhere I think
this<00:02:24.470> is<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.709> main<00:02:24.860> stage<00:02:25.130> so<00:02:25.550> John<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.790> take
