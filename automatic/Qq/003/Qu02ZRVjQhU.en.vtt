of Internet enabled apps there are two

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.509 
of Internet enabled apps there are two
ways<00:00:24.929> your<00:00:25.140> phone<00:00:25.349> can<00:00:25.560> access<00:00:26.009> the<00:00:26.160> Internet

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
ways your phone can access the Internet

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.970 
ways your phone can access the Internet
one<00:00:27.419> way<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.779> by<00:00:27.810> using<00:00:27.990> data<00:00:28.499> through<00:00:28.949> a

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
one way is by using data through a

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.339 
one way is by using data through a
cellular<00:00:29.400> network<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:30.419> other<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.929> through<00:00:31.199> a

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
cellular network the other is through a

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.740 
cellular network the other is through a
Wi-Fi<00:00:31.679> network<00:00:32.420> naturally<00:00:33.420> when<00:00:33.630> you're

connected to the Internet via a cellular

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.849 
connected to the Internet via a cellular
network<00:00:35.730> you'll<00:00:36.690> use<00:00:36.870> data<00:00:37.170> from<00:00:37.380> your<00:00:37.560> plan
