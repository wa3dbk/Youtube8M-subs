00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.530
 a explosive supplies from Australia reached the radiology of the clinics 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.869
 eat-center 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:13.369
 The contents of this container are highly dangerous and at the same time 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.440
 Age the EWN radioactive beads 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.179
 the bidders offenses 94 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:24.570
 the world's most advanced method of fighting liver tumors these 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:25.359
 are naked 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.789
 Munich then emit highly concentrated radiation 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.089
 in a big way a way you can not radiate from the outside 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.740
 Life succeeds in certain situations 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.720
 To get poppy under control downsize 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.630
 and above all 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.060
 Great of the patients that knows the shows on medium term and also 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.660
 longer-term survival 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.330
 significantly improve 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.389
 a dose of this liquid radioactive substance 

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:55.999
 that of Professor Koch with a lot of instinct directly into the 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.309
 Liver tumors of the patient via a catheter a waddling 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.280
 Glass is 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.210
 from everything we do in the West and do something bad 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.960
 Patients say cars means so Suazo feels comes with speed-fit concerns 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.040
 Personally I was pretty hard in that concentration process 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.620
 compellingly 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.460
 and we have many dozens of times 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.660
 really with what you have on your forehead Dagestan you have to go 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:20.520
 I say 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.550
 Now it becomes a bit more routine to decide on the use of the sirt 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.110
 It follows at the Essen-Mitte Hospital in an interdisciplinary tumor conference 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.550
 between all responsible specialist departments 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.920
 Cancer patients beta thousand concert spectacular radiation therapy 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.040
 gain in lifetime 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.780
 one took it back and forth thoughtfully 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.240
 if I want to do that at all or not 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.079
 what is more active today and materials are re-injected and 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.920
 of course, it requires fear first 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.200
 i think thank bad for strings then all rooms 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.740
 you can not go home but that's not what it's for politics 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.590
 so 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.350
 So you can really go home after two days 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.240
 without any side effects then it will be through these now I have yes 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.240
 the hope that it may still come 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.999
 Patients from all over the world are interested in the local 2 therapies 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.159
 at the clinics eat-mitte 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.269
 so that goes well above that threshold must have failed us 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.419
 and that's obviously the area Bechter 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:22.369
 the need for 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:25.919
 Patients expect the advanced procedures targeted 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:30.549
 In fact, others have increased competence of interventional 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.919
 Radiology and internal oncology such an interdisciplinary center 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.959
 for regional tumor therapy 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.170
 there are in Germany 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.690
 only at the clinics food-center
