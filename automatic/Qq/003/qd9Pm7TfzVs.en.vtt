00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:05.140
 It is taking a distance 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.120
 Be wary of net ride 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.990
 Speeder above me 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.610
 What does it mean 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.900
 March outside shoot probability is not high 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.900
 Morning and I got fired 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:28.789
 Because if you do not miss 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.789
 Oh mirror two people lucky Do more reliable route is by ck 06 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:38.660
 dee 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.660
 This is why I took a distance from various March 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.470
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.290
 an an 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.770
 I mean 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.540
 Ka' I thought a higher or store the trajectory of the knee ball 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.690
 Reverse 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:58.070
 Low batting due to its unique form 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:03.230
 That was the secret to disappear 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:09.770
 In the case of a normal shot, the host of defense is facing up 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:12.020
 From the hole just like pushing out from the chest What kind of position the phone is low 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.920
 Many swore 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:20.190
 A soaring ball gets out of the chair in an instant 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.530
 At the same time he is bitten into the gaze guidance 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.050
 Lost sight of 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.280
 It looks like it has disappeared 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.210
 Dadan 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.140
 Fly one step down 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.180
 Sea I spread 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.180
 If there is a speed to catch up from outside 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.490
 It's full view see 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.430
 Let's go 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.400
 Shinomatsu 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.400
 Good 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.150
 bl 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.970
 Hmm
