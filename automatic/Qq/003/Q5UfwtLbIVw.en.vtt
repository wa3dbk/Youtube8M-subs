00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
now empty and let's move on to the iPad

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.560 
now empty and let's move on to the iPad
itself<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.790> once<00:01:44.939> again<00:01:45.060> you're<00:01:45.240> presented

again strangely satisfying I don't
really<00:01:56.820> know<00:01:56.939> why<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.540> as<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.290> see<00:01:58.530> there

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
really know why but as you can see there

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.030 
really know why but as you can see there

with especially at the slate gray color
here<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.680> have<00:02:04.950> here<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.850> looks<00:02:06.000> really<00:02:06.240> nice

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
here I have here it looks really nice

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.819 
here I have here it looks really nice
actually<00:02:06.570> I'm<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.869> big<00:02:07.020> fan<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.439> coloring

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
actually I'm a big fan of the coloring

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
but as you can see if we just moved down

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.860 
but as you can see if we just moved down
here<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.099> iPad<00:02:11.550> minis<00:02:11.910> Fitness<00:02:12.330> really<00:02:12.540> comes

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
here the iPad minis Fitness really comes

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.850 
here the iPad minis Fitness really comes
into<00:02:13.110> effect

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
into effect

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.350 
into effect
they<00:02:14.010> did<00:02:14.160> an<00:02:14.250> advert<00:02:14.580> with<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.790> pencil<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:15.300> I

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
they did an advert with a pencil so I

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.970 
they did an advert with a pencil so I
thought<00:02:15.540> I'd<00:02:15.690> compare<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.380> pen<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.710> just

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
thought I'd compare it to a pen I just

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.930 
thought I'd compare it to a pen I just
had<00:02:17.100> lying<00:02:17.280> on<00:02:17.460> my<00:02:17.550> desk

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
had lying on my desk

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.240 
had lying on my desk
it's<00:02:18.300> actually<00:02:18.600> thinner<00:02:18.990> than<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:19.740> stylus

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
it's actually thinner than this stylus

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.820 
it's actually thinner than this stylus
pen<00:02:20.550> which<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.330> very<00:02:21.690> very<00:02:22.020> impressive<00:02:22.470> it's

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
pen which is very very impressive it's

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.950 
pen which is very very impressive it's
super<00:02:23.220> thin<00:02:23.400> super<00:02:23.880> lightweight<00:02:24.360> just<00:02:24.630> weighs

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
super thin super lightweight just weighs

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.500 
super thin super lightweight just weighs
over<00:02:25.350> just<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:26.130> pound<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.610> think<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.060> then<00:02:27.360> here

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
over just a pound I think and then here

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.010 
over just a pound I think and then here
we<00:02:27.600> have<00:02:27.630> my<00:02:27.930> iPhone<00:02:28.440> 5<00:02:28.920> my<00:02:29.670> red<00:02:29.880> iPhone<00:02:30.330> 5<00:02:30.690> next

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
we have my iPhone 5 my red iPhone 5 next

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.290 
we have my iPhone 5 my red iPhone 5 next
to<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.440> iPad<00:02:31.740> Mini<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.160> they're<00:02:32.820> very<00:02:33.000> very

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
to the iPad Mini and they're very very

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.440 
to the iPad Mini and they're very very
similar<00:02:33.660> in<00:02:34.250> depth<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.550> doubt<00:02:36.000> you'll<00:02:36.180> be<00:02:36.210> able

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
similar in depth I doubt you'll be able

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.180 
similar in depth I doubt you'll be able
to<00:02:36.540> find<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.810> difference<00:02:37.170> but<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.770> again<00:02:38.070> it

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
to find a difference but it again it

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.530 
to find a difference but it again it
just<00:02:38.220> shows<00:02:38.400> how<00:02:38.550> thin<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.210> iPad<00:02:39.510> air

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
just shows how thin the iPad air

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.690 
just shows how thin the iPad air
actually<00:02:39.990> is<00:02:40.230> okay<00:02:40.770> so<00:02:40.830> let's<00:02:41.130> just<00:02:41.220> go<00:02:41.459> ahead

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
actually is okay so let's just go ahead

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.140 
actually is okay so let's just go ahead
and<00:02:41.910> first<00:02:42.300> boot<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.590> boots<00:02:43.860> up<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.400> 18

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
and first boot it it boots up in 18

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.449 
and first boot it it boots up in 18
seconds<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.380> course<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.830> booting<00:02:47.220> to

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
seconds but of course this is booting to

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.160 
seconds but of course this is booting to
the<00:02:47.580> startup<00:02:48.030> screen<00:02:48.150> not<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.750> actual

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
the startup screen not the actual

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.170 
the startup screen not the actual
springboard<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.550> it's<00:02:50.700> not<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.850> totally

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
springboard so it's not a totally

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.760 
springboard so it's not a totally
scientific<00:02:51.360> test<00:02:51.810> we're<00:02:52.110> doing<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.320> full<00:02:52.530> speed

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
scientific test we're doing a full speed

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.199 
scientific test we're doing a full speed
test<00:02:53.040> on<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.310> iPad<00:02:53.610> air<00:02:53.640> so<00:02:53.940> definitely

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
test on the iPad air so definitely

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.310 
test on the iPad air so definitely
