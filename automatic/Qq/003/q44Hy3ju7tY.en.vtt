00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello my america building abbas 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.150
 technologies in this video we will see 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.929
 how to do to update a 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.940
 computer in this case we have an hp 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:17.609
 the model is probook 45 30s that what 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.949
 we can see there this computer for 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.390
 to be able to update it is quite simple 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.939
 the only thing we have to do is what 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.880
 next is to grab and take the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.189
 battery to remove the battery is very 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.590
 simple we have two obstacles here the only thing 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.020
 what you have to do is tighten the locks 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.219
 towards the middle for this side and there it goes 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.579
 Battery 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.379
 after that we have here a screw 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.480
 in the middle that we have this 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.090
 take out so that these tapas run 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.640
 sideways to achieve that once 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.100
 that we take out a screw obviously 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.440
 we press well towards the middle and there only 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.989
 the lid moves forward once 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.660
 that we achieve this we take the cover as 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.289
 we can see here and then we give it 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.840
 back so you can see here in this 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.090
 side we have the hard drive this 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.690
 hard disk in this case we have 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.750
 taken out 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.420
 because the client wanted to use it in 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.550
 another on another side so in this case 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.070
 to remove the hard drive we have two 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.200
 screws here we have two screws here 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.260
 and once we get those screws 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.820
 we run the piece of metal towards 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.470
 forward that is what holds the disk 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.840
 rigid and ready 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.540
 we can take it out afterwards here we have 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.700
 to put more memory in this case 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.320
 we have two banks the only thing that there is 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.440
 do to get the memory is 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.840
 push the levers so that the side and 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.420
 once one does that can lift 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.330
 the memory towards up there like 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.000
 we can see in memory comes out remember 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.400
 to place it or place it well until the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.440
 background and once you place once 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.030
 it's fine at the bottom we press it and there 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.700
 go down later if you want to put more 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.540
 memory does it from this side and that 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.590
 it would be everything after we have 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.000
 here it would be the wifi plate if it arrives 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.770
 to have a problem you have to 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.869
 replace is also quite simple 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.180
 you have to disconnect the connectors 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.700
 these that we see here and once you do 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.440
 that 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.170
 to take out the two screws that he has 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.230
 side and the insert is up 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.360
 up after we have something else 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.120
 that we can get in the reader 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.220
 to divide as we can see here in the 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.459
 case that the reader divides and fails 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.340
 for some reason we have here in this 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.010
 cost a little hole that there goes a 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.810
 screw in this case we already take out the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.269
 screw to be faster in this 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.340
 video and how can we see the reader 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.470
 decides it comes out completely so if the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.940
 you have to replace is easier to 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.819
 do it after another important thing is 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.560
 make sure to keep the fans 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.140
 clean here if you have to clean it 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.940
 once a year would be ideal because if this is 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.670
 it comes to work obviously all the 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.099
 computer will be affected because 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.540
 if it gets to damage the fan it 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.250
 will start to reheat the rest of 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.190
 the components and the rest of the 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.140
 electronics is going to deteriorate enough 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.760
 quick after obviously once 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.650
 she exists is the change if you wanted 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.900
 put a solid-state hard drive 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.970
 or a bigger hard drive and put it 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.360
 more memory or maybe cleaning what 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.620
 be 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.550
 then what you have to do is 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.530
 quite simple once the cap support 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.600
 that supporting the lid pushes it towards 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.590
 go ahead and automatically work 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.270
 then we put the screw here as you 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.020
 had said at the beginning and then 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:40.420
 We put the battery and that would be it and 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.220
 that way we already concluded with the work 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.990
 of the update I hope that I have 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.240
 liked this video any doubt that 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.860
 have not hesitate to consult me ​​and we 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.860
 we see until the next see you later
