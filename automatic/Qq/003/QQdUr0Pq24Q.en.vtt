00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.980
 he is only one meter 69 tall 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.109
 nickname is fled 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.570
 nevertheless, argentinier counted lionel messi 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.800
 He is one of the biggest footballers in the world 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.630
 is one of the stars of the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.920
 world championship in the neighboring country 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.140
 Brazil will be fourfold 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.189
 World footballer feared and loved 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.929
 at the same time messi barcelona messi is 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.759
 different though he only has his football 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.320
 left foot he used is the only one 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.510
 player in real life just like that 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.530
 plays as in video games the only one 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.149
 the booth of another 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.820
 planet he is the best player of all 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.010
 times his water teammate the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.690
 Brazilian Daniel Alves says about messier 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.030
 since brazilian argentina 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.980
 Messi was actually born in Brazil 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.620
 been and you have to argentina 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.329
 taken to raise him there and 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.550
 study messi would be brazilian 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.559
 Yes I would wish that you can 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.470
 imagine that messi and then take 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.330
 No one would have a chance against that , me 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.189
 would put on this argentina jersey 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.650
 because they have good players like messi 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.540
 i like argentina too i like his 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.979
 kind of really like to play but before 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.390
 Everything had a very good ability 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.580
 Hard to pull through is what I think 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.530
 I did it too but not very much 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.330
 often and messi always does it 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.409
 if he has the ball very close to the foot 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.119
 plays at a very high level 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.770
 speed we know and admire 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.630
 also all his other typical ones 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.890
 His style of play plays a part 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.960
 shoot or dribble 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.119
 but this ability he has the ball 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.140
 This ability is close to the foot 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.140
 fascinates me 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.659
 in my opinion the messis 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.229
 world championship no matter if argentina 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.229
 wins or not 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.649
 if Argentina to win at the 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.299
 World Cup we would help 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.679
 undoubtedly giving him the chance to do so 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.030
 the best soccer player one 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.689
 history to compete 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.250
 namely with maradona yes if you 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.799
 I think that would be world champion 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.310
 falls to him in his career 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.450
 then finally the football god would be 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.410
 that's the best for me anyway 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.410
 Player of the world
