maybe<00:01:53.159> both<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.759> three<00:01:54.060> or<00:01:54.270> four<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:55.320> do<00:01:55.439> not

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
maybe both the three or four you do not

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.920 
maybe both the three or four you do not
even<00:01:55.770> work<00:01:56.070> here<00:01:56.100> not<00:01:56.640> even<00:01:56.909> worth<00:01:57.270> counting

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
even work here not even worth counting

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.660 
even work here not even worth counting
because<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.469> know<00:01:58.590> why<00:01:58.799> you're<00:01:59.460> putting

because you know why you're putting

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.600 
because you know why you're putting
protein<00:02:00.360> now<00:02:00.659> with<00:02:00.960> your<00:02:01.380> carrot<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.430> can

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
protein now with your carrot you can

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.100 
protein now with your carrot you can
munch<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.060> munch<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.420> carrots<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:03.990> you're

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
munch and munch on carrots and you're

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.020 
munch and munch on carrots and you're
still<00:02:04.409> hungry<00:02:04.680> you're<00:02:05.219> satisfying<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
still hungry you're satisfying the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.990 
still hungry you're satisfying the
nibble<00:02:06.329> nibble<00:02:06.479> yeah<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:07.350> you're<00:02:07.590> not

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
nibble nibble yeah but you're not

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.570 
nibble nibble yeah but you're not
getting<00:02:09.000> and

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
getting and

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.900 
getting and
protein<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.780> stop<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.320> hunger<00:02:11.770> so<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.700> can

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
protein to stop the hunger so you can

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.120 
protein to stop the hunger so you can
nibble<00:02:13.150> on<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.420> few<00:02:13.720> carrots<00:02:14.170> add<00:02:14.350> some<00:02:14.740> hummus

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
nibble on a few carrots add some hummus

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.460 
nibble on a few carrots add some hummus
you<00:02:15.430> don't<00:02:15.700> get<00:02:15.940> hungry<00:02:16.210> well<00:02:16.870> like<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.200> said

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
you don't get hungry well like you said

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.840 
you don't get hungry well like you said
carrots<00:02:17.890> if<00:02:18.010> they're<00:02:18.220> since<00:02:18.460> they're<00:02:18.610> high<00:02:18.820> in

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
carrots if they're since they're high in

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.750 
carrots if they're since they're high in
sugar<00:02:19.300> it<00:02:19.540> can<00:02:19.750> create<00:02:19.990> that<00:02:20.560> sugar<00:02:21.010> imbalance

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
sugar it can create that sugar imbalance

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.490 
sugar it can create that sugar imbalance
so<00:02:21.970> it's<00:02:22.120> not<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:22.300> protein<00:02:22.780> helps<00:02:23.230> with<00:02:23.470> that

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
so it's not a protein helps with that

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.200 
so it's not a protein helps with that
I'm<00:02:23.800> already<00:02:23.920> about<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:24.370> it's<00:02:24.640> cookies
