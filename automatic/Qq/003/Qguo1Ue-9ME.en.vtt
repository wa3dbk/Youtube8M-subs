white in the middle darker for it
actually<00:02:15.400> quite<00:02:15.819> weird<00:02:17.459> but<00:02:18.459> that's<00:02:18.550> fine

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
actually quite weird but that's fine

that's cool
I<00:02:26.170> was<00:02:26.380> actually<00:02:26.530> contemplating<00:02:27.220> if<00:02:27.280> I<00:02:27.400> should

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
I was actually contemplating if I should

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.840 
I was actually contemplating if I should
that<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:28.630> whole<00:02:28.989> head<00:02:29.260> or<00:02:29.980> do<00:02:30.130> highlights<00:02:30.550> with

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
that a whole head or do highlights with

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.610 
that a whole head or do highlights with
the<00:02:30.940> fact<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.510> streak<00:02:31.930> down<00:02:32.170> on<00:02:32.470> me

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
the fact that the streak down on me

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.290 
the fact that the streak down on me
anyway<00:02:34.050> it's<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.140> nice<00:02:35.350> lift<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:36.010> not

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
anyway it's a nice lift is not

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:48.660 
anyway it's a nice lift is not
drastically<00:02:37.300> bright<00:02:46.530> store<00:02:47.530> results<00:02:47.800> before

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
drastically bright store results before

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.420 
drastically bright store results before
I<00:02:48.700> put<00:02:48.910> in<00:02:49.030> any<00:02:49.180> styling<00:02:50.160> agents<00:02:51.160> or<00:02:51.310> anything

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
I put in any styling agents or anything

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.190 
I put in any styling agents or anything
so<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.920> is<00:02:54.130> it

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
so this is it

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.530 
so this is it
I'll<00:02:57.200> put<00:02:57.470> up<00:02:57.500> some<00:02:57.560> photos<00:02:58.070> with<00:02:58.940> my<00:02:59.180> finished

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
I'll put up some photos with my finished

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.890 
I'll put up some photos with my finished
looks<00:02:59.870> a<00:03:00.370> before<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.430> after<00:03:01.670> in<00:03:02.060> natural

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
looks a before and after in natural

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.200 
looks a before and after in natural
sunlight<00:03:03.140> so<00:03:03.620> it's<00:03:03.950> a<00:03:04.040> better<00:03:04.250> comparison<00:03:04.550> so

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:17.990
