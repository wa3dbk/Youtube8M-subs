00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hi my name is his nikitin no matter 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.690
 beginner or need an experienced specialist 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.760
 tips that I will give in this video 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.059
 help you make your projects even 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.549
 better creation of materials is the basis 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.220
 any visualizations as you know and from 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.170
 how much your quality will be 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.539
 scene materials will depend 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.369
 how realistic is your project 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.170
 that is, the dependency is essentially direct than 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.140
 the better the material the better the final 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.539
 the result of your project here are a few 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.880
 Tips to give first 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.100
 first step 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.559
 you need to open photoshop and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.510
 prepare those textures that you 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.640
 going to use your material 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.070
 if this tree is appropriate 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.160
 find the wood texture make of it 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.230
 seamless texture for defense and then from 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.170
 this texture de plus seamless already 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.840
 make cards for the bank to reflect for 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.789
 gloss and so on good texture is 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.250
 in fact, the key to success and not worth it 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.920
 this underestimate half the materials 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.149
 very well tuned very 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.460
 greatly lose due to the fact that 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.920
 poor quality texture used in 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.450
 second, select the type of material after 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.330
 like wushu texture give us ready 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.490
 choose the type of material for most 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.350
 cases fits faith mtf this 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.659
 Is it standard raevsky material which 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.330
 in 90 percent of cases used 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.970
 but if you do for example tulle or 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.780
 lamp shade or some kind of fabric 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.670
 which does not shine through color but a 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.570
 illuminated by light from the inside then better 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.230
 just use 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.360
 faith and that will come down here in this example 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.960
 if you create for example a complex layered 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.720
 material 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.660
 like an old dresser with stains of paint 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.550
 or his and not 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.880
 there are some complicated effects 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.680
 cracks world hollows so on then in this 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.810
 case you need a door blend 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.600
 if these effects are many then they need 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.240
 make built do it possible with 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.390
 using the game and goin ' material in 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.310
 third, first set the diffuse color 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.470
 that is, put on it prepared 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.190
 texture overlay this texture then on 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.070
 check the object so that there are no seams in 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.110
 the joints of these textures to size 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.660
 the texture was right pick the right one 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.380
 size and definitely recommend 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.770
 use 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.630
 Real-world map site that is true 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.690
 sizes so to speak when you ask 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.610
 the size of your texture in millimeters is not 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.209
 each time you set tons through styling 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.610
 parameter 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.680
 asked in millimeters and you have at all 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.270
 objects this texture with the same 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.360
 size is not necessary every time 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.320
 and and tune in the fourths turn on 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.450
 necessarily frene 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.500
 that is, the reflection on the outhouse they give 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.650
 more correct 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.370
 correct physically correct result 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.130
 2014 3d max 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.950
 and 3 doors, in principle, this parameter is already 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.630
 set by default ie it 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.050
 need to be included specifically if you donâ€™t 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.700
 need configure refract and thief exactly 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.170
 refract and word, that is, this 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.810
 parameters which is responsible for 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.310
 refraction in a transparent object and at 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.830
 same time same parameter 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.290
 regulates just took dior that is 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:11.850
 it can of course be customized through 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:14.250
 tick separately but generally correct 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.000
 will use a refractor this one and 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.510
 same set up reflection ie force 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.799
 reflection is just a color for now 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.900
 reflection actually is at all 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.660
 absolute materials even if 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.760
 roll of toilet paper wallpaper on the wall 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.510
 either some kind of stucco which 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.180
 Overall, it seems like a matte euro 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.120
 would be a reflection there should not be at the very 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.370
 In fact, they are simply in this case with 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.319
 matte materials were going to be very 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.659
 blurred reflection will not be so 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.480
 strong i mean if you bet here 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:50.769
 black to white that value there 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.840
 It is typically in the range of 10-15 and the parameter 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.920
 glossiness that is reflect class us 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:00.099
 will be within there 1 and 4 to 0 6 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.760
 it will give you matt black accordingly 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:06.010
 it is not bad to take into account here 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.109
 brdm parameter that is what you have 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.639
 damn and ward is used if 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:12.760
 matte material is best 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:15.220
 use exactly cooking then 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.620
 add a card to bam to add 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.820
 all the relief even the map which you 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.570
 they were preparing photoshop 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.940
 use it and after 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.479
 these are all basic base part settings 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.020
 so to speak 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:31.630
 do a trial render you are looking here 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.000
 at this stage are you really 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.680
 done as you need all or 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.750
 looks basically ok i mean 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.930
 After these settings, the material should already 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.180
 be quite similar to itself on how 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.830
 it must look real and if it is 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.780
 not so you need to deliver to 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.800
 Now configure these materials current 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.110
 to achieve in correct reflections 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.699
 exactly glossiness to force 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.139
 poisoning consistent with reality and 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:02.880
 so on only after that already stands 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:06.210
 proceed to the next configuration step 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.380
 textures for reflection for glossiness 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.240
 add some extra layers 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.990
 scratched if it 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.150
 materials 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.430
 1 and so on, that is, after that 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.310
 the process of material complications begins 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.530
 until you have achieved good quality with 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.670
 basic settings that are listed 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.320
 for this you do not even start 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.810
 include more advanced so let's say 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.980
 parameter adjustment of all parameters 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.990
 at the same time 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.190
 this is the same as solving equations in 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.530
 which 10 unknowns 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.720
 more unknown parameters 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.940
 correspondingly harder to understand what 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.060
 really need to change therefore 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.370
 try first to work with basic 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.460
 settings and after that when received 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.740
 good result already act in 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.450
 complication side 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.670
 some more tips for example for 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.320
 tissues you can use a favor card 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.750
 in order to highlight a little 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.210
 the areas we look at under the sharp 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.280
 angle you probably saw such examples 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.850
 when the fabric is at a little angle 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.010
 glows 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:09.910
 not necessarily white but often 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:12.130
 lighter than the color of the fabric is also possible 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.410
 add a map of them to mix 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.720
 for example the bump of the main fabric that is 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.580
 its very structure and additionally 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.100
 add there another bank card with 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.800
 folds like the material crushed and 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.980
 then laid out like this 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.440
 an example to eliminate this 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.980
 those minimal recommendations that I 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.920
 I can give you now quickly further 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:39.400
 video we will deal in detail with examples 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.580
 similar materials with how 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.230
 use and analyze the major errors 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.540
