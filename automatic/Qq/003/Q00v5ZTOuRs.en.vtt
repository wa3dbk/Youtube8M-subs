00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.400 
know I was able to build my confidence
up<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.609> that<00:00:59.609> was<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.270> know<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.660> was<00:01:00.989> able<00:01:01.379> to

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
happy with the result we've actually

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.890 
happy with the result we've actually
seen<00:01:11.400> like<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.760> lot<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.000> gragas<00:01:12.420> being<00:01:12.630> chose

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
seen like a lot of gragas being chose

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.480 
seen like a lot of gragas being chose
just<00:01:13.170> because<00:01:13.409> mid<00:01:13.590> lane<00:01:13.770> seems<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.159> be<00:01:14.220> banned

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
just because mid lane seems to be banned

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.520 
just because mid lane seems to be banned
out<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> lot<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> lot<00:01:15.990> easier<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.350> be

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
out a lot is it a lot easier to be

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.530 
out a lot is it a lot easier to be
consistent<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.400> Orianna<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:18.210> because<00:01:18.420> of

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
consistent with Orianna just because of

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.149 
consistent with Orianna just because of
how<00:01:18.689> our<00:01:18.840> ultimate<00:01:19.259> works<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.740> course

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
how our ultimate works of course

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.920 
how our ultimate works of course
Gragas<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> lot<00:01:20.909> more<00:01:21.000> skill<00:01:21.240> shots<00:01:21.509> as

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
Gragas is a lot more skill shots as

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.870 
Gragas is a lot more skill shots as
ultimate<00:01:22.290> works<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.619> certain<00:01:22.860> way<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.189> guess

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
ultimate works in a certain way I guess

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.130 
ultimate works in a certain way I guess
yeah<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> lot<00:01:24.570> more<00:01:24.689> easier<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:24.990> be<00:01:25.110> I

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
yeah is it a lot more easier to be I

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.530 
yeah is it a lot more easier to be I
guess<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.650> more<00:01:26.280> consistent<00:01:26.729> with<00:01:27.090> orianna's

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
guess can more consistent with orianna's

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.730 
guess can more consistent with orianna's
thing<00:01:27.689> or<00:01:27.990> excuse<00:01:28.590> me

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
thing or excuse me

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.440 
thing or excuse me
Oriana<00:01:29.369> then<00:01:29.700> Gragas<00:01:30.619> so<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.159> do<00:01:32.700> think<00:01:33.390> that

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
Oriana then Gragas so I I do think that

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.450 
Oriana then Gragas so I I do think that
gravis<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.970> more<00:01:35.970> difficult<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.420> play<00:01:36.540> because

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
gravis is more difficult to play because

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.780 
gravis is more difficult to play because
gravis<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.700> melee<00:01:39.689> character<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.610> need

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
gravis is a melee character so you need

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.170 
gravis is a melee character so you need
to<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.150> really<00:01:42.420> experienced<00:01:43.110> playing<00:01:43.320> him<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
to be really experienced playing him and

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.840 
to be really experienced playing him and
also<00:01:45.180> his<00:01:45.720> ultimate<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.470> really<00:01:47.220> difficult<00:01:47.460> to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
also his ultimate is really difficult to

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.990 
also his ultimate is really difficult to
land<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.320> know<00:01:49.439> use<00:01:49.710> well<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.340> yeah<00:01:50.970> I

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
land and you know use well so yeah I

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.450 
land and you know use well so yeah I
think<00:01:51.450> all<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.200> tougher<00:01:52.829> champion<00:01:53.369> to

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
think all this is a tougher champion to

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.999 
think all this is a tougher champion to
play<00:01:54.170> one<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> things<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.619> we<00:01:55.710> noticed

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
play one of the things that we noticed

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.950 
play one of the things that we noticed
anyway<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.399> when<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.969> did<00:01:57.149> play<00:01:57.329> or<00:01:57.509> jnana<00:01:57.780> you

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
anyway is when you did play or jnana you

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.469 
anyway is when you did play or jnana you
tended<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.649> pick<00:01:58.799> champions<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.759> would<00:02:00.299> help

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
tended to pick champions that would help

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.600 
tended to pick champions that would help
you<00:02:00.570> deliver<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.079> ball<00:02:01.259> especially<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.490> know

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
for your ultimate can you maybe talk a

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.600 
for your ultimate can you maybe talk a
