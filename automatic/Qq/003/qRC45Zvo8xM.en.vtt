00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:06.470
 hello gourmets friends if last week 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.019
 teaches you to be an appetizer of the 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.150
 Spanish cuisine today I'm going to show you a 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.419
 appetizer of international cuisine that 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.580
 you can do in just 5 minutes to 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:20.860
 to do this recipe we're going to need a 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.750
 cabernet of course an egg 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.270
 bread crumbs 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.730
 frying oil 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.680
 and red fruit jam first thing 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.680
 what we do is catch egg and beat it 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.230
 and success in action 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.050
 once beaten on the egg we wet the 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.050
 change in green 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.000
 d 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.000
 right now 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.960
 to me 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.880
 and then we do the same with the bread 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.110
 grated 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.980
 everything comes back they're on 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.980
 moneychanger 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.040
 we already have the paper ready for frying 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.760
 we remove the rest of the egg 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.280
 we take a small pan 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.190
 and we put them at a fairly high heat 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.410
 for example, on the 8th , we put oil 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.210
 fry 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.290
 abundant we hope it will warm up a 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.230
 bit 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.330
 two or three minutes and when we see that 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.160
 the oil is hot 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.370
 we take the camembert that we have 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.910
 exceeded before then carefully to 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.910
 Do not splash 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.259
 but I usually put below the 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.259
 spatula 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.829
 well let's see that it is going to last a 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.829
 little we turn it around 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.830
 after 23 minutes 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.379
 I give it back again so that 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.069
 go back to catch some heat again 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.069
 up 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.900
 you 'll see how it's going to end up bloating 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.610
 in fact I just also throw a 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.340
 spoon a little oil for this 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.020
 up so that I really was very 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.930
 liquid inside that is what 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.930
 we want when it's more good 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.470
 when we see since it swells a lot 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.470
 he is in danger of exploiting 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.030
 we take them out because then it is that 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.010
 the history 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.840
 we prepare first a dish with a 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.170
 napkin to take some of 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.060
 oil 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.060
 but you have to eat it pretty fast 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.810
 we assemble everything in a little dish with some 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.030
 few toast and marmalade 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:30.070
 blueberries and you'll see how we have left 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:33.900
 this rich change see super batter 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:36.520
 fast super simple and super good 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.130
 guaranteed 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.620
 dear doctors certainly do not forget
