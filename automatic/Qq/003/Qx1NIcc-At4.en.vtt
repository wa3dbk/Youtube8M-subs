00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.990
 cycling here in baja california 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.120

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.159
 and then yes they continue to follow the 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:58.209
 moment of cycling here on low 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:04:02.159
 california so to get the 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.159
 sport here cycling 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.560
 we know that it is a great event that 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.390
 can you tell the youth to support the 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.440
 sport but then first of all 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.450
 motions because you are here 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.890
 present and the reality is that good 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.380
 this type of events the only purpose that 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.480
 has is to start the health the fun 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.710
 in family and obviously this goes 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.930
 routed nothing else to adults 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.160
 but also young people to children to 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.630
 the elderly people who 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.820
 been participating and women 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.160
 young girls define everyone in 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.200
 general and the important thing of this is that 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.430
 we have great taste because it makes us 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.800
 one more answer from the others 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.169

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.280
 How long does it take to organize 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:47.370

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.780
 that they could support us what they are 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.210

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.590
