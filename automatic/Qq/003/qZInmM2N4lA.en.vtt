00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.710
 hello and welcome to a new building tutorial in adobe photoshop 

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:13.719
 in which evo and explain how to put hits behind an image 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.910
 for this we are going to use the quick mask tool 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.230
 from any other tool that allows us to select any area 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:27.829
 OK to activate 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.529
 the kanepi the quick mask the quick mask twig 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.760
 we urge the brush who dedicated neither fabric that down 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.150
 but the first thing we have to do in our image is to duplicate them 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.700
 control j 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.370
 well we have it here duplicated 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.770
 we click our intel 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.230
 in the icon of down 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.320
 the first thing to select 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.650
 paint size 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.710
 and its hardness 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.790
 and we will start painting 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.810
 anyway 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.840
 about what we want to select we have to 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.840
 it gets a reddish color 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.440
 this means that you are not selecting 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.360
 we have selected 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.730
 the area that is 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.340
 enough with 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.160
 of suffering 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.260
 drop the pisco no 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.550
 and here we see the selection 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.550
 this police scheme or I have advance 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.760
 percent share what we have 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.840
 what to delete 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.600
 old 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 press the key to delete 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.940
 I already have to go 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.470
 and now the last percent and we need already 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.170
 expose 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.380
 the rest tool 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.380
 we leave the text 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.900
 we ask you what we want 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.230
 those who entered a bit 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.320
 to our fair 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.129
 and now to give us 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.299
 that aspect that comes out in the magazines say 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.269
 we are going to 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.269
 the text layer the socialist spokesperson 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:22.699
 and so we have stayed 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:24.479
 as a final 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:25.999
 well this has been all 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:29.269
 eel as you see by its very simple defect 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.609
 and it looks very good 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:33.999
 and good 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:36.919
 Nothing more to say and thank you very much
