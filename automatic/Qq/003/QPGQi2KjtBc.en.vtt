the<00:01:01.620> first<00:01:01.800> thing<00:01:01.949> I'll<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.129> reviewing<00:01:03.170> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the first thing I'll be reviewing the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.500 
the first thing I'll be reviewing the
bushings<00:01:04.619> are<00:01:04.799> fairly<00:01:05.100> hard<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:06.240> can't

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
bushings are fairly hard you can't

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.850 
bushings are fairly hard you can't
really<00:01:06.810> bend<00:01:07.200> them<00:01:07.700> super<00:01:08.700> easy<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.860> these

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
really bend them super easy and these

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.270 
really bend them super easy and these
are<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.310> my<00:01:12.000> trucks<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.780> bolt<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.409> like

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
are on my trucks that bolt is on like

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.640 
are on my trucks that bolt is on like
about<00:01:14.670> as<00:01:14.790> loose<00:01:15.030> as<00:01:15.090> they<00:01:15.360> can<00:01:15.570> go<00:01:17.479> as<00:01:18.530> you<00:01:19.530> can

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
about as loose as they can go as you can

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.690 
about as loose as they can go as you can
see<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.659> really<00:01:24.840> don't<00:01:25.110> have<00:01:25.320> like

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
see and so you really don't have like

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.210 
see and so you really don't have like
like<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> super<00:01:27.330> small<00:01:27.570> turning<00:01:27.960> radius<00:01:28.320> but

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
like a super small turning radius but

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.149 
like a super small turning radius but
they're<00:01:29.430> just<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:30.630> decent<00:01:31.020> they<00:01:31.710> also<00:01:31.890> come

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
they're just like decent they also come

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.350 
they're just like decent they also come
with<00:01:32.189> washers<00:01:32.820> inside<00:01:33.500> like<00:01:34.670> for<00:01:35.670> washers<00:01:36.180> and

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
with washers inside like for washers and

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.109 
with washers inside like for washers and
for<00:01:36.540> bushing<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:36.990> total<00:01:37.460> two<00:01:38.460> small<00:01:38.729> washers

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
for bushing in total two small washers

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.999 
for bushing in total two small washers
two<00:01:39.299> big<00:01:39.450> washers<00:01:39.900> two<00:01:40.079> small<00:01:40.350> bushings<00:01:40.710> two

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
two big washers two small bushings two

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.289 
two big washers two small bushings two
big<00:01:41.220> bushings<00:01:42.200> if<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.409> only<00:01:44.399> had<00:01:44.790> Technic

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
big bushings if you only had Technic

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.020 
big bushings if you only had Technic
bushings<00:01:45.840> before<00:01:46.399> these<00:01:47.399> are<00:01:47.549> pretty<00:01:47.759> good

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
bushings before these are pretty good

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.740 
bushings before these are pretty good
because<00:01:49.040> they<00:01:50.040> will<00:01:50.280> stop<00:01:50.549> your<00:01:50.759> trucks<00:01:51.570> from

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
because they will stop your trucks from

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.569 
because they will stop your trucks from
my<00:01:52.110> kind<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.439> wobbling<00:01:52.890> from<00:01:52.950> corner<00:01:53.549> to

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
my kind of wobbling from corner to

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.260 
my kind of wobbling from corner to
corner<00:01:55.399> yeah<00:01:56.399> that's<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:56.790> basically<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
corner yeah that's like basically the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.609 
corner yeah that's like basically the
only<00:01:57.360> thing<00:01:57.479> are<00:01:57.689> good<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:58.020> unless<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.409> like

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
only thing are good for unless you like

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.190 
only thing are good for unless you like
tight<00:01:58.860> trucks<00:01:59.299> referent<00:02:00.299> for<00:02:00.329> looser<00:02:00.930> trucks

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
tight trucks referent for looser trucks

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.170 
tight trucks referent for looser trucks
the<00:02:01.680> next<00:02:01.979> thing<00:02:02.159> I'll<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.369> reviewing<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
the next thing I'll be reviewing is the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.730 
the next thing I'll be reviewing is the
thing<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.600> probably<00:02:03.810> hook<00:02:04.110> on<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.439> video

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
thing you probably hook on this video

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.290 
thing you probably hook on this video
for<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.659> tape<00:02:07.640> now<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.700> tape<00:02:09.060> it

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
for and that is the tape now the tape it

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.559 
for and that is the tape now the tape it
takes<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.629> little<00:02:09.869> while<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.170> wear<00:02:10.500> in<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
takes a little while to wear in so the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.110 
takes a little while to wear in so the
one<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:13.049> haven't<00:02:13.439> put<00:02:13.560> on<00:02:13.590> anything<00:02:14.120> obviously

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
one I haven't put on anything obviously

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.849 
one I haven't put on anything obviously
and<00:02:16.109> this<00:02:16.379> one<00:02:17.659> I've<00:02:18.659> had<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.079> for<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.590> while<00:02:19.650> but

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
and this one I've had it for a while but

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.259 
and this one I've had it for a while but
I<00:02:19.920> don't<00:02:20.069> really<00:02:20.159> use<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.489> deck<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:20.969> it's<00:02:21.120> not

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
I don't really use this deck so it's not

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.569 
I don't really use this deck so it's not
very<00:02:21.510> grippy<00:02:21.900> at<00:02:21.989> all<00:02:22.109> it<00:02:22.260> worn<00:02:22.499> in<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.980> this

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
very grippy at all it worn in and this

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.289 
very grippy at all it worn in and this
one<00:02:23.879> it's<00:02:24.150> very<00:02:24.269> warming<00:02:25.069> so<00:02:26.069> like<00:02:26.939> I<00:02:27.060> said

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
one it's very warming so like I said

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.879 
one it's very warming so like I said
when<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.569> first<00:02:27.749> get<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.079> it's<00:02:28.230> like<00:02:28.409> hardly

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:28.889 
when you first get it it's like hardly

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.640 
when you first get it it's like hardly
grippy<00:02:29.340> at<00:02:29.430> all<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.930> probably<00:02:31.109> won't<00:02:31.469> be<00:02:31.620> able

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
grippy at all you probably won't be able

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.649 
grippy at all you probably won't be able
to<00:02:31.859> like<00:02:32.010> get<00:02:32.189> all<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.579> your<00:02:32.670> tricks<00:02:32.969> down<00:02:33.209> like

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
to like get all of your tricks down like

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.140 
to like get all of your tricks down like
if<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:34.139> put<00:02:35.099> this<00:02:35.219> on<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.430> deck<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.700> normally

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
if you put this on a deck you normally

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.129 
if you put this on a deck you normally
use<00:02:36.180> with<00:02:36.510> like<00:02:36.689> grippier<00:02:37.200> tape<00:02:38.090> but<00:02:39.139> it's

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
use with like grippier tape but it's

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:45.140 
use with like grippier tape but it's
just<00:02:40.469> me<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.639> has<00:02:42.919> pretty<00:02:43.919> big<00:02:44.189> pores<00:02:44.519> they're

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
just me it has pretty big pores they're

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.409 
just me it has pretty big pores they're
also<00:02:45.299> kind<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.629> sparkly<00:02:47.000> do<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.090> want<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.299> see

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:48.419 
also kind of sparkly do you want to see

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.149 
also kind of sparkly do you want to see
the<00:02:48.540> texture<00:02:48.959> maybe<00:02:49.590> better

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
the texture maybe better

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.259 
the texture maybe better
I<00:02:52.189> wouldn't<00:02:53.189> particularly<00:02:53.489> recommend<00:02:54.180> the

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
I wouldn't particularly recommend the

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:54.830 
I wouldn't particularly recommend the
tape

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
tape

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.000 
tape
like<00:02:55.560> it's<00:02:55.949> just<00:02:56.129> decent<00:02:56.939> step<00:02:57.900> up<00:02:58.079> Roma<00:02:58.590> tech

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
like it's just decent step up Roma tech

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.619 
like it's just decent step up Roma tech
decks<00:02:59.250> like<00:02:59.549> I<00:02:59.579> um

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
decks like I um

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.369 
decks like I um
the<00:03:01.019> bushings<00:03:02.120> but<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.419> had<00:03:03.689> honestly<00:03:03.870> prefer

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
the bushings but I had honestly prefer

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.379 
the bushings but I had honestly prefer
like<00:03:04.709> four<00:03:05.099> corner<00:03:05.340> finger<00:03:05.639> boards<00:03:05.939> tape<00:03:06.180> over

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
like four corner finger boards tape over

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.589 
like four corner finger boards tape over
this<00:03:06.750> just<00:03:07.109> because<00:03:07.379> it's<00:03:07.530> like<00:03:07.769> grippier<00:03:08.599> but

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
this just because it's like grippier but

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.159 
this just because it's like grippier but
it<00:03:09.900> does<00:03:10.109> grip<00:03:10.439> very<00:03:10.709> cleanly<00:03:11.840> this<00:03:12.840> edge<00:03:12.989> is<00:03:13.139> a

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
it does grip very cleanly this edge is a

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.259 
it does grip very cleanly this edge is a
bit<00:03:13.349> old<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:13.769> it's<00:03:13.919> not<00:03:14.010> super<00:03:14.219> clean<00:03:14.579> but<00:03:15.239> also

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
bit old so it's not super clean but also

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.809 
bit old so it's not super clean but also
it<00:03:16.169> is<00:03:16.199> very<00:03:16.500> easy<00:03:16.889> to<00:03:16.979> it<00:03:17.069> like<00:03:17.189> cut<00:03:17.459> designs

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
it is very easy to it like cut designs

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.629 
it is very easy to it like cut designs
into<00:03:18.530> like<00:03:19.530> these<00:03:19.799> two<00:03:21.829> um<00:03:22.829> there's<00:03:23.400> not

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
into like these two um there's not

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.390 
into like these two um there's not
really<00:03:23.879> much<00:03:24.120> else<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.419> say<00:03:24.689> about<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.989> it<00:03:25.530> just

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
really much else to say about it it just

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.770 
really much else to say about it it just
takes<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.180> while<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.359> get<00:03:27.689> worn<00:03:27.959> in<00:03:28.229> and<00:03:29.780> that's

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
takes a while to get worn in and that's

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.629 
takes a while to get worn in and that's
the<00:03:30.989> only<00:03:31.139> thing<00:03:31.169> actually<00:03:31.709> say<00:03:32.040> about<00:03:32.069> it

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
the only thing actually say about it

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.949 
the only thing actually say about it
the<00:03:33.060> next<00:03:33.359> thing<00:03:33.599> are<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.319> stickers<00:03:34.909> so<00:03:35.959> the

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
the next thing are the stickers so the

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.059 
the next thing are the stickers so the
stickers<00:03:38.599> they're<00:03:39.599> actually<00:03:40.049> pretty<00:03:40.439> good<00:03:40.769> I

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
stickers they're actually pretty good I

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.530 
stickers they're actually pretty good I
like<00:03:41.250> these<00:03:41.400> because<00:03:41.609> they're<00:03:41.879> they<00:03:42.150> can<00:03:42.299> fit

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
like these because they're they can fit

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.960 
like these because they're they can fit
on<00:03:42.629> a<00:03:42.659> deck<00:03:43.019> unlike<00:03:43.919> most<00:03:44.129> stickers<00:03:44.609> which<00:03:44.819> you

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
on a deck unlike most stickers which you

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.649 
on a deck unlike most stickers which you
can<00:03:45.120> just<00:03:45.299> put<00:03:45.479> on<00:03:45.509> ramps<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:47.509> also<00:03:48.509> they're

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
can just put on ramps and also they're

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.740 
can just put on ramps and also they're
all<00:03:48.840> clear<00:03:49.319> like<00:03:49.889> on<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.189> edges<00:03:50.609> so<00:03:50.849> they<00:03:51.479> look

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
all clear like on the edges so they look

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.069 
all clear like on the edges so they look
nice<00:03:51.989> on<00:03:52.259> a<00:03:52.319> blank<00:03:52.650> deck<00:03:53.780> so<00:03:54.780> they're<00:03:54.930> just

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
nice on a blank deck so they're just

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.339 
nice on a blank deck so they're just
some<00:03:55.259> examples<00:03:55.769> that<00:03:55.799> I<00:03:55.919> did<00:03:56.069> it<00:03:56.159> with<00:03:56.310> them<00:03:56.489> so

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
some examples that I did it with them so

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.110 
some examples that I did it with them so
these<00:03:58.349> are<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.590> ones<00:03:58.739> that<00:03:59.069> of<00:03:59.669> course<00:03:59.939> I<00:04:00.060> took

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
these are the ones that of course I took

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.240 
these are the ones that of course I took
off<00:04:00.449> of<00:04:00.569> here<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.019> just<00:04:01.139> to<00:04:01.769> show<00:04:01.979> you<00:04:02.040> what

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
off of here and just to show you what

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.640 
off of here and just to show you what
they<00:04:02.370> look<00:04:02.400> like<00:04:03.829> it's<00:04:04.829> like<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.069> tiny<00:04:06.650> Black

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
they look like it's like a tiny Black

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.479 
they look like it's like a tiny Black
River<00:04:08.900> red<00:04:09.900> one<00:04:10.099> and<00:04:11.509> then<00:04:12.859> you<00:04:13.859> can<00:04:13.919> see<00:04:14.310> it

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
River red one and then you can see it

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.879 
River red one and then you can see it
the<00:04:14.789> black<00:04:15.090> river<00:04:15.269> ramps<00:04:15.750> it's<00:04:16.440> kind<00:04:16.739> of<00:04:16.769> like

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
the black river ramps it's kind of like

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.019 
the black river ramps it's kind of like
a<00:04:16.919> strip<00:04:17.340> with<00:04:17.909> schools<00:04:18.509> on<00:04:18.690> top<00:04:18.870> of<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.199> and

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:20.029 
a strip with schools on top of it and

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:24.550 
a strip with schools on top of it and
one<00:04:21.029> in<00:04:21.359> this<00:04:21.510> little<00:04:21.870> circle<00:04:22.800> in<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.010> grip

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
one in this little circle in the grip

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.260 
one in this little circle in the grip
and<00:04:24.710> then<00:04:25.130> another<00:04:25.400> one<00:04:25.730> on<00:04:25.970> this<00:04:26.620> purple<00:04:27.620> deck

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.430 

so<00:04:32.270> far<00:04:32.510> they<00:04:32.630> seem<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:32.990> be<00:04:33.110> somewhat<00:04:33.980> durable

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
so far they seem to be somewhat durable

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.580 
so far they seem to be somewhat durable
but<00:04:36.440> yeah<00:04:37.400> they're<00:04:38.300> just<00:04:38.480> they<00:04:38.990> look<00:04:39.320> really

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
but yeah they're just they look really

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:46.090 
but yeah they're just they look really
cool<00:04:39.800> I<00:04:39.860> guess<00:04:42.670> yeah<00:04:43.670> there's<00:04:44.300> really<00:04:45.100> nothing

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
cool I guess yeah there's really nothing

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.310 
cool I guess yeah there's really nothing
else<00:04:46.160> to<00:04:46.310> say<00:04:46.550> about<00:04:46.580> stickers<00:04:47.300> they're<00:04:48.170> just

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
else to say about stickers they're just

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.510 
else to say about stickers they're just
kind<00:04:48.500> of<00:04:48.560> like<00:04:48.830> what<00:04:49.220> you<00:04:49.400> would<00:04:49.520> expect<00:04:51.520> yeah

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
kind of like what you would expect yeah
