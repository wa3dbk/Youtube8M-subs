mixed<00:00:22.260> copper<00:00:22.769> aluminum<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.430> it's<00:00:24.029> worth<00:00:24.180> a

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
mixed copper aluminum and it's worth a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.019 
mixed copper aluminum and it's worth a
heck<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.720> lot<00:00:24.840> more<00:00:25.310> than<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.340> aluminum

end off and this end off in two seconds
then<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.110> fins<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:41.070> copper<00:00:41.399> fins<00:00:42.230> whatever

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
then the fins the copper fins whatever

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.850 
then the fins the copper fins whatever
is<00:00:43.770> there<00:00:43.980> they're<00:00:44.760> gonna<00:00:44.879> scrap<00:00:45.210> them<00:00:45.360> as<00:00:45.510> is

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
is there they're gonna scrap them as is

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.930 
is there they're gonna scrap them as is
if<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.980> bury<00:00:47.190> them<00:00:47.280> too<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.730> you're

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
if you bury them too like this you're

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.790 
if you bury them too like this you're
losing<00:00:48.270> money<00:00:48.450> basically<00:00:49.140> what<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.620> want<00:00:49.770> to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
losing money basically what you want to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.040 
losing money basically what you want to
do<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.100> take<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.399> steel<00:00:50.730> up<00:00:50.960> separate<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
do is take the steel up separate the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.720 
do is take the steel up separate the
steel<00:00:52.320> from<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.590> aluminum<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.340> get<00:00:53.520> more

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
steel from the aluminum you get more

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.209 
steel from the aluminum you get more
money<00:00:54.170> it's<00:00:55.170> always<00:00:55.320> gonna<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> way<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.100> is

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
money it's always gonna be the way it is

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.090 
money it's always gonna be the way it is
in<00:00:56.370> every<00:00:56.579> strand<00:00:56.879> right<00:00:57.530> these<00:00:58.530> copper<00:00:58.920> bits

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
in every strand right these copper bits

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.470 
in every strand right these copper bits
is<00:00:59.309> number<00:00:59.520> two<00:00:59.670> copper<00:01:00.090> because<00:01:00.239> they're

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
is number two copper because they're

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.080 
is number two copper because they're
solder<00:01:00.750> joints<00:01:01.140> inside<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.370> you

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
solder joints inside here you can you

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.179 
solder joints inside here you can you
can<00:01:03.180> sell<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.510> two<00:01:03.780> separately<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.040> my

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
can sell that two separately this is my

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.570 
can sell that two separately this is my
axe<00:01:05.369> I'm<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.630> hit<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.840> with<00:01:06.930> my<00:01:06.960> axe<00:01:07.580> cuz

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
axe I'm going to hit it with my axe cuz

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:25.260 
axe I'm going to hit it with my axe cuz
that's<00:01:08.850> what<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.619> not<00:01:10.710> gonna<00:01:10.860> work

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.669 

I<00:01:26.280> guess<00:01:27.280> then<00:01:27.490> not<00:01:28.119> gonna<00:01:28.240> work<00:01:28.560> work<00:01:29.560> a

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
I guess then not gonna work work a

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:36.359 
I guess then not gonna work work a
little<00:01:29.920> better<00:01:30.100> if<00:01:30.159> you<00:01:30.280> had<00:01:30.429> a<00:01:30.460> hammer<00:01:30.729> I<00:01:35.369> have

little better if you had a hammer I have

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.700 
little better if you had a hammer I have
a<00:01:36.399> steel<00:01:36.729> blade<00:01:36.969> what<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:38.049> heck

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
a steel blade what the heck

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.559 
a steel blade what the heck
every<00:01:39.610> time<00:01:40.350> every<00:01:41.350> time<00:01:41.469> I<00:01:41.679> record<00:01:42.039> in<00:01:42.189> here

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
every time every time I record in here

00:01:42.569 --> 00:02:05.249 
every time every time I record in here
battery<00:01:43.569> dies<00:01:44.759> what<00:01:45.759> is<00:01:45.880> up<00:01:46.149> yo

okay<00:02:06.259> this<00:02:07.220> is<00:02:07.369> a<00:02:07.400> reciprocating<00:02:08.000> sum<00:02:08.420> is<00:02:08.840> it

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
okay this is a reciprocating sum is it

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:25.660 
okay this is a reciprocating sum is it
for<00:02:09.080> demolition<00:02:09.350> alive

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.229 

guts<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.880> those<00:02:27.060> no<00:02:27.390> problem<00:02:28.430> okay<00:02:29.430> now<00:02:30.090> that

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
guts to those no problem okay now that

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.710 
guts to those no problem okay now that
I've<00:02:30.360> cut<00:02:30.569> through<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:31.790> this<00:02:32.790> saw<00:02:33.150> blade<00:02:33.180> is

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
I've cut through that this saw blade is

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.839 
I've cut through that this saw blade is
as<00:02:34.260> dull<00:02:34.590> as<00:02:34.830> it's<00:02:35.040> ever<00:02:35.220> been

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
as dull as it's ever been

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:43.759 
as dull as it's ever been
I<00:02:39.739> use<00:02:40.739> them<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.069> lot<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.630> I<00:02:42.630> wear<00:02:42.840> them<00:02:42.989> out<00:02:43.140> and

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
I use them a lot and I wear them out and

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.920 
I use them a lot and I wear them out and
that<00:02:44.519> saw<00:02:44.670> blade<00:02:44.700> was<00:02:45.060> dull<00:02:45.269> so<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.780> don't

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
that saw blade was dull so you don't

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.880 
that saw blade was dull so you don't
need<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.200> best<00:02:46.410> top-of-the-line

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890

steel<00:02:53.400> plate<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:55.200> believe<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.069> duct<00:02:56.400> about

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
steel plate I I believe the duct about

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.210 
steel plate I I believe the duct about
15<00:02:57.120> cents<00:02:57.569> per<00:02:57.630> pound<00:02:58.049> that<00:02:58.319> scrap<00:02:58.680> yards<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.040> go

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
15 cents per pound that scrap yards I go

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.850 
15 cents per pound that scrap yards I go
to<00:02:59.280> for<00:03:00.209> not<00:03:00.420> having<00:03:00.720> remove<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.170> now<00:03:01.860> this

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
to for not having remove this now this

let me show you the difference between

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.000 
let me show you the difference between
aluminum<00:03:48.150> radiators<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.930> MCL<00:03:49.530> which<00:03:49.860> is

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
aluminum radiators and MCL which is

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.790 
aluminum radiators and MCL which is
mixed<00:03:50.190> copper<00:03:50.610> aluminum<00:03:51.000> radiators<00:03:51.620> this<00:03:52.620> is

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
mixed copper aluminum radiators this is

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.090 
mixed copper aluminum radiators this is
MCL<00:03:53.430> if<00:03:53.880> you<00:03:54.150> cut<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.690> ends<00:03:55.020> off<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.500> you<00:03:55.830> look

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
MCL if you cut the ends off and you look

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.630 
MCL if you cut the ends off and you look
in<00:03:56.310> it

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
in it

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.380 
in it
you<00:03:56.910> can<00:03:57.150> see<00:03:57.420> copper<00:03:58.610> there's<00:03:59.610> copper<00:04:00.150> lines

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
you can see copper there's copper lines

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.240 
you can see copper there's copper lines
running<00:04:00.810> through<00:04:01.260> this<00:04:01.380> this<00:04:01.860> is<00:04:02.010> not

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
running through this this is not

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.690 
running through this this is not
aluminum<00:04:02.850> this<00:04:03.510> is<00:04:03.630> aluminum<00:04:03.930> fin<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.800> this

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
aluminum this is aluminum fin and this

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.790 
aluminum this is aluminum fin and this
is<00:04:05.880> like<00:04:06.060> an<00:04:06.270> aluminum<00:04:06.600> foil<00:04:07.110> that<00:04:07.410> they<00:04:07.590> put

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
is like an aluminum foil that they put

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.370 
is like an aluminum foil that they put
on<00:04:07.950> it<00:04:08.130> scrap<00:04:09.000> yards<00:04:09.330> have<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.480> better<00:04:09.810> price<00:04:10.140> in

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
on it scrap yards have a better price in

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.770 
on it scrap yards have a better price in
this<00:04:10.590> than<00:04:11.130> any<00:04:11.520> other<00:04:11.640> aluminum<00:04:12.330> radiator

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
this than any other aluminum radiator

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.230 
this than any other aluminum radiator
