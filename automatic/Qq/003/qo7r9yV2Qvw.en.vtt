00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
k-tec be first introduced on I believe

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.399 
k-tec be first introduced on I believe
the<00:03:28.340> GP<00:03:28.669> Pro<00:03:28.940> it's<00:03:29.389> nice<00:03:29.659> to<00:03:29.900> see<00:03:30.049> it<00:03:30.169> now<00:03:30.290> in

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
the GP Pro it's nice to see it now in

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:32.229 
the GP Pro it's nice to see it now in
the<00:03:30.500> GP<00:03:30.799> tech<00:03:30.979> and<00:03:31.159> what<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.310> is<00:03:31.400> is<00:03:31.549> a<00:03:31.579> 5<00:03:31.970> layer

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
the GP tech and what it is is a 5 layer

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.089 
the GP tech and what it is is a 5 layer
system<00:03:32.540> for<00:03:33.049> abrasion<00:03:33.470> resistance<00:03:33.949> and

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
protection in an outside or lateral side

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.920

potentially<00:03:37.430> low<00:03:37.639> side<00:03:37.879> crash<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.479> notice<00:03:38.810> it

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
potentially low side crash and notice it

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.539 
potentially low side crash and notice it
ties<00:03:39.109> in<00:03:39.319> with<00:03:39.440> my<00:03:39.590> third<00:03:39.859> and<00:03:40.040> fourth<00:03:40.250> finger

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
ties in with my third and fourth finger

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.939 
ties in with my third and fourth finger
bridge<00:03:40.790> so<00:03:41.209> what<00:03:41.299> k-tec<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:41.870> it<00:03:42.049> starts<00:03:42.530> start

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:42.949
