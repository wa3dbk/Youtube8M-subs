00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
that what's kind of like the pecs we're

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.900 
that what's kind of like the pecs we're
going<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.320> start<00:02:07.560> with<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.280> bottom<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.789> this

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
going to start with the bottom of this

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.010 
going to start with the bottom of this
line<00:02:09.179> right<00:02:09.390> here<00:02:09.450> we're<00:02:10.379> going<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.530> make

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
line right here we're going to make

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.680 
line right here we're going to make
a<00:02:11.050> rainbow<00:02:11.650> all<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.430> way<00:02:12.970> to<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.180> top<00:02:13.450> just

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
a rainbow all the way to the top just

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.780 
a rainbow all the way to the top just
like<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:14.010> then<00:02:15.010> we're<00:02:15.100> gonna<00:02:15.190> start<00:02:15.490> on<00:02:15.670> the

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
like that then we're gonna start on the

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.310 
like that then we're gonna start on the
bottom<00:02:16.150> we're<00:02:16.480> going<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.690> do<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.840> same<00:02:17.050> thing

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
make a rainbow at the end and we're

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.760 
make a rainbow at the end and we're
gonna<00:02:20.740> do<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.040> for<00:02:21.280> all<00:02:21.520> four<00:02:22.090> wings<00:02:22.680> now<00:02:23.680> we

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
gonna do that for all four wings now we

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.870 
gonna do that for all four wings now we
don't<00:02:23.890> want<00:02:24.100> to<00:02:24.130> make<00:02:24.280> our<00:02:24.400> lines<00:02:24.670> too<00:02:25.090> thick

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
don't want to make our lines too thick

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.960 
don't want to make our lines too thick
thin<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.180> we're<00:02:28.330> gonna<00:02:28.420> use<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.630> thin<00:02:29.020> brush

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
thin so we're gonna use a thin brush

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.460 
thin so we're gonna use a thin brush
even<00:02:30.970> with<00:02:31.240> a<00:02:31.270> thin<00:02:31.540> brush<00:02:31.720> but<00:02:32.080> make<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.230> too

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
even with a thin brush but make it too

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.260 
even with a thin brush but make it too
thick<00:02:32.740> if<00:02:32.860> you<00:02:32.950> press<00:02:33.220> down<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.700> less<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.150> we

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
thick if you press down to less so we

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.600 
thick if you press down to less so we
don't<00:02:34.420> want<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.600> press<00:02:34.780> down<00:02:34.810> too<00:02:35.200> much<00:02:35.610> we're

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
don't want to press down too much we're

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.270 
don't want to press down too much we're
gonna<00:02:36.700> do<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:36.910> same<00:02:37.030> thing<00:02:37.090> here<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.710> make

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
and those are our four week but we're

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.630 
and those are our four week but we're
not<00:02:46.810> there<00:02:46.990> yet<00:02:47.050> what<00:02:47.890> we're<00:02:48.040> going<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.280> do<00:02:48.460> now

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
and this is a little tricky for some of

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.930 
and this is a little tricky for some of
the<00:02:50.350> kids<00:02:50.530> we're<00:02:51.220> gonna<00:02:51.280> make<00:02:51.520> some<00:02:51.670> lines

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
the kids we're gonna make some lines

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.220 
the kids we're gonna make some lines
pointing<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.700> they're<00:02:54.700> gonna<00:02:54.820> be<00:02:55.510> pointing<00:02:56.080> to

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
pointing to they're gonna be pointing to

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.350 
pointing to they're gonna be pointing to
the<00:02:56.350> drain<00:02:56.590> plug<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.430> on<00:02:57.550> this<00:02:57.670> side<00:02:58.000> we're

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
the drain plug so on this side we're

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.070 
the drain plug so on this side we're
going<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.630> pointing<00:02:59.050> that<00:02:59.650> way<00:03:00.750> same<00:03:01.750> thing<00:03:01.990> on

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
going to pointing that way same thing on

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.250 
going to pointing that way same thing on
this<00:03:02.170> one<00:03:02.230> we're<00:03:02.530> not<00:03:02.560> pointing<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.430> way

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
this one we're not pointing that way

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.980 
this one we're not pointing that way
just<00:03:05.260> like<00:03:05.530> this<00:03:06.120> now<00:03:07.120> this<00:03:07.300> is<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.450> hard<00:03:07.720> part

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
just like this now this is the hard part

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.140 
just like this now this is the hard part
because<00:03:08.590> on<00:03:08.890> this<00:03:09.040> side<00:03:09.250> were<00:03:09.430> pointing<00:03:10.120> the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
because on this side were pointing the

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.590 
because on this side were pointing the
other<00:03:10.270> way<00:03:10.920> sliding<00:03:11.920> down<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:16.060> on<00:03:16.209> this<00:03:16.420> one

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
other way sliding down and on this one

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.660 
other way sliding down and on this one
to<00:03:16.780> remember<00:03:17.140> we're<00:03:17.290> going<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:17.470> slide<00:03:17.890> towards

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
to remember we're going to slide towards

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.330 
to remember we're going to slide towards
a<00:03:18.910> dragonfly<00:03:19.900> we<00:03:20.350> just<00:03:20.560> put<00:03:20.740> three<00:03:21.070> on<00:03:21.100> each

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
a dragonfly we just put three on each

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.160 
a dragonfly we just put three on each
one<00:03:21.550> of<00:03:21.670> those<00:03:21.820> they<00:03:22.390> kind<00:03:22.690> of<00:03:22.780> look<00:03:22.930> like

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
one of those they kind of look like

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.260 
one of those they kind of look like
leaves<00:03:23.530> if<00:03:23.890> you<00:03:23.980> look<00:03:24.160> at<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.490> wings<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.209> a

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
leaves if you look at the wings of a

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.270 
leaves if you look at the wings of a
dragonfly<00:03:25.660> they<00:03:26.050> have<00:03:26.260> these<00:03:26.500> veins<00:03:26.770> in<00:03:27.100> them

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
dragonfly they have these veins in them

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.510 
dragonfly they have these veins in them
so<00:03:27.820> that's<00:03:28.060> all<00:03:28.270> we<00:03:28.420> need<00:03:28.630> for<00:03:28.870> our<00:03:29.260> block<00:03:29.590> now

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
so that's all we need for our block now

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.390 
so that's all we need for our block now
what<00:03:30.760> we<00:03:30.910> need<00:03:30.970> is<00:03:31.240> a<00:03:31.330> second<00:03:32.020> color<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:33.220> go

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
what we need is a second color to go

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.580 
what we need is a second color to go
with<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:34.209> first<00:03:34.390> color<00:03:34.630> we<00:03:34.810> did<00:03:34.959> now<00:03:35.140> I<00:03:35.350> chose

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
with the first color we did now I chose

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.949 
with the first color we did now I chose
purple<00:03:35.920> for<00:03:36.280> my<00:03:36.420> dragonfly<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:37.660> I'm<00:03:37.720> going<00:03:37.900> to

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
purple for my dragonfly so I'm going to

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.920 
purple for my dragonfly so I'm going to
choose<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.500> red<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.420> what<00:03:40.420> we're<00:03:40.540> going<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.780> do
