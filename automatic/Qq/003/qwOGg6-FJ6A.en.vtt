 BZ notes that this is percent potato porridge that tastes extremely good 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.289

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.980
 till 8 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.750
 severed the shading quickly 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.240

 is curable to US Glauch construction and at the same time no 80 calories is 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.270

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.860

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.920

 Tinfoil took the war soon apart the time new 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.950
