00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
what first you got to do is you got to

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.220 
what first you got to do is you got to
take<00:00:30.420> off<00:00:30.599> little<00:00:30.960> end<00:00:31.140> cap<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:33.110> squeeze<00:00:34.110> it

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.510 
take off little end cap to squeeze it
off<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.710> comes<00:00:34.890> off<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.309> like<00:00:35.460> that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
off so that comes off just like that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.060 
off so that comes off just like that
very<00:00:36.030> simple<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.890> then<00:00:39.260> what<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.500> the

very simple and then what it is the
piece<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.430> cracks<00:00:42.590> so<00:00:43.850> you<00:00:44.850> screw<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.360> crack

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
piece of cracks so you screw the crack

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
piece of cracks so you screw the crack
piece<00:00:46.129> and<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.850> bottom<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.410> bottom

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
piece and this is the bottom the bottom

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.340 
piece and this is the bottom the bottom
wheel<00:00:51.590> just<00:00:52.590> take<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.980> part<00:00:53.190> off<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.199> you<00:00:55.199> got

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
wheel just take that part off so you got

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.290 
wheel just take that part off so you got
this<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.100> part<00:00:56.340> here<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.579> cracks<00:00:57.059> you

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
this this the part here that cracks you

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.119 
this this the part here that cracks you
can<00:00:57.449> see<00:00:57.660> X<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.079> glued<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:58.920> glue

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
can see X I glued this and this glue

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.729 
can see X I glued this and this glue
will<00:00:59.280> last<00:00:59.520> maybe<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.059> week<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.649> dealt<00:01:01.649> with

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
very still barney's a Phillips and then

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.969 
very still barney's a Phillips and then
a<00:01:25.350> 5/16<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.549> nut<00:01:27.619> what<00:01:28.619> you're<00:01:28.740> going<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.890> do

a 5/16 the nut what you're going to do
is<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.220> pull<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.549> all<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.970> way<00:01:30.090> out<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
is just pull this all the way out and

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.670 
is just pull this all the way out and
make<00:01:30.720> sure<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> power<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.380> off<00:01:33.320> you<00:01:34.320> pull<00:01:34.590> it

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
make sure the power is off you pull it

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.760 
make sure the power is off you pull it
all<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.860> way<00:01:34.979> out<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:37.140> rack<00:01:38.930> run<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.049> by<00:01:40.200> hand

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
all the way out the rack run it by hand

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.110 
all the way out the rack run it by hand
and<00:01:42.770> that<00:01:42.950> one<00:01:43.130> which<00:01:43.400> I<00:01:43.520> need<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.730> do<00:01:43.850> is<00:01:44.030> to

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
and that one which I need to do is to

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.010 
and that one which I need to do is to
take<00:01:44.240> a<00:01:44.300> Phillips<00:01:45.790> and<00:01:46.790> screw<00:01:47.120> this<00:01:47.210> as<00:01:47.600> hard

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
take a Phillips and screw this as hard

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:56.650 
take a Phillips and screw this as hard
as<00:01:48.140> you<00:01:48.230> can<00:01:52.270> all<00:01:53.270> right<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:56.210> wheel<00:01:56.390> moves

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
as you can all right the wheel moves

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:07.030 
as you can all right the wheel moves
nicely<00:01:59.830> put<00:02:00.830> that<00:02:00.980> cap<00:02:01.250> back<00:02:01.460> on<00:02:01.700> and<00:02:06.040> there

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
nicely put that cap back on and there

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.520 
nicely put that cap back on and there
you<00:02:07.160> go<00:02:07.340> now<00:02:07.610> what<00:02:08.390> I'll<00:02:08.540> do<00:02:08.810> is<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:09.290> get

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
you go now what I'll do is you get

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.410 
you go now what I'll do is you get
dialects<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:10.460> send<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:10.700> through<00:02:10.910> G<00:02:11.180> all<00:02:11.330> you

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
dialects you send you through G all you

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.730 
dialects you send you through G all you
will<00:02:11.540> need<00:02:11.660> this<00:02:11.780> tool<00:02:12.050> because<00:02:12.380> these<00:02:12.530> two<00:02:12.710> a

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
will need this tool because these two a

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.130 
will need this tool because these two a
mine<00:02:13.070> would<00:02:13.370> crack<00:02:13.640> from<00:02:13.820> both<00:02:14.030> sides<00:02:14.360> they

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
mine would crack from both sides they

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.500 
mine would crack from both sides they
crack<00:02:15.500> but<00:02:15.830> I'll<00:02:15.920> give<00:02:16.100> you<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.220> third<00:02:16.490> one<00:02:16.730> just

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
crack but I'll give you a third one just

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.040 
crack but I'll give you a third one just
just<00:02:18.320> to<00:02:18.410> have<00:02:18.530> an<00:02:18.650> extra<00:02:18.950> one<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:20.090> that's<00:02:20.690> it

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
just to have an extra one so that's it

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.410 
just to have an extra one so that's it
that's<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.410> fix<00:02:21.710> then<00:02:22.130> I've<00:02:22.520> done<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.210> it

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
that's the fix then I've done it it

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.590 
that's the fix then I've done it it
won't<00:02:23.600> rust<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.580> I've<00:02:25.580> had<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.000> on<00:02:26.180> there<00:02:26.420> for

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
won't rust and I've had it on there for

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.900 
won't rust and I've had it on there for
