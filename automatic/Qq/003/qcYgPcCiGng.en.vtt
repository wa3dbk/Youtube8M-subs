00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.970
 Dr. ranieri mazzei iris is a specialist in plastic surgery 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.380
 reconstructive and aesthetic I graduated from the University of Milan where 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.509
 I also obtained a specialization and then a master's degree in 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.070
 senology because beyond the aesthetic aspect I also became interested 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.859
 to the purely reconstructive aspect 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.000
 from the point of view of surgical extractions let's call it that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.119
 I consider myself a Brazilian school because this is so many years ago 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.320
 opportunities to collaborate with numerous specialists. coming from this 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.360
 country that is at the forefront of cosmetic surgery interventions that 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.190
 I prefer to follow one of these is definitely breast augmentation 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.840
 which among other things also one of the most requested interventions 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.270
 from patients I believe that I use them. of the last prostheses 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.630
 generation and especially the initial interview google regards proper manner 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.679
 precise careful wishes and needs 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:02.269
 iren impossible patients' tv cubes can give results that sometimes 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.079
 I'm really spectacular towards the patient mimmo ho 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:09.079
 experienced I got used to having a relationship 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.860
 from where I try to make him speak I try to clarify his desires I try to 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.609
 understand his goals because I believe that I believe 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:22.939
 so that the important indication is to represent 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:26.420
 at least 50% of the good result of an intervention 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.990
 if we are on the same wavelength the patient or understand if you wish on 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.040
 expectations on needs are also able to respond differently 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.350
 optimal result I decided to collaborate with the trinite because the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.670
 I believe the future of our profession is to overcome 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.890
 of the single professional who in his studio closed between four walls and the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.490
 possibility of having an organization behind that cares for all 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.890
 aspects is not strictly medical so it allows me to concentrate 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.790
 directly on what relationship with the patient the clinical part the part 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.520
 surgical is the first for actors and in the post-operative lifting me 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.840
 a whole series of issues of issues that actually do - to do 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.410
 with medicine
