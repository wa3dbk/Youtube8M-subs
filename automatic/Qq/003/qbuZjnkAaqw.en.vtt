fingers<00:00:52.879> through<00:00:53.269> the<00:00:53.449> hair<00:00:54.160> but<00:00:55.160> I<00:00:55.190> just

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
fingers through the hair but I just

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.060 
fingers through the hair but I just
found<00:00:55.670> that<00:00:55.910> very<00:00:56.150> very<00:00:56.420> confusing<00:00:57.080> and<00:00:57.350> I

found<00:00:58.430> that<00:00:58.580> this<00:00:58.760> is<00:00:58.820> a<00:00:58.970> much<00:00:59.330> easier<00:00:59.660> way<00:00:59.960> to

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
found that this is a much easier way to

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.830 
found that this is a much easier way to
do<00:01:00.559> a<00:01:00.590> four<00:01:00.920> stranded<00:01:01.430> round<00:01:01.700> braid<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.300> these
