change the ribbons that it has I'm not

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.610 
change the ribbons that it has I'm not
too<00:05:38.800> sure<00:05:38.950> about<00:05:38.979> that<00:05:39.310> but<00:05:39.370> um<00:05:40.500> you<00:05:41.500> could

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
too sure about that but um you could

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.900 
too sure about that but um you could
look<00:05:41.770> that<00:05:41.889> up<00:05:41.950> for<00:05:42.039> yourself<00:05:42.520> you<00:05:42.669> can<00:05:42.789> also

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
look that up for yourself you can also

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.180 
look that up for yourself you can also
change<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:43.419> route<00:05:43.720> that<00:05:43.750> you<00:05:44.050> meet<00:05:44.289> it<00:05:44.410> at<00:05:44.590> the

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.330 
change the route that you meet it at the
level<00:05:45.430> level<00:05:46.419> 0<00:05:46.690> probably<00:05:47.530> should<00:05:47.770> change

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
level level 0 probably should change

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.879 
level level 0 probably should change
that<00:05:48.430> because<00:05:48.700> that<00:05:48.789> doesn't<00:05:49.120> make<00:05:49.300> any<00:05:49.450> sense

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889
