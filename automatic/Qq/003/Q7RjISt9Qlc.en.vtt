I'll<00:00:07.200> be<00:00:07.319> talking<00:00:07.500> about<00:00:07.710> left-handed

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
I'll be talking about left-handed

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.220 
I'll be talking about left-handed
pressure<00:00:08.639> when<00:00:09.420> we<00:00:09.450> first<00:00:09.780> learned<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.110> play

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
pressure when we first learned to play

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.230 
pressure when we first learned to play
the<00:00:10.320> guitar<00:00:10.580> often<00:00:11.580> because<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.879> lack<00:00:12.089> of

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
the guitar often because of lack of

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.239 
the guitar often because of lack of
experience<00:00:12.809> we<00:00:13.049> end<00:00:13.230> up<00:00:13.379> using<00:00:13.410> more<00:00:13.980> pressure

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:14.249 
experience we end up using more pressure

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:15.739 
experience we end up using more pressure
in<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.519> left<00:00:14.730> hand<00:00:14.910> than<00:00:15.030> necessary

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:15.749 
in the left hand than necessary

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.600 
in the left hand than necessary
and<00:00:15.839> even<00:00:16.350> when<00:00:16.500> we<00:00:16.650> gain<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.860> experience

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
and even when we gain the experience

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.700 
and even when we gain the experience
when<00:00:18.090> we're<00:00:18.270> learning<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.630> new<00:00:18.780> piece<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.260> our

when we're learning a new piece and our

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.410 
when we're learning a new piece and our
left<00:00:19.920> hand<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.190> unfamiliar<00:00:20.670> with<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.970> notes

left hand is unfamiliar with the notes

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.360 
left hand is unfamiliar with the notes
it<00:00:21.810> actually<00:00:22.020> works<00:00:22.440> harder<00:00:22.860> than<00:00:23.040> it<00:00:23.160> needs

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.370 
it actually works harder than it needs

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.390 
it actually works harder than it needs
to<00:00:23.690> the<00:00:24.690> key<00:00:24.870> is<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.500> figure<00:00:25.770> out<00:00:25.950> the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
to the key is is to figure out the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.550 
to the key is is to figure out the
perfect<00:00:26.550> balance<00:00:27.150> between<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.870> power<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.350> the

perfect balance between the power of the
right<00:00:28.740> hand<00:00:28.920> stroke<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.520> whether<00:00:29.700> you're

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
right hand stroke so whether you're

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.350 
right hand stroke so whether you're
playing<00:00:30.120> piano<00:00:30.750> mezzo<00:00:31.200> Forte<00:00:31.590> Forte<00:00:32.180> etc<00:00:33.180> and

playing piano mezzo Forte Forte etc and

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.209 
playing piano mezzo Forte Forte etc and
how<00:00:33.899> much<00:00:34.079> pressure<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.679> exude<00:00:34.949> in<00:00:35.100> their

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
how much pressure you exude in their

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.029 
how much pressure you exude in their
left<00:00:35.460> hand<00:00:35.699> a<00:00:35.999> good<00:00:36.839> way<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.019> start<00:00:37.379> is<00:00:37.679> to<00:00:37.710> take

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
left hand a good way to start is to take

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.160 
left hand a good way to start is to take
something<00:00:38.399> very<00:00:38.550> simple<00:00:39.059> like<00:00:39.300> Agassi<00:00:39.870> major

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
something very simple like Agassi major

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.979 
something very simple like Agassi major
scale<00:00:40.499> and<00:00:40.769> to<00:00:41.640> play<00:00:41.820> through<00:00:42.210> with<00:00:42.570> studying

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
scale and to play through with studying

00:00:42.989 --> 00:01:00.829 
scale and to play through with studying
the<00:00:43.140> notes<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.739> playing<00:00:44.159> so<00:00:44.550> lightly<00:00:59.839> be

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
the notes so playing so lightly be

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.119 
the notes so playing so lightly be
careful<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.289> you're<00:01:01.440> placing<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.949> nose

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
careful that you're placing the nose

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.979 
careful that you're placing the nose
accurately<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:02.909> the<00:01:02.999> right<00:01:03.179> place<00:01:03.479> in<00:01:03.749> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
accurately in the right place in the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.760 
accurately in the right place in the
fret<00:01:04.229> then<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.220> next<00:01:05.519> step<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.969> to<00:01:06.780> press<00:01:07.740> just

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
fret then the next step is to press just

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.929 
fret then the next step is to press just
a<00:01:08.070> little<00:01:08.100> harder<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.759> to<00:01:08.969> buzz<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.420> notes

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.359 

can<00:01:14.939> use<00:01:15.200> play<00:01:16.200> each<00:01:16.409> pitch<00:01:16.710> more<00:01:16.920> than<00:01:17.100> once

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
can use play each pitch more than once

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.160 
can use play each pitch more than once
so<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.789> get<00:01:17.939> more<00:01:18.210> than<00:01:18.270> one<00:01:18.570> chance<00:01:18.840> per

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
so that you get more than one chance per

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.469 
so that you get more than one chance per
finger<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:20.070> figure<00:01:20.340> out<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.909> pressure

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
finger to figure out that pressure

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:44.360 
finger to figure out that pressure
balance

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.370 

so<00:01:45.370> after<00:01:46.150> playing<00:01:46.390> that<00:01:46.570> a<00:01:46.630> few<00:01:46.900> times<00:01:46.930> with

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
so after playing that a few times with

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.700 
so after playing that a few times with
buzzing<00:01:48.330> then<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.540> next<00:01:49.780> step<00:01:49.990> is<00:01:50.200> to<00:01:50.440> press

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
buzzing then the next step is to press

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.250 
buzzing then the next step is to press
just<00:01:51.070> a<00:01:51.190> little<00:01:51.430> bit<00:01:51.550> beyond<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.720> avoid<00:01:53.080> the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
just a little bit beyond to avoid the

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.860 
just a little bit beyond to avoid the
bus<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:53.740> get<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:54.100> clean<00:01:54.400> pitch<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:55.390> you'll

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
bus and get a clean pitch and you'll

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:28.650 
bus and get a clean pitch and you'll
notice<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.320> doesn't<00:01:56.350> take<00:01:56.770> that<00:01:56.800> much<00:02:27.660> so

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
notice it doesn't take that much so

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.990 
notice it doesn't take that much so
practice<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.290> few<00:02:29.560> times<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:30.190> make<00:02:30.670> sure

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
practice that a few times and make sure

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.940 
practice that a few times and make sure
that<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.330> get<00:02:31.450> used<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.840> pressing<00:02:32.380> little<00:02:32.740> and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
that you get used to pressing little and

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.370 
that you get used to pressing little and
not<00:02:33.220> buzzing<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.820> notes<00:02:34.030> now<00:02:34.750> of<00:02:34.900> course<00:02:35.170> this

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
not buzzing the notes now of course this

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.990 
not buzzing the notes now of course this
was<00:02:35.560> perfect<00:02:36.040> for<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.490> amount<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.820> volume

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
was perfect for the amount of volume

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:56.330 
was perfect for the amount of volume
that<00:02:37.270> I<00:02:37.300> was<00:02:37.450> using<00:02:37.630> in<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.900> right<00:02:38.080> hand<00:02:38.350> if<00:02:38.800> I

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:05.850 

actually<00:02:57.340> have<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.850> press<00:02:58.090> louder

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.730 

to<00:03:06.580> avoid<00:03:06.910> buzzing<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.570> that's<00:03:08.350> as<00:03:08.620> I

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
to avoid buzzing and that's as I

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.260 
to avoid buzzing and that's as I
mentioned<00:03:09.070> before<00:03:09.160> that's<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.850> whole<00:03:10.030> point

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
mentioned before that's the whole point

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.780 
mentioned before that's the whole point
is<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.540> figure<00:03:10.840> out<00:03:10.990> the<00:03:11.440> balance<00:03:12.100> between<00:03:12.310> how

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
is to figure out the balance between how

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.100 
is to figure out the balance between how
loud<00:03:13.000> you're<00:03:13.150> playing<00:03:13.390> in<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.630> right<00:03:13.810> hand

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
loud you're playing in the right hand

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.990 
loud you're playing in the right hand
and<00:03:14.290> how<00:03:14.890> much<00:03:15.070> you're<00:03:15.220> pressing<00:03:15.430> in<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.730> left

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
and how much you're pressing in the left

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.420 
and how much you're pressing in the left
hand<00:03:16.240> and<00:03:16.480> never<00:03:17.050> really<00:03:17.500> working<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.250> left

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
hand and never really working the left

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.920 
hand and never really working the left
hand<00:03:18.670> harder<00:03:19.030> than<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.300> needs<00:03:19.510> to

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
hand harder than it needs to

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.710 
hand harder than it needs to
after<00:03:20.560> practicing<00:03:21.040> on<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.310> simple<00:03:21.850> scale<00:03:22.120> then

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
after practicing on a simple scale then

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.140 
after practicing on a simple scale then
you<00:03:22.750> can<00:03:23.020> apply<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.380> whatever<00:03:24.150> repertoire

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
you can apply to whatever repertoire

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.000 
you can apply to whatever repertoire
that<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.450> have<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:25.960> if<00:03:26.200> there<00:03:26.380> is<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.530> passage

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
that you have so if there is a passage

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.010 
that you have so if there is a passage
that<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:27.370> think<00:03:27.670> you're<00:03:28.240> using<00:03:28.600> too<00:03:28.900> much

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
that you think you're using too much

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.320 
that you think you're using too much
pressure<00:03:29.350> and<00:03:29.650> use<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.460> same<00:03:30.640> technique<00:03:30.670> so

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
pressure and use the same technique so

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:46.490 
pressure and use the same technique so
let's<00:03:31.510> say

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.010 

and<00:03:46.980> they<00:03:47.100> increase<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.580> pressure<00:03:47.820> this<00:03:48.780> way

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
and they increase the pressure this way

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.140 
and they increase the pressure this way
your<00:03:49.260> left<00:03:49.470> hand<00:03:49.770> is<00:03:49.980> working<00:03:50.280> just<00:03:50.730> as<00:03:50.910> hard

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
your left hand is working just as hard

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.210 
your left hand is working just as hard
as<00:03:51.300> necessary<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.050> not<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.470> bit<00:03:52.740> more<00:03:53.040> than

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
as necessary and not a bit more than

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.520 
as necessary and not a bit more than
that<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.730> you<00:03:54.030> can<00:03:54.210> conserve<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.930> energy<00:03:55.380> and

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
that and you can conserve the energy and

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.710 
that and you can conserve the energy and
the<00:03:55.620> power<00:03:55.830> so<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.220> can<00:03:56.310> last<00:03:56.730> for<00:03:57.390> however

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
the power so you can last for however

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.330 
the power so you can last for however
long<00:03:57.990> your<00:03:58.170> practice<00:03:58.530> session<00:03:58.830> is<00:03:58.980> or<00:03:59.220> if

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
long your practice session is or if

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.070 
long your practice session is or if
you're<00:03:59.460> playing<00:03:59.760> an<00:03:59.940> entire<00:04:00.270> hour-and-a-half

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
you're playing an entire hour-and-a-half

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.710 
you're playing an entire hour-and-a-half
concert
