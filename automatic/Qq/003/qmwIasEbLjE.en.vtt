00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 in 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.650
 hello and welcome to my workshop I 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.389
 call me denis fortin I would like you 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.420
 to share my passion for the work of the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.420
 wood 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.830
 so we completed the manufacturing of our 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.240
 bosses name adjust our chances for 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.000
 that everything is impeccable 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.720
 the next step it's going to be rounding 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.910
 all the fields of our book 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.629
 so if we do it by hand we see on 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.870
 makes reference marks 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:50.890
 if you want because here will have a quarter of 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.199
 inch then we try to lift myself to the eye 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.420
 the to come to our result there is going 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:01:00.360
 to be quite difficult so a method 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:03.850
 quite simple is that we will lead marked 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.670
 action trees can score a quarter 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.850
 inch then half of these stamps 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.350
 of gold so an eighth of an inch 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.979
 we will do the same thing on the other 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:23.290
 side so with the marks that we have here 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:26.350
 we will draw deadlines on all of our 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.709
 parish that we will mark our two 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.090
 lines of a tale was 1/8 inch re 

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:34.030
 for us the traits to a body of 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:41.920
 race we will do the same thing with our 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:44.500
 sides then at that moment then in a 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:50.410
 first time we are going to pick up a 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:54.190
 45 Â° angle that will come join our 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.509
 two reference lines of the center then 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.020
 after following we simply remained 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:02.649
 complete the round y so the first 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.630
 parish 46 degrees this will help us to 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.420
 see a reference that is pretty 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.459
 accurate then at that moment he will us 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.470
 just stay complete the rounding of 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.200
 each side then we will have a body of 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.590
 role that is perfectly adjusted so 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.510
 it's a name 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.700
 which can be done by hand the train 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.489
 very easily I 'm just going to make a 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.930
 demo start to show the 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.170
 how is it not very complicated 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.269
 to arrive at a result even if we do not have 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.610
 mechanized tools to make the 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.890
 job 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.360
 so if the gema pieces of wood with a 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.879
 certain height that will allow us 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:59.540
 to work effectively 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:03:02.090
 then I'm just going to come otherwise 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.870
 look there I just made a 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.379
 45 degree yard I read you join 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.370
 my first two relays had who are 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:16.900
 an eighth of an inch kloet step after 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.900
 it is simply to complete 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.070
 complete the flare to join 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.410
 My other line yet thumb then I 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.570
 guard will have the who is really 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.610
 impeccable that way in this 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.000
 portrait there no longer that we could 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.950
 all make the outline in hand with 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.530
 this method would be fine 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.870
 also on a top we will go do 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.590
 the top comfort we will go a little 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.080
 faster 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.280
 but it could feed that which 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.000
 could be done by hand the other 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.000
 easily 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.720
 so I invite you to follow 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.880
 training each training is 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.170
 accompanied by detailed plans are 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.790
 also provides the required stencil the 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.390
 polarization of each of the different 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.630
 steps then everything is accompanied by 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:23.300
 videos not thoroughly then with the guides 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.540
 of course I developed the tools 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.100
 crm that are also available we are in 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.830
 able to do quality work 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.760
 professional for a handyman it's 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.400
 really interesting 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.140
 so I invite you to follow us then 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.000
 participate in large numbers 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.510
 we will have a lot of fun in the 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.510
 the Woodcraft 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
 Oh
