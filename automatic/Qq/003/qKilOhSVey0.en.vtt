for<00:03:15.650> 15<00:03:16.010> minutes<00:03:16.220> at<00:03:16.459> 400<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:17.650> I'm<00:03:18.650> just<00:03:19.069> going

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
for 15 minutes at 400 and I'm just going

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.259 
for 15 minutes at 400 and I'm just going
to<00:03:19.489> flip<00:03:19.850> them<00:03:20.120> over<00:03:20.319> you<00:03:21.319> can<00:03:21.530> use<00:03:21.709> a<00:03:21.739> tongue

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
to flip them over you can use a tongue

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.259 
to flip them over you can use a tongue
tongs<00:03:23.269> or<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:24.100> spatula<00:03:25.100> having<00:03:25.819> to<00:03:25.940> be<00:03:26.060> done

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
tongs or a spatula having to be done

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.449 
tongs or a spatula having to be done
this<00:03:26.480> before<00:03:27.049> I'm<00:03:27.709> thinking<00:03:28.099> maybe<00:03:28.220> the

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
this before I'm thinking maybe the

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:35.460 
this before I'm thinking maybe the
spatula<00:03:28.760> might<00:03:29.269> work<00:03:29.480> if<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:29.780> use<00:03:30.410> a<00:03:31.209> fork<00:03:32.209> to

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:43.890 

kind<00:03:36.470> of

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.140 

so<00:03:44.900> I'm<00:03:45.020> thinking<00:03:45.410> this<00:03:45.650> spatula<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.730> fork

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
so I'm thinking this spatula and fork

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.640 
so I'm thinking this spatula and fork
might<00:03:47.390> work<00:03:47.600> pretty<00:03:47.870> well<00:03:47.990> I'm<00:03:48.260> just<00:03:48.440> going<00:03:48.620> to

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
might work pretty well I'm just going to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.430 
might work pretty well I'm just going to
flip<00:03:48.830> them<00:03:49.160> over<00:03:50.140> like<00:03:51.140> that<00:03:52.870> take<00:03:53.870> maybe<00:03:54.170> four

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
flip them over like that take maybe four

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.680 
flip them over like that take maybe four
or<00:03:54.470> five<00:03:54.770> at<00:03:54.980> a<00:03:55.069> time<00:03:56.440> they<00:03:57.440> smell<00:03:57.890> absolutely

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
or five at a time they smell absolutely

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:10.600 
or five at a time they smell absolutely
wonderful<00:04:06.340> okay<00:04:07.340> so<00:04:07.400> now<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:09.680> sweet<00:04:10.160> potato

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610
