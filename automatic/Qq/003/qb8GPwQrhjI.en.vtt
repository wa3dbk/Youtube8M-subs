00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.479 
they're a baja would offered me this
idea<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:08.170> buzzer<00:03:08.440> sounds<00:03:09.010> just<00:03:09.280> like

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
idea and the buzzer sounds just like

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.050 
idea and the buzzer sounds just like
this<00:03:10.050> when<00:03:11.050> we<00:03:11.170> have<00:03:11.650> a<00:03:11.680> devourer<00:03:12.220> well

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
this when we have a devourer well

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.960 
this when we have a devourer well
actually<00:03:14.040> when<00:03:15.040> we<00:03:15.070> have<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.370> mood<00:03:15.700> risk<00:03:17.970> when

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
actually when we have a mood risk when

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.970 
actually when we have a mood risk when
you<00:03:19.000> have<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.300> mutalisk<00:03:19.840> mutalisks<00:03:20.440> can

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
you have a mutalisk mutalisks can

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.960 
you have a mutalisk mutalisks can
obviously<00:03:21.880> fly<00:03:22.330> they<00:03:22.569> have<00:03:22.780> wings<00:03:23.140> and<00:03:23.769> they

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
obviously fly they have wings and they

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.050 
obviously fly they have wings and they
wave<00:03:24.970> wings<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:26.110> soda<00:03:26.530> fly<00:03:26.920> just<00:03:27.459> like<00:03:27.610> birds

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
wave wings and soda fly just like birds

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.420 
wave wings and soda fly just like birds
that's<00:03:28.420> logical<00:03:29.019> because<00:03:29.410> we<00:03:29.769> all<00:03:29.920> learn

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
that's logical because we all learn

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.110 
that's logical because we all learn
biology<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:32.500> don't<00:03:32.890> know<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.220> what

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
biology and I don't know and what

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.509 
biology and I don't know and what

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
small it's hard to imagine devour being

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.910 
small it's hard to imagine devour being
picked<00:04:45.080> up<00:04:45.260> into<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:46.010> air<00:04:46.040> with<00:04:46.430> those<00:04:46.610> wings
