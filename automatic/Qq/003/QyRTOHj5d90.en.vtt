00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.589
 I have to touch the topic again 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.480
 windows 10 since my previous two 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.350
 The video caused a lot of questions and 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.450
 comments 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.490
 First of all, I want to immediately notice that how 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.750
 this is always happening users 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.809
 divided into two camps 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.240
 those who like windows 10 and those who like 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.619
 the second is not going to go there either 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.029
 user groups can also 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.160
 divided into those who are just 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.599
 conservative and does not like to let in 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.970
 your computer is new software 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.189
 providing for those who have already tried 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.060
 windows 10 and face some 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.310
 inconvenience 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.870
 or problems and those who think that 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.910
 new operating system 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.620
 so wedged into his 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.410
 privacy well, or as they say now 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.900
 spying spy windows 10 was mine 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.250
 past video and I will not repeat with 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.410
 the first group of conservative 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.510
 users to whom by the way I'm 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.820
 I also sometimes carry myself in general 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.340
 it is clear now it will be about those who 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.470
 already tried windows 10 and run into 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.240
 any problems resulting in 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.790
 Generally wrote up a new operating 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.280
 system from accounts it is from them i and 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.350
 received the most negative reviews 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.390
 and comments on my first video 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.820
 which was dedicated to windows 10 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.590
 yes i think windows 10 is potentially 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.750
 very interesting in terms of 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.120
 the functionality of the operating system and 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.710
 in the very first video I'm in 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.510
 in general, and recommended to use 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.090
 this operating system 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.760
 I made it clear that without considering it necessary 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.710
 upgrade to windows 10 right now i'm 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.710
 I did not explain in detail why I am so 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.570
 I count and do it in this video case 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.090
 The fact that any update is fraught with 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.100
 potential problems you can for years 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.530
 use windows 7 and everything will be 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.510
 work like a clock and then upgrade to 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.850
 windows 10 and the computer will start strongly 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.130
 slow down there will be problems with some 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.020
 devices or programs but also 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.659
 similar things and solve such a problem 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.100
 it will be very difficult and the whole thing is that 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.830
 all computers to some extent 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.600
 unique in your computer can be 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.880
 specific set of devices or 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.680
 programs the operating system can 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.930
 stand for years during this time you can 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.640
 install and remove thousands of programs and 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.710
 In general, during this time you can do 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.720
 actions that will further affect 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.340
 to work a new operating system 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.450
 what actions absolutely say 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.830
 impossible 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.870
 because it needs to be known 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.940
 accordingly find and indicate the reason 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.830
 why your computer after the upgrade 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.019
 began to behave somehow inadequately 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.569
 simply impossible reasons for this may 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.459
 be a million and a billion if you think 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.519
 that such problems can only be 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.720
 with windows you are mistaken 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.810
 literally late last year I 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.709
 I updated mac os to the new version 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.780
 this by 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.000
 similar update that was me 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.769
 prompted to download via the Internet after 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.690
 computer upgrade became noticeable 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.760
 slow down there were problems with 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.500
 programs with wi-fay and this when accounting 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.870
 the fact that my laptop at that time 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.090
 it was less than two months when did i 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.220
 installed the system cleanly ie creating 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.870
 the installation flash drive and formatted 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.329
 partition with the old operating system 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.220
 then all problems disappeared and everything became 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.690
 work as before but I could 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.269
 take advantage of new opportunities 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.130
 new operating system exactly 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.620
 so I think that it is impossible to draw a conclusion 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.989
 about windows 10 after update 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.840
 it is about windows 10 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.400
 they have her functionality I said 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.630
 I think I need to wait with 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.850
 switching to windows 10 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.859
 some time but here are the phrases 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.480
 some time is absolutely not specific 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.700
 that's why i want to clarify 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.950
 worth the wait until 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.810
 microsoft create mechanism using 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.730
 which can be legal 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.750
 user reinstall windows 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.970
 10 clean 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.920
 that is , using a boot disk or 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.319
 flash drives as far as i know bye 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.329
 only the update algorithm works and 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.680
 when trying to install a system from 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.959
 downloaded from the official site 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.450
 distribution keys to previous 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.489
 licensed windows not working here 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.319
 when microsoft solves this problem 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.720
 then you can install windows 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.180
 10 and only then can we talk about 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.250
 its incorrect work on the computer where 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.540
 windows used to work fine 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.489
 7 or windows 8 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.139
 but again , all of the above is mine 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.660
 I don't call anyone's personal opinion 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:03.030
 go to windows 10 and the female of this 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.799
 I will not do well and in the conclusion 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.000
 I propose to participate in the survey on 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.280
 about windows 10 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.900
 link to it is under this video 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.269
 let's see how in reality 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.739
 looks like a relationship 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.250
 users to the new operating 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.250
 system
