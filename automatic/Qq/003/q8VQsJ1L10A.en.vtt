secret<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.510> spring<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.960> basically<00:00:58.350> just

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
secret this spring is basically just

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.779 
secret this spring is basically just
using<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.890> concealer<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.460> my<00:00:59.579> blending

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
using a concealer with my blending

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.729 
using a concealer with my blending
sponge<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.449> why<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.899> like<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.559> because

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
sponge and why I like this is because

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.560 
sponge and why I like this is because
with<00:01:02.100> my<00:01:02.219> blending<00:01:02.399> sponge<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:03.149> sprinkle

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
with my blending sponge I just sprinkle

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.990 
with my blending sponge I just sprinkle
it<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.920> like<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> few<00:01:05.489> drops<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.939> water

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
it and like like a few drops of water

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.300 
it and like like a few drops of water
onto<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.960> then<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.560> makes<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.100> tip

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
onto it and then that just makes the tip

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.890 
onto it and then that just makes the tip
really<00:01:08.520> moist<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.060> stuff<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.510> then<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.750> just

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
really moist and stuff and then I just

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260 
really moist and stuff and then I just
use<00:01:10.049> my<00:01:10.080> concealer<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.000> basically

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
use my concealer and that just basically

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.390 
use my concealer and that just basically
covers<00:01:12.689> up<00:01:12.869> all<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.409> slots<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.890> want<00:01:14.189> and
