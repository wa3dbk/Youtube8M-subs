00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.110
 Good money I do not assume 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.820
 but the wind is just for fun too 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.520
 only that means negotiation if you are one 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.000

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.290

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.830

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:10.320
 also gets the food 15 depending on 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.710
 if she stands and how wobbly the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.570
 begin 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.220
 I will put that into the description 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.539
 what you need for that is the link there 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.350
 if you wanted to join in there and then 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.689
 I was still the second point 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.369
 I will address you today 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.369
 evening still make a live stream 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.979
 and it starts at 17 o'clock 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.590
 Of course, going on would be nice if 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.770
 monkeys while you would and yes I will 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.450
 finally get the partnership 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.070
 means I want all right again 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.259
 This has all of them now too 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.830

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.360
 Incidentally, I will be on stream 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.920
 So everything extreme I will play the games 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.959
 we do that because the stream is not that 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.020
 tournament in itself but I play 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:04.880
 I will also render that 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.100
 means she could look at it too 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.679
 on my stream is synonymous yes like 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.110
 said a description otherwise 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.650
