00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 So people welcome back to Pokemon 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.319
 We catch omega ruby ​​in this part 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.059
 I'm the left westrick to me 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.759
 the em-fourth as in the story 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.889
 get it call your lake city us ever 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.740
 after what have value and then 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.080
 We fly in the air when we are outraged 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.359
 now at least three pokémon in the team 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.170
 have the maximum friendship value 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.789
 have value 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.570
 then we find here in the me of 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.890
 mosbach city the unexplored cave there 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.580
 We definitely want to go in 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.800
 the cave 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.390
 because there is the blessed clio 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.670
 want to catch best practice for today 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.379
 You can meet there every day 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:47.309
 between four o'clock in the morning and 19 o'clock 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.920
 59 in the evening pure air is wild 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.129
 has agreed cheerfully opened can feel 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.800
 I say so now we find 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.489
 the second of the legendary here in this 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.980
 portal 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.170
 it is obvious 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.920
 like all other time bounds 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.320
 events the users of 3ds not circumstances 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.920
 otherwise you will be for 24 hours 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.979
 he is spellbound by these events 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.400
 quite a good thing 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.189
 remains is it is very balanced 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.439
 Of course, that too should be psycho 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.640
 must but his course, 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.860
 jo jo jo jo jo jo dat more correct 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.360
 luck and of course that too 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.659
 ability hover as said by the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.369
 It is relatively balanced 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.259
 which is not necessarily an advantage 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.720
 is because by that it stops 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.829
 balanced it is currently like 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.110
 wife chickens 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.390
 So that's what the student counts for then 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.290
 theoretically could also be window balls 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.490
 use 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.490
 I'm not sure 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.969
 I just look at my first student 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.619
 therefore more one as mentioned 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.979
 in that this is relatively balanced 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.590
 nowhere is it extraordinary 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.709
 good starts but of course nothing 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:12.180
 except under worst but that's why 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:14.970
 is not it the best book now? 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.250
 is quite cool from the trio I like 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.069
 nevertheless least and general 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:26.879
 I like it that theo megamäßig 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:29.250
 I have to say because they have 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.970
 somehow it's nothing special 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.220
 Clearly in theaters always see one 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.620
 very similar from within the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.340
 trios are the dolls creative house though 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.810
 especially here these differ 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.849
 the less clear the color 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.170
 is different so a bit of the 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:52.079
 head is a bit different but otherwise 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.470
 however, they are relatively alike when 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:58.380
 only eleven opinion good as that was 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.200
 but try a lot with hyper-v it is 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.109
 do not do it and he does not know 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.950
 really if it counts so so 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:09.090
 Cave in there would be yes we have great 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.660
 Drove okay it went faster than 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.510
 thought 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.239
 pity very fine so we have the 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.549
 pink head already caught that 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.079
 I am very pleased 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.450
 respect it is always so not in the net 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.370
 brings because it is said in English so 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.720
 and if she wants a lot like her 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.250
 here with wife is written and im 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.349
 English only the woman by that 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.299
 it will be replaced in german 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.389
 the team through which you understand 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.430
 what do you mean that it was loud? 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.169
 the people the all of mourning 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.810
 pain and joy 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:45.829
 Well then bring us the friends at times 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:48.350
 3 times bring us three old walk it 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:52.940
 continue and yeah 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:56.810
 june and okay that's all 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.370
 so then we would have caught that 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.960
 It was then already with this part he 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.490
 Hope the partner will please you if you like 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.500
 so is also liked about feedback 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.330
 and then we'll see you at the next party 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.010

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.010
 Have a nice day and all the best
