00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.790
 Welcome back to a new one 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.530
 gameplay commentary here on the social 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.090
 can clarify if, however, to kick 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.470
 comments topic is coming up a bit 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.360
 Gameplay in the background and that's it 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.930
 her a solo trip to moab today 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.150
 map dom 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.500
 the whole thing arose with the acr and 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.180
 you can be really good in any case 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.280
 give all it was played by the 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.780
 black stars course link to their and 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.309
 main channel course with bottom in the 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.450
 video description so if you like 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.280
 You can do that again 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.200
 watch it that 's it in principle already 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.879
 we'll get to think kick topics 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.650
 actually after every video it is now 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.420
 on facebook the videos where you animals 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.710
 torment where they beat people together 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.930
 or I have recently, for example 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.879
 seen someone suicide 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.890
 Filmed like someone just from 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.570
 skyscraper jumps up and onto the street 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.489
 pops that just someone filmed 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.870
 and after every video I think 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.820
 actually okay there you actually have 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.560
 the disturbed things actually seen 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.510
 I can not shock anything anymore 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.090
 are you so bugged right ? 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.880
 is sad and every time again 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.979
 every time I'm convinced that 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.680
 that was not the worst thing 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.720
 is still sick people love everywhere 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.240
 it so sorry for me these videos tag 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.850
 every day to look at the day 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.500
 on my home page every day i have to 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.479
 this fucking videos just watch 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.460
 which start automatically and on facebook 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.780
 the last high club is i can do it 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.369
 but not otherwise do people say everything 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.140
 principle but also only the prologue to the 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.299
 whole topic and that a long time ago 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.820
 a colleague of mine in whatsapp groups 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.799
 left sends where it went to the video what 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.689
 I turned around that 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.939
 by and large, never really 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.380
 what belongs to me in principle, too 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.729
 did not care because I over 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.560
 such topics actually at all 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.140
 I do not want to know anything or me 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.820
 not exactly inform about it 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.320
 I 'm not looking explicitly for and now 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.570
 says hediger that interests me now 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.100
 I had to do that but there 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.020
 I looked at the video there it went 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.609
 The top 10 is sick and says 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.109
 this in data russen and whole 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.729
 it describes the whole but actually that 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.380
 what I see on facebook every day 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.180
 and on the other social networks 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.980
 everywhere gc-leadership violence goes everywhere 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.190
 somehow it that people in mind 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.930
 to attract weaker creatures too 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.610
 massacres torture and torture 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.190
 where people just do their job 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.800
 play and where people actually only 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.810
 make shit and her 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.790
 banks perverse somehow drove 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.560
 but already say that that 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.330
 data world is a lot worse than 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.310
 what you can do in the normal internet too 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.690
 I personally get to see you there 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.330
 not on it I inform myself about 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.680
 Docus on other videos and that 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.540
 I'll try this one for you now 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.190
 bit convey and I declare 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.870
 Just what you sick for it shit 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.550
 in principle, has already said there 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.490
 is there anything in the principle 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.960
 drugs there are weapons there's 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.060
 child pornography there are people who 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.770
 small animals catch up to it 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.960

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.330
 a sick i shit my some 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.830
 People find that sexually stimulating me 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.560
 mine were the ones who made it 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.860
 bands of gail women on animals rum 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.650
 kick and I kill my sick 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.080
 goes sick and it is ok please in the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.180
 psychiatry age there you have to 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.220
 get treated and not in the 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.500
 internet search age what's up with 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.150
 um who makes the devil the whole 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.250
 even that was not yet 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.470
 the worst one thinks okay no 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.270
 it's actually worse 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.000
 is getting worse among other things 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.770
 there are pages with the name slave 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.360
 The non-retiree draws that describes 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.400
 all the services it 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.680
 there is and indeed there is the slave 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.420
 m fucking transporter in front of your door 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.340
 to be delivered in front of your door 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.239
 Just come to your home 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.580
 all right 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.320
 these are slaves that are slaves 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.360
 with separated two so that not 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.520
 Can run away as sex slaves 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.530
 these are young girls 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.540
 I think guys and so there's synonymous 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.880
 I do not know. I think that's bad 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.620
 Ill think about it and that 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.350
 the legs are cut off 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.000
 there are no nativity of birth to the 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.500
 the legs are cut off so that the 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.840
 can not and will then run 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.820
 sold and people make that he 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.350
 somewhere when you can not get up 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.480
 live this fucking planet when you can 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.250
 something like that is heard in pretty much every top 10 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.600
 there is also a side to us again 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.060
 was actually describing this page 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.549
 All together there's a principle 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.040
 Everything in front of the running webcam you can 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.870
 interact with the people in the 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.310
 principle in humans just kill the 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.900
 People are happy about the people 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.290
 rape and so on and so on 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.960
 continue 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.300
 in principle, this page describes how 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.830
 the worst thing ever 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.080
 people can be done and I 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.820
 do not understand the devil again like so 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.210
 which can happen somehow every day 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.949
 What 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.569
 with the people is going on and what the 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.190
 people simply impels as to what 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.479
 I can not understand it 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.380
 and I want it, I think so 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.840
 do not understand 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.360
 I just hope someday 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.889
 with it to end sometime there are such 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.160
 ill people no longer it is 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.720
 just sad that something like that exists and me 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.610
 Hope everyone of you sees it that way 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.680
 I think each one of you like that 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.259
 I know that in principle that is every one of 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.880
 you see it's just the healthy one 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:06.340
 common sense of the one says 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.770
 noinger that's not fair that 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.889
 you do not do why did not have that 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.900
 every person why are only a large part 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.699
 the people take such causes as 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.460
 that the girls are okay thicker here 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.110
 I pass a border okay that 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.520
 is bad you do not do that why 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.770
 not everyone has this 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.050
 Responsibility what actually 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.789
 in each of us should have someday 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.320
 that's pretty good ending me 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.460
 I hope I could entertain you 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.740
 I hope I could maybe you too 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.199
 his eyes open in his perfidious way 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.909
 and wise I do not know it I want 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.289
 Just to have said people again 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.909
 will not be to such it is 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.710
 just to do this illegally and 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.849
 I just hope none of you has 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.409
 either that's what you need 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.840
 It's not good that it looks good 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:48.039
 to look at it and you can even do that 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.289
 do not bounce off of anyone that is 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.060
 just inferior so do not go 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.349
 on sunshine people's principle was it 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.669
 that again for today's people 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.650
 we'll be listening to each other for the next few weeks 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.270
 sometime again has a name 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.870
 Have a nice time thinking of the 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.320
 beautiful things in life was clear 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.320
 you
