00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.289
 Hi everybody 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.670
 so today we will learn the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.300
 blog to fakie 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.300
 we left 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.210
 to make a full speech pot 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.150
 arrived in the peat with enough 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.320
 speed 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.300
 put your head on the popping you 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.390
 want 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.650
 levet the back of the skateboard 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.880
 once look and like this 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.530
 he will not make them a little 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.530
 impulse as desired 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.060
 scraped so as to trigger the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.610
 conflict debt 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.990
 it is here to fall back on the vices of 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.990
 way not to do d ibm 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.630
 where the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.430
 who would like 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.430
 enough speed for the roads 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:26.020
 be well stuck on the edge of the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:30.870
 coaching at this level countries must 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:34.760
 to be like those who before or levis 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.760
 hold back well in the middle of the field 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.770
 snaps not loud enough so that the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.680
 stage jitters do not come to type in the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.630
 cockpit otherwise you're stuck and 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.210
 land down the curve and that makes 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.870
 rather bad 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.900
 once the poc keep me well the weight 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:01.140
 well perpendicular to your deck for 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.150
 avoid the hypers and you no longer have 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.240
 to let you go down 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.380
 who breaks through to report 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.560
 go into practice 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.410
 imagine 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.190
 latch you're going to make a paper at 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.580
 bed 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.000
 in this way on points 4 years 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.320
 there it is not all 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.380
 snap and wanted certainly in France by 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.380
 example 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.540
 and that's it for today 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.310
 so I'll see you soon for a 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.310
 next guy tricks hi to all
