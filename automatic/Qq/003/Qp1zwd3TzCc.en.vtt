00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
this deck and I just really wanted to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.660 
this deck and I just really wanted to
try<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.140> out<00:00:34.290> because<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.800> seemed<00:00:35.010> really<00:00:35.370> cool

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
try it out because it seemed really cool

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.340 
try it out because it seemed really cool
and<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.360> thought<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.660> guys<00:00:36.809> would<00:00:37.050> enjoy<00:00:37.110> it

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
and I thought you guys would enjoy it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.660 
and I thought you guys would enjoy it
too<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.829> let's<00:00:38.040> go<00:00:38.129> ahead<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.340> take<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.550> look

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
too so let's go ahead and take a look

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.850 
too so let's go ahead and take a look
over<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> deck<00:00:39.210> before<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.570> get<00:00:39.629> started

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
over the deck before we get started

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.940 
over the deck before we get started
alright<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:42.230> basic<00:00:43.230> premise<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> duck

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
alright so the basic premise of the duck

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.680 
alright so the basic premise of the duck
is<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.280> want<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.550> get<00:00:44.760> omniscient<00:00:45.270> into<00:00:45.510> play

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
is you want to get omniscient into play

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.779 
is you want to get omniscient into play
and<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.110> know<00:00:46.170> we've<00:00:46.440> tried<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.860> out<00:00:47.010> 12<00:00:47.760> and

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
and I know we've tried this out 12 and

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.639 
and I know we've tried this out 12 and
me<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.090> Brad<00:00:48.239> already<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:49.079> i<00:00:49.110> think<00:00:49.350> our<00:00:49.469> deck

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
me and Brad already but i think our deck

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.700 
me and Brad already but i think our deck
which<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.950> built<00:00:50.160> poorly<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.140> it<00:00:52.140> showed<00:00:52.500> as<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
which is built poorly and it showed as a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.040 
which is built poorly and it showed as a
result<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.940> particular<00:00:54.600> version<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
result this particular version of the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.729 
result this particular version of the
deck<00:00:55.230> uses<00:00:55.500> omniscience<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.430> cast<00:00:57.739> door

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
deck uses omniscience to cast door

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.319 
deck uses omniscience to cast door
nothingness<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.489> then<00:00:59.609> temporal<00:00:59.969> mastery

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
nothingness and then temporal mastery

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.209 
nothingness and then temporal mastery
and<00:01:00.420> then<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.930> win<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> game<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
and then you just win the game the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.070 
and then you just win the game the
sideboard<00:01:02.640> has<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> bunch<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.480> different<00:01:03.629> plans

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
sideboard has a bunch of different plans

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.600 
sideboard has a bunch of different plans
but<00:01:04.379> we'll<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:05.369> that's

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
but we'll get to that but that's

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.210 
but we'll get to that but that's
basically<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.900> way<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> deck<00:01:07.710> kills<00:01:08.040> you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
basically the the way the deck kills you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.429 
basically the the way the deck kills you
is<00:01:08.369> by<00:01:08.549> going<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.939> form<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.210> serrated<00:01:09.540> door<00:01:09.780> but

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
is by going to form a serrated door but

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.050 
is by going to form a serrated door but
we<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> few<00:01:11.040> other<00:01:11.159> ways<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.520> win<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.909> we

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
we have a few other ways to win like we

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.510 
we have a few other ways to win like we

temporal master is there I guess against
some<00:03:20.580> decks<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:20.880> just<00:03:21.060> need<00:03:21.330> to<00:03:21.420> have<00:03:21.540> another

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
some decks you just need to have another

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.810 
some decks you just need to have another
time<00:03:22.020> walk<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:22.500> that<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:22.800> can<00:03:23.010> chain<00:03:23.580> time

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
time walk so that you can chain time

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.940 
time walk so that you can chain time
walks<00:03:24.060> over<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.480> over<00:03:24.630> again<00:03:24.840> but<00:03:25.470> I'm<00:03:25.709> not

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
walks over and over again but I'm not

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.710 
walks over and over again but I'm not
actually<00:03:26.640> sure<00:03:26.970> how<00:03:27.390> that<00:03:27.600> works

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
actually sure how that works

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.360 
actually sure how that works
specifically<00:03:28.350> but<00:03:28.980> we<00:03:29.100> have<00:03:29.190> two<00:03:29.340> more

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
specifically but we have two more

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.280 
specifically but we have two more
terminus<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.240> planar<00:03:30.540> cleansing<00:03:30.840> is<00:03:31.080> just

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
terminus and a planar cleansing is just

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.470 
terminus and a planar cleansing is just
more<00:03:31.410> wrath<00:03:31.620> effects<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.220> then<00:03:32.760> we<00:03:32.940> have<00:03:33.060> two

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
more wrath effects and then we have two

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.910 
more wrath effects and then we have two
things<00:03:33.720> our<00:03:33.900> relation<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.440> thoughtful<00:03:34.830> air

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
things our relation and a thoughtful air

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.620 
things our relation and a thoughtful air
against<00:03:35.340> decks<00:03:35.550> where<00:03:35.790> we<00:03:36.000> don't<00:03:36.120> have<00:03:36.300> that

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
against decks where we don't have that

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.570 
against decks where we don't have that
much<00:03:36.780> time<00:03:37.050> or<00:03:37.770> where<00:03:38.010> we<00:03:38.100> do<00:03:38.220> have<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.370> lot<00:03:38.520> of

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
much time or where we do have a lot of

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.070 
much time or where we do have a lot of
time<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:38.970> we<00:03:39.060> just<00:03:39.240> want<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.480> get<00:03:39.630> more<00:03:39.750> cards

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
time and we just want to get more cards

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.620 
time and we just want to get more cards
and<00:03:40.260> then<00:03:40.740> we<00:03:40.830> have<00:03:40.980> one<00:03:41.310> wildfire<00:03:41.850> which<00:03:42.120> is

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
and then we have one wildfire which is

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.150 
and then we have one wildfire which is
actually<00:03:42.900> pretty<00:03:43.290> sweet<00:03:43.560> against<00:03:43.800> a<00:03:43.890> lot<00:03:44.040> of

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
actually pretty sweet against a lot of

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.070 
actually pretty sweet against a lot of
decks<00:03:44.340> it's<00:03:45.060> not<00:03:45.150> very<00:03:45.300> good<00:03:45.540> against<00:03:45.750> things

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
decks it's not very good against things

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.370 
decks it's not very good against things
with<00:03:46.260> undying<00:03:47.510> or<00:03:48.510> opposing<00:03:48.959> throw<00:03:49.110> actos

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
with undying or opposing throw actos

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.229 
with undying or opposing throw actos
decks<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:49.890> it's<00:03:50.190> really<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.580> weird<00:03:50.850> card<00:03:51.120> to

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
decks so it's really a weird card to

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.630 
decks so it's really a weird card to
have<00:03:51.390> in<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.660> sideboard<00:03:52.290> but<00:03:52.890> i<00:03:52.920> like<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.370> and

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
have in the sideboard but i like it and

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.270 
have in the sideboard but i like it and
some<00:03:53.850> matchups<00:03:54.060> where<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:55.200> have<00:03:55.830> omniscience

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
some matchups where you have omniscience

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.680 
some matchups where you have omniscience
in<00:03:56.430> play<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:56.850> you<00:03:56.970> like<00:03:57.270> let's<00:03:57.510> say<00:03:57.600> you

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
in play and you like let's say you

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.390 
in play and you like let's say you
alchemist<00:03:58.170> refuge<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.770> then<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.010> can<00:03:59.190> put

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
alchemist refuge and then you can put

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.729 
alchemist refuge and then you can put
spells<00:03:59.700> underneath<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.660> world<00:04:00.840> fire<00:04:01.110> so<00:04:01.709> that

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
spells underneath the world fire so that

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.500 
spells underneath the world fire so that
they'll<00:04:02.070> resolve<00:04:02.370> after<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:03.060> world<00:04:03.270> fire

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
they'll resolve after the world fire

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.170 
they'll resolve after the world fire
