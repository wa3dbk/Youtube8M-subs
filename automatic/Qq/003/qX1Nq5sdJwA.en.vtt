00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:03.609

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:10.039

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.959
 name is andy and the avilÃ©s will teach me 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:14.539
 They are delicious with mushrooms that 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.619
 The couscous is really delicious 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.480
 great alternative to replace 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.189
 any type of pasta and also for 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.780
 replace any type of rice is 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.550
 very low in calories so if they are 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.740
 diet this recipe is perfect for you 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.390
 it's the preparation time and the time 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.340
 of cooking combined approximately 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.210
 15 minutes I hope this recipe will 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.210
 like, let's start 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.640
 remember that the list of ingredients 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.530
 is in the description of this video and 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.710
 they will also find it on my blog 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.930
 where they can print the complete recipe 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.730
 let's start in a pan over medium heat van 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.660
 to heat a tablespoon of oil 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.820
 olive 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.980
 and since the oil is hot now 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.930
 they are going to cook onion and garlic for 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.710
 about 2 minutes to be 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.710
 soften a little 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.590
 then the mushrooms are going to be added 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.570
 and they are going to cook them on medium low heat 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.570
 for approximately 5 minutes 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.799
 after five minutes the mushrooms 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.439
 they are also soft so now 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.369
 We are going to season them with a little salt and 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.369
 ground black pepper 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.189
 stir in a little 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.079
 and then add the liquid I 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.119
 I'm using vegetable broth but 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.520
 They can use water or they can use 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.469
 chicken broth and the same amount of 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.569
 couscous is the same amount of water as 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.759
 they will need if they are using a 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.250
 cup and a half of couscous are going to need 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.259
 a cup and a half of liquid remember the 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.539
 water or the broth should be hot 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.179
 so that it starts to boil soon I 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.640
 Heat the broth in the microwave for 2 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.319
 minutes now I'm going to cover the pan and 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.969
 I'm going to let the liquid boil 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.770
 the water is already hot this will take 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.010
 approximately about 2 minutes or 3 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.320
 minutes when a lot 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.640
 since the liquid is boiling now 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.590
 you are going to add the couscous 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.159
 stir well so that everything is well 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.159
 mixed 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.940
 and then lower the fire to the lowest 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.190
 cover the pan again with the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.380
 cover and make sure the pan or 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.050
 the pan is well sealed so that 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.360
 the steam does not escape and we are going to cook 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.760
 the couscous for approximately 5 minutes 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.200
 or until the liquid has dried and 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.180
 the couscous is soft 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.489
 here I have about a quarter of 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.780
 cup of mushrooms are sliced and 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.849
 I'm going to skip them in a little 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.290
 olive oil for approximately 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.690
 five minutes to soften a 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.290
 little and only are seasoned with salt 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.090
 and pepper 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.799
 and as I say, I'm just going to 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.170
 cook for 5 minutes so that it 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.030
 soften a bit and then I'm going to 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.939
 book these will be to decorate the 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.829
 couscous at the time of serving it that's how 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.480
 you see the couscous after 5 minutes 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.090
 as you can see the liquid is already 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.459
 completely evaporated and the couscous 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.319
 it is also well cooked now what 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.810
 let's stir with a fork so that 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:06.549
 it will sponge a little bit now we are going to 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.549
 add the scallion and the cilantro 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.209
 and to finish I like to add 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.920
 a little bit of butter is 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.379
 about half a spoonful of 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.450
 butter but this step is 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.069
 Completely optional the butter does not 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.989
 it is really necessary that the couscous 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.819
 as it is already perfect after 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.370
 add the butter I'm going to mix by 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.620
 last try the taste and add more 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.700
 salt and pepper if you think it's necessary and 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.700
 that is all 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.319
 now the couscous is ready to serve 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.970
 I'm going to decorate it with the rest of the 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.780
 mushrooms and with a little more than 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.430
 coriander 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.430
 and that's all good advantage 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.569
