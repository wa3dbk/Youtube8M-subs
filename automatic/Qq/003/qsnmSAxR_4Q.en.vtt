DNA<00:04:17.560> is<00:04:17.830> a<00:04:18.220> molecular<00:04:18.549> blueprint<00:04:19.450> for<00:04:19.930> a

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
DNA is a molecular blueprint for a

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.219 
DNA is a molecular blueprint for a
living<00:04:20.350> thing<00:04:20.620> how<00:04:21.340> does<00:04:21.400> it<00:04:21.640> work

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
living thing how does it work

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.379 
living thing how does it work
DNA<00:04:23.229> creates<00:04:23.620> RNA<00:04:24.190> RNA<00:04:24.669> creates<00:04:25.510> protein

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
DNA creates RNA RNA creates protein

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.719 
DNA creates RNA RNA creates protein
proteins<00:04:27.199> go<00:04:27.919> on<00:04:28.129> to<00:04:28.310> form<00:04:28.639> life<00:04:30.250> this<00:04:31.250> entire

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
proteins go on to form life this entire

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.779 
proteins go on to form life this entire
process<00:04:32.150> is<00:04:32.689> complicated<00:04:33.650> as<00:04:34.099> sophisticated

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
process is complicated as sophisticated

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.589 
process is complicated as sophisticated
as<00:04:35.419> magical<00:04:36.289> as<00:04:36.379> it<00:04:36.560> might<00:04:36.770> seem<00:04:37.099> is<00:04:37.599> entirely

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
as magical as it might seem is entirely

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:42.700 
as magical as it might seem is entirely
based<00:04:39.139> in<00:04:39.639> chemistry<00:04:40.639> it<00:04:41.360> can<00:04:41.539> be<00:04:41.659> studied<00:04:41.990> it

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
based in chemistry it can be studied it

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.330 
based in chemistry it can be studied it
can<00:04:42.919> be<00:04:43.009> understood<00:04:44.379> I'm<00:04:45.379> John<00:04:45.770> Perry<00:04:46.099> and

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
can be understood I'm John Perry and

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.129 
can be understood I'm John Perry and
that's<00:04:46.969> DNA<00:04:47.710> stated<00:04:48.710> clearly
