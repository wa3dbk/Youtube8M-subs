00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.629
 the novelties of this last naruto 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.309
 We were in a car, contrast a little 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.320
 with what it was last year watermelon 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.390
 in them it was a little point of 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.370
 inflection in the saga store 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.660
 take back what will be the two 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.309
 first titles the other braces stones 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.320
 and the story continues from there 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.950
 continuous from the arc ping is 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.540
 where it ended are two and will continue 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.790
 up to what it is up to the current point 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.650
 of the anime that is the great grand line it 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.810
 they will include many more characters 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.910
 It is the largest staff of characters 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.280
 wanted to where the saga there 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.840
 novelties players have of course been 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.340
 included a new awakening system that 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.509
 allow some characters performed 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.119
 any time you have to wait until 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.530
 that the character is almost lifeless and 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.750
 the fighting returns against the great 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.910
 enemies but in some of them not 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.810
 We will be alone and against each other 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.369
 moments we have to face 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.860
 us to several enemies at the same time 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.330
 it is also a novelty that we use is 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.619
 very accurate, several have already appeared 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.880
 enemies on the screen and then we 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.490
 we can move with others so it's the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.710
 combat ring to finish them 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.450
 we are also in decision system 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.679
 you can choose two paths sometimes 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.920
 different to face one more 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.179
 easy takes harder than you can 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.880
 change a bit of the development of 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.780
 game and that will give us points to improve 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.570
 the skills of the characters 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.510
 we have a story mode that starts with 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.780
 the prologue 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.720
 the club and attack with leaf and as I said 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.140
 continues from term 2 after 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.410
 ping attack until some time of the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.780
 fourth great ninja war you have wanted 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.300
 pay homage to the saga in some way 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.640
 manga not in what form you have done it if 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.970
 we have taken advantage of and good in the edition 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.260
 of the author's launching all 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.950
 editions issued collector data 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.960
 because we have two editions 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.590
 collector one dedicated to nature 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.300
 decade that really one dedicated to the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.410
 heroes of the saga and another decade the 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.540
 villains we no longer know why this is so 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.730
 I feel without fucking a little bit 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.040
 15 calm channels a little men a 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.310
 little evil we're going to see it like that then 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.819
 includes an exclusive Naruto costume 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.370
 dressed as goku I still like with the suit 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.129
 or we all know with stick to the back 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.879
 and what a good way a little bit 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:03.900
 special to do the deception instead of 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.900
 use a hand well 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.400
 exact but good very well you have me 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.079
 said that there are actually two 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.349
 selections collectors true one 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.329
 dedicated to the villains not that in this 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.280
 case gives us all the players 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.200
 with a super cool figure of those who 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.730
 really and others the heroes with the 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.680
 dynamite figure do we have for a 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.510
 side the wheel of fire edition that is 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.819
 let's say the dedicated edition of naruto 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.439
 santa de naruto the two editions have 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.810
 a soundtrack have a poster of 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:34.480
 double-sided has a special box and 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.639
 have one and have a figure in one case 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.590
 everything is set in the heroes and the 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.720
 figuration to mourning and in another case is the 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.370
 of the villains and is while the 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.900
 sugar figures is the biggest game 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.819
 what I've done as adults to date has 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.730
 more characters than ever and even in 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.340
 we had seventy-odd people 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.160
 I have many characters 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.379
 we were missing almost nobody now we have 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.000
 even more has been further improved the 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.980
 system the system of struggle to make 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.580
 our asset to do it more and more 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.000
 there are all spectacular until 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.700
 it is immense all the battles 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.180
 most identifiable of the 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.739
 of the series from the beginning we can 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.169
 face the club and destroy with 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.510
 leaf with practically houses coming out 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.130
 flying 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.740
 then he is a very big adult very 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.180
 spectacular and above all is living the 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.919
 anime do you want to say some last 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.110

 for the after- dinner but also the 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.490
 3ds version that is different is a 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:59.029
 parody but good that sure
