00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.700
 He is the Olympic champion Steve Gerda 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.530
 gold in london 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.290
 his triumph is something 1 graphic in life 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.089
 to be able to experience that and I have it 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.730
 I often said that but I feel 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.609
 really again is sure that the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.590
 just more happened 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.269
 I'll be safe for my life 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.939
 then the people which stand behind it and 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.939
 Above all, my father would be grateful 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:35.070
 his golden horse is a dream for him 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.309
 that's more than that, I have to go now 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.230
 I think so my life long 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.379
 Driver and his owner grateful 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.649
 be that yes that I experience something like that 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.030
 was allowed and therefore the best for me 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.840
 that happened in my life so far 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:56.310
 is and I totally believe my life 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:01.740
 a lot but a positive change 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:04.110
 Nino is recovering from a winter holiday 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.780
 to geneva he has not worked briefly 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.970
 have luck with the weather that it is beautiful 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.180
 is that he is still in the woods after every day 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.860
 Nino could have had one 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.350
 much more understood 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.910
 You can still win in pairs if I 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.350
 I'm a rider for my other horses 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.120
 Also not good if thats me 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.520
 not today if I'm with the 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.250
 others are strong 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.840
 I also often lose 80 win it 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.160
 That's nice, too, but it is 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.500
 important that then just the people 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.229
 understand that this is really the couple 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.869
 wins and that the horse so whole 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.910
 100 percent is included 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.800
 to win new fans for equestrian sports 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.050
 That's his thing 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.810
 that's what we say our sport where 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.759
 actually is so beautiful and unfortunately 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.650
 sometimes so unknown is for the people 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.550
 from the outside that they as well as some 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.070
 I'll bite it in there and that 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.650
 somehow that our sport somehow 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.899
 the popularity deserves it 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.270
 at first, because I think the people 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.250
 such tournaments also like him in Basel 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.050
 or as many beautiful tournaments as us 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.520
 in switzerland if you have one 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.070
 They want to be there again 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.280
 come because the sport is just belief 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.670
 I'm much hornier than you usually are 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.910
 could imagine 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.250
 he dreams again in late august normandie 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.380
 everybody wants the world championship 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:29.069

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.069
