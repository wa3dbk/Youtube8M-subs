or that because if I just leave this in
here<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.440> be<00:00:13.530> horrible<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:14.099> don't<00:00:14.580> notice<00:00:14.759> from

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
here to be horrible I don't notice from

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.640 
here to be horrible I don't notice from
a<00:00:14.969> cinematic<00:00:15.420> perspective<00:00:15.900> with<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.080> VC<00:00:16.470> and

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
a cinematic perspective with the VC and

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.620 
a cinematic perspective with the VC and
the<00:00:16.740> exterior<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.850> pretty<00:00:18.240> much<00:00:18.330> better

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
the exterior just is pretty much better

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.480 
the exterior just is pretty much better
than<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.960> real<00:00:19.109> thing<00:00:19.170> for<00:00:19.560> me<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.949> did<00:00:20.430> however

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
than the real thing for me I did however

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.890 
than the real thing for me I did however
switch<00:00:20.910> up<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.060> paint's<00:00:21.420> every<00:00:21.600> once<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:21.869> a

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
switch up the paint's every once in a

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.269 
switch up the paint's every once in a
while<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.260> there<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.470> little<00:00:22.650> variation<00:00:23.100> there

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
while so there is little variation there

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.250 
while so there is little variation there
I<00:00:23.460> actually<00:00:23.939> added<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.420> lot<00:00:24.510> more<00:00:24.570> glow<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
I actually added a lot more glow to the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.640 
I actually added a lot more glow to the
shots<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.800> think<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.160> feels<00:00:26.900> more<00:00:27.900> glam<00:00:28.260> and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
shots I think it feels more glam and

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.929 
shots I think it feels more glam and
kind<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.890> like<00:00:29.010> an<00:00:29.130> alternate<00:00:29.460> reality<00:00:29.550> of

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
kind of like an alternate reality of

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.130 
kind of like an alternate reality of
some<00:00:30.119> sort<00:00:30.330> i'm<00:00:30.420> not<00:00:30.570> sure<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:30.869> something

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
some sort i'm not sure if it's something

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.080 
some sort i'm not sure if it's something
i'll<00:00:31.320> keep<00:00:31.500> doing<00:00:31.920> for<00:00:32.070> every<00:00:32.309> video<00:00:32.460> some

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
i'll keep doing for every video some

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.580 
i'll keep doing for every video some
environments<00:00:33.570> can<00:00:33.600> be<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> lot<00:00:33.960> brighter<00:00:34.260> just

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
environments can be a lot brighter just

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.500 
environments can be a lot brighter just
by<00:00:34.680> default<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.399> if<00:00:35.520> i<00:00:35.610> were<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.790> put<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.239> much

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
by default so if i were to put this much

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.030 
by default so if i were to put this much
glow<00:00:36.809> into<00:00:37.020> other<00:00:37.140> clips<00:00:37.440> for<00:00:37.620> other<00:00:37.710> videos

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
glow into other clips for other videos

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.740 
glow into other clips for other videos
