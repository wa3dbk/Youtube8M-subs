00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.439
 very many alocas we hurry the 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.019
 we collected and I already have a season 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:11.059
 more season we buy them because never 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.379
 we stop needing it I'm 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.509
 talking about the accessories and it's 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.250
 importance how they have that power so 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.710
 special to transform a look 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.000
 simple like the one I have today in a look 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.000
 completely different 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.760
 the lenses are one of the accessories 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.890
 basic essentials that every woman and 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.720
 man should have more even if arrived 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.880
 the spring and the first rays of 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.160
 sun you will choose you start to take what type 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.170
 of glasses we need there are trends are 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.820
 the lenses how to know what kind of lenses 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.670
 buy what I would tell them is that they 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.160
 let them guide by subscription and by their use 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.140
 for example they can opt for something super 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.210
 Playful as these lenses and connected 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.430
 Just like the ones in the movie, the list 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.410
 a letter that I think you have left 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.930
 to all kinds of faces that are the 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.910
 cat eye lenses that raising your 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.370
 square that elevates a lot again what 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.559
 gives you a taste of the other side and we 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.630
 option like these and assets for example 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.520
 which are a super classic style that 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.460
 we've seen it burst season by 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.680
 season for this spring they have in 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.899
 colors a luck or a but with a 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.470
 strong transparency I do not like are 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.470
 fresh 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.100
 ah 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.980
 and I find that the front with the 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.740
 greater temptation that a woman can 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.090
 have a lot of wallet so well 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.800
 I think if they are in the search for 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.720
 a prison and they want to invest for one of 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.820
 They leave them at a safe and 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.530
 versatile house I'm super stuck with the 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.840
 backpacks because they allow you 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.610
 load a lot of things and because in addition 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.110
 they are very comfortable to wear when not 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.430
 you want to carry like a portfolio in the 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.130
 which are already on their backs 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.300
 Maybe incredible I insist on choosing a 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.830
 model that is low 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.020
 then I would lean towards colors like 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.509
 those that are more raw colors and that 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.460
 allow us to use them in any 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.740
 Now it's time to talk to them 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.509
 in an indispensable mood I'm talking 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.509
 of earrings and necklaces 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.750
 everyone has a personality some are 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.190
 more formal than the others and everything 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.170
 really it depends on what you want 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.360
 for example, even in this same look 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.209
 opt for some lengths or feel a 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.400
 little bit more elegant and sophisticated like 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.930
 and we have much more chances and 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.270
 much more fun and much more 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.540
 juveniles like these kittens or are you 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.459
 skulls that still do not go out of style 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.469
 This chain is very fashionable 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.469
 words that is lewis and train 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.620
 and last but not least 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.990
 important the caps that are necessary 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.700
 favorite that I collect and I do treasure 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.230
 hear me we started talking about a 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.300
 prime season life of us 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.970
 we need something that protects us from the sun 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.060
 and not what I would not know I like everything 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.210

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.070
