00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:10.030
 and there comes the tip with the rossi egg 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.549
 what to do if you open raisins pesitos 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.349
 the but step does not pass them opened like 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:18.610
 so that I can not continue then accelerated 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:21.990
 is for being second 1 third in some 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.990
 moment came with some problem or matÃ­as 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.440
 just a small one and tromba on the straight 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.390
 and then the place where more complicated 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.570
 that's why they see that he's always looking for 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.660
 in it will be or will be that little bitch brought it 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.120
 short accelerator rossi and he was put to the 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.550
 bebe girolami that neither what 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.550
 accelerates goes too much to take care of the bull 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:52.320
 and the fight goes on and rossi who was trying 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:56.579
 move forward meanwhile they collide 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.440
 the son diego up to the baby view what 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.540
 I wear a little while max and juan 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.030
 maximum attended to diego and I already say 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.800
 we bard and then several others 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.140
 Once they were on the side of the road 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.410
 Bebu who was taking care not to spend 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.320
 too much the right foot rossi that 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.420
 I took a turn away from him 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.700
 going over in the curve was not that I was 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.700
 bad in the senate good and little bit 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.590
 that the mouth died said sectors glue 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.180
 and several cars were left out 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.180
 repeat the story in the final 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.250
 A) Yes 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:55.140
 raising everywhere celebrating that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:02:07.070
 It is good to know or badly 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:07.070
 but not good either slowly 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.640
 and if I do not come to run, I come to 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.129
 win and the team come lifting 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.360
 doing more than the truth I do not know in 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.099
 what career did I have that I am in 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.120
 auto a fork distinctive product 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.069
 offering the entire platoon 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.760
 I do not know if it goes to procedure or not but I 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.000
 I think you have to take action 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.640
 well everyone complained the question is 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.340
 that the baby ran to win by 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.189
 position series and achieving the third 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.250
 triumph in the girolami category with the 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:47.370
 bull well up not only wins the final 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.849
 but also that it fits as a leader 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.709
 of the championship of the tc 2012 victory for 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.140
 first time for makin park the 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.409
 I celebrate the joy and the highest the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.920
 egg that deserved this triumph the crying 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:04.700
 the tears the champagne mendoza was for 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.700
 he very effusive the me 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.790
 how did you see rossi the dew rhythm 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.340
 happy the truth that brought us everything to 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.410
 the harrow I do not know if I had any problem 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.650
 because the car later as he 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.090
 He reacted and went straight While 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.180
 hairpin like he was stopping and not 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:36.250
 let alone when we ran say 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.090
 sees slow down everyone but they came 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.670
 national has improved but they came 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.340
 too much playing and so what back 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.770
 causes an accident like the previous one in 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.480
 the first laps and mine because 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.490
 they raise in the slowest understand 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.770
 then there are all the 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.200
 brothers and they call them I know how was the 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.790
 horn not to hit the car ahead 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.250
 they hit me from behind and it's been a 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.960
 traffic all crashing and there was that 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.090
 slow to zero and try to dodge all 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.910
 I'm surprised by the pace of the cars 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.030
 back they had because if we see the 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.460
 series what I was doing was not a thing 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.440
 final is another was the and told experience 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.160
 what is the point to which it can be 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.230
 slow down a race 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.870
 no no I do not see loads lenses and I 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.280
 it seems that the burdens that run it say 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.260
 that historically was also 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.560
 penalized by the sports code 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.480
 international if you can not travel to 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.490
 a speed other than that of the 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.870
 competition requirement this does not 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.030
 I'm saying that someone has what 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.890
 I have done the opposite because I also 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.750
 we can find a slow return of a 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.580
 pile and layer that has a problem what 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.130
 what happens if we make this custom 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.720
 it's a problem so I think the 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.430
 limit can be easily evaluated first 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.470
 with a time and second check 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.870
 if that is repetitive in fact there are people 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.820
 It seems that it has few 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.770
 intentions to win and that yes not that 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.940
 that does not have to be promoted under any 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.280
 point of view it seems to me that those 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.570
 are directing certain pilots to 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.280
 that they do not win are causing the 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.330
 motorsport change mentality and that 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.330
 I do not think it has to happen
