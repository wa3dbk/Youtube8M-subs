sound<00:00:47.789> wave<00:00:49.550> in<00:00:50.550> Lego<00:00:51.500> by<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.559> way<00:00:53.120> also<00:00:54.120> if

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
sound wave in Lego by the way also if

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.490 
sound wave in Lego by the way also if
you<00:00:54.360> don't<00:00:54.600> already<00:00:54.780> know<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:58.260> me

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
you don't already know this this to me

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.410 
you don't already know this this to me
looks<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.219> over<00:00:59.489> here<00:00:59.760> this<00:01:00.000> camera

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
looks like it's over here this camera

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.680 
looks like it's over here this camera
just<00:01:00.570> reverses<00:01:01.109> everything<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.059> this<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.300> left

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
just reverses everything so this is left

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.850 
just reverses everything so this is left
and<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.500> right<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:05.600> know<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.840> weird<00:01:07.020> but

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.230 

yeah<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.070> got<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.490> microphone<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.689> got<00:01:13.850> set<00:01:14.850> door

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
yeah we got a microphone we got set door

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.580 
yeah we got a microphone we got set door
whoops<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.799> broke<00:01:17.009> off<00:01:18.590> which

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
whoops and it just broke off which

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.070 
whoops and it just broke off which
Laserbeak<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.490> nicely<00:01:21.390> fit<00:01:21.840> inside<00:01:24.080> doesn't

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
Laserbeak can nicely fit inside doesn't

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.590 
Laserbeak can nicely fit inside doesn't
close<00:01:25.439> completely<00:01:26.159> all<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> way<00:01:27.000> but<00:01:27.330> it's

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
close completely all the way but it's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:36.230 
close completely all the way but it's
good<00:01:28.140> enough<00:01:34.100> on<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> other<00:01:35.400> side<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.090> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
good enough on the other side we have a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.450 
good enough on the other side we have a
speaker<00:01:36.810> which<00:01:37.259> that's<00:01:37.829> just<00:01:38.100> head<00:01:38.430> I

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
speaker which that's just head I

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.280 
speaker which that's just head I
couldn't<00:01:38.909> really<00:01:39.000> figure<00:01:39.210> out<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.479> way<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> get

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
couldn't really figure out a way to get

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.870 
couldn't really figure out a way to get
it<00:01:40.409> hidden<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.659> see<00:01:42.659> two<00:01:42.840> holes<00:01:43.079> there<00:01:43.729> we<00:01:44.729> got

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
it hidden and see two holes there we got

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:53.410 
it hidden and see two holes there we got
two<00:01:45.090> batteries

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.240 

then<00:01:54.420> we<00:01:54.540> have<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.660> battery<00:01:54.930> cover<00:01:58.040> he's<00:01:59.040> ready

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
then we have a battery cover he's ready

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.330 
then we have a battery cover he's ready
to<00:01:59.370> go<00:01:59.490> we're<00:02:00.330> going<00:02:00.480> to<00:02:00.570> play<00:02:00.690> some<00:02:00.930> music

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
to go we're going to play some music

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.010 
to go we're going to play some music
yeah<00:02:02.340> i<00:02:02.370> just<00:02:02.460> gotta<00:02:02.820> move<00:02:03.090> laser<00:02:03.480> because

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
yeah i just gotta move laser because

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.100 
yeah i just gotta move laser because
he's<00:02:04.200> easier<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.010> transform<00:02:05.490> without<00:02:05.730> him<00:02:06.110> so

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
he's easier to transform without him so

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.560 
he's easier to transform without him so
now<00:02:07.620> i'll<00:02:07.710> show<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.039> transform<00:02:08.479> take<00:02:09.479> this

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
now i'll show you to transform take this

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.590 
now i'll show you to transform take this
whole<00:02:09.750> gun<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.320> off<00:02:13.010> spin<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.340> around<00:02:14.600> then

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
whole gun to you off spin it around then

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.340 
whole gun to you off spin it around then
you<00:02:15.780> move<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:17.460> right<00:02:17.640> here<00:02:18.170> yeah<00:02:19.170> i<00:02:19.200> know

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350

you move this to right here yeah i know
a<00:02:19.500> little<00:02:19.830> bit<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.160> take<00:02:20.370> apart<00:02:20.640> former<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.300> in

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
a little bit of take apart former but in

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.810 
a little bit of take apart former but in
the<00:02:21.690> original<00:02:21.750> g1<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.590> know<00:02:22.709> they<00:02:23.490> actually

the original g1 you know they actually
did<00:02:23.970> have<00:02:24.180> some<00:02:24.510> take<00:02:25.500> apart<00:02:25.800> farmers

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
did have some take apart farmers

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.080 
did have some take apart farmers
especially<00:02:26.970> uh<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:30.690> rocket<00:02:31.050> ship<00:02:31.230> guy<00:02:32.090> omega

type things you just oh I forgot laser

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.479 
type things you just oh I forgot laser
beaks<00:02:59.790> lasers<00:03:00.269> I<00:03:00.480> store<00:03:01.110> them<00:03:01.380> on<00:03:01.590> sound<00:03:02.280> wave

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
beaks lasers I store them on sound wave

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.870 
beaks lasers I store them on sound wave
and<00:03:02.760> he<00:03:03.660> will<00:03:03.810> not<00:03:03.989> transform<00:03:04.799> them<00:03:04.980> correctly

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
and he will not transform them correctly

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.590 
and he will not transform them correctly
if<00:03:06.030> those<00:03:06.209> are<00:03:06.360> on<00:03:07.250> now<00:03:09.799> spin<00:03:10.799> these<00:03:10.950> rounds<00:03:11.600> so

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
if those are on now spin these rounds so

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.690 
if those are on now spin these rounds so
facing<00:03:12.840> out<00:03:13.170> because<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.590> makes<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.830> lot<00:03:13.980> easier

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.630 

just<00:03:17.700> like<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:18.560> then<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.430> where<00:03:20.580> it

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
just like that then this is where it

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.860 
just like that then this is where it
gets<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.880> little<00:03:20.970> bit<00:03:21.150> tricky<00:03:21.510> because<00:03:21.630> he

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
gets a little bit tricky because he

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.539 
gets a little bit tricky because he
tends<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.440> fall<00:03:22.860> apart<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:27.239> want<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.540> kind<00:03:27.780> of

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
tends to fall apart you want to kind of

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:40.960 
tends to fall apart you want to kind of
kind<00:03:29.549> of<00:03:29.700> bring<00:03:32.900> yeah<00:03:37.160> let<00:03:38.160> me<00:03:38.310> pick<00:03:38.549> that<00:03:38.820> up

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:55.950 

please<00:03:41.970> don't<00:03:42.269> laugh<00:03:42.480> okay<00:03:43.790> go<00:03:44.790> ahead

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:04.750 

um<00:03:58.450> yeah<00:03:59.450> that<00:04:00.850> doesn't<00:04:01.850> usually<00:04:02.360> happen<00:04:03.760> well

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
um yeah that doesn't usually happen well

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.390 
um yeah that doesn't usually happen well
I<00:04:05.000> mean<00:04:05.180> does<00:04:05.570> break<00:04:05.840> quite<00:04:06.080> a<00:04:06.110> bit<00:04:06.290> but<00:04:06.500> not

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
I mean does break quite a bit but not

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.510 
I mean does break quite a bit but not
that<00:04:08.060> badly<00:04:08.600> anyway<00:04:09.470> what<00:04:09.950> I<00:04:09.980> was<00:04:10.130> saying<00:04:10.400> is

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
that badly anyway what I was saying is

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.090 
that badly anyway what I was saying is
it<00:04:10.820> it's<00:04:11.660> kinda<00:04:11.990> hard<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.230> show<00:04:12.410> you<00:04:12.470> this<00:04:12.710> but

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
it it's kinda hard to show you this but

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.080 
it it's kinda hard to show you this but
on<00:04:13.760> camera<00:04:14.690> but<00:04:14.810> you<00:04:14.930> want<00:04:15.080> to<00:04:15.170> kind<00:04:15.380> of<00:04:16.090> bring

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
on camera but you want to kind of bring

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.900 
on camera but you want to kind of bring
that<00:04:17.120> down<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:17.930> bring<00:04:18.140> that<00:04:18.170> up<00:04:18.769> at<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.730> same

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
that down and bring that up at the same

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.650 
that down and bring that up at the same
time<00:04:20.209> if<00:04:20.570> that<00:04:20.600> makes<00:04:20.959> any<00:04:21.109> sense<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:22.660> then

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
time if that makes any sense and then

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.740 
time if that makes any sense and then
kind<00:04:23.930> of<00:04:24.610> bend<00:04:25.610> it<00:04:25.820> out<00:04:25.970> a<00:04:26.000> little<00:04:26.270> bit<00:04:26.420> and

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
kind of bend it out a little bit and

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.100 
kind of bend it out a little bit and
then<00:04:27.020> push<00:04:27.560> it<00:04:27.680> all<00:04:27.770> back<00:04:27.950> together<00:04:29.110> you'll

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
then push it all back together you'll

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.080 
then push it all back together you'll
figure<00:04:30.320> it<00:04:30.440> out<00:04:30.590> once<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:30.890> make<00:04:31.070> it<00:04:31.310> if<00:04:31.580> you<00:04:31.640> oh

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
figure it out once you make it if you oh

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.030 
figure it out once you make it if you oh
yeah<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:32.960> may<00:04:33.170> want<00:04:33.320> to<00:04:33.380> do<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.590> legs<00:04:33.770> first

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
yeah you may want to do the legs first

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.660 
yeah you may want to do the legs first
so<00:04:34.400> I'll<00:04:35.030> start<00:04:35.300> on<00:04:35.390> those<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:36.770> legs<00:04:37.040> are<00:04:37.430> more

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
so I'll start on those the legs are more

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.910 
so I'll start on those the legs are more
complicated<00:04:38.240> than<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.050> original<00:04:39.500> sound

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
complicated than the original sound

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.770 
complicated than the original sound
we've<00:04:40.160> because<00:04:40.640> I<00:04:40.820> didn't<00:04:41.330> have<00:04:41.480> the<00:04:41.660> right

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
we've because I didn't have the right

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.540 
we've because I didn't have the right
pieces<00:04:42.230> I'm<00:04:43.210> severely<00:04:44.210> crying<00:04:44.990> low<00:04:45.290> on<00:04:45.650> joint

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
pieces I'm severely crying low on joint

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.490 
pieces I'm severely crying low on joint
pieces<00:04:47.090> and<00:04:47.270> all<00:04:47.360> that<00:04:47.570> so<00:04:47.840> I<00:04:47.870> had<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.110> kind<00:04:48.230> of

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
pieces and all that so I had to kind of

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.770 
pieces and all that so I had to kind of
improvise<00:04:49.010> as<00:04:50.000> you<00:04:50.120> can<00:04:50.210> see<00:04:50.419> those<00:04:50.570> two

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
improvise as you can see those two

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:57.930 
improvise as you can see those two
colors<00:04:51.020> don't<00:04:51.350> even<00:04:51.590> match<00:04:54.820> okay<00:04:56.140> easy<00:04:57.140> just

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
colors don't even match okay easy just

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:05.530 
colors don't even match okay easy just
fold<00:04:58.940> out<00:05:01.330> then<00:05:02.330> just<00:05:02.780> bend<00:05:03.080> them<00:05:03.410> down<00:05:04.540> so

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
fold out then just bend them down so

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.110 
fold out then just bend them down so
it's<00:05:05.660> like<00:05:05.690> that<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:06.520> his<00:05:07.520> legs<00:05:07.790> look<00:05:08.090> a

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
it's like that and his legs look a

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.870 
it's like that and his legs look a
little<00:05:08.300> bit<00:05:08.510> funky<00:05:08.960> because<00:05:09.650> of<00:05:09.890> my<00:05:10.700> life

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
little bit funky because of my life

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.100 
little bit funky because of my life
pieces<00:05:11.450> now<00:05:11.660> these<00:05:11.840> blue<00:05:12.200> things<00:05:12.229> just<00:05:14.110> spin

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
pieces now these blue things just spin

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:25.990 
pieces now these blue things just spin
around<00:05:15.229> and<00:05:19.660> for<00:05:20.660> the<00:05:20.720> final<00:05:20.930> part<00:05:24.310> these<00:05:25.310> if

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
around and for the final part these if

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.530 
around and for the final part these if
they<00:05:26.210> don't<00:05:26.419> fall<00:05:26.720> off<00:05:29.290> bend<00:05:30.290> them<00:05:31.060> well<00:05:32.060> even

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
they don't fall off bend them well even

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.900 
they don't fall off bend them well even
if<00:05:32.750> they<00:05:32.870> do<00:05:32.930> fall<00:05:33.890> off<00:05:34.070> bend<00:05:34.430> them
