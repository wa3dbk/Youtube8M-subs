00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
huge problem i was stuck in Torp with no

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.580 
huge problem i was stuck in Torp with no
OS<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.669> had<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> pretty<00:00:33.750> problem<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.350> then<00:00:34.500> I

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
OS so I had a pretty problem and then I

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.220 
OS so I had a pretty problem and then I
fixed<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.130> with<00:00:35.309> ADB<00:00:35.790> sideload<00:00:36.270> by<00:00:36.480> using<00:00:36.719> Torp

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
fixed it with ADB sideload by using Torp

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.979 
fixed it with ADB sideload by using Torp
so<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.160> was<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> big<00:00:38.730> deal<00:00:38.969> but<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.480> took<00:00:39.570> me<00:00:39.960> a

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
so it was on a big deal but I took me a

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.990 
so it was on a big deal but I took me a
week<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.290> figure<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.800> out<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> first

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
week to figure it out so the first

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.400 
week to figure it out so the first
problem<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.600> as<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.960> could<00:00:43.110> see<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
problem is as you could see the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.959 
problem is as you could see the
orientation<00:00:44.190> doesn't<00:00:44.309> work<00:00:44.610> perfectly<00:00:46.969> turn

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
prop one of the problem also on the lock

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.779 
prop one of the problem also on the lock
screen<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.289> can't<00:01:01.620> put<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.070> landscape<00:01:02.460> mode

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
it pretty much worked pretty well there

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.380 
it pretty much worked pretty well there
is<00:01:09.600> not<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.810> many<00:01:10.260> problem<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:11.700> some<00:01:12.090> games

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
is not that many problem on some games

is not that many problem on some games
like<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.960> trials<00:01:13.409> extreme3<00:01:14.010> let<00:01:14.909> me<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.210> if<00:01:15.299> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
like the trials extreme3 let me see if I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.330 
like the trials extreme3 let me see if I
could<00:01:15.450> demonstrate<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.350> as<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.159> see

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
could demonstrate to you as you can see

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.370 
could demonstrate to you as you can see
I'm<00:01:17.580> holding<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.330> way<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.960> facing

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
I'm holding it this way it's facing

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.560 
I'm holding it this way it's facing
toward<00:01:19.650> me<00:01:19.860> but<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.250> still<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.970> orientation

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
toward me but it's still the orientation

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.020 
toward me but it's still the orientation
is<00:01:21.689> messed<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:22.189> once<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.310> hold<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.790> way

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
is messed up once you hold it this way

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.719 
is messed up once you hold it this way
the<00:01:24.409> sometimes<00:01:25.409> also<00:01:25.619> reverses<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.460> once<00:01:26.610> you

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the sometimes also reverses but once you

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.700 
the sometimes also reverses but once you
start<00:01:26.850> playing<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> game<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.470> works

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
start playing the game it works

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.670 
start playing the game it works
perfectly<00:01:33.170> let<00:01:34.170> me<00:01:34.320> see<00:01:34.439> if<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.619> could

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
perfectly let me see if I could

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.340 
perfectly let me see if I could
demonstrate<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.460> you

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.609 

might<00:01:40.890> take<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.159> while<00:01:41.900> as<00:01:42.900> you<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.229> see<00:01:43.409> now

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
might take a while as you can see now

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.530 
might take a while as you can see now
when<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.430> game<00:01:44.640> starts<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.119> not<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.299> big

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
when the game starts it's not a big

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.929 
when the game starts it's not a big
problem<00:01:46.070> one<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.340> other<00:01:47.460> game<00:01:47.759> i<00:01:47.790> think

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
problem one of the other game i think

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.289 
problem one of the other game i think
it's<00:01:48.210> called<00:01:48.270> explained<00:01:48.960> 9<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
it's called explained 9 the

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.399 
it's called explained 9 the
accelerometer<00:01:51.299> was<00:01:51.600> messed<00:01:51.930> up<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.350> I

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
accelerometer was messed up so I

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.440 
accelerometer was messed up so I
couldn't<00:01:52.680> really<00:01:52.799> play<00:01:53.190> that<00:01:53.460> game<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.330> I'm

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
couldn't really play that game so I'm

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.230 
couldn't really play that game so I'm
not<00:01:54.600> sure<00:01:54.750> how<00:01:55.020> many<00:01:55.229> games<00:01:55.640> has<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:56.909> problem

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
not sure how many games has this problem

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.359 
not sure how many games has this problem
but<00:01:57.659> there<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:57.960> some<00:01:58.140> problem<00:01:58.190> like<00:01:59.190> I<00:01:59.310> said
