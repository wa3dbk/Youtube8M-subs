with Jose for many years and he believes

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.190 
with Jose for many years and he believes
that<00:02:21.469> the<00:02:22.189> moon<00:02:22.370> is<00:02:22.790> made<00:02:23.239> up<00:02:23.420> with<00:02:23.450> organic

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
that the moon is made up with organic

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.470 
that the moon is made up with organic
life<00:02:24.680> do<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.099> believe<00:02:25.400> yourself<00:02:25.909> that<00:02:26.120> these

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
life do you believe yourself that these

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.679 
life do you believe yourself that these
are<00:02:26.810> oceans<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.879> grain<00:02:28.879> mountain<00:02:29.299> pastures

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
are oceans and grain mountain pastures

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.949 
are oceans and grain mountain pastures
that<00:02:29.870> we're<00:02:30.019> seeing<00:02:30.230> here<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:31.810> think<00:02:32.810> that

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
that we're seeing here I think that

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.660 
that we're seeing here I think that
there's<00:02:33.140> an<00:02:33.290> atmosphere<00:02:33.950> on<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.129> moon<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.579> I

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
there's an atmosphere on the moon and I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.410 
there's an atmosphere on the moon and I
think<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:36.530> there<00:02:36.739> are<00:02:37.209> there's<00:02:38.209> some

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
think that that there are there's some

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.240 
think that that there are there's some
kind<00:02:38.629> of<00:02:38.689> vegetation<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:39.680> there's<00:02:40.099> some

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
kind of vegetation that there's some

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.160 
kind of vegetation that there's some
kind<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.840> when<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:42.790> when<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.819> did<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.209> segment<00:02:45.049> of

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
kind of when I when I did a segment of

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.770 
kind of when I when I did a segment of
the<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.040> moon<00:02:46.280> around<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.239> scart<00:02:47.569> days

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
the of the moon around the scart days

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.770 
the of the moon around the scart days
and<00:02:48.109> I<00:02:48.200> show<00:02:48.409> the<00:02:48.590> mountains<00:02:49.069> and<00:02:49.780> they're

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
and I show the mountains and they're

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.449 
and I show the mountains and they're
kind<00:02:51.049> of<00:02:51.139> brown<00:02:51.349> and<00:02:51.379> green<00:02:51.829> you<00:02:52.099> know<00:02:52.129> and

anything to the color I'm not filling

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.179 
anything to the color I'm not filling
with<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.379> or<00:03:03.829> anything<00:03:04.299> I<00:03:05.299> believe<00:03:06.189> that

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:07.189 
with it or anything I believe that

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:09.399 
with it or anything I believe that
there's<00:03:07.430> an<00:03:07.549> atmosphere<00:03:08.090> on<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.269> moon<00:03:08.409> and

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
there's an atmosphere on the moon and

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.110 
there's an atmosphere on the moon and
and<00:03:09.859> I<00:03:09.980> believe<00:03:10.220> that<00:03:10.250> there's<00:03:10.579> color<00:03:10.790> on<00:03:11.000> them

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
and I believe that there's color on them

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.550 
and I believe that there's color on them
and<00:03:11.299> I<00:03:11.389> believe<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:11.810> we've<00:03:11.959> seen<00:03:12.169> that<00:03:12.379> in

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
and I believe that we've seen that in

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.849 
and I believe that we've seen that in
the<00:03:12.650> Apollo<00:03:13.299> some<00:03:14.299> of<00:03:14.389> the<00:03:14.480> Apollo<00:03:14.780> shots<00:03:15.169> some

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
the Apollo some of the Apollo shots some

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.159 
the Apollo some of the Apollo shots some
of<00:03:15.919> the<00:03:16.010> 16<00:03:16.370> millimeter<00:03:16.790> film<00:03:16.879> that<00:03:17.780> came<00:03:17.989> back

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.169 
of the 16 millimeter film that came back

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.319 
of the 16 millimeter film that came back
shows<00:03:18.470> clearly<00:03:18.979> there<00:03:19.280> was<00:03:19.400> color<00:03:19.669> on<00:03:19.940> the

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
shows clearly there was color on the

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.559 
shows clearly there was color on the
moon<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:21.680> what<00:03:21.889> you're<00:03:22.069> saying<00:03:22.400> is<00:03:22.639> right<00:03:23.299> now

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
moon so what you're saying is right now

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.250 
moon so what you're saying is right now
NASA<00:03:24.139> is<00:03:24.560> covering<00:03:25.129> ups<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.940> biggest<00:03:26.419> unknown

NASA is covering ups the biggest unknown

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.469 
NASA is covering ups the biggest unknown
secret<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.220> man<00:03:28.400> at<00:03:28.669> the<00:03:28.849> moment<00:03:29.180> that<00:03:29.329> they're

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:29.479 
secret to man at the moment that they're

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:32.159 
secret to man at the moment that they're
not<00:03:29.599> trying<00:03:30.079> to<00:03:30.229> tell<00:03:30.500> people<00:03:30.560> right<00:03:31.099> now<00:03:31.310> that

not trying to tell people right now that
you<00:03:33.169> know<00:03:33.290> I<00:03:33.500> have<00:03:33.979> mostly<00:03:34.340> dead<00:03:34.669> right<00:03:34.970> I

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
you know I have mostly dead right I

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.199 
you know I have mostly dead right I
think<00:03:36.620> that<00:03:37.040> there's<00:03:37.220> a<00:03:37.310> cover-up<00:03:37.669> I<00:03:37.940> think

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
think that there's a cover-up I think

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.789 
think that there's a cover-up I think
that<00:03:38.329> they<00:03:38.479> don't<00:03:38.690> want<00:03:38.930> people<00:03:39.319> to<00:03:39.440> know<00:03:40.690> that

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
that they don't want people to know that

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.530 
that they don't want people to know that
the<00:03:42.799> moon<00:03:43.010> has<00:03:43.430> color<00:03:43.849> they<00:03:44.150> don't<00:03:44.359> want

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
the moon has color they don't want

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.869 
the moon has color they don't want
people<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:44.989> look<00:03:45.169> at<00:03:45.440> it<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:46.400> if<00:03:46.579> they<00:03:46.699> can
