ripped them off when it took off the
shelf<00:01:30.049> it's<00:01:31.049> kind<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.439> stupid<00:01:31.619> design<00:01:31.890> I

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
shelf it's kind of a stupid design I

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.270 
shelf it's kind of a stupid design I
mean<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.600> lip<00:01:33.840> doesn't<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.740> have<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.250> be

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
mean that lip doesn't really have to be

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.539 
mean that lip doesn't really have to be
there<00:01:36.290> it's<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:37.439> holding<00:01:37.710> anything<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.310> now

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
there it's not holding anything in now

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.390 
there it's not holding anything in now
right<00:01:39.060> now<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.689> didn't<00:01:40.350> really<00:01:41.040> need<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> be

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
right now so didn't really need to be

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.260 
right now so didn't really need to be
there<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:41.850> um<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:44.130> when<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.850> took<00:01:44.970> off

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.000 
dry glue left over it's not that big of
a<00:02:18.650> deal<00:02:18.830> them<00:02:19.480> paints<00:02:20.480> kind<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.900> glossy<00:02:21.739> like

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
a deal them paints kind of glossy like

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.759 
a deal them paints kind of glossy like
sparkly<00:02:25.209> necessarily<00:02:26.209> like<00:02:26.569> that<00:02:26.870> but<00:02:27.200> it's

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
sparkly necessarily like that but it's

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.110 
sparkly necessarily like that but it's
fine<00:02:27.950> if<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:28.250> have<00:02:28.519> one<00:02:28.700> you<00:02:28.819> know<00:02:28.940> what<00:02:29.060> I'm

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
fine if you have one you know what I'm

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.210 
fine if you have one you know what I'm
talking<00:02:29.480> about<00:02:29.540> on<00:02:30.200> here<00:02:30.739> it<00:02:30.829> just<00:02:30.980> looks<00:02:31.160> like

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
talking about on here it just looks like

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.819 
talking about on here it just looks like
it's<00:02:31.459> shiny<00:02:31.930> can<00:02:32.930> kind<00:02:33.230> of<00:02:33.349> see<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.650> though

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
it's shiny can kind of see it though

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.210 
it's shiny can kind of see it though
just<00:02:34.069> he's<00:02:34.519> kind<00:02:34.760> of<00:02:34.790> like<00:02:34.879> glittery<00:02:35.299> I<00:02:36.220> guess

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
just he's kind of like glittery I guess

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.120 
just he's kind of like glittery I guess
that<00:02:37.400> doesn't<00:02:37.579> matter<00:02:37.670> them

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.550 

I<00:02:44.160> guess<00:02:44.850> I<00:02:45.000> would<00:02:45.240> recommend<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:45.960> engine<00:02:46.350> to

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
I guess I would recommend this engine to

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.920 
I guess I would recommend this engine to
anyone<00:02:46.890> but<00:02:47.070> they<00:02:47.760> discontinued<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:54.630> if

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
anyone but they discontinued it so so if

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.720 
anyone but they discontinued it so so if
you<00:02:55.050> can<00:02:55.200> find<00:02:55.380> one<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.650> would<00:02:55.890> buy<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.400> mean

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
you can find one I would buy it I mean

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.020 
you can find one I would buy it I mean
they<00:02:56.820> seem<00:02:57.060> pretty<00:02:57.390> rare<00:02:58.490> but<00:02:59.490> someone<00:02:59.850> told

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
they seem pretty rare but someone told

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:08.690 
they seem pretty rare but someone told
me<00:03:00.270> that<00:03:01.880> they<00:03:02.880> make<00:03:05.030> its<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:07.290> after<00:03:07.740> makes

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
me that they make its that after makes

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.460 
me that they make its that after makes
them<00:03:09.060> every<00:03:09.390> once<00:03:09.570> in<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.780> while<00:03:09.930> like<00:03:10.140> makes<00:03:10.350> a

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
them every once in a while like makes a

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.680 
them every once in a while like makes a
batch<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.890> them<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.310> they<00:03:11.760> don't<00:03:12.000> then<00:03:12.540> they

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
batch of them and they don't then they

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.230 
batch of them and they don't then they
make<00:03:12.810> another<00:03:13.110> batch<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:14.220> think<00:03:15.030> that's

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
make another batch so I think that's

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.460 
make another batch so I think that's
what<00:03:15.330> someone<00:03:15.510> told<00:03:15.690> me<00:03:15.900> but<00:03:17.990> anyway<00:03:18.990> I<00:03:19.230> like

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
what someone told me but anyway I like

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.330 
what someone told me but anyway I like
this<00:03:19.620> engine<00:03:20.010> it's<00:03:20.760> very<00:03:21.000> good<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:22.340> would

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
this engine it's very good I would

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.970 
this engine it's very good I would
recommend<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.970> so<00:03:24.350> she<00:03:25.350> had<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.560> chance<00:03:25.740> to

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
recommend it so she had the chance to

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.700 
recommend it so she had the chance to
buy<00:03:26.100> one<00:03:26.340> go<00:03:26.490> and<00:03:26.640> buy<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:27.140> if<00:03:28.140> it's<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.410> decent

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
buy one go and buy it if it's a decent

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.250 
buy one go and buy it if it's a decent
price<00:03:28.740> of<00:03:29.250> course<00:03:29.490> I<00:03:29.790> it's<00:03:30.390> anything<00:03:30.810> over

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
price of course I it's anything over

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.400 
price of course I it's anything over
maybe<00:03:32.090> 120<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.150> don't<00:03:33.330> buy<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.570> because<00:03:33.900> it's

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
maybe 120 you don't buy it because it's

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.160 
maybe 120 you don't buy it because it's
not<00:03:34.830> like<00:03:35.070> I<00:03:35.550> guess<00:03:36.120> it's<00:03:36.300> worth<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.930> but

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
not like I guess it's worth that but

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.300 
not like I guess it's worth that but
maybe<00:03:37.800> kind<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.070> a<00:03:38.160> waste<00:03:38.400> I<00:03:39.590> mean<00:03:40.590> that<00:03:40.980> person

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
maybe kind of a waste I mean that person

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.090 
maybe kind of a waste I mean that person
just<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:42.720> person<00:03:43.020> selling<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.470> probably

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
just the person selling it probably

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.220 
just the person selling it probably
would<00:03:45.000> end<00:03:45.030> up<00:03:45.270> selling<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.690> but<00:03:45.840> whoever

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
would end up selling it but whoever

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.460 
would end up selling it but whoever
bought<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.650> would<00:03:46.770> be<00:03:46.890> kind<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.760> stupid<00:03:48.410> now<00:03:49.410> if

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
bought it would be kind of stupid now if

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.200 
bought it would be kind of stupid now if
she<00:03:49.710> gets<00:03:49.860> this<00:03:49.950> hundred<00:03:50.280> twenty<00:03:50.580> dollars<00:03:50.730> but

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
she gets this hundred twenty dollars but

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.510 
she gets this hundred twenty dollars but
I<00:03:52.760> don't<00:03:53.760> know<00:03:54.950> certainly<00:03:55.950> if<00:03:56.100> it's<00:03:56.280> anything

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
I don't know certainly if it's anything

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.080 
I don't know certainly if it's anything
over<00:03:56.910> 120<00:03:57.570> I<00:03:57.630> wouldn't<00:03:57.960> but<00:03:59.090> hopefully

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
over 120 I wouldn't but hopefully

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.750 
over 120 I wouldn't but hopefully
