right in to the back here so there's a

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.199 
right in to the back here so there's a
piece<00:03:30.900> sticking<00:03:31.739> out<00:03:31.980> here<00:03:32.310> plugs<00:03:32.879> right<00:03:33.060> in

here you just want to fold a hammer and
let's<00:03:36.269> just<00:03:36.419> set<00:03:36.569> that<00:03:36.599> aside<00:03:36.810> for<00:03:36.989> right<00:03:37.230> now

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
let's just set that aside for right now

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.699 
let's just set that aside for right now
so<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:38.220> can<00:03:38.400> plug<00:03:38.519> this<00:03:38.669> back<00:03:38.730> in<00:03:39.199> so<00:03:40.199> the

so you can plug this back in so the

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.970 
so you can plug this back in so the
interesting<00:03:41.010> thing<00:03:41.459> is<00:03:42.019> so<00:03:43.019> before<00:03:43.530> with<00:03:43.829> the

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
interesting thing is so before with the

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.390 
interesting thing is so before with the
prime<00:03:44.250> these<00:03:44.730> pieces<00:03:45.180> fold<00:03:46.109> in<00:03:46.379> and<00:03:47.129> lock

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
prime these pieces fold in and lock

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.319 
prime these pieces fold in and lock
together<00:03:47.669> to<00:03:48.030> kind<00:03:48.180> of<00:03:48.269> secure<00:03:48.750> all<00:03:48.959> this

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
together to kind of secure all this

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.569 
together to kind of secure all this
don't<00:03:51.329> do<00:03:51.510> that<00:03:51.540> okay<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:52.560> when<00:03:53.129> I<00:03:53.160> first<00:03:53.400> got

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
don't do that okay so when I first got

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.220 
don't do that okay so when I first got
it<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:53.879> started<00:03:54.510> trying<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.810> do<00:03:54.959> that<00:03:55.109> because

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
it I started trying to do that because

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.319 
it I started trying to do that because
I'm<00:03:55.470> used<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:55.889> other<00:03:56.040> one<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.400> you<00:03:57.150> get
