00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.160
 Well everything exactly can you 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.260
 harm us from being there to see everything 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.020
 what is environment and england the 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.320
 chelsea and well I think they lead us to a 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.590
 agreement and well this had to come back 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.750
 You were with him in the moments also 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.520
 when his environment advised him to 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.730
 that had to be removed from what was 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.680
 his neighborhood by customs and also 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.770
 for the lifestyle they have there 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.370
 and it happens to him that since he loved you is there he is 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.080
 your neighborhood is complicated but yes yes I have 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.840
 understood that when they talked a lot about that 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.900
 they helped him stack but then as you 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.360
 I say that is personal and one does not know that 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.670
 will be of no yes yes he did not want to leave 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.440
 good but as I tell you in this in this 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.110
 in this time so you have to be with him 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.910
 and support him and help him in anything 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.100
 it happens a lot in football I ask you 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.020
 in the sense that there are many 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.330
 players with these conditions with the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.860
 which has the one that obviously could 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.040
 have had an incredible future and that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.869
 they do not arrive because of the situation in which 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.690
 find and by the customs that 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.420
 they carry daily life if there are many the 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.149
 true that they took us for small 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.890
 things that good did not want to be so 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.020
 professionals and as due do 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.180
 this takes you for example to leave you 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.200
 a message what is all the people that 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.509
 is linked to football 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.189
 of course it happened of the ambient football that is 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.610
 complicated from one moment to another began 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:35.590
 to win very well and the truth can be 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.939
 little fly the sheet and I think there 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.520
 where they have little head is 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.429
 quiet and know that the family this does not 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.220
 and being supported with the family 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.870
 just never dazzled the money 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.420
 and fame 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.900
 I believe that he was not always the same as 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.970
 I tell you mate always good the 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.230
 truth that helped in all this I say what 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.230
 that I lived in danube with the no
