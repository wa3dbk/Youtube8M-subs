some bed here although I do as I come
here<00:01:22.619> here<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.460> look<00:01:23.580> at<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> distance<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.360> so

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
here here and look at the distance is so

here here and look at the distance is so
short<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.350> gap<00:01:25.590> here<00:01:25.860> let's<00:01:26.250> say<00:01:26.430> from<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
short the gap here let's say from the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.830 
short the gap here let's say from the
other<00:01:26.880> side<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.700> here<00:01:29.700> here<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.240> then<00:01:30.329> what<00:01:30.810> i

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
other side so here here and then what i

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.200 
other side so here here and then what i
can<00:01:31.049> do<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.170> i<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.409> pass<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:32.130> by<00:01:32.430> if<00:01:32.970> i'm

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
can do is i can pass this by if i'm

here harder just like this here just
like<00:02:13.630> this<00:02:13.870> even<00:02:14.470> softer<00:02:14.920> just<00:02:15.160> like<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:15.520> here

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
like this even softer just like so here

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.530 
like this even softer just like so here
pull<00:02:16.510> here<00:02:17.460> again<00:02:19.200> again<00:02:20.640> again<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:22.120> if<00:02:22.390> you

pull here again again again and if you

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.090 
pull here again again again and if you
come<00:02:22.750> out<00:02:22.930> too<00:02:23.140> far<00:02:23.470> there's<00:02:23.830> so<00:02:23.980> much

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
come out too far there's so much

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.250 
come out too far there's so much
distance<00:02:24.670> again<00:02:25.330> that's<00:02:25.630> not<00:02:25.780> where<00:02:25.960> you<00:02:26.050> want

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
distance again that's not where you want

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.690 
distance again that's not where you want
to<00:02:26.320> be<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.620> want<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:26.860> make<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.100> as<00:02:27.220> efficient

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
to be you want to make it as efficient

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.650 
to be you want to make it as efficient
as<00:02:27.730> possible<00:02:27.840> here<00:02:29.340> here<00:02:30.340> here<00:02:32.460> here<00:02:33.460> so<00:02:34.030> it

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
as possible here here here here so it

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.330 
as possible here here here here so it
doesn't<00:02:35.140> always<00:02:35.350> have<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.650> be<00:02:35.800> where<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.190> guy

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
doesn't always have to be where the guy

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.460 
doesn't always have to be where the guy

pass<00:03:26.680> right<00:03:26.980> so<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:28.230> good<00:03:29.230> way<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.470> drill<00:03:30.070> this

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
pass right so a good way to drill this

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.230 
pass right so a good way to drill this
like<00:03:30.700> a<00:03:30.820> one-two<00:03:31.240> combo<00:03:31.720> is<00:03:31.930> I<00:03:32.710> go<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.250> push<00:03:33.820> and
