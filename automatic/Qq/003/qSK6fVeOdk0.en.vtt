00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.690 
inside of freezer bay and then you just
want<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.590> keep<00:02:34.799> on<00:02:34.950> cutting<00:02:35.189> them<00:02:35.400> up<00:02:35.489> until

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
want to keep on cutting them up until

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.539 
want to keep on cutting them up until
your<00:02:36.000> freezer<00:02:36.269> bag<00:02:36.599> is<00:02:37.219> probably<00:02:38.219> about

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
your freezer bag is probably about

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.979 
your freezer bag is probably about
halfway<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.689> 3/4<00:02:40.409> full

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
halfway to 3/4 full

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.270 
halfway to 3/4 full
okay<00:02:42.989> so<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.439> reason<00:02:43.799> that<00:02:43.829> most<00:02:44.129> people

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
okay so the reason that most people

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.899 
okay so the reason that most people
don't<00:02:44.760> freeze<00:02:45.569> squash<00:02:45.930> or<00:02:46.829> zucchini<00:02:47.129> is

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
don't freeze squash or zucchini is

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.229 
don't freeze squash or zucchini is
because<00:02:48.329> when<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.349> freeze<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.889> it<00:02:50.099> pulls<00:02:50.909> all

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
because when you freeze it it pulls all

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.849 
because when you freeze it it pulls all
the<00:02:51.389> water<00:02:51.599> out<00:02:51.719> of<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.109> and<00:02:52.379> then<00:02:52.590> when<00:02:52.829> you

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
the water out of it and then when you

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.399 
the water out of it and then when you
thought<00:02:53.189> out<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.849> get<00:02:54.000> these<00:02:54.180> soggy<00:02:54.629> limp

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
thought out you get these soggy limp

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.550 
thought out you get these soggy limp
disgusting<00:02:56.189> pieces<00:02:56.670> of<00:02:56.819> squash<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:58.079> after<00:02:58.470> you

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
the bag about halfway or a little bit

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.530 
the bag about halfway or a little bit
more<00:03:06.810> with<00:03:07.560> water<00:03:07.829> and<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.909> want<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.299> be

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
more with water and you want it to be

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
able to cover almost all of the squash

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.640 
able to cover almost all of the squash
in<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.109> bank<00:03:13.700> so<00:03:14.930> when<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.049> lay<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.349> flat<00:03:16.530> like

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
in the bank so when you lay it flat like

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.250 
in the bank so when you lay it flat like
this<00:03:17.299> you<00:03:18.299> know<00:03:18.419> it's<00:03:18.599> hard<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.870> see<00:03:19.049> in<00:03:19.139> the

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
this you know it's hard to see in the

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.740 
this you know it's hard to see in the
video<00:03:19.379> but<00:03:19.889> all<00:03:20.400> my<00:03:20.669> squash<00:03:21.030> is<00:03:21.329> covered<00:03:21.720> with

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
video but all my squash is covered with

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.199 
video but all my squash is covered with
water<00:03:21.959> in<00:03:22.439> the<00:03:22.470> bag

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
water in the bag

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.909 
water in the bag
freezing<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.329> in<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.720> water<00:03:25.260> helps<00:03:25.799> to

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
freezing it in the water helps to

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.979 
freezing it in the water helps to
preserve<00:03:26.159> the<00:03:26.459> water<00:03:26.609> in<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.150> squash<00:03:27.479> and<00:03:27.750> the

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
preserve the water in the squash and the

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.969 
preserve the water in the squash and the
zucchini<00:03:28.430> so<00:03:29.430> when<00:03:29.609> I<00:03:29.639> thought<00:03:29.909> out<00:03:30.269> I'll<00:03:30.569> have

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:30.979 
zucchini so when I thought out I'll have

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:33.289 
zucchini so when I thought out I'll have
pieces<00:03:31.979> of<00:03:32.129> squash<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.579> zucchini<00:03:32.849> that

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
pieces of squash and zucchini that

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.449 
pieces of squash and zucchini that
tastes<00:03:33.810> just<00:03:33.900> like<00:03:34.109> squash<00:03:34.680> or<00:03:34.979> zucchini<00:03:35.010> that

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
tastes just like squash or zucchini that

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.039 
tastes just like squash or zucchini that
I<00:03:35.669> just<00:03:35.909> picked<00:03:36.180> out<00:03:36.329> at<00:03:36.449> the<00:03:36.510> garden<00:03:36.870> instead

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
I just picked out at the garden instead

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.099 
I just picked out at the garden instead
of<00:03:37.290> those<00:03:37.500> limp<00:03:37.889> soggy<00:03:38.540> disgusting<00:03:39.540> pieces<00:03:39.959> of

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109

lasagna or something like that this is
great<00:03:53.159> for<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:54.260> so<00:03:55.260> once<00:03:55.530> I<00:03:55.650> put<00:03:55.859> it<00:03:55.949> in

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
great for that and so once I put it in

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.710 
great for that and so once I put it in
the<00:03:56.129> bag<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.609> I<00:03:56.639> put<00:03:56.669> my<00:03:56.970> water<00:03:57.209> in<00:03:57.419> the<00:03:57.540> bag

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
the bag and I put my water in the bag

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.849 
the bag and I put my water in the bag
and<00:03:58.019> seal<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.440> up

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
and seal it up

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.839 
and seal it up
I<00:03:59.690> set<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.720> flat<00:04:01.109> like<00:04:01.139> this<00:04:01.620> in<00:04:01.889> my<00:04:02.069> freezer<00:04:02.400> so

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
I set it flat like this in my freezer so

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.240 
I set it flat like this in my freezer so
they<00:04:02.879> can<00:04:03.030> stack<00:04:03.510> on<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.810> shelves<00:04:04.349> or<00:04:04.560> in<00:04:04.979> the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
they can stack on the shelves or in the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.030 
they can stack on the shelves or in the
chest<00:04:05.459> freezer<00:04:06.260> that<00:04:07.260> way<00:04:07.409> I<00:04:07.439> can<00:04:07.739> get<00:04:07.859> the

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
chest freezer that way I can get the

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.140 
chest freezer that way I can get the
most<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.459> my<00:04:08.609> freeze

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
most of my freeze

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.300 
most of my freeze
that<00:04:09.239> I<00:04:09.269> can<00:04:09.599> possibly<00:04:10.049> get<00:04:10.560> cuz<00:04:10.799> it's<00:04:10.980> sitting

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
that I can possibly get cuz it's sitting

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.600 
that I can possibly get cuz it's sitting
flat<00:04:11.720> so<00:04:12.720> that's<00:04:13.170> how<00:04:13.349> I<00:04:13.379> preserve<00:04:13.890> squash<00:04:14.310> and

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
flat so that's how I preserve squash and

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.569 
flat so that's how I preserve squash and
zucchini<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:15.769> if<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:16.919> have<00:04:17.009> any<00:04:17.190> questions

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
zucchini and if you have any questions

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.600 
zucchini and if you have any questions
