00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
now you need ik joints ik handles to

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.749 
now you need ik joints ik handles to
manipulate<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:09.030> leg<00:00:09.710> so<00:00:10.710> what<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.700> I

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
manipulate this leg so what is that I

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.029 
manipulate this leg so what is that I
can<00:00:12.120> handle<00:00:13.549> well<00:00:14.549> when<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:14.940> animate<00:00:15.470> if<00:00:16.470> you

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
can handle well when you animate if you

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.550 
can handle well when you animate if you
want<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.550> move<00:00:18.480> his<00:00:18.690> leg<00:00:18.930> if<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.170> didn't<00:00:19.470> have

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
want to move his leg if you didn't have

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.790 
want to move his leg if you didn't have
ik<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.570> you'd<00:00:21.570> have<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.869> select<00:00:22.140> each<00:00:22.410> joint

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
ik and you'd have to select each joint

ik and you'd have to select each joint
and<00:00:23.130> move<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.730> like<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:25.109> if<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.800> wanted

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
and move it like that and if you wanted

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.890 
and move it like that and if you wanted
to<00:00:26.099> move<00:00:26.220> his<00:00:26.400> hip<00:00:26.730> up<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.449> select<00:00:27.599> it

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
to move his hip up you have to select it

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.140 
to move his hip up you have to select it
and<00:00:28.080> move<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.349> like<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.849> it's<00:00:29.849> time

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
and move it like that it's time

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.580 
and move it like that it's time
consuming<00:00:31.189> you<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:32.489> do<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.059> want<00:00:33.300> to

consuming you can do it if you want to

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.690 
consuming you can do it if you want to
but<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.770> easier<00:00:35.989> to<00:00:36.989> go<00:00:37.890> up<00:00:38.040> skeleton

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700

they call it that's what you need for
the<00:01:30.479> legs<00:01:30.720> because<00:01:31.110> you're<00:01:31.229> going<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.409> create

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the legs because you're going to create

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.490 
the legs because you're going to create
a<00:01:31.860> pole<00:01:32.189> vector<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.570> knee<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.140> need

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
a pole vector for the knee and you need

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:44.179 
a pole vector for the knee and you need
that<00:01:34.740> from<00:01:36.590> legs<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.659> single<00:01:39.979> chain<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:43.130> is<00:01:44.130> for

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
that from legs the single chain I is for

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.889 
that from legs the single chain I is for
like<00:01:45.500> fingers<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.939> stuff<00:01:47.939> where<00:01:48.750> you

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
like fingers and stuff where you

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.389 
like fingers and stuff where you
wouldn't<00:01:49.110> really<00:01:49.380> need<00:01:50.090> much<00:01:51.090> side<00:01:51.479> sway<00:01:52.399> but

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
wouldn't really need much side sway but

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.760 
wouldn't really need much side sway but
this<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.329> can<00:01:54.509> create<00:01:54.720> kind<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.229> side<00:01:55.470> sway

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
this you can create kind of a side sway

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.679 
this you can create kind of a side sway
now<00:01:56.750> we<00:01:57.750> render<00:01:58.380> rotate<00:01:59.280> plain<00:01:59.520> salt<00:01:59.880> solver

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
now we render rotate plain salt solver

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.830 
now we render rotate plain salt solver
let's<00:02:01.320> go<00:02:01.469> back<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.710> our<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.159> click<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.850> we

go down to the ankle click again now you

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.420 
go down to the ankle click again now you
got<00:02:12.950> ik<00:02:13.190> handle<00:02:13.790> now<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:15.590> see<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:19.130> can<00:02:19.280> pick

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
got ik handle now you see you can pick

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.040 
got ik handle now you see you can pick
up<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.670> can<00:02:20.090> when<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.450> can<00:02:20.480> move<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.810> leg

up the I can when you can move the leg

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.800 
up the I can when you can move the leg
like<00:02:21.709> you<00:02:21.920> move<00:02:22.130> your<00:02:22.310> leg<00:02:22.489> all<00:02:23.330> over<00:02:23.720> the

like you move your leg all over the
place<00:02:23.989> like<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.260> instead<00:02:24.830> of<00:02:24.890> manipulating

down a lot that gives you an idea on how

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:22.290 
down a lot that gives you an idea on how
to<00:07:19.180> create<00:07:19.449> joints<00:07:20.139> I<00:07:20.789> guess<00:07:21.789> in<00:07:21.969> the<00:07:22.059> next

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.300 
to create joints I guess in the next

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.999 
to create joints I guess in the next
lesson<00:07:22.479> let<00:07:22.779> me<00:07:22.869> take<00:07:23.080> this<00:07:23.259> one<00:07:23.439> down<00:07:23.649> and

edit it and everything will go on
further<00:07:27.819> with<00:07:28.089> turbo<00:07:28.479> and<00:07:28.689> we'll<00:07:29.879> i'll<00:07:30.879> show

00:07:31.079 --> 00:07:31.089 
further with turbo and we'll i'll show

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:32.909 
further with turbo and we'll i'll show
you<00:07:31.149> how<00:07:31.270> to<00:07:31.360> create<00:07:31.659> the<00:07:31.870> controls<00:07:32.319> and<00:07:32.589> stuff

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 
you how to create the controls and stuff

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:36.510 
you how to create the controls and stuff
for<00:07:33.219> him<00:07:33.309> and<00:07:33.899> after<00:07:34.899> that<00:07:35.050> I<00:07:35.110> guess<00:07:35.469> well<00:07:36.159> then

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:36.520 
for him and after that I guess well then

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.769 
for him and after that I guess well then
I'll<00:07:36.639> show<00:07:36.669> you<00:07:36.879> how<00:07:36.969> to<00:07:37.059> create<00:07:37.120> the<00:07:37.539> PO

I'll show you how to create the PO

00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:40.709 
I'll show you how to create the PO
vectors<00:07:38.229> for<00:07:38.409> the<00:07:38.499> knee<00:07:39.120> and<00:07:40.120> I<00:07:40.270> guess<00:07:40.479> then

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:40.719 
vectors for the knee and I guess then

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:42.420 
vectors for the knee and I guess then
after<00:07:41.050> we<00:07:41.139> get<00:07:41.229> all<00:07:41.379> that<00:07:41.559> done<00:07:41.770> we'll<00:07:42.099> start

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:42.430 
after we get all that done we'll start

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.589 
after we get all that done we'll start
the<00:07:43.240> upper<00:07:43.809> body<00:07:44.050> so<00:07:44.830> this<00:07:45.789> is<00:07:45.969> the<00:07:46.149> unpicked

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:46.599 
the upper body so this is the unpicked

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:50.189 
the upper body so this is the unpicked
one<00:07:46.839> y'all<00:07:47.620> take<00:07:47.949> it<00:07:48.009> easy
