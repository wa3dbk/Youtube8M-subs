have a little um a little side split
here<00:05:23.069> at<00:05:23.250> the<00:05:23.400> sides<00:05:23.639> which<00:05:23.849> I<00:05:23.969> thought<00:05:24.120> was<00:05:24.240> a

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
here at the sides which I thought was a

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.909 
here at the sides which I thought was a
nice<00:05:24.509> little<00:05:24.719> added<00:05:24.960> effect<00:05:25.349> and<00:05:25.589> it's<00:05:25.740> just

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
nice little added effect and it's just

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.579 
nice little added effect and it's just
so<00:05:26.129> soft<00:05:26.520> and<00:05:26.789> so<00:05:26.849> nice<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.569> wear<00:05:27.689> that<00:05:28.080> one<00:05:28.229> was

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:28.589 
so soft and so nice to wear that one was

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:31.579 
so soft and so nice to wear that one was
a<00:05:28.830> great<00:05:29.400> great<00:05:29.789> buy<00:05:30.089> next<00:05:30.900> thing<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.110> got<00:05:31.379> was<00:05:31.409> a

a great great buy next thing I got was a

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:33.019 
a great great buy next thing I got was a
dress<00:05:32.009> and<00:05:32.189> it's<00:05:32.339> not<00:05:32.520> something<00:05:32.699> that<00:05:32.909> I

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:33.029 
dress and it's not something that I

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:35.779 
dress and it's not something that I
would<00:05:33.120> probably<00:05:33.830> traditionally<00:05:34.830> by<00:05:35.129> myself

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
would probably traditionally by myself

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.760 
would probably traditionally by myself
but<00:05:35.939> I<00:05:35.969> saw<00:05:36.240> it<00:05:36.389> on<00:05:36.479> the<00:05:36.509> rack<00:05:36.779> and<00:05:37.020> I<00:05:37.409> would

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
but I saw it on the rack and I would

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.869 
but I saw it on the rack and I would
never<00:05:37.919> not<00:05:38.099> only<00:05:38.250> tried<00:05:38.460> on<00:05:38.580> but<00:05:38.729> you<00:05:38.789> know

00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:41.939 
see how it looks because it doesn't have

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:43.639 
see how it looks because it doesn't have
much<00:05:42.120> hanger<00:05:42.449> appeal<00:05:42.569> but<00:05:42.899> I<00:05:42.960> wanted<00:05:43.289> to<00:05:43.349> see

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.969 
it it just gives it a little bit of
texture<00:06:12.149> it<00:06:12.479> is<00:06:12.839> just<00:06:13.050> simply<00:06:13.289> a<00:06:13.379> cotton<00:06:13.949> dress

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:20.009 
actually quite long it's not a mini

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.850 
actually quite long it's not a mini
dress<00:06:20.339> it's<00:06:20.580> 66<00:06:21.300> just<00:06:21.779> above<00:06:22.020> my<00:06:22.259> knee<00:06:22.319> so<00:06:22.680> it's

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
dress it's 66 just above my knee so it's
