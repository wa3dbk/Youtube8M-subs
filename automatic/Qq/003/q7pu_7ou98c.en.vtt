00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hey people so this video i would have 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.560
 have to do for quite some time 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.060
 but what does not hesitate? 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.950
 It certainly noticed almost everyone else 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.420
 youtuber except me has a pretty 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.769
 good branding on his channel you 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.160
 You know, they have all these pretty ones 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.330
 channel banda updates playlists 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.770
 logistician but most important is that 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.090
 all this channel trailer have that 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.220
 if someone clicks on the channel 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.359
 she's this really cool epic 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.830
 trailer see what it's on the canal 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.420
 so that people are more happy 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.279
 They subscribe after nine years 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.539
 youtube I still have none of that 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.460
 I think I had for a long time 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.869
 sometimes live video as a trailer I am 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.890
 simply bad in branding fact is 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.180
 that one is still one another 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.500
 this standard banner is which on 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.969
 youtube offers if you have your channel 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.230
 I opened my environment to be that 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.879
 be chic banner I mean this 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.200
 car focused color light ball 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.640
 things actually look really good 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.260
 What did I choose? 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.300
 is a new year is the state yes 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.039
 right after nine years youtube 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.550
 Delay no longer ago I have 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.079
 finally the channel trailer 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.670
 one feels my two weeks of 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.800
 year around so I have this video 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.510
 somehow deferred and somehow he 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.390
 I still do not have my logo 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.570
 playlist i gave dated and main channel 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.400

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.930

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.310
 banal very nice i have this car 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.430
 focused colored light ball 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.740
 We purely love things like that too 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.950
 I started watching videos in 2006 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.600
 I do me with not much 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.130
 I thought I did my best 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.390
 few parodies do you know my friends 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.280
 and I were just fun 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.659
 I would have thought that the people 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.370
 I still do not know that 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.780
 which is why we look but I am grateful 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.420
 You have to have my life for that 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.770
 changed 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.970
 I am from the depressed child 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.530
 just wanted to be someone else 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.090
 won someone who is confident 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.070
 and he is just too happy 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.509
 and that's what this channel is all about 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.729
 you just have to be yourself 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.050
 Otherwise, be crazy if you have one 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.580
 wig is used for lips for 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.200
 Short barbie girl then want to do 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.400
 you if you have a kamehameha out of the 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.690
 hands, we always shoot 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.200
 childhood dream of you was then do it 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.060
 was 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.229
 if you are a singer like innumerable ones 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.850
 It was said that you do not sing 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.020
 then it does not matter then the only one 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.080
 person who can stop 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.649
 Are you because it is never too late you 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.649
 be yourself 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.630
 are you done because nobody has here 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.370
 according to his life story 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.080
 asked what do you mean I thought this 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.179
 Thinking during clip from an interview 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.710
 the judgment of the trailer you always talk 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.700
 I still have the best ones 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.410
 I just wanted a little bit 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.700
 make inspiring and that makes 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.110
 but do not even see that just means that 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.400
 it's not too late to do that 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.720
 Not too late for you 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.360
 to go because I am the one who 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.360
 So if it does not matter, it does not matter 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:39.530
 will also press clearly too late tells me 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.849
 I do not know, I say he tells me 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.220
 my bubble is the truth 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.989
 you can gop yourself with the maintenance 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.640
 Duty then I take just surfaces 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.040
 person that is a dream 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.720
 No , that's a dream I am 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.489
 only cities I look I can not 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.780

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.780

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.520
 Random scenes seen at the end 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.570

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.680

 and I just took it 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.510

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.890
