00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
rubber on this length one you could kind

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.529 
rubber on this length one you could kind
of<00:00:24.990> hear<00:00:28.550> without<00:00:29.550> doing<00:00:30.000> anything<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.390> hear

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
that squeaky squeaky that may just be

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.549 
that squeaky squeaky that may just be
because<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:34.739> new<00:00:35.210> but<00:00:36.210> there's<00:00:36.899> noise<00:00:37.260> in'

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
because it's new but there's noise in'

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.900 
because it's new but there's noise in'
in<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.040> belt<00:00:38.309> itself<00:00:39.290> so<00:00:40.290> i<00:00:40.680> still<00:00:41.399> may<00:00:41.610> try

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
in the belt itself so i still may try

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.790 
in the belt itself so i still may try
this<00:00:41.969> out<00:00:42.329> if<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.290> gives<00:00:43.469> too<00:00:43.770> much

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
this out if this gives too much

00:00:43.800 --> 00:01:58.539 
this out if this gives too much
vibration

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
front is trued up you go real slow on

00:02:16.709 --> 00:03:27.050 
front is trued up you go real slow on
this<00:02:16.860> one

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060

well here's the newly machined surface
on<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.170> Scourge<00:03:46.530> ah<00:03:46.799> let's<00:03:47.610> see<00:03:48.470> see<00:03:49.470> if<00:03:49.560> it

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
on the Scourge ah let's see see if it

00:03:49.680 --> 00:04:46.469 
on the Scourge ah let's see see if it
works

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.189 

alright<00:04:47.379> gonna<00:04:47.590> change<00:04:47.949> the<00:04:48.309> strategy<00:04:48.639> here

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
alright gonna change the strategy here

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:56.339 
alright gonna change the strategy here
and<00:04:51.059> put<00:04:52.059> a<00:04:52.090> collet<00:04:52.509> in<00:04:53.279> just<00:04:54.279> see<00:04:54.460> how<00:04:55.139> the<00:04:56.139> bed

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
and put a collet in just see how the bed

00:04:56.349 --> 00:06:37.780 
and put a collet in just see how the bed
ways<00:04:56.559> our<00:04:56.800> by<00:04:56.949> trying<00:04:57.219> to<00:04:57.309> true<00:04:57.520> this<00:04:57.699> piece<00:04:58.059> up

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:43.390 

all<00:06:38.790> right<00:06:39.060> now<00:06:39.300> I<00:06:39.750> put<00:06:40.230> the<00:06:40.350> three<00:06:40.560> jaw<00:06:40.800> on<00:06:41.100> and

all right now I put the three jaw on and
see<00:06:44.400> if<00:06:44.580> the<00:06:46.640> tip<00:06:47.640> we<00:06:47.820> can<00:06:47.850> get<00:06:48.060> a<00:06:48.090> good<00:06:52.970> see<00:06:53.970> if

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
see if the tip we can get a good see if

00:06:54.030 --> 00:07:20.810 
see if the tip we can get a good see if
we<00:06:54.150> can<00:06:54.240> get<00:06:54.360> a<00:06:54.390> good<00:06:54.540> cut<00:06:54.810> on<00:07:19.310> well<00:07:20.310> I'm<00:07:20.640> no

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:20.820 
we can get a good cut on well I'm no

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.710 
we can get a good cut on well I'm no
expert<00:07:20.850> but<00:07:21.300> that's<00:07:21.570> sticking<00:07:21.810> out<00:07:21.960> oh<00:07:22.200> good

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:23.720 
expert but that's sticking out oh good

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.930 
expert but that's sticking out oh good
four<00:07:24.720> inches<00:07:25.080> or<00:07:25.290> so<00:07:25.500> and<00:07:25.770> from<00:07:25.950> here<00:07:26.250> to<00:07:26.400> here

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 
four inches or so and from here to here

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.310 
four inches or so and from here to here
it's<00:07:27.690> only<00:07:27.840> like<00:07:28.110> one<00:07:28.980> and<00:07:29.160> a<00:07:29.220> half<00:07:29.460> thousands

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:30.320 
it's only like one and a half thousands

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.950 
it's only like one and a half thousands
difference<00:07:31.320> in<00:07:31.470> the<00:07:31.590> diameter<00:07:31.980> so<00:07:32.780> I<00:07:33.780> think

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 
difference in the diameter so I think

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.020 
difference in the diameter so I think
that<00:07:34.230> 3jo<00:07:34.590> may<00:07:34.800> not<00:07:34.980> be<00:07:35.130> too<00:07:35.310> bad<00:07:35.490> I'll<00:07:35.760> have<00:07:35.910> to

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.030 
that 3jo may not be too bad I'll have to

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.100 
that 3jo may not be too bad I'll have to
check<00:07:36.240> if<00:07:36.390> some<00:07:36.600> of<00:07:36.660> the<00:07:36.720> guys<00:07:36.870> who<00:07:37.050> are

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.110 
check if some of the guys who are

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.850 
check if some of the guys who are
experts<00:07:37.620> on<00:07:37.830> this<00:07:38.010> but<00:07:38.400> I<00:07:39.260> think<00:07:40.260> I<00:07:40.440> can<00:07:40.590> start

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860 
experts on this but I think I can start

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.770 
experts on this but I think I can start
doing<00:07:41.310> some<00:07:41.580> stuff<00:07:41.790> I<00:07:41.910> haven't<00:07:42.090> done<00:07:42.450> anything

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:42.780 
doing some stuff I haven't done anything

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.250 
doing some stuff I haven't done anything
on<00:07:43.110> this<00:07:43.260> three<00:07:43.560> jocks<00:07:43.800> I<00:07:44.010> forget<00:07:44.370> that

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:45.260 
on this three jocks I forget that

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.480 
on this three jocks I forget that
cleaned<00:07:46.260> up<00:07:46.350> on<00:07:46.500> the<00:07:46.590> inside<00:07:46.950> so<00:07:47.130> that<00:07:47.160> it<00:07:47.310> the

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:47.490 
cleaned up on the inside so that it the

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.520 
cleaned up on the inside so that it the
register<00:07:47.940> does<00:07:48.120> hit<00:07:48.390> I<00:07:48.570> was<00:07:49.170> thinking<00:07:49.440> about

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:49.530 
register does hit I was thinking about

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.790 
register does hit I was thinking about
putting<00:07:50.190> it<00:07:50.370> on<00:07:50.490> a<00:07:50.520> face<00:07:50.970> plate<00:07:51.240> and<00:07:51.800> grinding

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 
putting it on a face plate and grinding

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.460 
putting it on a face plate and grinding
that<00:07:52.950> or<00:07:53.700> I<00:07:53.730> should<00:07:53.910> say<00:07:54.090> facing<00:07:54.570> that<00:07:54.750> and<00:07:55.380> I

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:55.470 
that or I should say facing that and I

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.620 
that or I should say facing that and I
still<00:07:55.770> may<00:07:55.980> depending<00:07:56.730> on<00:07:56.880> what<00:07:57.150> does<00:07:57.450> some<00:07:57.600> of

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:57.630 
still may depending on what does some of
