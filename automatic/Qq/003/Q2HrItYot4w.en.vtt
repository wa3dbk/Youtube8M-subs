00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
single time and I like that kind of

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.580 
single time and I like that kind of
challenge<00:02:24.290> I<00:02:28.360> don't<00:02:29.360> regard<00:02:29.960> myself<00:02:30.200> as<00:02:30.530> a

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
challenge I don't regard myself as a

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.640 
challenge I don't regard myself as a
photographer<00:02:31.310> but<00:02:31.550> as<00:02:31.700> an<00:02:31.850> image<00:02:32.150> maker<00:02:32.650> so

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
photographer but as an image maker so

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.950 
photographer but as an image maker so
it's<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:33.920> hybrid<00:02:34.250> between<00:02:34.640> photography<00:02:35.450> and

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
it's a hybrid between photography and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.870 
it's a hybrid between photography and
oil<00:02:36.170> painting<00:02:36.620> that<00:02:37.250> gives<00:02:37.490> me<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.700> lot<00:02:37.820> of

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
oil painting that gives me a lot of

00:02:37.880 --> 00:03:06.289 
oil painting that gives me a lot of
freedom

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.630 

most<00:03:07.299> men<00:03:07.629> I<00:03:07.989> think<00:03:08.049> are<00:03:08.680> fascinated<00:03:09.220> by<00:03:09.250> women

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
most men I think are fascinated by women

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.220 
most men I think are fascinated by women
but<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:09.819> have<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.150> possibility<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:11.049> can

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
but I have the possibility that I can

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.679 
but I have the possibility that I can
use<00:03:11.379> them<00:03:11.560> as<00:03:11.680> models<00:03:13.230> I'm<00:03:14.230> not<00:03:14.560> going<00:03:14.980> for<00:03:15.689> top
