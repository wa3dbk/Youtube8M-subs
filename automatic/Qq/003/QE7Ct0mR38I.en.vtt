00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
but altered state it's kind of hard to

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.729 
but altered state it's kind of hard to
just<00:03:51.370> build<00:03:51.700> up<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.120> color<00:03:52.329> on<00:03:52.660> it<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.989> bit<00:03:53.019> so<00:03:53.680> i

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
just build up the color on it a bit so i

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.979

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
highlight in my tear duct and I put a

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.009 
highlight in my tear duct and I put a
little<00:04:04.540> bit<00:04:04.870> on<00:04:05.049> my<00:04:05.110> brow<00:04:05.650> bone<00:04:05.680> just<00:04:06.400> a<00:04:06.610> little

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:20.000 

the<00:04:11.019> next<00:04:11.860> um<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:15.489> next<00:04:15.880> eyeshadow<00:04:16.419> i<00:04:16.510> got<00:04:16.989> was

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.260 

hashtag<00:04:21.010> break<00:04:21.340> and<00:04:21.579> i<00:04:21.669> should<00:04:21.880> also<00:04:22.060> mention

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
hashtag break and i should also mention

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.150

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
have that one on my lip I don't think

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.690 
have that one on my lip I don't think
this<00:04:38.750> is<00:04:38.810> a<00:04:38.990> unique<00:04:39.290> color<00:04:39.650> at<00:04:39.890> all<00:04:40.040> it<00:04:40.340> reminds

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
this is a unique color at all it reminds

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.880 
this is a unique color at all it reminds
me<00:04:40.880> of<00:04:41.180> something<00:04:41.810> else<00:04:42.170> that<00:04:42.470> I<00:04:42.500> probably

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
me of something else that I probably

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.940 
me of something else that I probably
already<00:04:43.250> have<00:04:43.870> what's<00:04:44.870> I<00:04:45.050> got<00:04:45.290> it<00:04:45.560> I<00:04:45.680> realized

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
already have what's I got it I realized

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.080 
already have what's I got it I realized
that<00:04:46.310> but<00:04:47.060> that's<00:04:47.960> okay<00:04:48.440> and<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:48.770> last<00:04:49.670> one

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
that but that's okay and the last one

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.650 
that but that's okay and the last one
was<00:04:50.420> carbon<00:04:51.370> and<00:04:52.370> I<00:04:52.580> just<00:04:52.910> been<00:04:53.150> wanting<00:04:53.540> to

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
was carbon and I just been wanting to

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.010 
was carbon and I just been wanting to
get<00:04:53.810> a<00:04:53.870> carbon<00:04:54.410> to<00:04:54.560> add<00:04:54.740> to<00:04:54.980> my<00:04:55.130> collection

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
get a carbon to add to my collection

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.220 
get a carbon to add to my collection
yeah<00:04:57.020> I<00:04:57.760> figured<00:04:58.760> why<00:04:59.570> not<00:04:59.600> get<00:04:59.960> this<00:05:00.170> one

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
yeah I figured why not get this one

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.980 
yeah I figured why not get this one
since<00:05:00.650> it<00:05:00.830> was<00:05:00.950> in<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:01.220> larger<00:05:01.640> one<00:05:01.990> carbon

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
since it was in the larger one carbon

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.690 
since it was in the larger one carbon
and<00:05:03.170> I<00:05:03.230> was<00:05:03.380> really<00:05:03.620> happy<00:05:03.830> with<00:05:04.070> carbon<00:05:04.520> I

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
and I was really happy with carbon I

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.450 
and I was really happy with carbon I
used<00:05:05.180> it<00:05:05.420> a<00:05:05.510> little<00:05:05.720> bit<00:05:05.990> in<00:05:06.260> my<00:05:06.530> crease<00:05:07.250> as

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
used it a little bit in my crease as

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.940 
used it a little bit in my crease as
well<00:05:07.670> just<00:05:07.970> to<00:05:08.150> darken<00:05:08.360> it<00:05:08.750> and<00:05:08.990> I<00:05:09.650> actually

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
well just to darken it and I actually
