00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
into the carburetor right okay here we

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:48.410 
into the carburetor right okay here we
go

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420

that's the coolest thing ever I guess

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.130 
that's the coolest thing ever I guess
you<00:01:54.130> could<00:01:54.400> if<00:01:54.610> you<00:01:55.180> had<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.390> lot<00:01:55.750> of<00:01:55.869> hydrogen

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
you could if you had a lot of hydrogen

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.170 
you could if you had a lot of hydrogen
run<00:01:56.770> your<00:01:56.920> engine<00:01:57.040> completely<00:01:57.939> without<00:01:58.119> any

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180

other<00:01:58.420> modifications<00:01:59.070> let's<00:02:00.070> do<00:02:00.220> it<00:02:00.310> again

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
other modifications let's do it again

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.149 
other modifications let's do it again
you<00:02:01.840> know<00:02:02.140> there's<00:02:02.500> going<00:02:02.680> to<00:02:02.770> be<00:02:02.860> trouble

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
you know there's going to be trouble

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:14.830 
you know there's going to be trouble
when<00:02:03.610> it's<00:02:03.759> all<00:02:03.970> going<00:02:04.360> so<00:02:04.630> well

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.380 

okay<00:02:15.840> let's<00:02:16.050> live<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.530> test<00:02:17.060> with<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.090> rather

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
okay let's live that test with a rather

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.890 
okay let's live that test with a rather
nasty<00:02:18.900> backfire<00:02:19.710> it's<00:02:20.250> time<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.850> back<00:02:21.270> out<00:02:21.510> I

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
nasty backfire it's time to back out I

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.970 
nasty backfire it's time to back out I
think<00:02:22.680> it's<00:02:22.800> best<00:02:23.070> if<00:02:23.250> we<00:02:23.400> just<00:02:23.430> some<00:02:23.820> money
