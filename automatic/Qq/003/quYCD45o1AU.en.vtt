00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.460
 Hello everyone as it was in the previous one 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:14.580
 video I installed firmware 4.70 from 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:17.160
 Felix here is the firmware in principle 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.410
 everything is working fine but the only thing 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.800
 what she lacks is still full 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.029
 manager 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:32.009
 a developer released manager 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:35.730
 erismann but it unfortunately works 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.790
 incorrectly that is, it runs the image 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.100
 but for some reason does not want to see him further 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.280
 that is, the image is already mounted 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.910
 start the game does not start now I 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.910
 I 'll show it to you 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:06.930
 first install the full version of iris 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:09.370
 manager then put a minor 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:16.619
 you can just put a minor 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:16.619
 no matter the same will run 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:27.150
 here he asks to adjust the tap 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.150
 adjust to 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.500
 Here we see what the image runs exactly 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.000
 playstation 3 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:50.810
 he doesn't launch iso images as written 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.010
 sort of like go namely 3 station 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.979
 for some reason not so let's try for 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.310
 interest simply run the same would 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.310
 you again 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.030
 here we see the image loaded on the main 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.769
 screen are 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.439
 but when you start the game, I start writing 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:32.140
 mistake but that is not yet all 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:33.629
 unfinished raw if you try 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.790
 run 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:42.849
 for example a game so it is set via 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.500
 pkg file via 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:52.569
 install under signature files surely 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:55.980
 she will go to sesar try this 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:03:00.209
 see the game started 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.209
 I donâ€™t see any further sense 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.610
 Well, all the game will go shorter let's 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.480
 come out and try to run it again through 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.480
 his image of the game 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.290
 let's try for example to run 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.620
 image of the game 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.620
 fighting force 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:53.269
 and have not tested, we do not know and then he 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:55.519
 went as we see playstation 1 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:59.360
 apple station 2 starts up 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.910
 images iso images from ps3 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.790
 they don't start because this 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:12.290
 firmware without cobra function no function 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:15.140
 cobras but as we see the game from ps1 successfully 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.799
 it started and it even goes no sense 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.799
 further check 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.570
 here goes 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:05:00.949
 that is what I want to say is that the games 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:05.479
 format that is games playstation 3 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:07.849
 iso format and folder formats gc 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.599
 and so on, there are just different shots 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:14.749
 disks they will not be started yet 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:20.449
 we wait while the high-grade manager for 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:22.269
 470 firmware such games as easy 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.979
 let's say installed via install 

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:27.379
 package files 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:31.309
 pgg format for example there are all sorts of 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:34.609
 gran turismo on 5 disks divided or 

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:41.239
 still something the same gta 5 have it 

00:05:34.609 --> 00:05:43.849
 you start but now I showed you 

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:46.489
 it's all on the example of me installed 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:51.589
 I only have a headlamp edge 4 and 

00:05:46.489 --> 00:05:57.069
 life is strange and all is firmware 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:06:00.489
 it works fine so we are waiting 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:06.469
