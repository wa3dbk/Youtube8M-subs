00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello in this video I show you how 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.629
 could back off her your pony 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.090
 you only need one for that 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.309
 Small hair brace and it is best 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.690
 to have a little bit of a turn here 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.580
 or so it's not that boring 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.070
 Looks like a few never 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.770
 would like to put back then it should 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.109
 Be careful that your full house does not work too 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.970
 Far on the other edge goes and the hair 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.449
 Take away if you do not look nice 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.119
 out 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.710
 I take at most at the very most 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.170
 until the end of the eyebrow 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.480
 but that's never too much, I go 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.980
 always up to the middle then pull yes 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.170
 simply insert the line with your finger 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.210
 little in your hairline high as one 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.210
 piece and then you have the hair 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.800
 want her stuck in the hand 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.700
 caress a bit smoothly up here 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:55.770
 that looks neat like this and now 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:57.719
 Do you turn your hair once and now ? 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.879
 pushes yes to the equipment with their 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.690
 fingering the hair a bit like 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.570
 ahead 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.619
 that is a bit in it as living now 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.689
 yes just your hair clips and do 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.060
 behind your turned at the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.890
 This is the first one 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.990
 possibility very simple 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.150
 Now I'll do it again and show it 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.740
 you another possibility and 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.280
 Although you can get the hair for example 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.439
 also just weave back for this 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.740
 you take from your head to the 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.740
 border about a piece of your hair 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:46.649
 and that now divides into three equal sized ones 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.630
 aspire to so now you take that 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.500
 outer strands on your face 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.140
 lies from below into the middle afterwards 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.539
 follows the second outer streams from below 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.240
 in the middle here he pulls the whole 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.289
 nice 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.170
 now you start new strands 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.390
 always add the strand to the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.009
 face comes new strands that 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.410
 means you take this into action 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.799
 go with a thumb in your polish 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.260
 and take also on a few hair 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.750
 to the nerd goes again from below 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.730
 with it in the middle 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.590
 this strand that no one has to the 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.590
 just continue to continue as normal 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.640
 and now again with enormous a few 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.549
 Hair from your poly to your front 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.430
 to take a strand and on again 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:46.319
 maybe that's just what he's doing now 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:48.239
 of course always tighten tight and 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.950
 Although you can either the whole up 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.940
 expensive moore and lichen with the 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.519
 fix 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.290
 but I want to get up here now 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.549
 maybe just without hair 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.549
 to continue to take 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.720
 You're here, that's enough 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.160
 that here at the side with it here 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.950
 up a bit more volume than pull 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.950
 I raise my hair a bit 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.920
 now back with the 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.300
 fasten tension and you're done 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.300
 I hope I could help you
