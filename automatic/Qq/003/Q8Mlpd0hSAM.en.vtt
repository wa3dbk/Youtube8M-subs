00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
of his heroes who happen to do that to

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.080 
of his heroes who happen to do that to
write<00:01:55.380> clearly<00:01:55.770> about<00:01:55.950> art<00:01:56.159> because<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.640> lot<00:01:56.969> of

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
write clearly about art because a lot of

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.359 
write clearly about art because a lot of
people<00:01:57.420> don't<00:01:57.659> write<00:01:58.229> clearly<00:01:58.680> about<00:01:58.890> art<00:01:59.159> and

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
people don't write clearly about art and

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.200 
people don't write clearly about art and
it's<00:01:59.460> very<00:01:59.640> off-putting<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.509> think<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.350> readers

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
it's very off-putting I think to readers

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.859 
it's very off-putting I think to readers
they<00:02:03.210> think<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:04.280> they<00:02:05.280> feel<00:02:05.549> stupid<00:02:05.909> because

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
they think that they feel stupid because

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.410 
they think that they feel stupid because
it's<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.409> dense<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:08.099> lot<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.910> times

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.850 

so<00:02:12.420> I'm<00:02:12.540> sort<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.780> against<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.350> skull<00:02:13.650> art

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
so I'm sort of against that skull art

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.060 
so I'm sort of against that skull art
speak<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.660> it's<00:02:15.660> very<00:02:16.170> complicated<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.920> very

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
speak and it's very complicated is very

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.360 
speak and it's very complicated is very
hard<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.370> parse<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:18.210> very<00:02:18.390> abstract<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:20.310> I

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
hard to parse it's very abstract so I

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.290 
hard to parse it's very abstract so I
have<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.550> certain<00:02:21.560> personal<00:02:22.790> dislike<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:24.180> that

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
have a certain personal dislike of that

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.600 
have a certain personal dislike of that
kind<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.540> writing<00:02:24.840> when<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.710> was<00:02:25.980> younger<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.520> I

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
kind of writing when I was younger and I

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.540 
kind of writing when I was younger and I
first<00:02:26.970> got<00:02:27.120> interested<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:28.080> art<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.680> found<00:02:29.430> it

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
first got interested in art I found it

know for you know a paragraph describing
a<00:03:44.850> painter<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:45.720> when<00:03:45.810> you<00:03:45.900> can<00:03:46.020> really<00:03:46.170> just

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
simply show it there was really no

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.510 
simply show it there was really no
reason<00:03:48.630> not<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.380> thought<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:50.130> know<00:03:50.190> usually

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
reason not to I thought you know usually

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.760 
reason not to I thought you know usually
when<00:03:50.610> you<00:03:50.730> get<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:50.910> book<00:03:51.450> with<00:03:51.630> illustrations

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
when you get a book with illustrations

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.840 
when you get a book with illustrations
they're<00:03:52.770> all<00:03:52.860> bunched<00:03:53.130> together<00:03:53.340> in<00:03:53.730> the

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
they're all bunched together in the

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.220 
they're all bunched together in the
center<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.270> I<00:03:54.300> guess<00:03:54.450> they<00:03:54.600> do<00:03:54.660> that<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.020> save

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
center and I guess they do that to save

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.110 
center and I guess they do that to save
money<00:03:55.410> money<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.340> told<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.790> publisher

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
money money and I told the publisher

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.030 
money money and I told the publisher
said<00:03:57.300> look<00:03:57.450> if<00:03:58.080> I<00:03:58.230> can<00:03:58.380> print<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:58.680> out<00:03:58.770> on<00:03:58.830> my

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
said look if I can print it out on my

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.490 
said look if I can print it out on my
own<00:03:59.070> computer<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.900> can<00:04:01.140> print<00:04:01.350> it<00:04:01.410> out

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500

with your big printing machines and I

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.570 
with your big printing machines and I
wanted<00:04:03.870> them<00:04:04.020> to<00:04:04.140> fall<00:04:04.410> when<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:05.070> was<00:04:05.280> talking

wanted them to fall when I was talking
about<00:04:05.850> them<00:04:06.209> not<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:06.450> didn't<00:04:06.750> want<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:06.959> reader

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
to have to go find them in the centers

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.270 
to have to go find them in the centers
somewhere<00:04:10.500> so<00:04:10.800> because<00:04:11.250> they<00:04:11.370> were<00:04:11.900> you<00:04:12.900> know

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.560 
somewhere so because they were you know
really<00:04:14.280> important<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:14.880> story<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.480> have

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
really important to the story to have

really important to the story to have
them

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
them

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.490 
them
at<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.450> moment<00:04:16.810> when<00:04:16.959> you're<00:04:17.080> reading<00:04:17.260> about

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
at the moment when you're reading about

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.680 
at the moment when you're reading about
it<00:04:17.830> you<00:04:18.400> know<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.610> narrator<00:04:19.030> of<00:04:19.060> this<00:04:19.269> book<00:04:19.540> is

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
it you know the narrator of this book is

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.250 
it you know the narrator of this book is
male<00:04:19.959> so<00:04:20.440> he's<00:04:20.680> really<00:04:21.210> casting<00:04:22.210> his<00:04:22.360> gaze<00:04:22.600> on

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
male so he's really casting his gaze on

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.340 
male so he's really casting his gaze on
a<00:04:23.320> woman<00:04:24.070> actually<00:04:24.940> Picasso<00:04:25.690> used<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:26.050> do<00:04:26.170> that

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
a woman actually Picasso used to do that

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.320 
a woman actually Picasso used to do that
you<00:04:26.560> know<00:04:26.650> he<00:04:26.770> painted<00:04:27.310> a<00:04:27.430> lot<00:04:27.610> of<00:04:27.730> pictures

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
you know he painted a lot of pictures

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.410 
you know he painted a lot of pictures
especially<00:04:29.140> later<00:04:29.620> in<00:04:29.830> life<00:04:30.010> of<00:04:30.280> a<00:04:30.910> man

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
especially later in life of a man

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.500 
especially later in life of a man
looking<00:04:31.810> at<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:31.990> woman<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.820> I<00:04:33.820> think<00:04:34.360> it's

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
looking at a woman and I think it's

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.670 
looking at a woman and I think it's
there's<00:04:35.110> something<00:04:36.840> fascinating<00:04:37.840> about<00:04:38.380> the

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
there's something fascinating about the

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.140 
there's something fascinating about the
way<00:04:38.830> men<00:04:40.050> look<00:04:41.050> at<00:04:41.170> women<00:04:41.500> and<00:04:41.680> I<00:04:42.310> guess<00:04:43.030> it

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
way men look at women and I guess it

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.670 
way men look at women and I guess it
just<00:04:43.180> intrigues<00:04:43.720> me<00:04:43.840> I<00:04:43.960> don't<00:04:44.230> know<00:04:44.320> because

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
just intrigues me I don't know because

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.610 
just intrigues me I don't know because
they're<00:04:44.890> especially<00:04:45.610> lacy<00:04:46.090> who<00:04:46.420> is<00:04:46.620> really

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
they're especially lacy who is really

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.450 
they're especially lacy who is really
inexplicable<00:04:51.870> so<00:04:52.870> I<00:04:52.900> think<00:04:53.170> it's<00:04:53.290> good<00:04:53.530> for<00:04:53.560> it
