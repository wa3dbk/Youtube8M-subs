00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
now this isn't early that they do this

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.300 
now this isn't early that they do this
to<00:05:49.900> get<00:05:50.020> a<00:05:50.050> head<00:05:50.200> start<00:05:50.350> and<00:05:51.010> they<00:05:51.100> do<00:05:51.220> this

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
to get a head start and they do this

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.360 
to get a head start and they do this
every<00:05:51.460> year<00:05:51.700> early<00:05:52.000> but<00:05:52.120> it's<00:05:52.240> not<00:05:52.420> I<00:05:53.370> it's

every year early but it's not I it's

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.610 
every year early but it's not I it's
just<00:05:54.670> because<00:05:54.760> it<00:05:55.060> takes<00:05:55.210> a<00:05:55.330> while<00:05:55.480> to<00:05:55.780> put<00:05:56.500> all

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620
