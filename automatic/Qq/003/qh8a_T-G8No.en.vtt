00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.059
 to listen to a pool that has been 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.190
 think of how cley is to extend your 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.139
 product display during the year because 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.970
 for many months the pool is a 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.340
 expensive adornment for the garden 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.529
 my question is if you can enjoy 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.600
 of a china for another three months for one 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.449
 reasonable price is my condition for 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.130
 to do was not to do works after having 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.029
 given many turns to the head 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.250
 I discovered that I had two functions 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.500
 ex-athletic or in the heat fight at the end 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.489
 I opted for a heat pump and I'm going 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.579
 explain in the experience of flower bands 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.170
 function as the air-conditioning 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.809
 take advantage of the physical principles of the case 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.309
 the iran will precipitate heat from the outside 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.309
 and passed outwards 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.680
 with the technical effect explained in 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.020
 pumps to reach the third 80% of the heat 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.629
 club and outdoor holder while in the 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.750
 questions concerning 100% of the temperature 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.479
 of the city light subscriber 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:13.640
 the result a much cleaner energy 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:15.560
 pipes electrical consumption also finds 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.100
 it the solution to mount a 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.680
 heat 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.640
 avoiding making works or having to move in 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.979
 installation 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.159
 the easy connect system resolves the 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.200
 I install it myself and it's a lot 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.020
 small pump circulation connects with 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.170
 two hoses to a submerged terminal 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.170
 in the pool 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.030
 the aspect that is very important is very 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.030
 silent 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.960
 It's my experience, I usually respond. 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.300
 I had planned 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.970
 I can use china from May until 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.700
 end of September and this costs on average 1 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:20.180
 europe the day the former electric manager 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:22.360
 would cost five times more attractive 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.250
 pumps depending on the size of the pool 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.650
 and it is also important to reduce 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.070
 still more consumption covering the pool 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.200
 night in the colder months talk in a 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.540
 shop with the specialized vendor and 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.970
 elano did on the spot have all the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.560
 necessary recommendations and off one silva 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.750
 service is advanced 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.010
 with this method although the sensation of 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.010
 Brazil lasts a lot more
