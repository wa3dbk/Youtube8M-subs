00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.090
 time and the town hall level 8 then 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.160

 brings many innovations new troops 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.360
 It brings a lot of things that improve in the

 laboratory new levels new troops 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.590

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.519

 see battle let's see a fight not 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.329
 good a combat a single player attack 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.500
 'top' of me because of my clan not in this 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.540
 You already know how I am 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.610
 level 8 city hall I do not think I can 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.840
 go up to this for a while and 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.980
 I want it to be pretty good 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.480
 by the way I do not know if you have given 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.120
 account but we are very close to the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.219
 9,000 subscribers and sincerely 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.840
 I'm quite motivated not so good at 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.340
 the best this man who comes from classes 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.719
 Agree agreements from time to time 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.219
 It makes us a visit and help us 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.020
 war and help us with the clan by donating 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.910
 no good troops let's see some 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.829
 cosillas a jiffy first we go to 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.620
 see the first thing first of all a 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.960
 We will explore the moment 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.339
 troops of hay a little bit we are going to 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.080
 look for the troops that sergio has for 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.690
 that you see then that it helps us 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.090
 in war of agreement let's explore the 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.310
 jr perfect and let's see here what 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.690
 we have perfect kids as you see us 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.610
 helps a lot in war is a 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.280
 good player of league of champions- 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.290
 city ​​hall level 9 pretty high and 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.390
 the truth is that it is a great help in the 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.980
 clan and let's see an attack of his he's 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.990
 which normally improves the witches of 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.240
 level 2 to make the attacks that I 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.400
 they leave because I wanted each time a little 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.510
 to little listening to advice from other people 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.550
 experienced that I then am 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.050
 improving rather not so good here 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.520
 you can see his village I think that also 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.410
 it's pretty good or is it a player 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.510
 quite advanced and from my point of 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.940
 view a player 'top' not then 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.010
 aside, guys, I 'm telling you , let's see a 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.560
 attack that has done the good to number 2 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.120
 that was pretty pretty good we're going to 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.460
 see a little bit how can the village be 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.470
 from the other set, that is, you have the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.140
 crossbows at level 2 the cannons at 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.270
 level 11 the magician towers at level 7 of 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.010
 agreement guns this mortar level 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.780
 7 that is, what is a village a 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.510
 new city ​​hall quite subidito no 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.340
 here we see the troops that this has to 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.229
 level 113 that is to say how much 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.910
 level to sergito but still I say 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.950
 who has done a very good job and we are going to 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.450
 see the repetition by the way yes 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.370
 I see that the video really has support 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.440
 He has offered me his account to do 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.120
 more attacks and to bring you many more 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.160
 things which I appreciate a lot 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.080
 and if you want me to really bring 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.700
 attacks with this account handling it myself 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.769
 I'm commenting on life and teaching 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.330
 things and trying things and so on 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.380
 just leave it to me in the comments 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.300
 and get good 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.890
 Vote the video with a little hand up like this 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.680
 how good are we going to see the attack as 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.150
 Attacks a good 'top' player to a mirror 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.040
 of war does not first strip by 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.420
 here a pig mountain pulls another mountain 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.400
 pork and the first bomb explodes 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.959
 giant and you can pretty much take out the 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.090
 castle as you see has there is a dragon 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.700
 which does not pay good let's stop 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.590
 sunken has a dragon that is going to 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.299
 bother a little bit it's true that it has 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.519
 6 maggette is that they have their little things 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.260
 but a dragon always upset about 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.840
 all because of the changes of 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.519
 speeds between archers dragons the 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.590
 changes of speeds are very fucked 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.599
 it's like he also has a magician there 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.190
 hidden and good that really goes to 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.690
 bother a little but to some chairs 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.579
 I say it's going to be an attack piece like 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.319
 You see in this case because it has three goals 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.299
 that is going to throw it very spread out 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.430
 this area and carries two freckles that already 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.049
 You will see how the Balearic Islands do not 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.069
 you hit the mounds and I'm cool 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.349
 I'm cool 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.079
 today stretches witches throws the castle the 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.939
 clan pulls more wizards or is incredible going to 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.349
 be pretty good this attack and from 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.939
 my point of view then we go to a lot 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.469
 the action where you are going to concentrate 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.180
 it does not take more than saying that it's going to 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.650
 concentrate over here there is a golem 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.450
 holding on there throws the two freckles like 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.849
 I told you before and one goes away 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.019
 for here for the right but you'll see 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.280
 that is going to get right now in the 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.739
 egg is where the two are 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.629
 small golems and also going to do 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.760
 pretty hurt and as you see spell of 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.590
 double jump rage and healing in the 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.689
 center because it 's the place where most damage 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.400
 they will receive the troops according to 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.930
 I like these attacks a lot, see them 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.150
 and a lot to bring them to the channel because 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.409
 especially apart from me learn me 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.579
 I like that you see it and 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.769
 you can really learn some 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.150
 cosillas for example this one that uses the 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.590
 first anger to guide what is coming 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.629
 being the troops towards the center 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.010
 Then he throws another rage to make them 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.889
 enough damage to this area and eliminate 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.150
 quite defenses then throw a spell 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.319
 of jump so that all the troops enter 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.480
 to the center and just when it is in the 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.340
 center has a healing spell what 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.049
 which makes them hold much more for 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.910
 there at least make sure both 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.440
 stars and in this case they can not 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.110
 be three stars let's pass it now 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.940
 by two but still it has been an attack 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.590
 very very 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.380
 from my point of view I think that has 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.550
 it's been pretty good over here you can see 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.440
 well that the witch is dead and such 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.270
 but he has left his skeletons that good 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.340
 they are helping here to destroy 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.590
 the house is are making good one 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.150
 little bit of help no and good and what 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.680
 is left the barbarian that over there 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.240
 up there that barbarian over there an archer 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.670
 around here and the pkk that will destroy 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.050
 little thing more and nothing guys I hope 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.940
 that taste of this attack I think that 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.220
 has been honestly quite well and 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.570
 I think it's cool that it's pretty cool 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.400
 will bring attacks from time to time to the 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.470
 channel if you want me to bring you more 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.730

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.590
