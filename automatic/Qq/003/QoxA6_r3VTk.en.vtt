00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.000
 I still remember that day when I eat 

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:09.060
 I always go into the sant for a while to kill 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.670
 the time but that day was not like the 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.670
 where it was only to kill players or 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.160
 do jumps that day I had a nice 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.500
 welcome from a player that until the day 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.800
 today I do not know what his nickname was and 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.230
 much less in real life but the case 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.900
 is that he greeted me gave me a lot of money and 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.160
 a tuned car asked me how I 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.840
 he called in real life I told him but 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.510
 by returning the question and he 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.730
 he just fell silent I did the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.760
 same question more than three times and he 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.190
 he just kept quiet and so 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.860
 we were all the way along the way 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.410
 until you reach the cj house where you 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.530
 he parked under the bridge and we got to 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.130
 talk he asked me where I was from 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.980
 I answered him but when he returned 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.010
 He asks simply remained silent 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.219
 I told him hey friend because you do not answer me 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.750
 the questions that I ask if I like you 

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:09.630
 I have answered them 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.630
 He told me they are things that you should not 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.240

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.030

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.860
 he answered you do not know who you're getting 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.830

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.770
 car and I went with my friend anita shinoda 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.530
 I told him hey hahaha I came across a 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.240

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.720
 telling me you do not know who you're getting 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.530
 pendejo she replied leave jajajaj 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.630
 He must be a 7 year old boy more 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.030
 I started to get many 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.530
 private messages by the server that 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.899
 they said you called me here you have me 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.030
 I just did not listen to him and he's ready but 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.729
 at the moment I get more messages 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.670
 saying what you did you should have 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.100
 have thought before you're in tatters 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.820
 you will be between loneliness and my curse 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.130
 and I said hahaha this one does not take it very 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.679
 to chest and I left the server and went to 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.000
 sleep since it was late and I had to go to 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.440
 lessons 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.250
 the next day I remember very well 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.320
 It was like 726 when I got up and I 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.710
 I realize that I have blood in my eye 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.620
 right I told my mom but she told me 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.110
 that it was just that he was infected but 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.930
 later returning from classes I gave 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.970
 mind that I had it more red my mom 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.150
 he realized and he got scared and he took me 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.520
 immediately to the ophthalmologist but that 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.709
 gone to the ophthalmologist alone was a loss 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.610
 of time since the doctor just 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.310
 prescribed a few drops coming back from the doctor 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.250
 my mom told me to take a nap for 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.290
 see if my son stayed the same and in that 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.230
 nap was good my son a day 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.140
 next I got into my car to go to the 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.780
 store I went to the store but there I had 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.300
 a little headache but I took it 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.300
 as if nothing happened when leaving the 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.730
 store I headed towards my car when I 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.030
 I find a little boy inside the 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.000
 self I was impressed because my 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.450
 auto brought all the insurance places 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.720
 I looked at myself and said to the child hello my friend 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.660
 hey you're not wrong to auto him 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.450
 he did not answer me I got off the car to see 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.700
 if there was no lady looking for her 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.340
 son but at the moment of ridding to see the 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.530
 car glass simply the small 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.360
 disappeared I supposed that he had 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.640
 wrong car and I went 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.520
 quietly home to take a 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.860
 nap during the course towards me 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.410
 home I felt a little dizzy and with 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.140
 headaches I decided to stop in a 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.709
 pharmacy to buy an aspirin can 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.930
 continue my journey to my house at 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.050
 I went to my bedroom to 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.050
 take a nap when I woke up 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.530
 I felt very bad nauseated me 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.770
 I walked slowly towards the bathroom I vomit and 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.840
 I realize it's pure blood I decided 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.690
 talk to my mom to come with me 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.970
 towards the doctor coming to the doctor 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.880
 he said he does not find him blasting towards 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.490
 these strange vomiting when in my 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.930
 slightly I see a little boy who 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.000
 It makes me throw myself to the floor 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.330
 where I started having a disorder 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.820
 mental I remember that in my mind I was passing 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.090
 many colors and in the center the small 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.919
 child that I found in my car the 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.960
 doctor did not think about it and it took me 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.630
 directly to the psychiatric hospital 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.750
 hospital where he left me in charge with a 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:49.259
 nurse she was very pretty her 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.780
 beauty trapped me to sleep to the 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:54.660
 next day I remember that she took me 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.090
 the breakfast to the hospital bed its 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.120
 beauty had me totally trapped 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.060
 it was like an angel fallen from heaven with 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.669
 his brown eyes and his brown hair and 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.340
 it was impossible to stop admiring the 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.490
 and so I stayed until dinner she gave me 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.099
 dinner but when it's time to go to sleep I 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.750
 I felt that I could not sleep since each 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.840
 time I closed my eyes 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.449
 the boy was there he tormented me 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.849
 made him suffer until the moment of 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.729
 the madness he made me get up 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:28.979
 bed and scream as loud as I could that 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.740
 He made the nurse go towards 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:33.990
 my bedroom when he arrived together 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.900
 others of nurses with shirts 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.660
 force and soothing compulsively 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.900
 I took the cutlery and I took out his eyes 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.729
 the two nurses and then kill them 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.250
 then I found the nurse the 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.680
 which I fell in love with her beauty but my 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.840
 madness could not against that so the 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.139
 I took the hair and cut the neck 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.330
 until beheading the memory that came 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.580
 a lot of dens and staff of the 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.340
 psychiatric I was shot and I 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.740
 they slept and I did not wake up until the day 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.139
 next where I was in a 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:11.250
 dark and cold cell where it smelled 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:13.319
 strongly urine was unbearable was 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.690
 inevitable the desire to get out of there 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:18.300
 after two hours I remember that two 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:21.050
 guards passed by my cell and they 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:24.379
 I asked where I am 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.530
 they laughed at me mocking me 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:30.800
 and they told me you're in jail imbecile 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:35.289
 ajaja ask them but but what do I do 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:38.720
 here they said murder in cold blood 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:42.050
 wait for your condemnation I started thinking 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.940
 that all this was due and it came to me 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.159
 to mind that night when I 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.099
 I found that player that I had 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:53.060
 cursed and all for a simple question 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:55.520
 what's your name now I'm sitting here 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.620
 in the corner of my cold and lonely cell 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.120
 regretting having asked the question 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.120
 what's your name
