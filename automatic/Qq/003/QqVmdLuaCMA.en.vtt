00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
to do is snap them make a perimeter of a

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.390 
to do is snap them make a perimeter of a
cage<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.570> then<00:03:57.470> what<00:03:57.620> you<00:03:57.739> use<00:03:57.920> for<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.250> base

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
cage and then what you use for the base

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.599 
cage and then what you use for the base
is<00:03:58.670> coroplast<00:03:59.410> it's<00:04:00.410> what<00:04:00.650> you<00:04:00.769> use<00:04:00.799> for<00:04:01.280> signs

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
is coroplast it's what you use for signs

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.440 
is coroplast it's what you use for signs
so<00:04:02.600> you<00:04:02.660> can<00:04:02.870> get<00:04:03.019> that<00:04:03.170> at<00:04:03.350> a<00:04:03.380> sign<00:04:03.709> shop<00:04:04.450> most

Plexiglas

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
Plexiglas

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.680 
Plexiglas
I<00:04:25.310> got<00:04:26.210> it<00:04:26.330> custom<00:04:26.780> cut<00:04:27.050> at<00:04:27.590> a<00:04:27.650> hardware<00:04:28.100> store

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
I got it custom cut at a hardware store

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.330 
I got it custom cut at a hardware store
because<00:04:29.690> if<00:04:29.990> I<00:04:30.110> had<00:04:30.290> grids<00:04:30.590> dividing<00:04:31.190> these

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
because if I had grids dividing these

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.140 
because if I had grids dividing these
two<00:04:32.470> rugby<00:04:33.470> will<00:04:33.680> chew<00:04:33.889> them<00:04:34.100> and<00:04:34.820> he<00:04:34.970> actually

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
two rugby will chew them and he actually

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.879 
two rugby will chew them and he actually
broke<00:04:35.510> a<00:04:35.540> tooth<00:04:35.840> once<00:04:36.169> from<00:04:36.470> chewing<00:04:36.770> them<00:04:37.690> so

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
broke a tooth once from chewing them so

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.710 
broke a tooth once from chewing them so
that<00:04:39.889> is<00:04:40.160> what<00:04:40.520> divides<00:04:40.850> their<00:04:41.120> cage<00:04:41.360> and<00:04:41.389> they

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
that is what divides their cage and they

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.990 
that is what divides their cage and they
are<00:04:41.840> divided<00:04:42.230> because<00:04:42.560> both<00:04:43.310> of<00:04:43.340> those<00:04:43.639> pigs

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
are divided because both of those pigs

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.240 
are divided because both of those pigs
will<00:04:44.960> not<00:04:45.230> get<00:04:45.470> along<00:04:45.680> with<00:04:45.890> each<00:04:46.070> other

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
will not get along with each other

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.400 
will not get along with each other
whatsoever<00:04:46.760> and<00:04:47.270> they<00:04:47.600> will<00:04:47.750> not<00:04:47.960> get<00:04:48.110> along

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
whatsoever and they will not get along

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.920 
whatsoever and they will not get along
with<00:04:48.590> anyone<00:04:48.860> else<00:04:49.210> so<00:04:50.210> I<00:04:50.240> like<00:04:50.630> it<00:04:50.660> that<00:04:50.870> way

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
with anyone else so I like it that way

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.900 
with anyone else so I like it that way
so<00:04:51.110> uh<00:04:51.290> I<00:04:51.620> feel<00:04:52.070> like<00:04:52.190> they're<00:04:52.340> close<00:04:52.580> to<00:04:52.820> each

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
so uh I feel like they're close to each

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.300 
so uh I feel like they're close to each
other<00:04:53.060> you<00:04:53.419> can<00:04:54.320> see<00:04:54.500> each<00:04:54.590> other<00:04:54.740> smell<00:04:55.160> each

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
other you can see each other smell each

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.830 
other you can see each other smell each
other<00:04:55.550> and<00:04:55.760> sometimes<00:04:56.180> they<00:04:56.390> have<00:04:56.540> little

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
other and sometimes they have little

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.409 
other and sometimes they have little

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
visits over the top of the Plexiglas but

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.250 
visits over the top of the Plexiglas but

easy<00:05:27.530> to<00:05:27.800> tidy<00:05:28.070> up<00:05:28.220> because<00:05:28.700> obviously<00:05:29.150> you're

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
easy to tidy up because obviously you're

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.950 
easy to tidy up because obviously you're
going<00:05:29.539> to<00:05:29.630> need<00:05:29.690> to<00:05:29.990> scoop<00:05:30.289> up<00:05:30.470> poops<00:05:30.740> everyday

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
going to need to scoop up poops everyday

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.590 
going to need to scoop up poops everyday
and<00:05:32.960> it's<00:05:33.650> cheap<00:05:33.950> it's<00:05:34.610> expensive<00:05:35.030> to<00:05:35.360> first

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
and it's cheap it's expensive to first

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.810 
and it's cheap it's expensive to first
purchase<00:05:36.080> them<00:05:36.289> but<00:05:36.830> in<00:05:36.950> the<00:05:37.100> long<00:05:37.280> run<00:05:37.520> it's<00:05:37.700> a

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
purchase them but in the long run it's a

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.659 
purchase them but in the long run it's a
lot<00:05:37.850> cheaper<00:05:38.050> because<00:05:39.050> if<00:05:39.350> you<00:05:39.500> know<00:05:39.650> I<00:05:39.919> would

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
lot cheaper because if you know I would

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.490 
lot cheaper because if you know I would
only<00:05:40.789> use<00:05:40.910> care<00:05:41.330> profession<00:05:42.140> if<00:05:42.260> you<00:05:42.380> know

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
only use care profession if you know

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.409 
only use care profession if you know
that's<00:05:42.830> really<00:05:43.220> expensive<00:05:43.580> and<00:05:44.150> that<00:05:44.270> would

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
that's really expensive and that would

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.920 
that's really expensive and that would
take<00:05:44.570> so<00:05:44.810> much<00:05:44.960> time<00:05:45.229> for<00:05:45.530> me<00:05:45.650> to<00:05:45.800> scoop<00:05:46.100> out

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
take so much time for me to scoop out

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.159 
take so much time for me to scoop out
because<00:05:47.930> this<00:05:48.080> is<00:05:48.140> a<00:05:48.289> three<00:05:48.620> by<00:05:48.770> five<00:05:48.800> cage

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
because this is a three by five cage

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.240 
because this is a three by five cage
same<00:05:51.169> with<00:05:51.320> this<00:05:51.500> one<00:05:53.710> and<00:05:54.710> then<00:05:54.890> that's<00:05:55.070> a

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
same with this one and then that's a

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.850 
same with this one and then that's a
four<00:05:55.490> by<00:05:55.669> four<00:05:55.780> so<00:05:56.780> I<00:05:56.810> would<00:05:57.050> have<00:05:57.229> to<00:05:57.380> use<00:05:57.560> so

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
four by four so I would have to use so

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.469 
four by four so I would have to use so
much<00:05:58.039> care<00:05:58.400> fresh<00:05:58.729> and<00:05:58.970> it<00:05:59.060> would<00:05:59.150> be<00:05:59.240> so

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
much care fresh and it would be so

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.820 
much care fresh and it would be so
expensive<00:05:59.870> and<00:06:00.440> a<00:06:01.130> real<00:06:01.370> waste<00:06:01.640> of<00:06:01.880> money<00:06:02.830> all

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
expensive and a real waste of money all

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.240 
expensive and a real waste of money all
right<00:06:03.890> so<00:06:04.550> next<00:06:04.880> oh<00:06:05.560> I<00:06:06.560> guess<00:06:06.830> I<00:06:06.950> should<00:06:07.100> say

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
right so next oh I guess I should say

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.969 
right so next oh I guess I should say
