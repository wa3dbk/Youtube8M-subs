00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.619
 in this month of February it does well 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.080
 better to work indoors or 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.820
 in the porch and do you know that the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.680
 main task of the moment this is the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.330
 potting indoor plants from 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.250
 minus those who need it 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.320
 and right now the time of 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.689
 prepare this little staging with 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.500
 our potting soil and all that I come back and 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.500
 we see everything in detail 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.260
 I chose to repot you today 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.640
 a tree of the mayas you will tell me that 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.500
 looks a little like yucca and yes you 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.340
 are right it's up to yucca but not 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.170
 any of them 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.480
 it's a new variety that has the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.030
 particularity of having a trunk enough 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.010
 bulging this tree of mayas I come 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.289
 just buy it and like very often 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.359
 he's in a pot a little tight for 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.760
 him then we are going to change his skin 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.799
 luck is London then we 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.770
 will repot our Mayan tree 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.439
 in a pot a modern train taxes in 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.729
 resin tax almost translucent because 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.470
 that he is connected 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.540
 it's a pot that will change color 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.060
 but it's a real pot that has its 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.689
 drain hole for watering water in 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.520
 excess 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.250
 that's very important unless you 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.750
 do not prefer a water reserve but that 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.670
 I'm not very fan hours every 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.250
 traditional pots so those who have a 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.380
 water drain hole must have 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.329
 a draining layer at the bottom we go 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.720
 use for that clay balls 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.720
 expanded 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.880
 to standards and about 4 to 5 cm 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.590
 thick 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.050
 it avoids the cerro this compact and that 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:58.260
 ensures the evacuation of irrigation water 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:02:00.990
 in x the secret of successful potting is 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.060
 the quality of the soil the soil is 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.130
 a culture support the professionals 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.950
 prepare it with organic materials 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.100
 with mineral materials so with a 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.260
 set of components whose 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.250
 proportion is the basic quality do 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.160
 all the difference 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.190
 little advice always try to 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.830
 check behind the bag if there is 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.560
 four main subjects 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.260
 and here we have a potting soil quite 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.980
 special event that I will reveal to you 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.740
 little secrets 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.110
 our soil here is composed of Corsican 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.700
 composted peat brown peat 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.010
 coconut fiber sphagnum 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.320
 organic fertilizers and mycorrhizae 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.370
 what are mycorrhizae and well these are 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.480
 germs of mushrooms that will come 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.920
 to assemble with the roots it is this 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.870
 which is called a symbiosis for 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.370
 allow the plant to better 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.170
 feed to better withstand the 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.390
 drought that guarantees you a 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.300
 successful potting a good potting soil does it 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.390
 to be black well no must it be fine 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.700
 no more on the other hand should it involve 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.410
 fibers and small pieces of 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.830
 wood for example or small pebbles 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:12.410
 and yes, that's exactly what we 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:15.780
 here in this soil that will avoid us 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.170
 compaction so that if I the 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.170
 be strong in my hand well it stays 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.560
 always hungry air and that's the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.780
 secret really a very good back the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.790
 youcat is a plant of southern origin 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.709
 American is a plant that we can 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.930
 qualify in vernacular language 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.880
 of succulents that scientists 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.040
 prefer to call a plant 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.690
 succulent because she has organs 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.180
 reserve so that means she has 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.830
 need this very light potting soil that I 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.019
 have just introduced yourself and now 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.720
 we'll see how hotpot this 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.470
 yucca then the little thing is already 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.330
 two 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.610
 keep the plant like this and we're going 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.130
 give a little kick on the edge of the pot 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.760
 and here I disassemble them and see 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.290
 we already see the apparent presence 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.630
 root around the root ball 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.420
 he needed to change his skin 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:10.890
 it is now sufficient to fill in 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:15.420
 interstices of the pot and the mound with 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:17.340
 our soil to ensure the implementation 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.680
 place of the plant 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.590
 so be careful that's not enough you're going 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.460
 see you still have to you is to c 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:32.130
 the moment one fills with a maximum of 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:35.970
 potting soil and we're going to get all the 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:40.680
 substrate well at the bottom of the pot and especially 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:45.150
 all around the mound so as to 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:48.000
 avoid any risk of air holes in fact 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.460
 two air pockets that would risk 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.780
 leave the roots dry and 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.780
 jeopardize the recovery 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.950
 to be assured that the potting mix is ​​going well 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.120
 penetrated to the bottom of the pot I 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.240
 the habit of using small 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.520
 bamboo chopsticks like that and that makes 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.150
 really an extremely efficient passage 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.700
 so do not hesitate do like me 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.950
 it's nothing at all but it's a small 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.100
 gardener's secret so we finish the 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.320
 work by tamping well with the palm 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.310
 hands in such a way as to leave about 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:25.470
 1.2 cm between the edge of the pot and the 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.180
 potting soil simply for 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.130
 receive irrigation water 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.130
 so now it's time to water 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.889
 then watering must be hearty 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.270
 so that they soak 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:47.410
 completely the entire volume of the potting soil 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:51.400
 usually we will realize 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:53.940
 to the fact that the water will filter through 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.940
 our drainage holes 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.710
 as I had told you this pot and 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.710
 bright while the light is
