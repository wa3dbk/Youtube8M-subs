00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.979
 Facilities for service vehicles have to withstand every situation 

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:12.169
 because in terms of cargo safety, there are no compromises 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.449
 therefore all tricks in components are stably constructed 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:20.159
 statically calculated as well as claim 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.859
 tested in simulated continuous operation 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.000
 then it goes to the crash test 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.890
 this is the day of truth 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.770
 here will show up under extreme conditions 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.120
 how stable and reliable are Flex Moser Whiskas StÃ«mme 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.940
 if the device crashes at a speed of 50 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.140
 Hourly kilometers in motion device 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.659
 and 27 times its own weight 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:47.960
 acts on the mounting parts 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.420
 Drawers warn shelves and cases are made with heavy material 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.460
 loaded 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.460
 After all, you want to create practical conditions 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.380
 Soon there are a few last steps and then it can 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.780
 start 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.840
 the tensions Flex motifs increases 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.140
 How will the new decor behavior have you done everything right 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.870
 he sharpens 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.530
 the Flex just furnishes what it promises everything is in place 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.650
 few deformations no more 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.650
 even drawers can be opened easily 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.480
 That's why nothing happened during childhood 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.670
 All Flex Monheim components, thanks to their robust construction, are made of high quality 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.650
 Safety requirements 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.520
 Functionality and comfort without exception 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.310
 With the crash test, the proof is again provided 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.799
 Quality ensures safety 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.799
 for your own personal safety 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.609
