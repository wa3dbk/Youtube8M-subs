let's birddog and I'm gonna walk through
it<00:00:02.370> and<00:00:02.550> I<00:00:03.389> stand<00:00:03.780> here<00:00:03.990> I'm<00:00:04.170> simulating<00:00:04.500> the

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
it and I stand here I'm simulating the

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.619 
it and I stand here I'm simulating the
right<00:00:04.890> tackles<00:00:05.339> down<00:00:05.520> block<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:06.029> lot<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.450> times

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
right tackles down block a lot of times

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.570 
right tackles down block a lot of times
on<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.839> down<00:00:07.020> block<00:00:07.290> we<00:00:07.440> get<00:00:07.589> penetration<00:00:08.160> and

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
on the down block we get penetration and

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.370 
on the down block we get penetration and
it'll<00:00:08.760> knock<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.090> guards<00:00:09.360> off<00:00:09.510> path<00:00:09.780> so<00:00:10.290> if

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
it'll knock the guards off path so if

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.350 
it'll knock the guards off path so if
your<00:00:10.500> guards<00:00:10.769> pull<00:00:10.980> flat<00:00:11.280> they<00:00:11.940> won't<00:00:12.179> get

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
your guards pull flat they won't get

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.430 
your guards pull flat they won't get
there<00:00:12.540> they're<00:00:12.660> gonna<00:00:12.750> hit<00:00:13.019> somebody's

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
there they're gonna hit somebody's

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.410 
there they're gonna hit somebody's
ankles<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:13.920> trip<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.160> fall<00:00:14.280> so<00:00:14.940> we<00:00:15.059> have<00:00:15.269> this

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
ankles and trip and fall so we have this

Chris then

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.620 
Chris then
Chris<00:04:27.300> knows<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:28.620> cut<00:04:28.860> it<00:04:28.979> up<00:04:29.270> we<00:04:30.270> want<00:04:30.389> to<00:04:30.479> go<00:04:30.600> a

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
Chris knows to cut it up we want to go a

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.969 
Chris knows to cut it up we want to go a
little<00:04:30.810> farther<00:04:31.139> you<00:04:31.440> can<00:04:31.560> see<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.830> left

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
little farther you can see the left

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.420 
little farther you can see the left
guard<00:04:32.160> turning<00:04:32.720> plant<00:04:33.720> and<00:04:34.080> turn<00:04:34.530> up<00:04:34.710> so<00:04:35.250> this

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
guard turning plant and turn up so this

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.470 
guard turning plant and turn up so this
90<00:04:35.910> is<00:04:36.030> really<00:04:36.539> really<00:04:36.780> critical<00:04:37.050> here
