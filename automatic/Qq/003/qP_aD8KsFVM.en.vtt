00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.690
 I want to show you how to box in two different ways 

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:15.399
 can create 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:17.500
 the one version of the world with 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.810
 one color first time and the other with Herschel at victory 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.909
 next to him, they are now asking why do we do that 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.979
 in several forums where we are also represented 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.770
 Often the question came 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.900
 How do I make an email with SPOX like Marianne error message how can I 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.550
 one 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.930
 Texts many message 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.060
 individually cut on the mats 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.060
 and because we are so sorry to explain it 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.130
 We thought we were listening 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.490
 far, so to speak, give the answer to the meteo 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.880
 as I said two different ways 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.000
 I'll start with the baking shop 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.770
 not bedpepert district with the 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.340
 VPS party office 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.619
 the build is relative 1 op easy we go north 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.420
 Economy off 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.280
 the whole time a little bit smaller 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.830
 the year in addition 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.080
 without a click 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.010
 equal 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.270
 MSG box 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.570
 Veit signs 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.920
 Clamp on 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.600
 Quotation marks per band 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.600
 now comes the message text rows around clerk the message text 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.320
 Quotes again 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.320
 now comes one 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.510
 a comma 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.070
 now comes without quotes 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.289
 the numerous who decide for the style I take me one 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.299
 a mistake Style I say break off with and turn back 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.990
 that would be 17 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.330
 like your grief quotes prince comes the 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.730
 the title of the 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.730
 the fair SPOX irradiation heading St 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.830
 less too 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.510
 and the clip too 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.589
 this 17 is nothing now 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:10.459
 so to speak, you always have to 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.659
 Transgenic can also be another number of its is just one example 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.419
 he could change again to save the comparison 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:19.829
 we do that 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.879
 among all parties down here was counting 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:27.089
 Boars always come to me 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:31.199
 Wesel Stocks 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:33.809
 grew worldwide 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:36.809
 according to VBS 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.639
 fits the coding 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.479
 and save 

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.199
 Now get ours here 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.199
 Mehrzad SPOX appeared 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.509
 and now the Lions are on 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.509
 yes our error message is now headline 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.189
 and the message text below is next to was 17 if I have one here now 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:03.199
 also makes an 18 times 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.079
 the whole again 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.739
 then this is just here 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.839
 or not 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:12.229
 with 13 makes 

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:13.629
 he will 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.629
 since he is completely empty 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.219
 the whole thing 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.319
 Make 15 goals 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.859
 also like that 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.689
 they do not exist for everyone 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.649
 little contributed number 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:35.599
 that was a bit of a trial 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.609
 how to have the right one 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.869
 it will not be the same for example here 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:41.959
 he has a 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.609
 No yes bill so much different from the settle 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.819
 Grimaldi 24 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.129
 I must say I personally do not work with this VW first part 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.799
 I work more metric PelÃ© Herrmann sees it already gives often 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.139
 this 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.969
 New Style is practically nothing 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:03.669
 30 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.669
 Of course, that does not work infinitely 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:08.649
 from then on 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:10.319
 also the 11th 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.599
 whether the PID 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.569
 No, it does not work 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.029
 Reinmar Platz has to get 

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:21.430

 Nordic space Bobby also exists 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.430
 this is warning 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.430
 symbolizes this except with his question mark 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.520
 as I said just try it 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.279
 the cult normal one click 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:36.060

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.270
 Heading quotation marks always 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.870
 these appen ornaments 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.080

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.419
 he has been defined now 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.900
 you can do that similar pace I better 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.180
 then we go to the second with or Ebert the courtly furry 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.479
 and the coach would 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.479
 or pull out Indian if they look very different 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:19.330
 and 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.330
 he was in a wheelchair Basic

 the Windows Forms applications 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.460

 and scenes trigger the whole namely the partners test 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:41.479
 October Click on the button 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:42.290
 and the 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.279

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:45.020
 for VBS 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.870
 So for the VW's crime 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.849
 he reactivated 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:49.940
 One click 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.949
 equal to SG 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.539
 read on once 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.369
 Use message text 

00:05:57.369 --> 00:06:00.369
 17 or the other number 

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.319
 heading 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:08.699
 and 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:11.729
 but again too 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:16.490
 that's not how it works in Minden Issel Bass he shows the mistake 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.020
 it's not working 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.080
 Red that caresses her way 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.930
 too lax 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.809
 he will go in principle 

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:28.189
 instead of when 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:30.719
 Brier work 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:33.719
 but you can instead of the 17- too 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:36.680
 select all 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.830
 if it wants to have Deilmann and that is now Indian b much 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.189
 easier 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:43.930
 I just write 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:44.980
 Refreshment is 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.980
 the eBox part and then you can see which one 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:51.699
 but in two man I always want to have the part of what 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:55.949
 Del then it has all start here 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:01.639
 and then there's just Megastar behind as an issue 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.110
 Dennis memorable attending is going to be less steep 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.740
 the 17th 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.210
 too thin and look like that 

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:21.759
 So in the backrest blame it looks quite like this 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.550
 you can also take the number 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:29.639
 and here we can cause a stir 

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:30.869
 which number 

00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:33.529

 bestowed in legacy 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.089
 because you see 

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:51.289
 yes now the 64-year-old has the in VG St 

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:55.669
 Salsa also a little help 

00:07:55.669 --> 00:07:58.800
 a market does not want to be in midfield for the 1 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.719

00:08:00.719 --> 00:08:03.129
 through your VWs of the time 

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:04.369
 you can here 

00:08:04.369 --> 00:08:07.249
 slim down 

00:08:07.249 --> 00:08:08.820
 there wants to those 

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.180
