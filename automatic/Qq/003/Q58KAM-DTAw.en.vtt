00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.980 
mini mops I got these from the home base
in<00:00:10.320> Toronto<00:00:11.450> that's<00:00:12.450> why<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.630> picked<00:00:12.780> these<00:00:12.929> up

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
in Toronto that's why I picked these up

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.900 
in Toronto that's why I picked these up
they're<00:00:13.740> not<00:00:13.889> expensive<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.519> got<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.670> think<00:00:14.790> I

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
they're not expensive I got I think I

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.240 
they're not expensive I got I think I
got<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.150> 3-pack<00:00:15.570> for<00:00:15.960> 12<00:00:16.560> bucks<00:00:16.859> or<00:00:17.039> something

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
got the 3-pack for 12 bucks or something

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.769 
got the 3-pack for 12 bucks or something
like<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.789> works<00:00:17.940> out<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.119> 4<00:00:18.570> bucks

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
like that so it works out to 4 bucks

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.880 
like that so it works out to 4 bucks
each<00:00:19.039> I<00:00:20.270> think<00:00:21.270> these<00:00:21.359> are<00:00:21.420> sweet<00:00:21.869> now<00:00:22.560> when<00:00:22.859> I

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
each I think these are sweet now when I

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.470 
each I think these are sweet now when I
say<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.340> mean<00:00:23.580> they're<00:00:23.850> sweet<00:00:24.090> once<00:00:24.330> you

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
say that I mean they're sweet once you

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.890 
say that I mean they're sweet once you
change<00:00:24.810> something<00:00:25.140> about<00:00:25.470> them<00:00:26.630> they're<00:00:27.630> mops

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
change something about them they're mops

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.669 
change something about them they're mops
obviously<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.760> figure<00:00:30.449> that's<00:00:30.990> it's<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.500> mop

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
obviously so I figure that's it's a mop

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.430 
obviously so I figure that's it's a mop
it's<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:33.059> very<00:00:33.300> very<00:00:33.630> small<00:00:33.989> like

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
it's just like it's very very small like

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.160 
it's just like it's very very small like
probably<00:00:34.800> about<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.100> quarter-inch<00:00:36.110> there's<00:00:37.110> a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
probably about a quarter-inch there's a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.979 
probably about a quarter-inch there's a
little<00:00:37.410> spring<00:00:37.770> inside<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.750> what<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.840> want

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
little spring inside and what you want

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.410 
little spring inside and what you want
to<00:00:40.050> do<00:00:40.170> before<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.530> use<00:00:40.739> these<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.270> take<00:00:42.270> out

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
to do before you use these is take out

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.779 
to do before you use these is take out
the<00:00:42.600> mop<00:00:42.780> itself<00:00:43.620> these<00:00:44.250> things<00:00:44.550> right<00:00:44.730> here

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
the mop itself these things right here

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.279 
the mop itself these things right here
just<00:00:45.090> take<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> little<00:00:45.600> knife<00:00:45.750> pop<00:00:46.110> that

just take like a little knife pop that
right<00:00:46.320> off<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.980> there's<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.030> spring<00:00:48.450> inside

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
right off and there's a spring inside

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.889 
right off and there's a spring inside
there<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.410> know<00:00:49.500> just<00:00:49.710> take<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.780> like<00:00:51.780> I

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
there you know just take like like I

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.389 
there you know just take like like I
don't<00:00:51.960> know<00:00:52.110> anything<00:00:52.469> that'll<00:00:52.710> fit<00:00:52.739> inside

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
don't know anything that'll fit inside

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.610 
don't know anything that'll fit inside
I<00:00:53.430> used<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.120> pen<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.840> pen<00:00:55.050> worked<00:00:55.260> perfectly

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
I used a pen and a pen worked perfectly

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.799 
I used a pen and a pen worked perfectly
fine<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.850> pop<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.239> spring<00:00:57.539> oh<00:00:57.629> what

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
fine and just pop that spring oh what

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.049 
fine and just pop that spring oh what
that<00:00:57.960> spring<00:00:58.199> does<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.680> restricts<00:00:59.100> like

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that spring does is it restricts like

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.479 
that spring does is it restricts like
the<00:01:00.239> paint<00:01:00.449> from<00:01:00.629> flowing<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:02.070> think<00:01:02.340> these

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
the paint from flowing and I think these

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.570 
the paint from flowing and I think these
flow<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> lot<00:01:03.120> better<00:01:03.359> when<00:01:03.989> there's<00:01:04.589> no<00:01:04.769> valve

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
flow a lot better when there's no valve

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.100 
flow a lot better when there's no valve
system<00:01:05.820> or<00:01:06.150> whatever<00:01:06.420> they<00:01:06.600> would<00:01:06.750> even<00:01:06.840> call

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
system or whatever they would even call

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.200 
system or whatever they would even call
it<00:01:07.200> inside<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.650> but<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.000> good<00:01:09.150> I

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
it inside this but it's just so good I

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.770 
it inside this but it's just so good I

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
like it's not gonna float nowhere near

as<00:01:26.580> good<00:01:26.729> as<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:27.090> quit<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:28.170> their<00:01:29.130> drips<00:01:29.430> are

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
as good as in quit but their drips are

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.760 
as good as in quit but their drips are
slow<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.780> you're<00:01:30.930> not<00:01:31.079> gonna<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> drips
