00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.120
 I would like to send a cake to the afternoon from the sea view 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.440
 There is a pattern that I think, but let me share 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.349
 Mark the height without saying different directions to raise it to defeat 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:17.659
 By force 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.880
 There is a second place if you think that it is carrying up 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.630
 Yamaguchi seems deep 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.599
 I'm an economist, but 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.349
 Use a little 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.239
 Joint from this state 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.239
 Moved up 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.030
 It is unrefined to practice this and to visualize party official recognition 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.920
 Sea view 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.920
 flat 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.020
 I have always figured out how to save the runner 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.890
 Outlook on the calm stage 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.340
 And it's so great though 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.660
 1405 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.800
 Please give me mac 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.890
 This is how this person can do it while holding up techno 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.270
 It happens 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.410
 Don't get too wide 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.420
 Imidas e library 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.550
 Because it is forcing 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.190
 In this state, the cat is strongly pushed out and wins 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.720
 It did not appear if it was good 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.830
 If requested, on the moon 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.830
 Admission blow back 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.970
 Something like that 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.110
 I should have told you from here 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.540
 Started 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.210
 Face forward 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.590
 Which one is Ichikawa 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.130
 I think it would be nice to have a try around 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.440
 so 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.870
 Please continue one week for 3 weeks 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.880
 Unfortunately
