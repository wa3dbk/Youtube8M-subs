fresh scratch built Baker in the road

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.370 
fresh scratch built Baker in the road
markers<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:03.270> all<00:02:03.479> scratch-build<00:02:04.020> took<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.229> day

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
markers so all scratch-build took a day

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.050

and<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.560> half<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.890> do<00:02:05.009> one<00:02:05.220> row<00:02:05.369> marker<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.940> it

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
and a half to do one row marker and it

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.150 
and a half to do one row marker and it
only<00:02:06.180> took<00:02:06.360> after<00:02:06.660> I<00:02:06.960> had<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.259> established<00:02:07.890> I

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
only took after I had it established I

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.639 
only took after I had it established I
dunno<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.149> took<00:02:09.300> six<00:02:09.569> hours<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> second

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.309 
app to keep this way because the road
mark<00:02:42.299> has<00:02:42.420> had<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.599> lot<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.900> weights<00:02:43.079> at<00:02:43.200> this

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
mark has had a lot of weights at this

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.559 
mark has had a lot of weights at this
point<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.950> didn't<00:02:44.489> have<00:02:44.579> it<00:02:44.700> tore<00:02:44.909> the<00:02:44.939> the

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
point I didn't have it tore the the

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.229 
point I didn't have it tore the the
gangs<00:02:46.260> rolled<00:02:46.799> but<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.549> was<00:02:47.670> just<00:02:47.849> too<00:02:47.970> fragile

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
gangs rolled but it was just too fragile

00:02:48.239 --> 00:03:04.790 
gangs rolled but it was just too fragile
so<00:02:48.629> I<00:02:48.659> had<00:02:49.170> good

good detail on those scratch built all
the<00:04:16.459> Coulter's<00:04:16.850> I<00:04:17.000> used<00:04:17.180> the<00:04:17.299> hole<00:04:17.510> punch<00:04:17.810> and

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
styrene bent into the wire and then

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.150 
styrene bent into the wire and then
mounted<00:04:23.240> them<00:04:23.389> on<00:04:23.450> there<00:04:23.690> and<00:04:23.950> also<00:04:24.950> you<00:04:25.040> can

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
mounted them on there and also you can

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.100 
mounted them on there and also you can
kind<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.430> see<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.700> u-bolts<00:04:26.180> and<00:04:26.330> at<00:04:26.450> all<00:04:26.630> but

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
kind of see the u-bolts and at all but

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
for it when it weights and I put it the

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.760 
for it when it weights and I put it the

raised position rest on it so it keeps
