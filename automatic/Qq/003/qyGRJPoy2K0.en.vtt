00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.590 
elastic at the end a little tiny bit
lower<00:03:45.720> than<00:03:45.930> I<00:03:46.050> normally<00:03:46.110> would<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:47.480> think<00:03:48.480> this

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
lower than I normally would I think this

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.270

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.550 
just helps show off the little twisted
ends<00:03:50.730> which<00:03:51.360> I<00:03:51.480> felt<00:03:51.720> like<00:03:54.260> secure<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:55.350> with<00:03:55.410> an

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
ends which I felt like secure it with an

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.210 
ends which I felt like secure it with an
elastic<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:57.350> then<00:03:58.350> I'm<00:03:58.620> going<00:03:58.830> to<00:03:58.890> go<00:03:59.010> back

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
elastic and then I'm going to go back

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.790 
elastic and then I'm going to go back
and<00:03:59.520> just<00:03:59.580> where<00:04:00.480> these<00:04:00.630> pieces<00:04:00.990> pull<00:04:01.440> in<00:04:01.590> I'm

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
and just where these pieces pull in I'm

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.020 
and just where these pieces pull in I'm
just<00:04:02.070> going<00:04:02.190> to<00:04:02.220> loosen<00:04:02.490> them<00:04:02.670> up<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.910> little
