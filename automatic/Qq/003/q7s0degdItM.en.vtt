stoked<00:00:30.410> about<00:00:30.590> this<00:00:30.890> airplane<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:31.880> finish<00:00:32.210> on

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
stoked about this airplane the finish on

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.500 
stoked about this airplane the finish on
it<00:00:32.419> is<00:00:32.689> beautiful<00:00:33.590> I<00:00:34.180> didn't<00:00:35.180> get<00:00:35.269> the<00:00:35.390> red

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
it is beautiful I didn't get the red

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.270 
it is beautiful I didn't get the red
white<00:00:35.690> and<00:00:35.839> blue<00:00:35.960> because<00:00:36.350> well<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:36.890> wasn't<00:00:37.070> on

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
white and blue because well it wasn't on

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.890 
white and blue because well it wasn't on
sale<00:00:37.519> so<00:00:37.790> I<00:00:37.820> went<00:00:38.059> ahead<00:00:38.150> with<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:38.449> I<00:00:38.750> guess

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
sale so I went ahead with the I guess

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.560 
sale so I went ahead with the I guess
it's<00:00:39.140> kind<00:00:39.350> of<00:00:39.379> a<00:00:39.500> grey<00:00:40.460> blue<00:00:40.760> on<00:00:41.089> top<00:00:41.330> I

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
it's kind of a grey blue on top I

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.450 
it's kind of a grey blue on top I
considered<00:00:42.350> more<00:00:42.500> of<00:00:42.530> a<00:00:42.620> blue<00:00:42.830> on<00:00:43.010> top<00:00:43.190> and

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
considered more of a blue on top and

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.250 
considered more of a blue on top and
then<00:00:43.910> I'll<00:00:44.000> real<00:00:44.269> light<00:00:44.510> grey<00:00:44.809> on<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.019> nose

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
then I'll real light grey on the nose

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.960 
then I'll real light grey on the nose
and<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:45.500> base<00:00:45.739> should<00:00:46.370> have<00:00:46.610> too<00:00:46.820> much

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
and the base should have too much

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.700 
and the base should have too much
trouble<00:00:47.210> seeing<00:00:47.570> it<00:00:47.750> I<00:00:47.930> may<00:00:48.320> put<00:00:48.530> a<00:00:48.559> yellow

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
trouble seeing it I may put a yellow

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.010 
trouble seeing it I may put a yellow
stripe<00:00:49.100> on<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.339> bottom<00:00:49.670> though<00:00:49.840> the<00:00:50.840> wings

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
stripe on the bottom though the wings

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.389 
stripe on the bottom though the wings
they<00:00:51.739> look<00:00:51.980> great

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
this is uh one of the first foamies I've

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.549 
this is uh one of the first foamies I've
ever<00:00:57.230> bought<00:00:57.530> that<00:00:58.340> I<00:00:58.399> haven't<00:00:58.820> had<00:00:59.000> to<00:00:59.719> pull

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
ever bought that I haven't had to pull

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.819 
ever bought that I haven't had to pull
hinges<00:01:00.980> off<00:01:01.160> and<00:01:01.430> realign<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.930> flight<00:01:03.530> the

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
flying surfaces the these these are off

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:08.710 
flying surfaces the these these are off
a<00:01:07.430> hair<00:01:07.729> but<00:01:08.030> not<00:01:08.180> enough<00:01:08.420> that<00:01:08.450> I'm<00:01:08.630> gonna

gonna<00:01:18.649> look<00:01:18.770> like<00:01:18.950> of<00:01:19.340> course<00:01:19.520> I<00:01:19.610> have<00:01:19.700> to<00:01:19.759> feed

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
gonna look like of course I have to feed

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.359 
gonna look like of course I have to feed
the<00:01:20.090> wire<00:01:20.270> through<00:01:20.470> that's<00:01:21.470> it<00:01:21.800> is<00:01:22.009> just<00:01:22.250> gonna

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
look at this bundle of wires I got a

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.180 
look at this bundle of wires I got a
hook<00:01:32.270> up<00:01:32.450> something<00:01:32.840> in<00:01:33.200> that<00:01:33.319> suite<00:01:33.649> I<00:01:33.830> love

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190

it<00:01:34.340> I<00:01:34.520> love<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:36.380> engineering<00:01:36.830> on<00:01:36.860> this<00:01:37.009> is

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
it I love it the engineering on this is

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.800 
it I love it the engineering on this is
pretty<00:01:37.429> nice<00:01:37.640> I<00:01:37.880> mean<00:01:38.060> they've<00:01:38.360> made

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
pretty nice I mean they've made

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.630 
pretty nice I mean they've made
everything<00:01:39.229> really<00:01:39.440> easy<00:01:39.709> to<00:01:39.920> get<00:01:40.039> to<00:01:40.099> take

everything really easy to get to take

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.309 
everything really easy to get to take
this<00:01:40.789> nose<00:01:41.030> cone<00:01:41.300> off<00:01:41.509> so<00:01:41.690> I<00:01:41.720> don't<00:01:41.810> break<00:01:42.140> it

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
this nose cone off so I don't break it

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:43.600 
this nose cone off so I don't break it
so<00:01:42.860> I'm<00:01:43.069> putting<00:01:43.310> everything<00:01:43.489> together

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
so I'm putting everything together

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.979 
so I'm putting everything together
that'll<00:01:44.000> be<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.149> last<00:01:44.330> thing<00:01:44.509> I<00:01:44.630> put<00:01:44.869> on<00:01:46.989> flip

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:47.989 
that'll be the last thing I put on flip

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:54.910 
that'll be the last thing I put on flip
it<00:01:48.140> over<00:01:48.259> here<00:01:48.619> gently<00:01:51.610> yeah<00:01:53.530> he's<00:01:54.530> not<00:01:54.649> sure

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
it over here gently yeah he's not sure

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.139 
it over here gently yeah he's not sure
if<00:01:55.069> there's<00:01:55.280> something<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:55.640> goes<00:01:55.759> over<00:01:56.000> that

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
if there's something that goes over that

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.790 
if there's something that goes over that
or<00:01:56.420> if<00:01:56.479> that's<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.750> cheater<00:01:56.989> go<00:01:57.200> I'll<00:01:57.349> find<00:01:57.649> out

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
or if that's a cheater go I'll find out

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.699 
or if that's a cheater go I'll find out
as<00:01:58.580> I'm<00:01:58.759> building<00:01:58.910> it<00:01:59.239> look<00:02:00.140> at<00:02:00.259> that<00:02:00.440> I<00:02:00.590> can

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
as I'm building it look at that I can

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.380 
as I'm building it look at that I can
get<00:02:00.830> right<00:02:00.979> to<00:02:01.160> the<00:02:01.280> EDF<00:02:01.640> unit<00:02:02.030> there's<00:02:02.239> the

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
get right to the EDF unit there's the

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.999 
get right to the EDF unit there's the
motor

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
motor

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.229 
motor
he's<00:02:04.009> pretty<00:02:04.160> sweet<00:02:04.489> all<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.700> server's<00:02:05.090> are

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:05.239 
he's pretty sweet all the server's are

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:09.100 
he's pretty sweet all the server's are
pre-installed<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.539> checked<00:02:08.869> they're<00:02:09.020> all

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
pre-installed and I checked they're all

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
movements a little tight but I think I

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.500

think what it'll be all right I may have

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.660 
think what it'll be all right I may have
to<00:03:23.660> put<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:23.900> couple<00:03:24.020> of<00:03:24.170> drops<00:03:24.320> of<00:03:24.560> two<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:25.550> one

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
to put a couple of drops of two and one

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.070 
to put a couple of drops of two and one
oil<00:03:25.910> back<00:03:26.120> in<00:03:26.360> there<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:26.690> see<00:03:26.810> if<00:03:26.840> that'll

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
oil back in there and see if that'll

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.350 
oil back in there and see if that'll
they<00:03:27.740> could<00:03:27.920> move<00:03:28.670> a<00:03:28.760> little<00:03:28.880> easier<00:03:29.180> but<00:03:29.300> I

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
they could move a little easier but I

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.670 
they could move a little easier but I
wanted<00:03:29.570> to<00:03:29.660> show<00:03:29.900> that<00:03:29.930> here's<00:03:30.290> what<00:03:30.440> it<00:03:30.530> looks
