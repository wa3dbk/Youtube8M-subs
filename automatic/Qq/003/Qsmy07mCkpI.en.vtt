00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 since then the new star wars battlefront 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.580
 2015 was also the screams 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.880
 by no means 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.070
 ok to what extent is this now 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.900
 battlefield in the future setting 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.150
 or be a battlefield 3 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.060
 it was with star wars because it is 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.590
 yes also produced by dice hey internet 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.420
 Here is going again and you are back 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.670
 At the start and this question we give 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.859
 today on the ground or 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.289
 on five reasons because I have for you 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.900
 five reasons why star wars 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.340
 battlefront will not be a battlefield 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.590
 whole I have here more or less in 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.360
 I divided myself into five categories 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.530
 have thought so much about you 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.190
 just show it clearly out there 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.559
 why the upcoming star wars battlefront 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.719
 2015 actually not really much 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.920
 how is it with battlefield? 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.300
 one or the other maybe first 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.280
 think and then maybe a bit 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.930
 shit because they say okay 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.850
 moment was missing in the last 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.949
 time with battlefield 4 and now up to date 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.449
 with tagline well always 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.820
 again as the one shot back 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.710
 of course, nobody has one 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.300
 bock especially when it comes to battlefront 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.280
 That's why we do not talk long 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.360
 around the bush and come to ours 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.360
 reason number one 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.009
 First of all we have the weapons here 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.990
 behave or a bit far that 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.729
 character behavior that you can 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.429
 combine and that is about it 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.280
 the first important fact that there is no 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:27.049
 real downside will give that is 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.090
 You can not over the eyes and grain 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.530
 aim at star wars battlefront too 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.149
 the preceding time is always like this 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.700
 that you mostly from the 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.469
 hip fire daily with a visor on 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.329
 the respective blaster or weapon 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:39.920
 have you had the opportunity in zoom 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.780
 that is also the case with star wars 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.189
 battlefront 2015 the case 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.619
 so far, however, is not really 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.750
 which blessings are known as well 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.700
 they may or may have 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.840
 can equip, therefore, remains 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.030
 the guess open that the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.340
 most of the weapons he extracted from the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.679
 hip is fired and her thus no 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.390
 Classic Taylor since every weapon 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.039
 have such example in the battlefield 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.679
 world of the other is added that her 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.899
 your figurine both in the first one 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.880
 You can also play ferguson mode 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.319
 this is new to battlefield 2 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.120
 Battlefield never really the case 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.920
 and of course it raises it again 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.019
 a little way out in one's own 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.130
 series or in the battlefront 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.540
 series because there it was in the 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.609
 the previous ones share the same 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.859
 case that he is both in first person as well 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:23.569
 also play word stock exchanges and thereby also 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.560
 constantly without any warped out and 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.510
 could switch 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.690
 And that is just in the new part of the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.690
 case 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.330
 Number two is the customization 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.340
 system in the battlefront gonna die 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.360
 possibility have your character like that 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.980
 adjust 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.590
 you want that means you 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.060
 your gadgets lotz according to variable 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.580
 can prove and not through here 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.040
 classic classes are limited because 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.810
 Battlefront is not a class system like 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.010
 for example, at battlefield the case 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.480
 is included 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.060
 so you can do different 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.310
 gadgets take the zb in a battle 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.440
 variety where he different classes 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.209
 assigned while you are in the 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.040
 Battlefront have the opportunity 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.590
 all of these in quotes 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.060
 class gadgets with increasing 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.160
 what we just had bock and what 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.540
 you just feel good 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.709
 you the possibility your figure too 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.319
 that means for example 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.880
 different heads in the context of 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.700
 different races you can choose 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.870
 and therefore just another 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.790
 Adjustment option occupied as in 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.829
 Battlefield was the case and not 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.989
 too limited or in a lane 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.900
 reason number three is kept why 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.720
 Battlefront 2015 will not be a battlefield 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.940
 is the battlefield teamplay system 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.970
 just part 4 he swears teamplay 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.170
 teamplay here teamplay because without teamplay 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.790
 you do not get ahead 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.440
 that's why classes have the 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.970
 You can also choose your gadgets 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.920
 to help each other 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.989
 The storm soldier acts as a paramedic 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.850
 can revive his colleagues and 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.370
 also heal the supporter throws you 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.049
 Production and the pioneer keeps you 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.239
 the vehicles from the body resp 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.400
 repair them again in the battlefront 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.290
 her as in the previous none 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.480
 real classes are only yours 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.430
 gadgets and also to the previous one 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.230
 was not the possibility medi packs 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.090
 take with you and throw them too 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.190
 because the heart system in star wars 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.859
 battlefront 2015 is designed so that 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.780
 your character is your own life 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.530
 regenerates that it is similar to 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.750
 battlefield 4 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.459
 However, the regeneration faster 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.720
 and thus the use of 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.539
 medi packs as is classic in 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.789
 battlefield 4 eg the case was not anymore 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.310
 is about such gadgets really necessary 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:31.200
 So medi packs or ammunition spex 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.610
 it will stay in the game 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.470
 the big question in the girlfriends 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.270
 It was like that, too 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.130
 different flags score through the 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.740
 ruins the possibility had with 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.910
 ammunition or life 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.009
 So we have to wait and see 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.870
 but you can definitely say something 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.210
 the teamplay battlefront is different 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.840
 designed as in the classic metal pz in 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.720
 danger is 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:56.099
 Number 4 on our list is that 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.330
 vehicle system battlefront you will 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:00.120
 at least what we know so far 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.550
 expected to have any fixed points spor 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.050
 for vehicles that means that he 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.120
 not like in battlefield at the beginning of the round 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.530
 just looks okay there are the and the 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.270
 Vehicles because I can spawn purely 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.099
 but like me already in one of my 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.620
 Form news mentioned it so-called 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.460
 Power ups gives the on the map random 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.770
 are distributed 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.180
 which you can collect here and 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.400
 according to which power up 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.349
 act then the vehicle can use 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.300
 this is connected with it 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.740
 every case in waters off mode of the case 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.780
 That's the only one so far 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.400
 demi demir could see like that on the 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.020
 other modes and cards in other 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.669
 looks like that is still the big one 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.889
 I can well imagine, however 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.139
 that it is common in this system 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.330
 stays and of course diversified 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.740
 in the whole game feeling insight into 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.659
 our point number five and so 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.870
 last reason why star was 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:48.419
 battlefront 2015 will not be a battlefield 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.789
 is the fact that it is star 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:52.860
 wars battlefront is the studio dice 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:55.289
 has indeed emphasized that they restart 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.509
 a more or less new edition and 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:59.639
 a separate part with star wars 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:00.690
 want to start battlefront 2015 and no 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:02.219
 battlefront 3 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.930
 However, this has to do with the 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:05.789
 star wars and around the battlefront 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.680
 franchise and the previous ones 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.090
 you should already note points 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.710
 especially if you are with the old battlefront 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.599
 pay familiar time for you 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.310
 of course, very much to the old parts 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.300
 have oriented and there also elements 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.710
 to include 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.909
 the whole thing just to one 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.789
 Battlefront become one 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:22.580
 independent new game in star wars 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:25.380
 universe and not easy to one 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.849
 Battlefield risks in the star wars setting 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.710
 Of course things will be like that 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.599
 frostbite engine uses but mine 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.430
 arx survival wulff 's recently 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:34.440
 published second game also uses 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.569
 a kind of real engine but is at 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.250
 Far from being a arena shooter therefore can 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:40.380
 you do not say so easy hey that is 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.150
 that's a frostbite engine that 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.740
 is battlefield no it will 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.729
 not be any case and the one or the other 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.050
 others may still be 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:47.880
 do not want to believe and then at the latest 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.710
 have the game in hand and also 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.570
 be allowed to play at the latest 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.050
 then notice that it is well 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.370
 plays differently than 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.080
 a battlefield even if it is 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.550
 a shooter to now I want yours 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.229
 opinion just to know write
