00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
tutorial is going to be on how to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.229 
tutorial is going to be on how to
isolate<00:00:38.160> an<00:00:39.050> object<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.290> move<00:00:41.190> around<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
isolate an object and move around the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.369 
isolate an object and move around the
object<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.680> like<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> circular<00:00:44.579> motion<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.480> do

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
object and like a circular motion I do

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.440 
object and like a circular motion I do
want<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.710> say<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.219> did<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:47.610> make<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.969> up<00:00:48.180> I

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
want to say I did not make this up I

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.040 
want to say I did not make this up I
have<00:00:48.840> seen<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.850> some<00:00:50.850> big<00:00:51.059> TV<00:00:51.420> shows<00:00:51.660> like<00:00:51.989> a

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
have seen it on some big TV shows like a

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.350 
have seen it on some big TV shows like a
mary<00:00:52.289> scott<00:00:52.440> talent<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.100> I've<00:00:53.579> seen<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> more

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
mary scott talent and I've seen a more

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.180 
mary scott talent and I've seen a more
than<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.600> few<00:00:54.750> dancers<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.649> done<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.980> so

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
than a few dancers that have done it so

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.099 
than a few dancers that have done it so
definitely<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:56.760> claiming<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.449> as<00:00:57.690> my<00:00:57.870> move

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
definitely not claiming this as my move

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.790 
definitely not claiming this as my move
but<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.160> concept<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.969> isolating<00:01:00.719> an<00:01:01.170> object

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
but the concept of isolating an object

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.880 
but the concept of isolating an object
is<00:01:02.039> definitely<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.850> fundamental<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:04.049> style<00:01:04.530> of

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
is definitely a fundamental or style of

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.130 
is definitely a fundamental or style of
popping<00:01:05.760> whether<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.210> isolate<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.720> all<00:01:06.840> kinds

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
popping whether you isolate in all kinds

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.010 
popping whether you isolate in all kinds
of<00:01:07.200> ways<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:08.760> concept<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.360> centering<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
of ways the concept of centering the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.350 
of ways the concept of centering the
object<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.890> then<00:01:11.159> orbiting<00:01:11.760> around<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.299> i

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
object and then orbiting around it i

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.539 
object and then orbiting around it i
think<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.869> really<00:01:13.229> cool<00:01:13.619> visual<00:01:14.130> effect

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
think is a really cool visual effect

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.550 
think is a really cool visual effect
that<00:01:15.119> every<00:01:15.570> dancer<00:01:15.960> should<00:01:16.140> know<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:16.409> they

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
that every dancer should know if they

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.840 
that every dancer should know if they
want<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.890> entertain<00:01:17.850> an<00:01:18.360> audience<00:01:19.700> so<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
want to entertain an audience so the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.950 
want to entertain an audience so the
first<00:01:21.060> thing<00:01:21.210> I'm<00:01:21.390> going<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.540> come<00:01:21.780> straight

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
first thing I'm going to come straight

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.910 
first thing I'm going to come straight
on<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.909> keeping<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.060> hat<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.810> center<00:01:25.770> as

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
on is keeping this hat in the center as

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.580 
on is keeping this hat in the center as
if<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.280> was<00:01:26.430> hanging<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.030> like<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.450> dog<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:28.110> I

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
if it was hanging on like a dog as I

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.460 
if it was hanging on like a dog as I
walk<00:01:28.619> across<00:01:29.420> my<00:01:30.420> arm<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.960> going<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.290> moving

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
walk across my arm is going to be moving

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.140 
walk across my arm is going to be moving
so<00:01:31.920> my<00:01:32.070> wrist<00:01:32.340> my<00:01:32.520> hey<00:01:32.700> I'm<00:01:32.759> going<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.000> try<00:01:33.119> to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
so my wrist my hey I'm going to try to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.950 
so my wrist my hey I'm going to try to
isolate<00:01:33.740> right<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.040> middle<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> this

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
isolate right in the middle so this

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.390 
isolate right in the middle so this
would<00:01:37.079> be<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.350> first<00:01:37.590> thing<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.130> want<00:01:38.310> to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
would be the first thing you want to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.179 
would be the first thing you want to
practice<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.950> definitely<00:01:40.950> one

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
practice and it this is definitely one

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.920 
practice and it this is definitely one
of<00:01:41.250> those<00:01:41.369> tricks<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.820> need<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.299> practice<00:01:42.540> in

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
of those tricks you need to practice in

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.990 
of those tricks you need to practice in
a<00:01:43.020> mirror<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> get<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> feeling<00:01:44.610> if

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
a mirror so you get the feeling if

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.030 
a mirror so you get the feeling if
you're<00:01:45.210> walking<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.439> maybe<00:01:46.649> kind<00:01:47.009> of

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you're walking and maybe kind of

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.429 
you're walking and maybe kind of
wobbling<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.270> obviously<00:01:48.930> lose<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
wobbling it that obviously lose the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.530 
wobbling it that obviously lose the
effect<00:01:49.799> or<00:01:50.369> if<00:01:50.490> you're<00:01:50.640> moving<00:01:51.060> with<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.420> as

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
effect or if you're moving with it as

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.910 
effect or if you're moving with it as
well<00:01:51.829> hmmm<00:01:52.850> no<00:01:53.850> bueno<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.500> what<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.710> got<00:01:55.770> that

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
well hmmm no bueno so what you got that

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.639 
well hmmm no bueno so what you got that
part<00:01:56.189> mastered<00:01:56.640> here<00:01:56.930> your<00:01:57.930> start<00:01:58.229> working<00:01:58.530> on

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
part mastered here your start working on

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.109 
part mastered here your start working on
your<00:01:58.680> fingertips<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.490> it's<00:01:59.610> really<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.030> going

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
your fingertips so it's really is going

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.539 
your fingertips so it's really is going
to<00:02:00.210> do<00:02:00.360> all<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.990> work<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.070> think<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.430> hardest

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
to do all the work I think the hardest

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.570 
to do all the work I think the hardest
part<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.210> getting<00:02:03.750> these<00:02:03.960> finger

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
part is getting these finger

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.130 
part is getting these finger
downs<00:02:04.820> you're<00:02:05.210> going<00:02:05.330> to<00:02:05.390> be<00:02:05.480> kind<00:02:05.990> of

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
downs you're going to be kind of

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.810 
downs you're going to be kind of
twisting<00:02:06.890> their<00:02:08.229> fingers<00:02:09.229> around<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.680> hat<00:02:10.040> to

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
twisting their fingers around the hat to

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.220 
twisting their fingers around the hat to
kind<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.090> keep<00:02:11.270> in<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.570> circle<00:02:11.930> it's<00:02:12.020> almost

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
kind of keep in the circle it's almost

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.410 
kind of keep in the circle it's almost
like<00:02:12.470> if<00:02:13.010> you're<00:02:13.190> twisting<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.790> head<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.180> way

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
like if you're twisting a head this way

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.500 
like if you're twisting a head this way
the<00:02:15.110> Hat<00:02:15.350> is<00:02:15.620> kind<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.190> object<00:02:16.910> that

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
the Hat is kind of that object that

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.330 
the Hat is kind of that object that
staying<00:02:17.870> still<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.200> then<00:02:18.470> your<00:02:18.650> hands<00:02:18.950> are<00:02:19.190> on

staying still and then your hands are on
top<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.930> twisting<00:02:20.930> your<00:02:20.960> fingers<00:02:21.530> as<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.310> try

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
top of twisting your fingers as you try
