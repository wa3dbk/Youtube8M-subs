00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
that happened yes it did so it's fun to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.830 
that happened yes it did so it's fun to
guess<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.150> know<00:01:39.240> those<00:01:39.420> games<00:01:39.659> are

introduces that competitive element
still<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:44.850> they<00:01:44.970> were<00:01:45.000> saying<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
still and because they were saying the

Nintendo<00:01:45.750> wraps<00:01:45.990> for<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.909> when<00:01:47.909> they've

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
Nintendo wraps for that when they've

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.130 
Nintendo wraps for that when they've
been<00:01:48.180> playing<00:01:48.390> with<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.630> they<00:01:48.750> actually<00:01:49.020> use

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
been playing with it they actually use

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.440 
been playing with it they actually use
it<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.320> do<00:01:49.439> speedruns<00:01:49.979> right<00:01:50.700> because<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:51.390> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
it to do speedruns right because now you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.880 
it to do speedruns right because now you
can<00:01:51.570> introduce<00:01:51.810> platforms<00:01:52.409> with<00:01:52.560> our<00:01:52.649> work

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
can introduce platforms with our work

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.230 
can introduce platforms with our work
any<00:01:53.040> platforms<00:01:53.490> before<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.030> through<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
any platforms before you get through the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.609 
any platforms before you get through the
level<00:01:54.479> super<00:01:54.720> fast<00:01:54.960> if<00:01:55.229> you're<00:01:55.320> kind<00:01:55.590> of

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
level super fast if you're kind of

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.780 
level super fast if you're kind of
already<00:01:55.770> familiar<00:01:56.219> with<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.670> thought

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
already familiar with it and I thought

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.300 
already familiar with it and I thought
that<00:01:56.850> was<00:01:57.090> interesting<00:01:57.320> also<00:01:58.320> introduction

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that was interesting also introduction

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.340 
that was interesting also introduction

get to play it that with that right yeah

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.470 
get to play it that with that right yeah
so<00:02:20.799> you<00:02:20.859> can<00:02:21.040> run<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.549> then<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:21.670> can<00:02:21.939> jump<00:02:22.329> up

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
so you can run and then you can jump up

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.729 
so you can run and then you can jump up
in<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.599> air<00:02:22.689> and<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:23.170> can<00:02:23.290> kind<00:02:23.409> of<00:02:23.530> glide

in the air and you can kind of glide

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.440 
in the air and you can kind of glide
down<00:02:24.010> but<00:02:24.459> it<00:02:24.549> didn't<00:02:24.760> look<00:02:24.819> like<00:02:24.879> this<00:02:25.209> game

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
down but it didn't look like this game

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.839 
down but it didn't look like this game
anymore<00:02:25.659> altitude<00:02:26.260> beyond<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.859> another

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
anymore altitude beyond that another

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.250 
anymore altitude beyond that another
feature<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.359> squirrel<00:02:28.599> suit<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:28.989> that<00:02:29.170> you

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
feature of the squirrel suit is that you

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.050 
feature of the squirrel suit is that you
can<00:02:29.409> latch<00:02:29.590> on<00:02:29.829> the<00:02:29.950> walls<00:02:30.159> which<00:02:30.489> seemed<00:02:30.730> not

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
can latch on the walls which seemed not

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.990 
can latch on the walls which seemed not
totally<00:02:31.989> useful<00:02:32.409> but<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:33.430> wasn't<00:02:33.700> useful<00:02:33.819> in

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
totally useful but it wasn't useful in

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.339 
totally useful but it wasn't useful in
the<00:02:34.090> level<00:02:34.299> they<00:02:34.389> was<00:02:34.540> showing<00:02:34.870> right<00:02:35.109> sure

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
the level they was showing right sure

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.539 
the level they was showing right sure
but<00:02:35.650> I'm<00:02:35.769> sure<00:02:35.920> there'll<00:02:36.099> be<00:02:36.129> some<00:02:36.340> kind<00:02:36.519> of

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
but I'm sure there'll be some kind of

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.940 
but I'm sure there'll be some kind of
wool<00:02:36.790> jumpy<00:02:37.329> bits<00:02:37.719> where<00:02:38.019> it's<00:02:38.139> useful<00:02:38.500> yeah

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
wool jumpy bits where it's useful yeah

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.649 
wool jumpy bits where it's useful yeah
so<00:02:39.189> it<00:02:39.250> looked<00:02:39.430> like<00:02:39.519> basically<00:02:39.939> if<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.329> were

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
so it looked like basically if you were

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:41.879 
so it looked like basically if you were
looking<00:02:40.930> like<00:02:41.079> it<00:02:41.230> you're<00:02:41.530> gonna<00:02:41.650> fall

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:41.889 
looking like it you're gonna fall

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.050 
looking like it you're gonna fall
someplace<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.400> could<00:02:42.489> just<00:02:42.639> grab<00:02:42.760> on<00:02:42.939> the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
someplace you could just grab on the

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.460 
someplace you could just grab on the
wall<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.359> as<00:02:43.480> opposed<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.930> what<00:02:43.959> new<00:02:44.169> Mario

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
wall and as opposed to what new Mario

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.720 
wall and as opposed to what new Mario
would<00:02:44.590> normally<00:02:44.919> do<00:02:45.040> which<00:02:45.189> is<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.579> could

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
would normally do which is you could

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.670 
would normally do which is you could
skip<00:02:46.569> down<00:02:46.689> the<00:02:46.750> wall<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.079> then<00:02:47.169> jump<00:02:47.379> try<00:02:47.620> to

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
skip down the wall and then jump try to

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.140 
skip down the wall and then jump try to
jump<00:02:47.980> off<00:02:48.129> you<00:02:48.310> could<00:02:48.430> just<00:02:48.579> hold<00:02:48.669> on<00:02:48.879> to<00:02:49.030> it

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
jump off you could just hold on to it

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.789 
jump off you could just hold on to it
for<00:02:49.269> a<00:02:49.299> while<00:02:49.389> get<00:02:49.629> your<00:02:49.750> bearings<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.319> then

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
for a while get your bearings and then

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.409 
for a while get your bearings and then
jump<00:02:51.040> back<00:02:51.129> off<00:02:51.400> so<00:02:51.669> I<00:02:51.700> thought<00:02:51.909> that<00:02:52.030> was<00:02:52.150> kind

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:52.419 
jump back off so I thought that was kind

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:53.879 
jump back off so I thought that was kind
of<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.689> they<00:02:52.750> had<00:02:52.900> weed<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:53.379> didn't<00:02:53.709> get<00:02:53.799> to

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
of and they had weed I didn't get to

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.470 
of and they had weed I didn't get to
play<00:02:54.040> with<00:02:54.250> it<00:02:54.340> but<00:02:54.459> they<00:02:54.519> had<00:02:54.669> some<00:02:54.909> those

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
play with it but they had some those

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.809 
play with it but they had some those
have<00:02:55.689> some<00:02:55.810> little<00:02:55.930> Yoshi<00:02:56.579> things<00:02:57.579> that<00:02:57.790> I
