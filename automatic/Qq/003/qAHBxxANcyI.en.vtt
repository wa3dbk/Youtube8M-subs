00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.080
 Welcome to the season before we look 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.760
 always after possibility new 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.780
 play experience in an exciting way and 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.969
 wise to improve 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.650
 This year we will make changes 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:11.669
 The aim of the supporter role 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.860
 to develop further 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:16.080
 to refine the role of the collector and 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.360
 to improve the general game flow 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.610
 we need your feedback about this 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.210
 play in the season 2014 even further 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.550
 improve 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.110
 We believe that all champions are over 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.560
 playing an important role in the game 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.990
 should 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.250
 Most roles and positions are 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.110
 already extremely successful 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.480
 but there are always some behind 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.699
 Both supporters and collectors are close by 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.129
 his 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:40.019
 Let's start with the supporters 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.089
 destroying enemy nexus is 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.890
 not cheap to win the view war 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.569
 was mostly at the expense of the supporter 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.190
 which were not able to 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:49.469
 to buy other items 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.149
 we are making changes around you 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.530
 Other strategic options too 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.359
 Provide and take responsibility for the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.370
 view of the entire team 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.690
 you will have a series of new views 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.120
 find objects 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.800
 These are free and have theirs 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.149
 own subject space and each 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.250
 this jewelry has a different one 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.079
 use as the reveal and 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.180
 disabling eyes from playing 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:11.909
 remote areas or the laying of 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.590
 free eyes because they are free 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.990
 Everyone can easily see 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.460
 participate in the game 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.289
 every player can only have one 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.820
 certain amount of eyes at the same time 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.100
 Distribute time on the map 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.840
 we want to encourage players to do so 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.909
 careful decisions at the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.710
 distribution of eyes to hit and that 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.689
 grant yourself to a true team 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.560
 to make a goal 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.149
 in addition we help the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.439
 purses the supporter in which we 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.090
 other sources of income 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.890
 championships and items for you 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.570
 create 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.909
 various support items grant now 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.290
 additional gold which supporter to 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.000
 better end of the game 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.160
 We also match the experience 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.180
 and facilitate at higher levels 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.620
 the climb this you should learn more 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.280
 give freedom to their lengths 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.840
 leave 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.680
 and still be able to 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.480
 wanted to keep up with their teams last 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.110
 We give support to the feeling important 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.640
 to fight in a team 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.470
 in order to make this possible we have support 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.180
 Scaling introduced the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.350
 usefulness of their skills with theirs 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.820
 ability to scale strongly improves 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.770
 and impairments are over the 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.570
 play effectively what suits them 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.230
 allows a similar increase in power too 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.790
 feel like the others roll collectors 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.560
 were in the third season with one 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.740
 airport-heavy playing style very 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.180
 successful but at carey sang lan the 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.950
 is launching more to the damage 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.720
 we could conclude that 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.660
 There was the same need for improvement 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.860
 as with the supporters we have on 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.450
 each side another camp 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.080
 added something new to the jungle 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.080
 phase opened 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.450
 we add that more new items 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.010
 towards dealing with more 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.010
 to give customization options 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.870
 to make sure the anglers are on 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.359
 the same level as their teams 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.560
 have neutral monsters and grades the 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.439
 with the average level of all 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.030
 scale the champion, giving you more 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.040
 experience and gold if you 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.000
 rising up 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.650
 by the income and the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.480
 experience should increase collectors 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.189
 further possibilities have to gold 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.420
 to earn 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.069
 these changes will be yours 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.189
 give the opportunity to play as you do 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.189
 want 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.489
 So far we have changed 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.090
 dedicated to certain roles 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.220
 aim 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.030
 but we also want the general 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.829
 Improve game flow 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.870
 next to adding a new camp 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.760
 we have some landscape architecture 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.189
 operated and the size and shape of 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.599
 budget adjusted 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:41.849
 These changes are meant to be messy 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:45.620
 when distributing eyes eliminate and 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.620
 solve problems with the fog of war 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.189
 around the snowball effect by the early 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.379
 destroying targets to reduce 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.639
 let's adjust the profit for the destroy 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.680
 from outer towers 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.900
 for this to pay the involved 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.099
 champions is and a smaller effect 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.019
 on the other lanes has 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.000
 moreover, that will destroy 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.799
 no longer inhibits all vasals 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.790
 reinforce but only in the 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.680
 appropriate lane 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.569
 This should be an inhibitor 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.349
 have lost the opportunity to one 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.269
 Give comeback 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:15.479
 instead of constantly defending all lanes too 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.340
 must ultimately be the gold and 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:19.199
 Scale the experience of the kite 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.930
 and better over the game 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.400
 give rewards 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.139
 The goal is the kites in the 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.380
 later game play to a hot one 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.880
 to make a fierce target 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.710
 We think that the game is with everyone 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.779
 addressed changes dynamic 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.669
 will expire as before 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:39.309
 And this is just the tip of the iceberg 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.059
 To learn more about the lectures changes 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:42.159
 to experience 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:44.289
 look at the rest of the content 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:47.490
 lecture and keep an eye out for 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.490
 further updates
