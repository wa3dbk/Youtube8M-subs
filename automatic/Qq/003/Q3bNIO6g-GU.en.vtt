starter<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:10.890> getting<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.280> ball<00:01:11.520> up

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
starter you just getting that ball up

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.060 
starter you just getting that ball up
really<00:01:12.720> gets<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.140> propelled<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.710> your<00:01:13.830> shot

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
really gets you propelled in your shot

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.609 
really gets you propelled in your shot
as<00:01:14.250> opposed<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.750> know<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> jump<00:01:16.229> stop<00:01:16.470> we

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
as opposed to a you know a jump stop we

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.649 
as opposed to a you know a jump stop we
just<00:01:16.770> like<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.070> inside<00:01:17.400> pivot<00:01:17.820> better

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
just like that inside pivot better

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.030
