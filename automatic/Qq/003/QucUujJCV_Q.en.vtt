00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.179 
ever own it of course the biggest
contradiction<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.020> his<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.619> wasn't<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
contradiction in his it wasn't the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.069 
contradiction in his it wasn't the
argument<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.060> he<00:01:45.329> says<00:01:45.630> he<00:01:45.810> wasn't

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
argument is that he says he wasn't

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.410 
argument is that he says he wasn't
looking<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.680> rap<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.130> Cavs<00:01:47.369> at<00:01:47.610> all<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.060> then
