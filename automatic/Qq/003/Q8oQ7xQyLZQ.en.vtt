just going to wrap my hair around it and
as<00:05:02.300> you<00:05:02.450> can<00:05:02.570> see<00:05:02.600> it<00:05:02.840> just<00:05:02.870> creates<00:05:03.320> a<00:05:03.440> really

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
as you can see it just creates a really

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.740 
as you can see it just creates a really
really<00:05:04.100> loose<00:05:04.460> curl<00:05:04.850> that<00:05:05.030> it<00:05:05.120> was<00:05:05.240> really<00:05:05.570> hot

really loose curl that it was really hot

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.950 
really loose curl that it was really hot
that's<00:05:05.990> why<00:05:06.140> I<00:05:06.170> made<00:05:06.200> that<00:05:06.590> weird<00:05:06.800> face<00:05:07.960> so

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
that's why I made that weird face so

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.390 
that's why I made that weird face so
yeah<00:05:09.230> basically<00:05:09.470> I'm<00:05:09.800> just<00:05:09.860> doing<00:05:10.190> that<00:05:10.340> to

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
yeah basically I'm just doing that to

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.550 
yeah basically I'm just doing that to
all<00:05:10.880> of<00:05:11.120> my<00:05:11.330> hair<00:05:11.600> and<00:05:11.630> then<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.170> do<00:05:12.290> it<00:05:12.350> to<00:05:12.470> the

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
all of my hair and then you do it to the

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:21.190 
all of my hair and then you do it to the
top<00:05:12.680> section<00:05:12.920> as<00:05:13.280> well

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.410 

and<00:05:21.320> then<00:05:22.070> once<00:05:22.280> I'm<00:05:22.430> finished<00:05:22.610> I'm<00:05:23.000> just

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
and then once I'm finished I'm just

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.180 
and then once I'm finished I'm just
taking<00:05:23.810> my<00:05:23.840> fingers<00:05:24.290> and<00:05:24.470> combing<00:05:24.920> through<00:05:25.100> it

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
taking my fingers and combing through it

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.590 
taking my fingers and combing through it
so<00:05:25.370> either<00:05:25.490> the<00:05:25.670> curls<00:05:25.940> don't<00:05:26.210> look<00:05:26.360> so

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
so either the curls don't look so

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.500 
so either the curls don't look so
perfect<00:05:27.110> and<00:05:27.590> you<00:05:28.130> could<00:05:28.340> tie<00:05:28.640> it<00:05:28.700> up<00:05:29.030> at<00:05:29.330> the

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
perfect and you could tie it up at the

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.150 
perfect and you could tie it up at the
top<00:05:29.720> or<00:05:29.930> pin<00:05:30.140> it<00:05:30.230> back<00:05:30.320> or<00:05:30.530> something<00:05:30.830> but<00:05:31.010> I

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
top or pin it back or something but I

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:58.439
