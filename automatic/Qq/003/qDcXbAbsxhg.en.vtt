that that sheet of plywood down there
he's<00:00:54.809> got<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.020> bow<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.980> with<00:00:56.280> all<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.780> so

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
he's got a bow in it so with all that so

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.630 
he's got a bow in it so with all that so
I<00:00:57.840> put<00:00:58.559> water<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.370> both<00:01:00.149> sides<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:02.340> now

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
I put water on the both sides and so now

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.450 
I put water on the both sides and so now
and<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.420> bow<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.220> all

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and the bow is going like that so all

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.390 
and the bow is going like that so all
that<00:01:06.180> weight<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.600> pressing<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> boat<00:01:07.320> down<00:01:07.650> so

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
that weight is pressing the boat down so

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.780 
that weight is pressing the boat down so
I'm<00:01:08.549> hoping<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.030> once<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.420> dries<00:01:10.549> it's<00:01:11.549> gonna

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
I'm hoping that once it dries it's gonna

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.390 
I'm hoping that once it dries it's gonna
be<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.710> matter<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.770> fact<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.040> think<00:01:14.100> I'm<00:01:14.310> gonna

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
be a matter of fact I think I'm gonna

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.039 
be a matter of fact I think I'm gonna
sweep<00:01:14.670> some<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.090> excess<00:01:15.479> water<00:01:15.750> off

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
sweep some of that excess water off

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.230 
sweep some of that excess water off
because<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.830> think<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.640> might<00:01:17.820> be<00:01:17.939> too<00:01:18.119> much

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
because I think it might be too much

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.980 
because I think it might be too much
water<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.930> top<00:01:19.820> I'm<00:01:20.820> not<00:01:21.000> sure<00:01:21.150> how<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.780> do

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
water on the top I'm not sure how to do

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.260 
water on the top I'm not sure how to do
it<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.229> anyway<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.460> kind<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.759> see<00:01:24.000> that

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
it but anyway you can kind of see that

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.880 
it but anyway you can kind of see that
there's<00:01:24.509> well<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.110> course<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.409> floor<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.770> not

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
there's well of course the floor is not

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.190 
there's well of course the floor is not
exactly<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.490> level<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.420> sting<00:01:27.630> either<00:01:27.840> but

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
exactly the level of sting either but

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.469 
exactly the level of sting either but
anyway<00:01:29.130> we'll<00:01:29.280> see<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.549> works<00:01:29.850> out<00:01:30.030> I

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
anyway we'll see if that works out I

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.010 
anyway we'll see if that works out I
called

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
called

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.480 
called
to<00:01:32.680> get<00:01:32.829> some<00:01:32.979> stuff<00:01:33.430> called<00:01:33.640> MDF<00:01:34.210> and<00:01:38.490> locally

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
to get some stuff called MDF and locally

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.260 
to get some stuff called MDF and locally
and<00:01:39.729> they<00:01:40.119> only<00:01:40.270> had<00:01:40.539> half<00:01:40.929> inch<00:01:41.289> and<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:43.240> I

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
and they only had half inch and so I

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.539 
and they only had half inch and so I
thought<00:01:43.840> well<00:01:44.049> it's<00:01:44.409> that's<00:01:44.619> not<00:01:45.069> what<00:01:45.219> I<00:01:45.250> want

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
thought well it's that's not what I want

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.630 
thought well it's that's not what I want
so<00:01:45.850> I<00:01:45.880> didn't<00:01:46.119> really<00:01:46.299> get<00:01:46.420> that<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:48.280> I'm<00:01:48.460> going

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
so I didn't really get that so I'm going

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.039 
so I didn't really get that so I'm going
to<00:01:48.729> experience<00:01:49.149> this<00:01:49.329> this<00:01:49.630> thing<00:01:49.869> should

like miserable or like that but
yesterday<00:02:29.950> my<00:02:30.180> studio<00:02:31.180> was<00:02:31.360> like<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:32.160> think<00:02:33.160> it

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
yesterday my studio was like I think it

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.670 
yesterday my studio was like I think it
was<00:02:33.370> 90<00:02:33.940> or<00:02:34.060> 80<00:02:34.090> 80<00:02:34.750> sub<00:02:35.140> maybe<00:02:35.349> but<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.650> think

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
was 90 or 80 80 sub maybe but I think

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.830 
was 90 or 80 80 sub maybe but I think

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
was I think was actually 90 over 90

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.520 
was I think was actually 90 over 90
degrees<00:02:41.590> hot<00:02:42.900> but<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.019> know<00:02:44.139> open<00:02:44.440> up

degrees hot but you know open up

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.089 
degrees hot but you know open up
a<00:02:44.650> window<00:02:44.769> it<00:02:45.160> gets<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.459> lot<00:02:45.609> cooler

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
a window it gets a lot cooler

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:59.839 
a window it gets a lot cooler
it's<00:02:47.969> okay<00:02:48.540> well<00:02:49.170> anyway<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:58.140> sword<00:02:58.849> that

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
it's okay well anyway the sword that

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.500 
it's okay well anyway the sword that
thing<00:03:01.280> okay<00:03:02.280> well<00:03:02.760> anyway<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.269> going<00:03:06.450> to

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
thing okay well anyway that is going to

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.470 
thing okay well anyway that is going to
go<00:03:06.629> on<00:03:06.750> top<00:03:06.959> of<00:03:07.140> this<00:03:07.319> and<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.909> is<00:03:08.970> gonna<00:03:09.209> be<00:03:09.450> a

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
go on top of this and this is gonna be a

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.949 
go on top of this and this is gonna be a
really<00:03:09.720> nice<00:03:10.019> table<00:03:11.209> I'm<00:03:12.209> getting<00:03:12.689> a<00:03:12.780> little

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
really nice table I'm getting a little

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.199 
really nice table I'm getting a little
excited<00:03:13.109> about<00:03:13.769> this<00:03:14.010> table<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.670> it's<00:03:14.939> just

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
excited about this table and it's just

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.869 
excited about this table and it's just
gonna<00:03:15.359> be<00:03:15.739> so<00:03:16.739> much<00:03:16.889> fun<00:03:17.129> to<00:03:17.250> have<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.430> table

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
gonna be so much fun to have a table

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.349 
gonna be so much fun to have a table
like<00:03:18.030> this<00:03:19.280> let's<00:03:20.280> see<00:03:20.400> if<00:03:20.459> I<00:03:20.519> can<00:03:20.670> demonstrate

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
like this let's see if I can demonstrate

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:32.440 
like this let's see if I can demonstrate
it<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.930> little<00:03:22.079> bit<00:03:22.260> better<00:03:22.470> for<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:22.920> anyway

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:45.480 

that

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.790 

so<00:03:46.490> there's<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.819> table<00:03:47.270> and<00:03:47.660> that<00:03:48.170> this<00:03:48.470> bar

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
so there's the table and that this bar

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.890 
so there's the table and that this bar
right<00:03:49.010> here<00:03:49.040> goes<00:03:49.550> up<00:03:49.850> to<00:03:50.390> take<00:03:50.569> the<00:03:50.690> place<00:03:50.870> of

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
right here goes up to take the place of

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.260 
right here goes up to take the place of
those<00:03:51.310> muffin<00:03:52.310> pans<00:03:52.580> which<00:03:52.850> I<00:03:52.970> think<00:03:53.150> maybe

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
those muffin pans which I think maybe

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.970 
those muffin pans which I think maybe
I'll<00:03:53.450> just<00:03:53.569> leave<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:54.020> like<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.680> muffin

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
I'll just leave it I like the muffin

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.010 
I'll just leave it I like the muffin
pans<00:03:55.160> better<00:03:55.400> but<00:03:56.270> anyway<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.569> can<00:03:56.630> see<00:03:56.900> the

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
pans better but anyway you can see the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.440 
pans better but anyway you can see the
nice<00:03:57.170> angle<00:03:57.530> of<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:57.740> table<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:58.400> so<00:03:59.180> that's

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
nice angle of the table and so that's

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.050 
nice angle of the table and so that's
going<00:03:59.630> to<00:03:59.690> be<00:03:59.840> my<00:03:59.990> work<00:04:00.200> surface<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.790> I'll<00:04:01.940> be

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
going to be my work surface and I'll be

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.270 
going to be my work surface and I'll be
doing<00:04:02.420> that<00:04:03.760> but<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:06.440> surface<00:04:06.650> this

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
doing that but the the surface this

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.380 
doing that but the the surface this
surface<00:04:07.459> is<00:04:07.820> a<00:04:07.850> little<00:04:07.940> bit<00:04:08.240> small<00:04:08.630> and<00:04:08.990> it's

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
surface is a little bit small and it's

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.530 
surface is a little bit small and it's
it's<00:04:11.390> got<00:04:11.720> all<00:04:11.989> of<00:04:12.140> these<00:04:12.880> it's<00:04:13.880> it's<00:04:14.270> one<00:04:14.450> of

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
it's got all of these it's it's one of

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.060 
it's got all of these it's it's one of
those<00:04:14.660> it's<00:04:14.930> a<00:04:15.080> it's<00:04:15.350> something<00:04:15.680> that's<00:04:15.860> I

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
those it's a it's something that's I

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.530 
those it's a it's something that's I
think<00:04:16.130> it's<00:04:16.370> made<00:04:16.489> out<00:04:16.640> of<00:04:16.700> particle<00:04:17.239> board

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
think it's made out of particle board

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.449 
think it's made out of particle board
covered<00:04:18.019> with<00:04:18.169> something<00:04:18.500> and<00:04:18.650> moisture<00:04:19.310> got

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
covered with something and moisture got

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.460 
covered with something and moisture got
in<00:04:19.579> there<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:19.760> it<00:04:19.820> bubbled<00:04:20.209> it<00:04:20.269> up<00:04:20.390> kind<00:04:20.660> of<00:04:20.750> so

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
in there and it bubbled it up kind of so

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.240 
in there and it bubbled it up kind of so
it's<00:04:21.590> not<00:04:21.739> flat<00:04:22.040> so<00:04:23.440> once<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.620> cart<00:04:24.860> once<00:04:25.070> the

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
it's not flat so once the cart once the

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.870 
it's not flat so once the cart once the
plywood<00:04:25.940> outside<00:04:26.330> is<00:04:26.510> dry<00:04:26.810> and<00:04:27.260> if<00:04:28.070> it's<00:04:28.280> if

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
plywood outside is dry and if it's if

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.510 
plywood outside is dry and if it's if
it's<00:04:29.090> it<00:04:29.930> should<00:04:30.140> be<00:04:30.200> fine<00:04:30.620> I<00:04:30.890> mean<00:04:31.160> it<00:04:31.430> was

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
it's it should be fine I mean it was

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.880 
it's it should be fine I mean it was
almost<00:04:31.760> fine<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.660> way<00:04:32.780> it<00:04:32.900> was<00:04:33.080> but<00:04:33.440> it's<00:04:33.650> I

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
almost fine the way it was but it's I

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.000 
almost fine the way it was but it's I
was<00:04:34.490> getting<00:04:34.700> a<00:04:34.730> little<00:04:34.970> anal<00:04:35.180> with<00:04:35.480> it<00:04:35.660> so

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
was getting a little anal with it so

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.830 
was getting a little anal with it so
hopefully<00:04:37.010> that'll<00:04:37.190> work<00:04:37.370> out<00:04:37.640> and<00:04:37.880> I'll<00:04:38.540> put

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
hopefully that'll work out and I'll put

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.120 
hopefully that'll work out and I'll put
that<00:04:38.960> on<00:04:39.020> there<00:04:39.320> and<00:04:39.440> I'll<00:04:39.560> have<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.740> perfect

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
that on there and I'll have a perfect

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.510 
that on there and I'll have a perfect
surface<00:04:40.370> for<00:04:40.700> my<00:04:40.850> for<00:04:41.390> my<00:04:41.540> work<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:42.400> it'll<00:04:43.400> be

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
surface for my for my work and it'll be

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.780 
surface for my for my work and it'll be
full<00:04:43.850> speed<00:04:44.120> ahead<00:04:45.160> okay<00:04:46.160> I'm<00:04:46.370> not<00:04:46.490> a<00:04:46.550> rowdy
