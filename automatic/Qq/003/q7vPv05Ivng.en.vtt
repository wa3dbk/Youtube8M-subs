00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
my natural eyebrow and I think in time I

off<00:00:54.449> with<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.020> am<00:00:55.260> using<00:00:55.559> wet<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.370> wild<00:00:56.579> Arcon

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
off with I am using wet and wild Arcon

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.590 
off with I am using wet and wild Arcon
in<00:00:57.629> milk<00:00:58.140> brown<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:59.129> really<00:00:59.670> just<00:00:59.879> outlined<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
in milk brown I really just outlined the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.840 
in milk brown I really just outlined the
shape<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.289> first<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:04.280> then<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.400> create<00:01:05.700> an

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
shape of it first and then I create an

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.920 
shape of it first and then I create an
arch<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:07.640> then<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:08.939> pull<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.330> down<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.720> it

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
arch and then I just pull it down and it

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.350 
arch and then I just pull it down and it
looks<00:01:10.170> weird<00:01:10.470> right<00:01:10.619> now<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.890> look<00:01:11.189> funky<00:01:11.430> but

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
looks weird right now I look funky but

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.560 
looks weird right now I look funky but
it's<00:01:12.510> okay<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.110> then<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.439> just

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.510 

basically<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.530> whole<00:01:18.680> point<00:01:18.740> is<00:01:19.250> that<00:01:19.280> I

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
basically the whole point is that I

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.090 
basically the whole point is that I
outlined<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:20.420> natural<00:01:20.900> shape<00:01:21.170> of<00:01:21.410> my<00:01:21.620> eyebrow

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
outlined the natural shape of my eyebrow

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.230 
outlined the natural shape of my eyebrow
and<00:01:23.200> then<00:01:24.200> I<00:01:24.290> connect<00:01:24.650> it<00:01:24.740> at<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.070> end<00:01:25.240> and

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
and then I connect it at the end and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:37.310 
and then I connect it at the end and
then<00:01:26.360> I<00:01:26.450> fill<00:01:26.630> it<00:01:26.750> in

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.320 

then<00:01:38.320> I<00:01:38.350> take<00:01:38.650> a<00:01:38.830> spoolie<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:39.880> then<00:01:40.030> I<00:01:40.120> just

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
then I take a spoolie and then I just

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:56.370 
then I take a spoolie and then I just
brush<00:01:40.510> off<00:01:40.660> the<00:01:40.750> color

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.740 

after<00:01:57.380> I've<00:01:57.530> done<00:01:57.560> that<00:01:58.520> with<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.210> eyebrow

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
after I've done that with the eyebrow

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.370 
after I've done that with the eyebrow
pencil<00:02:00.380> I<00:02:00.620> then<00:02:01.220> take<00:02:01.670> what<00:02:02.300> usually<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:02.990> lot<00:02:03.350> of

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
pencil I then take what usually a lot of

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.980 
pencil I then take what usually a lot of
people<00:02:03.830> would<00:02:04.040> use<00:02:04.450> concealer<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:05.630> whatnot

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
people would use concealer and whatnot

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.469 
people would use concealer and whatnot
but<00:02:06.170> I<00:02:06.470> just<00:02:06.740> used<00:02:07.010> my<00:02:07.130> old<00:02:07.430> foundation<00:02:08.149> that<00:02:08.450> I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
onto my finger and I take an angled

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.110 
onto my finger and I take an angled
brush<00:02:19.400> like<00:02:19.850> this<00:02:20.570> one<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:22.450> just<00:02:23.530> dab<00:02:24.530> it<00:02:24.680> on<00:02:24.860> and

the whole purpose of this is just to

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:48.319 
the whole purpose of this is just to
make<00:02:44.489> it<00:02:44.519> more<00:02:45.090> define<00:02:46.489> but<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.730> really<00:02:48.150> don't
