document class and inside of that we use

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.980 
document class and inside of that we use
the<00:01:10.080> write<00:01:10.320> method<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.390> inside<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.540> we

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
the write method and inside of that we

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.590 
the write method and inside of that we
enter<00:01:13.680> quotes<00:01:14.010> close<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.939> off<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.450> in

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
enter quotes close this off and in

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.810 
enter quotes close this off and in
between<00:01:15.780> these<00:01:16.110> quotes<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:17.100> put<00:01:17.340> whatever<00:01:17.580> we

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
between these quotes we put whatever we

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
inside here as you can see my first

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.530 
inside here as you can see my first
program<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.350> JavaScript<00:01:55.759> my<00:01:56.759> first<00:01:57.090> program

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
program in JavaScript my first program

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.020 
program in JavaScript my first program
in<00:01:57.840> JavaScript<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.649> basically<00:01:59.610> that<00:02:00.000> just

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
in JavaScript so basically that just

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.200 
in JavaScript so basically that just
wrote<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.990> page<00:02:01.229> willy-nilly

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
wrote that to the page willy-nilly

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.730 
wrote that to the page willy-nilly
another<00:02:03.210> cool<00:02:03.509> thing<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.140> do<00:02:04.469> with

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
another cool thing that you can do with

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.890 
another cool thing that you can do with
this<00:02:04.950> write<00:02:05.369> method<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.450> can

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
this write method is you can

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.280 
this write method is you can
put<00:02:07.320> HTML<00:02:07.500> element<00:02:08.400> inside<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.790> it<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.290> for

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
put HTML element inside of it so for

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.410 
put HTML element inside of it so for
example<00:02:10.680> if<00:02:10.770> we<00:02:10.890> wanted<00:02:11.130> two<00:02:11.340> lines<00:02:11.610> we<00:02:12.240> would

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
example if we wanted two lines we would

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.360 
example if we wanted two lines we would
