some of the best gloves that I've ever
even<00:00:29.099> tried<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:30.449> I'm<00:00:30.660> comparing<00:00:31.019> pretty

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
even tried on and I'm comparing pretty

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.950

much all the gloves that I tried on that
tried<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> lot<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.469> different<00:00:34.590> gloves<00:00:35.070> even<00:00:35.280> the

tried a lot of different gloves even the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.280 
tried a lot of different gloves even the
winnings<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.210> mean<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> think<00:00:36.750> these<00:00:36.899> girls

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
winnings I mean I think these girls

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.920 
winnings I mean I think these girls
really<00:00:37.559> do<00:00:37.890> fit<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> glove<00:00:38.660> they<00:00:39.660> feel

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
really do fit like a glove they feel

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.569 
really do fit like a glove they feel
great<00:00:42.170> my<00:00:43.170> problem<00:00:43.590> with<00:00:43.680> these<00:00:43.829> gloves<00:00:44.190> I

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
great my problem with these gloves I

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.119 
great my problem with these gloves I
think<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.140> they're<00:00:46.649> pretty

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
think that it's it's a they're pretty

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.470 
think that it's it's a they're pretty
cheaply<00:00:47.460> made<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.000> even<00:00:48.180> though<00:00:48.270> they<00:00:48.420> don't

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
cheaply made and even though they don't

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.020 
cheaply made and even though they don't
look<00:00:48.780> like<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.289> from<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:50.460> know<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.760> video<00:00:51.000> I

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
look like it from you know the video I

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.959 
look like it from you know the video I
guess<00:00:51.199> but<00:00:52.199> when<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.250> look<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.640> them<00:00:53.789> you'll

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
guess but when you look at them you'll

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.060 
guess but when you look at them you'll
be<00:00:54.090> able<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.449> see<00:00:54.719> for<00:00:55.140> example<00:00:55.230> I'll<00:00:55.739> kind<00:00:55.980> of

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
be able to see for example I'll kind of

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.709 
be able to see for example I'll kind of
bring<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.579> up<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> stitching

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
bring you up and you see the stitching

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.709 
bring you up and you see the stitching
it's<00:00:58.140> already<00:00:58.760> starting<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.789> fall<00:01:00.030> apart

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
it's already starting to fall apart

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.660 
it's already starting to fall apart
I<00:01:00.780> think<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> stitching<00:01:01.920> isn't<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.370> great<00:01:02.609> I

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
I think the stitching isn't that great I

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.979 
I think the stitching isn't that great I
think<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> paint<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.390> going<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> start<00:01:03.870> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
think the paint is going to start to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.539 
think the paint is going to start to
chip<00:01:04.229> pretty<00:01:04.530> fast<00:01:05.390> you<00:01:06.390> know<00:01:06.890> what<00:01:07.890> else<00:01:08.040> does

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
chip pretty fast you know what else does

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.140 
chip pretty fast you know what else does
not<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:09.000> much<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.479> cooling<00:01:09.979> you<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.150> type

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
not that much of a cooling you know type

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.910 
not that much of a cooling you know type
of<00:01:12.180> material<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.229> they<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.409> get<00:01:13.740> pretty

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
of material here so they do get pretty

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.190 
of material here so they do get pretty
warm<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.729> FASTA<00:01:15.060> compared<00:01:15.450> these<00:01:15.659> gloves<00:01:15.960> I

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
warm the FASTA compared these gloves I

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.950 
warm the FASTA compared these gloves I
would<00:01:16.350> compare<00:01:16.740> them<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.240> IMF<00:01:18.240> tech<00:01:18.479> ringside

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
would compare them to IMF tech ringside

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.929 
would compare them to IMF tech ringside
gloves<00:01:19.290> or<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.619> would<00:01:20.070> compare<00:01:20.369> if<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.790> could

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
gloves or I would compare if you could

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.149 
gloves or I would compare if you could
combine<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.420> IMF<00:01:21.990> tag<00:01:22.229> gloves<00:01:22.560> from<00:01:22.860> ringside

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
combine the IMF tag gloves from ringside

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.609 
combine the IMF tag gloves from ringside
with<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.119> Everlast<00:01:24.540> foreign<00:01:25.020> glows<00:01:25.229> more<00:01:25.530> or

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
with the Everlast foreign glows more or

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.780 
with the Everlast foreign glows more or
less<00:01:25.740> you've<00:01:26.009> probably<00:01:26.310> come<00:01:26.549> up<00:01:26.610> with

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
less you've probably come up with

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.179 
less you've probably come up with
something<00:01:27.000> like<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.350> still<00:01:28.979> love

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
something like this but I I still love

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.370 
something like this but I I still love
these<00:01:29.400> gloves<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.000> think<00:01:30.270> they're<00:01:30.479> one<00:01:31.259> of

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
these gloves and I think they're one of

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.780 
these gloves and I think they're one of
the<00:01:31.439> most<00:01:31.619> comfortable<00:01:32.070> gloves<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.579> could

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
the most comfortable gloves you could

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.390 
the most comfortable gloves you could
wear<00:01:33.390> they're<00:01:33.659> pretty<00:01:34.560> light<00:01:34.829> even<00:01:35.310> though

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
wear they're pretty light even though

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.620 
wear they're pretty light even though
they<00:01:35.520> don't<00:01:35.640> look<00:01:35.790> like<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.299> looks<00:01:36.450> sort

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
they don't look like that it looks sort

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.469 
they don't look like that it looks sort
of<00:01:36.720> both<00:01:36.900> him<00:01:37.880> great<00:01:38.880> padding<00:01:39.270> for<00:01:39.420> the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
think that the only drawback to them I

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.730 
think that the only drawback to them I
wish<00:02:25.510> they<00:02:25.660> were<00:02:25.780> just<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.140> little<00:02:26.320> bit<00:02:26.530> better

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
wish they were just a little bit better

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.220 
wish they were just a little bit better
made<00:02:27.100> again<00:02:28.060> I'm<00:02:28.240> going<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.480> show<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.750> what<00:02:29.200> I

made again I'm going to show you what I

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.410 
made again I'm going to show you what I
mean<00:02:29.530> here<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:32.410> know<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.490> material<00:02:34.060> is<00:02:34.270> still

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
mean here you know the material is still

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.940 
mean here you know the material is still
leather<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.020> think<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.410> there<00:02:35.590> will<00:02:35.680> last

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
leather and I think that there will last

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.880 
leather and I think that there will last
but<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.700> just<00:02:37.150> don't<00:02:37.690> think<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.470> last<00:02:38.680> for

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
but I I just don't think the last for

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.850 
but I I just don't think the last for
too<00:02:39.070> long<00:02:39.840> that's<00:02:40.840> about<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.200> only<00:02:41.230> drawback

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
too long that's about the only drawback

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.160 
too long that's about the only drawback
but<00:02:42.520> I<00:02:42.580> still<00:02:42.970> love<00:02:43.300> these<00:02:43.540> gloves<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:44.140> bought

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
but I still love these gloves I bought

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.670 
but I still love these gloves I bought
them<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.100> think<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:45.610> they're<00:02:45.820> great

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
them and I think that they're great

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.360 
them and I think that they're great
definitely<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.800> looking<00:02:48.010> for<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.190> comfortable

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
definitely to looking for a comfortable

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.400 
definitely to looking for a comfortable
rug<00:02:48.730> this<00:02:48.880> is<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.240> but<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:49.900> don't<00:02:49.960> think<00:02:50.080> this<00:02:50.260> is

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
rug this is it but I don't think this is

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.900 
rug this is it but I don't think this is
a<00:02:50.440> quality<00:02:50.950> glove<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.400> don't<00:02:51.460> think<00:02:51.580> this

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
a quality glove and I don't think this

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.930 
a quality glove and I don't think this
will<00:02:52.120> last<00:02:52.240> so<00:02:52.600> I'm<00:02:53.380> going<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.590> give<00:02:53.709> these

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
will last so I'm going to give these

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.940 
will last so I'm going to give these
four<00:02:54.940> stars<00:02:55.300> just<00:02:55.870> because<00:02:56.140> I<00:02:56.170> think<00:02:56.709> that

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
four stars just because I think that

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.920 
four stars just because I think that
these<00:02:57.160> gloves<00:02:57.520> are<00:02:57.850> awesome<00:02:58.390> as<00:02:58.570> far<00:02:58.900> as

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
these gloves are awesome as far as

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.890 
these gloves are awesome as far as
feeling<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.740> just<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.160> way<00:03:00.280> they<00:03:00.459> are<00:03:00.900> but

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
feeling and just the way they are but

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.210 
feeling and just the way they are but
really<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:02.320> think<00:03:02.410> I'm<00:03:02.740> three<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.040> half

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
really I think I'm three and a half

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.570 
really I think I'm three and a half
because<00:03:03.520> of<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:05.530> quality<00:03:05.950> other<00:03:06.190> than<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.550> I

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
because of the quality other than that I

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.970 
because of the quality other than that I
think<00:03:06.730> they're<00:03:07.030> great<00:03:07.150> gloves<00:03:07.830> probably<00:03:08.830> some
