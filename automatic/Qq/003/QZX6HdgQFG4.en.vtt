taking that out and then the volume I
believe<00:01:38.369> then<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:40.159> Wi-Fi<00:01:41.159> switch

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
believe then we have the Wi-Fi switch

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.749 
believe then we have the Wi-Fi switch
which<00:01:42.030> doesn't<00:01:42.329> seem<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.600> work<00:01:43.759> you're

usually I end up liking them better than

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.589 
usually I end up liking them better than
the<00:02:08.129> ones<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.399> get<00:02:08.550> at<00:02:08.670> stores<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.300> usually

the ones I get at stores and usually

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.410 
the ones I get at stores and usually
they<00:02:09.840> are<00:02:09.989> really<00:02:10.259> cheap<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.340> haven't<00:02:11.700> had

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
they are really cheap so I haven't had

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.150 
they are really cheap so I haven't had
any<00:02:12.569> bad<00:02:12.750> luck<00:02:12.780> as<00:02:13.170> far<00:02:13.200> as<00:02:13.410> accessories<00:02:13.950> go

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
any bad luck as far as accessories go

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.430 
any bad luck as far as accessories go
one<00:02:15.120> time<00:02:15.269> I<00:02:15.300> did<00:02:15.510> order<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.780> game<00:02:16.080> from<00:02:16.290> them

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
one time I did order a game from them

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.690 
one time I did order a game from them
and<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.650> was<00:02:16.739> bootleg<00:02:17.160> which<00:02:17.340> kind<00:02:17.610> of

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
and it was bootleg which kind of

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.170 
and it was bootleg which kind of
expected<00:02:18.239> but<00:02:18.450> other<00:02:18.900> than<00:02:19.019> that<00:02:20.000> next<00:02:21.000> I'm

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
expected but other than that next I'm

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.809 
expected but other than that next I'm

Hindu<00:02:24.260> 3d<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.290> guess<00:02:25.830> this<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.130> like<00:02:26.280> an

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
Hindu 3d I guess this is like an

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.800 
Hindu 3d I guess this is like an
official<00:02:28.640> inserts<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.849> cover<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.540> screen

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
official inserts that cover the screen

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.250 
official inserts that cover the screen
for<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.260> top<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.459> bottom<00:02:32.940> screens<00:02:36.080> look<00:02:37.080> kind

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
for the top and bottom screens look kind

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.839 
for the top and bottom screens look kind
of<00:02:37.349> complicated<00:02:37.890> when<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.370> was<00:02:38.459> watching<00:02:38.580> a

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
of complicated when I was watching a

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.600 
of complicated when I was watching a
video<00:02:39.030> for<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.630> but<00:02:39.980> hopefully<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.250> get<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.519> on

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
video for it but hopefully I get it on

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.100 
video for it but hopefully I get it on
there<00:02:41.790> definitely<00:02:42.239> not<00:02:42.360> gonna<00:02:42.450> film<00:02:42.780> myself

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
there definitely not gonna film myself

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.930 
there definitely not gonna film myself
putting<00:02:43.349> this<00:02:43.530> thing<00:02:43.709> on<00:02:43.860> because<00:02:44.280> it'll

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
putting this thing on because it'll

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.729 
putting this thing on because it'll
probably<00:02:44.970> take<00:02:45.450> me<00:02:45.480> forever<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.989> get<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.290> right

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
probably take me forever to get it right

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.350 
probably take me forever to get it right
hopefully<00:02:47.489> I<00:02:47.579> doesn't<00:02:47.880> get<00:02:47.970> on<00:02:48.060> there<00:02:48.269> all

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360

and under the protectors they actually
bond<00:03:10.889> really<00:03:11.190> nicely<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:12.600> don't<00:03:12.900> know<00:03:12.959> exactly

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
bond really nicely I don't know exactly

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.629 
bond really nicely I don't know exactly
how<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:13.410> describe<00:03:13.709> it<00:03:13.889> but<00:03:13.950> I'll<00:03:14.160> put<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.400> link

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
how to describe it but I'll put a link

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:15.979 
how to describe it but I'll put a link
in<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:14.910> description<00:03:15.359> that<00:03:15.389> shows<00:03:15.569> how<00:03:15.870> these

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
in the description that shows how these

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.110 
in the description that shows how these
things<00:03:16.200> go<00:03:16.470> on<00:03:16.500> but<00:03:16.829> they<00:03:16.950> kind<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:17.880> use<00:03:18.030> this

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
things go on but they kind of use this

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.390 
things go on but they kind of use this
weird<00:03:18.389> system<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.380> uh<00:03:19.410> actually<00:03:20.069> helps<00:03:20.280> you

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
weird system that uh actually helps you

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.809 
weird system that uh actually helps you
line<00:03:21.359> the<00:03:21.540> things<00:03:21.750> up<00:03:22.310> it's<00:03:23.310> pretty<00:03:23.549> foolproof

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
line the things up it's pretty foolproof

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.150 
line the things up it's pretty foolproof
you<00:03:24.239> just<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.630> put<00:03:24.840> them<00:03:24.989> out<00:03:25.109> against<00:03:26.010> the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
you just you put them out against the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.759 
you just you put them out against the
EDS<00:03:26.639> and<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:26.970> pull<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.480> strips<00:03:27.750> away<00:03:27.900> and<00:03:28.680> it

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
EDS and you pull the strips away and it

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.229 
EDS and you pull the strips away and it
ends<00:03:28.980> up<00:03:29.040> lining<00:03:29.250> up<00:03:29.430> perfectly<00:03:29.850> so<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.090> don't

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
ends up lining up perfectly so you don't

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.580 
ends up lining up perfectly so you don't
have<00:03:30.329> to<00:03:30.450> worry<00:03:30.600> about<00:03:30.720> putting<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.260> on<00:03:31.350> wrong

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
have to worry about putting it on wrong

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.890 
have to worry about putting it on wrong
and<00:03:31.739> yanking<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.160> off<00:03:32.450> so<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.480> went<00:03:33.810> pretty

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
and yanking it off so that went pretty

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.770 
and yanking it off so that went pretty
well<00:03:34.049> um<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:35.400> guess<00:03:36.000> that's<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.359> for<00:03:36.420> this<00:03:36.630> video

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
well um I guess that's it for this video

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.059 
well um I guess that's it for this video
I<00:03:37.109> got<00:03:37.350> my<00:03:37.530> screen<00:03:38.250> protectors<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:39.090> buy

the<00:03:46.049> description<00:03:46.410> where<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.560> got<00:03:46.709> them<00:03:46.769> from

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
the description where I got them from

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.300 
the description where I got them from
drop<00:03:47.760> my<00:03:47.850> camera<00:03:47.970> they<00:03:48.900> were<00:03:49.019> about<00:03:49.319> a<00:03:49.380> 16

drop my camera they were about a 16
dollars<00:03:50.639> altogether<00:03:51.359> so<00:03:52.019> I<00:03:52.049> think<00:03:52.200> that's

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
dollars altogether so I think that's

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.170 
dollars altogether so I think that's
pretty<00:03:52.620> good<00:03:52.739> if<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.069> remember<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.370> I<00:03:53.459> think<00:03:54.000> just

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
pretty good if I remember I I think just

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.910 
pretty good if I remember I I think just
