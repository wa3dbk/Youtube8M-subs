00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:11.889 
video today we're going to go over the

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.669 
video today we're going to go over the
pull<00:00:12.130> through<00:00:12.490> this<00:00:13.360> is<00:00:13.480> an<00:00:13.660> exercise<00:00:14.469> I<00:00:14.650> think

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:14.679 
pull through this is an exercise I think

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.640 
pull through this is an exercise I think
is<00:00:14.950> great<00:00:15.160> for<00:00:15.400> building<00:00:15.730> your<00:00:15.790> deadlift

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
is great for building your deadlift

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.960 
is great for building your deadlift
there's<00:00:17.650> some<00:00:17.860> carryover<00:00:18.310> in<00:00:18.400> the<00:00:18.490> squat<00:00:18.759> but

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
there's some carryover in the squat but

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.939 
there's some carryover in the squat but
I<00:00:19.060> think<00:00:19.270> deadlift<00:00:19.660> in<00:00:19.750> particular<00:00:20.380> you've

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
I think deadlift in particular you've

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.980 
I think deadlift in particular you've
got<00:00:21.070> a<00:00:21.100> big<00:00:21.730> carryover<00:00:22.510> from<00:00:22.600> doing<00:00:22.869> these

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
got a big carryover from doing these

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.260 
got a big carryover from doing these
properly<00:00:23.410> I<00:00:23.650> see<00:00:24.490> a<00:00:24.520> lot<00:00:24.760> of<00:00:24.820> people<00:00:25.000> do<00:00:25.119> these

deadlift a lot of the same principles go
onto<00:00:32.619> the<00:00:32.860> pull<00:00:33.070> through<00:00:33.309> and<00:00:33.489> doing<00:00:33.610> that

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
wrong all the time so I want to kind of

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.150 
wrong all the time so I want to kind of
go<00:00:37.420> through<00:00:37.450> the<00:00:37.660> pull<00:00:37.870> through<00:00:38.110> because<00:00:38.980> some

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
go through the pull through because some

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.740 
go through the pull through because some
of<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.309> comments<00:00:39.910> said<00:00:40.120> you<00:00:40.239> know<00:00:40.360> how<00:00:40.510> can<00:00:40.690> I

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
of the comments said you know how can I

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.750 
of the comments said you know how can I
think<00:00:41.020> some<00:00:41.200> things<00:00:41.469> and<00:00:42.160> I<00:00:42.280> think<00:00:42.520> the<00:00:42.579> pull

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
think some things and I think the pull

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.069 
think some things and I think the pull
through<00:00:42.969> is<00:00:43.059> one<00:00:43.270> of<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:43.420> biggest<00:00:43.719> ways<00:00:43.870> to

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
through is one of the biggest ways to

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.220 
through is one of the biggest ways to
help<00:00:44.200> stop<00:00:44.980> lockout<00:00:45.579> and<00:00:45.850> do<00:00:46.660> better<00:00:46.870> at<00:00:47.079> that

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
help stop lockout and do better at that

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.170 
help stop lockout and do better at that
pattern<00:00:47.469> of<00:00:47.860> squeezing<00:00:48.640> glutes<00:00:48.850> through<00:00:49.090> at

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
pattern of squeezing glutes through at

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.119 
pattern of squeezing glutes through at
the<00:00:49.300> top<00:00:49.480> so<00:00:50.289> a<00:00:50.320> couple<00:00:50.590> different<00:00:50.829> ways<00:00:50.890> we

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
the top so a couple different ways we

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.130 
the top so a couple different ways we
can<00:00:51.280> do<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.489> pull<00:00:51.670> through<00:00:51.969> if<00:00:52.600> one<00:00:52.809> work<00:00:52.989> on

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
can do the pull through if one work on

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.619 
can do the pull through if one work on
lower<00:00:53.649> back<00:00:53.890> strength<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.610> doing<00:00:54.879> a<00:00:54.969> stiff<00:00:55.329> leg

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
lower back strength to doing a stiff leg

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.560 
lower back strength to doing a stiff leg
pull<00:00:56.320> through<00:00:56.710> it's<00:00:57.550> great<00:00:58.000> for<00:00:58.300> the<00:00:58.390> lower

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
pull through it's great for the lower

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.350 
pull through it's great for the lower
back<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:59.410> finish<00:00:59.770> is<00:00:59.800> still<00:01:00.160> the<00:01:00.309> same<00:01:00.579> as<00:01:00.879> in

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
back the finish is still the same as in

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.139 
back the finish is still the same as in
the<00:01:01.539> bent<00:01:01.840> leg<00:01:01.960> pull<00:01:02.440> through<00:01:02.800> but<00:01:03.460> the

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
the bent leg pull through but the

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.330 
the bent leg pull through but the
emphasis<00:01:04.420> on<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.229> bent<00:01:05.440> leg<00:01:05.500> pull<00:01:05.890> through<00:01:06.160> is

emphasis on the bent leg pull through is

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.940 
emphasis on the bent leg pull through is
much<00:01:06.820> more<00:01:07.149> on<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.630> hamstrings<00:01:08.350> pulling

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.429 
lift is really good for that both of
them<00:01:30.700> however<00:01:30.909> are<00:01:31.299> great<00:01:31.630> for<00:01:31.869> the<00:01:31.960> lockout

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
your glutes you can also do this with a

your glutes you can also do this with a
wide<00:01:40.270> stance<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:41.590> can<00:01:41.770> do<00:01:41.950> it<00:01:42.070> with<00:01:42.189> a<00:01:42.220> closed

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.649 
stance so depending on what kind of
puller<00:01:44.680> you<00:01:44.979> are<00:01:45.159> you<00:01:45.640> can<00:01:45.850> modify<00:01:46.299> your

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
puller you are you can modify your

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.499 
puller you are you can modify your
stance<00:01:47.020> a<00:01:47.350> closer<00:01:48.310> stance<00:01:48.820> with<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.149> stiff

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
stance a closer stance with the stiff

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.310 
stance a closer stance with the stiff
leg<00:01:49.780> really<00:01:50.560> hits<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:51.100> low<00:01:51.280> back<00:01:51.490> super<00:01:51.939> hard

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
leg really hits that low back super hard

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.499 
leg really hits that low back super hard
if<00:01:53.320> you<00:01:53.619> go<00:01:53.770> wide<00:01:54.100> stance<00:01:54.579> with<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.149> bent<00:01:55.420> leg

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
if you go wide stance with the bent leg

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.660 
if you go wide stance with the bent leg
it's<00:01:55.840> better<00:01:56.049> for<00:01:56.380> some<00:01:56.710> of<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:56.860> sumo<00:01:57.220> pullers

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
it's better for some of the sumo pullers

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.209 
it's better for some of the sumo pullers
so<00:01:57.939> you<00:01:58.450> can<00:01:58.600> modify<00:01:58.960> it<00:01:59.170> you<00:01:59.439> can<00:01:59.590> do<00:01:59.770> bent<00:02:00.009> leg

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
so you can modify it you can do bent leg

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.459 
so you can modify it you can do bent leg
close<00:02:00.549> if<00:02:00.790> you<00:02:00.939> if<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.240> want<00:02:01.509> this<00:02:01.960> is<00:02:02.200> still

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
close if you if you want this is still

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.920 
close if you if you want this is still
great<00:02:02.740> for<00:02:03.100> conventional<00:02:03.700> pullers<00:02:04.119> but

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
great for conventional pullers but

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.620 
great for conventional pullers but
modify<00:02:05.439> your<00:02:05.649> stance<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.369> your<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:07.450> your

them almost perfectly straight when we

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.550 
them almost perfectly straight when we
go<00:02:43.370> down<00:02:43.580> we<00:02:43.910> can<00:02:44.090> use<00:02:44.300> a<00:02:44.330> wide<00:02:44.660> stance<00:02:45.080> if<00:02:45.410> we

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
go down we can use a wide stance if we

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.820 
go down we can use a wide stance if we
want<00:02:45.830> we<00:02:46.790> can<00:02:46.910> use<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.150> closed<00:02:47.480> stance<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:48.080> prefer

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
want we can use a closed stance I prefer

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.410 
want we can use a closed stance I prefer
using<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.160> closed<00:02:49.370> stance<00:02:49.670> hence<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.060> low<00:02:50.210> back

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
using a closed stance hence the low back

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.230 
using a closed stance hence the low back
more<00:02:50.780> so<00:02:51.560> as<00:02:51.680> we<00:02:51.770> go<00:02:51.920> through<00:02:51.950> we<00:02:52.700> let<00:02:52.850> our<00:02:52.970> arms

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
more so as we go through we let our arms

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.390 
more so as we go through we let our arms
hang<00:02:53.510> we<00:02:54.230> don't<00:02:54.410> pull<00:02:54.650> with<00:02:54.800> our<00:02:54.950> arms<00:02:55.130> at<00:02:55.280> all

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
hang we don't pull with our arms at all

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.570 
hang we don't pull with our arms at all
we<00:02:56.240> let<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.510> pull<00:02:56.750> us<00:02:56.870> through<00:02:56.950> until<00:02:57.950> we're

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
we let it pull us through until we're

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.920 
we let it pull us through until we're
basically<00:02:58.850> pulled<00:02:59.240> through<00:02:59.420> as<00:02:59.510> far<00:02:59.750> as<00:02:59.840> we

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
basically pulled through as far as we

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.560 
basically pulled through as far as we
can<00:03:00.220> then<00:03:01.220> when<00:03:01.340> we<00:03:01.430> come<00:03:01.610> up<00:03:01.670> we<00:03:02.060> keep<00:03:02.210> our<00:03:02.390> leg

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
can then when we come up we keep our leg

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.280 
can then when we come up we keep our leg
straight<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:04.250> we<00:03:04.400> squeeze<00:03:05.240> that<00:03:05.450> bond<00:03:05.930> you

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290
