00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
what i liked about his finishing and

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.120 
what i liked about his finishing and
he's<00:02:08.899> very<00:02:08.930> acrobatic<00:02:09.350> as<00:02:09.770> well<00:02:09.920> it's<00:02:10.070> quite

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
he's very acrobatic as well it's quite

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.460 
he's very acrobatic as well it's quite
at<00:02:10.280> least<00:02:10.459> two<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.729> three<00:02:10.759> acrobatic<00:02:11.540> gold<00:02:11.750> it

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
at least two to three acrobatic gold it

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.440 
at least two to three acrobatic gold it
when<00:02:12.890> he's<00:02:13.069> at<00:02:13.250> an<00:02:13.340> acute<00:02:13.610> angle<00:02:13.819> he<00:02:14.120> doesn't

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
when he's at an acute angle he doesn't

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.690 
when he's at an acute angle he doesn't
just<00:02:14.569> shoot<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:14.989> down<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.260> middle

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
just shoot it down the middle

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.490 
just shoot it down the middle
for<00:02:16.090> some<00:02:16.239> reason<00:02:16.569> it<00:02:16.750> when<00:02:17.110> it's<00:02:17.230> such<00:02:17.379> an

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
for some reason it when it's such an

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.440 
for some reason it when it's such an
acute<00:02:17.739> angle<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:18.160> goes<00:02:18.400> more<00:02:18.790> for<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.060> acute

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
acute angle it goes more for the acute

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.630 
acute angle it goes more for the acute
it<00:02:19.810> goes<00:02:20.080> for<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.319> deeper<00:02:20.769> side<00:02:21.010> meaning

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
it goes for a deeper side meaning

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.490 
it goes for a deeper side meaning
suppose<00:02:22.629> he's<00:02:22.780> running<00:02:23.050> past<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.319> keeper

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
suppose he's running past the keeper

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.250 
suppose he's running past the keeper
just<00:02:23.920> I'll<00:02:24.069> take<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.519> for<00:02:24.580> an<00:02:24.790> example<00:02:25.260> if

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
just I'll take that for an example if

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.990 
just I'll take that for an example if
most<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.680> his<00:02:26.800> clips<00:02:27.069> whenever<00:02:27.370> he<00:02:27.489> goes<00:02:27.670> at

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
most of his clips whenever he goes at

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.520 
most of his clips whenever he goes at
those<00:02:28.300> kind<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.510> angles<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:28.930> just<00:02:29.080> bubbles

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
those kind of angles it just bubbles

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.100
