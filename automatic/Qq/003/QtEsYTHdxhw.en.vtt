00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:37.060
 today April 2, 2014 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.940
 since November 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.350
 planting 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.589
 of follow-up is to say that it was sown in 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.530
 the first of November of the campus that 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:52.860
 we have here 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.410
 you see that this means that it was in 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.070
 midwinter 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.660
 and in greenhouse 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:06.110
 greenhouse with very little water 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.229
 and I say that there is always campus 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.950
 than having it moistened but with very little 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.070
 Water 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.230
 now I just delivered them 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.140
 we have 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.820
 the casualties we had considered let's 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.260
 to see if we are analyzing 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.260
 here we have 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:37.230
 some copies 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:39.520
 quite developed that are already stretched 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.869
 to look for light 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:47.060
 I said in another presentation or exhibition 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.159
 what will I put around 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.960
 another wall around I'm referring 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.890
 around the whole campus this 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.120
 tiny 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.720
 Well, here you have around to put 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:06.130
 after cardboard 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:09.940
 or any material in order that 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.420
 that is covered and that the light between 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:19.600
 less amount of light the experiment is 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.880
 take advantage now that they stretch for 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.430
 experiment with those of nyon who 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.670
 it has on the very long long stem 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.590
 that we gain in height but we lose 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.990
 coudet 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.380
 but it's also interesting 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:39.950
 some are damaged and we have this 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.990
 that the first cotyledons are a 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.790
 little bit 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.790
 we leave you so well 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:54.130
 they will no longer do us the work that 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:57.700
 corresponds the other day a friend here of 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.700
 facebook told me 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.530
 stay 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.560
 they had their light adn a squad of four 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.070
 weeks since you can not imagine the 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.250
 size that had more than these that I have 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.750
 here 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.860
 but but we are in another latitude 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.480
 this one is pretty well developed like this 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.530
 like this other 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.319
 and now 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.569
 Here I present another little gem to this 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.569
 you are precious 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.320
 here 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.930
 well it looks perfectly in this the 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.850
 copper and we do not have to forget that 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.560
 the genetic part is important because 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:50.510
 they are super important, we all go 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.510
 sometimes we lose copies but 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.460
 It is not our care's fault 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.820
 and here 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.370
 we have this that is totally 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.800
 eared looking for a great 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.330
 intensity to light is this look does 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.330
 high the tree 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.840
 and here the other is to say that that has 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.970
 given the idea to leave those who have 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.480
 reducing the light now I present to you 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.940
 that the other one that I had to 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.170
 take out my give 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.880
 another replante 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.700
 and notice that the first sheet 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.740
 I was doing normal work and now 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:42.759
 we have the albino and it usually happens 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:45.150
 since or that already comes from genetics or 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:48.500
 it solves us 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.520
 the theme of the leaves 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.520
 either green 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:59.410
 they do not have 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:03.680
 life there we have another low and then already 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:07.750
 because if I put myself to what is analyzed 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.750
 I do not want to think about the negative part 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.849
 but currently 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:17.309
 there are 50% casualties 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:20.429
 although there are many highs but at a 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:22.849
 half plant are those that have been 

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:28.869
 gone losing by the way 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:28.869
 for me it's fine because it's a latitude 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:39.050
 Your climate or origin 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:41.330
 They are nice to me I love them like that but 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.209
 this friend if I compare this pose with 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.569
 his of four weeks is apotheosis 

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:49.360
 we will see these are a Bible with 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:52.439
 about 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.439
 what he has 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:59.750
 where is 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:01.940
 and those who are high ready 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:06.490
 two 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:10.660
 well this is the summary since November 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:17.500
 so always january february march 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:22.009
 April will make us 5 6 5 months 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:26.259
 good until next month 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:26.259
 and now we have no danger 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.080
 Y 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.080
 and
