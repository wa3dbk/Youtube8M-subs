all<00:00:06.210> right<00:00:06.330> let's<00:00:06.509> let's<00:00:06.750> do<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.899> quick<00:00:07.170> take

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
all right let's let's do a quick take

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.290 
all right let's let's do a quick take
let's<00:00:07.980> take<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.130> quick<00:00:08.580> look<00:00:08.730> at<00:00:08.880> what<00:00:09.000> Mendel

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
let's take a quick look at what Mendel

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.419 
let's take a quick look at what Mendel
has<00:00:09.510> through<00:00:09.809> his<00:00:09.840> f1<00:00:10.380> what<00:00:11.040> Mendel<00:00:11.280> has

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
has through his f1 what Mendel has

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.339 
has through his f1 what Mendel has
through<00:00:11.610> his<00:00:11.730> f1<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.269> he's<00:00:12.719> got<00:00:12.870> these<00:00:13.019> smooth

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
through his f1 is he's got these smooth

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.990 
through his f1 is he's got these smooth
plants<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.160> I'm<00:00:14.280> using<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.670> smooth<00:00:14.880> and

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
plants and I'm using the smooth and

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.070 
plants and I'm using the smooth and
wrinkled<00:00:15.330> because<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.690> was<00:00:15.809> his<00:00:15.929> first

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
wrinkled because it was his first

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.450 
wrinkled because it was his first
experiment<00:00:16.590> we're<00:00:16.800> not<00:00:16.920> going<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.190> go<00:00:17.310> through

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
experiment we're not going to go through

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.450 
experiment we're not going to go through
all<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.640> his<00:00:17.850> experiments<00:00:18.359> one<00:00:19.199> just<00:00:19.980> sets<00:00:20.250> it

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
all of his experiments one just sets it

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.029 
all of his experiments one just sets it
out<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:20.789> nicely<00:00:21.210> smooth<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.020> wrinkled<00:00:22.320> we've

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
out so nicely smooth and wrinkled we've

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.519 
out so nicely smooth and wrinkled we've
determined<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:24.060> use<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.269> certain<00:00:24.779> criteria<00:00:25.470> to

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
determined to use a certain criteria to

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.170 
determined to use a certain criteria to
describe<00:00:26.039> these<00:00:26.220> remember<00:00:26.490> Mendel's<00:00:27.029> law

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
describe these remember Mendel's law

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.599 
describe these remember Mendel's law
Mendel's<00:00:28.050> law<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.199> segregation<00:00:28.410> said<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.429> get

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
Mendel's law of segregation said you get

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.730 
Mendel's law of segregation said you get
one<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.210> your<00:00:30.300> traits<00:00:31.050> from<00:00:31.289> each<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.650> your

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
one of your traits from each of your

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.229 
one of your traits from each of your
parent<00:00:32.130> which<00:00:32.250> means<00:00:32.460> since<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.850> have<00:00:33.000> two

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
parent which means since you have two

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.410 
parent which means since you have two
parents<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:34.670> certainly<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.730> sperm<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.180> an<00:00:36.270> egg

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
parents or certainly a sperm in an egg

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.139 
parents or certainly a sperm in an egg
then<00:00:37.140> you're<00:00:37.320> going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.590> get<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.920> gene<00:00:38.399> for<00:00:38.940> this

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
then you're going to get a gene for this

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.209 
then you're going to get a gene for this
trait<00:00:39.570> from<00:00:39.719> each<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.079> them<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:41.100> we

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
trait from each of them and so we

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.729 
trait from each of them and so we
decided<00:00:41.610> okay<00:00:41.969> since<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.420> smooth<00:00:42.780> was<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
decided okay since the smooth was the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.160 
decided okay since the smooth was the
one<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.219> Mendel<00:00:44.760> noted<00:00:45.270> was<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.629> dominant

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
one that Mendel noted was the dominant

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.549 
one that Mendel noted was the dominant
one<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:47.010> decided<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.550> call<00:00:47.730> big<00:00:48.030> s<00:00:48.239> smooth<00:00:49.170> and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
one we decided to call big s smooth and

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.549 
one we decided to call big s smooth and
to<00:00:50.280> show<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.879> was<00:00:50.940> what<00:00:51.559> masked

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
to show that that was what masked

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.220 
to show that that was what masked
wrinkled<00:00:53.280> instead<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.090> calling<00:00:54.300> wrinkled<00:00:54.809> W

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
wrinkled instead of calling wrinkled W

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.410 
wrinkled instead of calling wrinkled W
we're<00:00:55.410> calling<00:00:55.800> wrinkled<00:00:56.160> little<00:00:56.399> s<00:00:56.550> for

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
we're calling wrinkled little s for

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.200 
we're calling wrinkled little s for
wrinkled<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.309> this<00:00:59.309> worked<00:00:59.609> like<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.850> charm

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
wrinkled and this worked like a charm

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.330 
wrinkled and this worked like a charm
you<00:01:00.449> guys<00:01:00.600> because<00:01:00.989> if<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:01.289> decide<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:02.160> call

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
you guys because if we decide to call

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.820 
you guys because if we decide to call
this<00:01:02.460> P<00:01:02.730> generation<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:04.409> say<00:01:04.650> that

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
this P generation here and we say that

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.560 
this P generation here and we say that
okay<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.430> pure<00:01:05.670> breeding<00:01:05.970> that's<00:01:06.360> so

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
okay this is pure breeding that's so

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.100 
okay this is pure breeding that's so
important<00:01:07.110> big<00:01:07.740> s<00:01:07.920> big<00:01:08.130> s<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.600> this<00:01:09.600> was<00:01:09.810> pure

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
important big s big s and this was pure

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.100 
important big s big s and this was pure
breeding<00:01:10.409> had<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.310> little<00:01:11.909> s<00:01:12.030> little<00:01:12.060> s<00:01:12.479> it

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
breeding had to be little s little s it

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.969 
breeding had to be little s little s it
was<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.680> clearly<00:01:14.509> delineated<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.439> f1

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
was so clearly delineated that in the f1

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.370 
was so clearly delineated that in the f1
generation<00:01:17.240> we<00:01:18.240> would<00:01:18.450> get<00:01:18.630> nothing<00:01:19.140> if<00:01:19.259> you

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
generation we would get nothing if you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.810 
generation we would get nothing if you
look<00:01:19.590> at<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> sperm<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.520> one<00:01:20.670> will

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
look at the sperm that this one will

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.840 
look at the sperm that this one will
produce<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.860> eggs<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.520> one<00:01:23.700> will

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
produce and the eggs that this one will

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.179 
produce and the eggs that this one will
produce<00:01:24.030> or<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.350> were<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.560> female<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
produce or if this were the female the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.800 
produce or if this were the female the
eggs<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.060> one<00:01:27.210> were<00:01:27.330> producing<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
eggs that this one were producing the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.240 
eggs that this one were producing the
sperm<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.320> would<00:01:28.470> reproduce<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.159> have

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
sperm that this would reproduce you have

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.850 
sperm that this would reproduce you have
no<00:01:29.369> choices<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.720> no<00:01:30.900> choices<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.799> is

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
no choices you have no choices this is

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.410 
no choices you have no choices this is
always<00:01:32.220> going<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.549> produce<00:01:32.670> big<00:01:32.970> s<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.299> is

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
always going to produce big s this is

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.520 
always going to produce big s this is
always<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.900> produce<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.200> little<00:01:34.380> s<00:01:34.500> and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
always going to produce a little s and

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.660 
always going to produce a little s and
so<00:01:35.070> your<00:01:35.220> f1<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.780> be<00:01:36.930> big<00:01:37.680> s<00:01:37.890> little<00:01:38.159> s

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
so your f1 is going to be big s little s

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.690 
so your f1 is going to be big s little s
that's<00:01:39.659> where<00:01:40.020> we<00:01:40.140> are<00:01:40.170> now<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:41.159> remember<00:01:41.310> we

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
that's where we are now but remember we

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.160 
that's where we are now but remember we
have<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.850> describes<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.899> figure

have to describes we have to figure

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.230 
have to describes we have to figure
something<00:01:43.200> out

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
something out

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.139 
something out
he<00:01:45.240> got<00:01:45.860> three<00:01:46.860> quarters<00:01:48.079> smooth<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:50.149> one

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
he got three quarters smooth and one

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.749 
he got three quarters smooth and one
quarter<00:01:51.590> wrinkled<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.770> his<00:01:53.070> f2<00:01:55.399> and<00:01:56.399> now<00:01:56.729> I

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
quarter wrinkled in his f2 and now I

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.940 
quarter wrinkled in his f2 and now I
have<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.630> introduce<00:01:58.290> some<00:01:58.500> words

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
have to I have to introduce some words

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.760 
have to I have to introduce some words
to<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.369> okay<00:01:59.880> we<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.689> genetics<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.740> a

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
to you okay we in genetics have a

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.310 
to you okay we in genetics have a
vocabulary<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.689> we<00:02:03.840> do<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.079> every

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
vocabulary just like we do in every

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.740 
vocabulary just like we do in every
other<00:02:04.350> field<00:02:04.799> where<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.250> have<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.969> talk<00:02:06.540> about

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
other field where I have to talk about

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.630 
other field where I have to talk about
things<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.799> I'm<00:02:07.890> going<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.039> go<00:02:08.160> back<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.520> this

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
things so I'm going to go back to this

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.510 
things so I'm going to go back to this
thing<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.149> am<00:02:09.270> going<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.539> say<00:02:10.190> that<00:02:11.190> you're

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
thing and I am going to say that you're

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.460 
thing and I am going to say that you're
going<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.730> see<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.209> described<00:02:12.720> several

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
going to see this described several

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
going to see this described several
different<00:02:13.680> ways<00:02:14.330> okay<00:02:15.350> first<00:02:16.350> of<00:02:16.530> all<00:02:16.620> this

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
different ways okay first of all this

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.950 
different ways okay first of all this
purebred<00:02:17.940> line<00:02:19.010> we<00:02:20.010> use<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.550> term<00:02:21.050> homozygous

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
purebred line we use the term homozygous

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.510 
purebred line we use the term homozygous
to<00:02:24.960> define<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:26.150> same<00:02:27.230> zygote<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:28.830> anything

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
to define that same zygote so anything

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.460 
to define that same zygote so anything
that<00:02:29.550> has<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.090> two<00:02:30.300> alleles<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.900> same<00:02:31.200> is

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
that has the two alleles the same is

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.960 
that has the two alleles the same is
going<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.680> be<00:02:31.740> called<00:02:32.070> homozygous<00:02:32.580> in<00:02:33.170> my<00:02:34.170> f1

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
going to be called homozygous in my f1

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.760 
going to be called homozygous in my f1
we're<00:02:35.970> going<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.360> talk<00:02:36.540> about<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:37.410> fact<00:02:37.650> that

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
we're going to talk about the fact that

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.770 
we're going to talk about the fact that
this<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.220> hybrid<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.090> term<00:02:39.300> we<00:02:39.420> use<00:02:39.570> all

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
this is a hybrid is the term we use all

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.530 
this is a hybrid is the term we use all
the<00:02:39.900> time<00:02:40.550> well<00:02:41.550> there's<00:02:41.730> another<00:02:42.030> way<00:02:42.300> in

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
the time well there's another way in

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.810 
the time well there's another way in
terms<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.930> its<00:02:43.080> zygosity<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:44.190> describe<00:02:44.610> this

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
terms of its zygosity to describe this

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.900 
terms of its zygosity to describe this
other<00:02:45.300> than<00:02:45.740> hybrid<00:02:46.740> which<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:47.370> cool<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.730> can

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
other than hybrid which is cool you can

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.940 
other than hybrid which is cool you can
use<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.180> word<00:02:48.330> hybrid<00:02:48.690> but<00:02:49.140> we<00:02:49.260> also<00:02:49.440> refer<00:02:49.920> to

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
use the word hybrid but we also refer to

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.240 
use the word hybrid but we also refer to
that<00:02:50.130> as<00:02:52.430> heterozygous<00:02:53.430> we're<00:02:54.300> mixed<00:02:55.250> just

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
that as heterozygous we're mixed just

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.220 
that as heterozygous we're mixed just
some<00:02:56.490> vocabulary<00:02:56.850> because<00:02:57.390> now<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.750> can<00:02:58.080> talk

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
some vocabulary because now I can talk

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.600 
some vocabulary because now I can talk
to<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.410> about<00:02:58.440> heterozygous<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.490> know

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
to you about heterozygous and you know

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.250 
to you about heterozygous and you know
I'm<00:02:59.700> going<00:02:59.820> to<00:02:59.880> be<00:03:00.000> talking<00:03:00.150> next<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:01.080> now<00:03:01.230> I

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
I'm going to be talking next so now I

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.360 
I'm going to be talking next so now I
don't<00:03:01.410> have<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.709> think<00:03:01.860> they<00:03:01.980> were<00:03:02.040> pure

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
don't have to think they were pure

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.830 
don't have to think they were pure
breeding<00:03:02.670> lines<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.270> can<00:03:03.330> say<00:03:03.540> hey<00:03:03.660> they<00:03:03.780> were

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
breeding lines I can say hey they were

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.570 
breeding lines I can say hey they were
homozygous<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.740> know<00:03:04.860> exactly<00:03:05.190> what<00:03:05.490> I'm

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
homozygous and you know exactly what I'm

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.340 
homozygous and you know exactly what I'm
talking<00:03:05.610> about<00:03:05.970> that's<00:03:06.810> kind<00:03:07.080> of<00:03:07.110> fun

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
talking about that's kind of fun

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.110 
talking about that's kind of fun
alrighty<00:03:08.040> so<00:03:08.430> it's<00:03:08.580> like<00:03:08.700> having<00:03:09.000> our<00:03:09.060> own

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
alrighty so it's like having our own

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.090 
alrighty so it's like having our own
little<00:03:09.330> secret<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:09.959> know<00:03:10.080> code<00:03:10.380> language

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
little secret you know code language

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.100 
little secret you know code language
alright<00:03:11.550> so<00:03:11.940> homozygous<00:03:12.390> gave<00:03:12.990> us

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
alright so homozygous gave us

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.410 
alright so homozygous gave us
heterozygous<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.920> now<00:03:14.040> here's<00:03:14.550> what<00:03:14.760> he<00:03:15.060> did

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.580 

he<00:03:18.420> had<00:03:18.690> remember<00:03:19.140> in<00:03:19.230> his<00:03:19.320> law<00:03:19.470> of

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
he had remember in his law of

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.350 
he had remember in his law of
segregation<00:03:19.800> he<00:03:20.519> said<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.910> these<00:03:21.060> are<00:03:21.239> going

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
segregation he said that these are going

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.759 
segregation he said that these are going
to<00:03:21.450> separate<00:03:21.930> so<00:03:22.080> let's<00:03:22.350> go<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.590> that

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
to separate so let's go to that

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.220 
to separate so let's go to that
heterozygous<00:03:23.489> f1<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:26.420> let's<00:03:27.420> cross<00:03:27.720> them<00:03:28.019> but

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
heterozygous f1 and let's cross them but

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.449 
heterozygous f1 and let's cross them but
now<00:03:28.760> we're<00:03:29.760> going<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.209> have<00:03:30.800> segregation<00:03:31.800> here

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
now we're going to have segregation here

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.120 
now we're going to have segregation here
alright<00:03:33.060> remember<00:03:33.360> this<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.110> now<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.800> gets<00:03:34.950> a

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
alright remember this and now it gets a

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.940 
alright remember this and now it gets a
little<00:03:35.280> more<00:03:35.459> interesting<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.810> let's<00:03:37.080> take<00:03:37.920> a

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
little more interesting so let's take a

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.400 
little more interesting so let's take a
look<00:03:38.160> let's<00:03:38.370> make<00:03:38.430> this<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.850> male<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.540> let's

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
look let's make this the male and let's

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.229 
look let's make this the male and let's
take<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.620> look<00:03:40.830> at<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.190> gametes<00:03:41.610> this<00:03:41.760> male<00:03:42.000> can

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
take a look at the gametes this male can

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.630 
take a look at the gametes this male can
form<00:03:43.130> you<00:03:44.130> can<00:03:44.340> only<00:03:44.489> send<00:03:44.760> one<00:03:44.880> perspire<00:03:45.750> and

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
form you can only send one perspire and

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.400 
form you can only send one perspire and
therefore<00:03:47.780> according<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.810> Mendel's<00:03:49.230> law<00:03:49.350> of

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
therefore according to Mendel's law of

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.199 
therefore according to Mendel's law of
segregation<00:03:49.640> half<00:03:50.640> of<00:03:50.820> his<00:03:50.970> sperm<00:03:53.000> will<00:03:54.000> have

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
segregation half of his sperm will have

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.090 
segregation half of his sperm will have
the<00:03:55.080> big<00:03:55.260> s<00:03:55.580> the<00:03:56.580> smooth<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.799> half<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:58.980> his

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
the big s the smooth and half of his

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.960 
the big s the smooth and half of his
sperm<00:04:01.310> will<00:04:02.310> have<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.549> little<00:04:02.790> s<00:04:03.739> okay

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
sperm will have the little s okay

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.030 
sperm will have the little s okay
similarly<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.269> female<00:04:06.660> portion<00:04:06.930> of<00:04:07.320> the

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
similarly the female portion of the

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.550 
similarly the female portion of the

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
was a rainbow for Mendel and why it

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.020 
was a rainbow for Mendel and why it
opened<00:04:30.960> his<00:04:31.140> eyes<00:04:31.350> because<00:04:32.100> he<00:04:32.370> saw<00:04:32.670> what<00:04:32.940> was

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
opened his eyes because he saw what was

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.950 
opened his eyes because he saw what was
happening<00:04:33.090> here

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
happening here

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.650 
happening here
he<00:04:34.320> saw<00:04:34.650> that<00:04:35.160> when<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:35.490> sprinkled<00:04:36.030> sperm<00:04:36.390> on

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660

he saw that when you sprinkled sperm on
an<00:04:37.110> egg<00:04:37.410> in<00:04:37.740> these<00:04:38.520> flowers<00:04:39.180> that<00:04:39.630> it<00:04:39.780> was

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
an egg in these flowers that it was

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.680 
an egg in these flowers that it was

those<00:04:51.780> little<00:04:52.740> s<00:04:52.950> eggs<00:04:53.280> let's<00:04:54.180> just<00:04:54.510> look<00:04:54.630> at

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
those little s eggs let's just look at

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.690 
those little s eggs let's just look at
those<00:04:54.840> combinations<00:04:55.470> this<00:04:56.190> would<00:04:56.370> give<00:04:56.520> me<00:04:56.550> a

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
those combinations this would give me a

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.290 
those combinations this would give me a
big<00:04:56.880> s<00:04:57.030> big<00:04:57.240> s<00:04:57.710> right<00:04:58.790> this<00:04:59.790> would<00:04:59.970> give<00:05:00.120> me<00:05:00.150> a

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
big s big s right this would give me a

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.800 
big s big s right this would give me a
big<00:05:00.960> s<00:05:01.110> little<00:05:01.350> s<00:05:01.850> but<00:05:02.850> remember<00:05:03.330> Mendel<00:05:03.780> was

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
big s little s but remember Mendel was

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.480 
big s little s but remember Mendel was
no<00:05:04.080> dummy<00:05:04.290> he<00:05:05.040> realized<00:05:05.520> that<00:05:05.850> wow<00:05:06.300> we<00:05:07.050> have

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
no dummy he realized that wow we have

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.670 
no dummy he realized that wow we have
other<00:05:08.490> sperms<00:05:09.390> half<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:10.140> sperms<00:05:10.440> I'm

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
other sperms half the sperms I'm

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.470 
other sperms half the sperms I'm
sprinkling<00:05:10.980> over<00:05:11.340> this<00:05:11.460> stigma<00:05:11.760> have<00:05:12.450> a

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
sprinkling over this stigma have a

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.730 
sprinkling over this stigma have a
little<00:05:12.810> s<00:05:12.960> and<00:05:13.320> so<00:05:14.010> therefore<00:05:14.280> this<00:05:15.120> little<00:05:15.450> s

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
little s and so therefore this little s

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.040 
little s and so therefore this little s
might<00:05:16.740> fertilize<00:05:17.370> those<00:05:17.669> big<00:05:17.910> s<00:05:18.090> eggs<00:05:18.360> too<00:05:18.690> cuz

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
might fertilize those big s eggs too cuz

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.860 
might fertilize those big s eggs too cuz
prompt<00:05:19.410> possibility<00:05:20.190> is<00:05:20.310> it<00:05:20.490> might<00:05:20.669> and<00:05:20.970> well

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
prompt possibility is it might and well

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
look at that big s little s but that's

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.640 
look at that big s little s but that's
not<00:05:27.120> all<00:05:27.300> because<00:05:27.450> there<00:05:27.720> is<00:05:27.840> still<00:05:28.080> a<00:05:28.140> fourth

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
going to write them both as big as

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.890 
going to write them both as big as
little<00:06:16.530> s<00:06:16.650> as<00:06:16.890> we<00:06:17.100> get<00:06:17.250> to<00:06:17.370> convention<00:06:17.900> and

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
little s as we get to convention and

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.680 
little s as we get to convention and
last<00:06:19.229> but<00:06:19.440> not<00:06:19.590> least<00:06:19.970> we<00:06:20.970> come<00:06:21.180> to<00:06:21.330> this<00:06:21.479> one

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
last but not least we come to this one

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.600 
last but not least we come to this one
and<00:06:22.229> I'm<00:06:22.320> gonna<00:06:22.440> put<00:06:22.650> this<00:06:22.770> over<00:06:22.950> to<00:06:23.250> the<00:06:23.340> side
