00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.140
♫ Years ago back when I was a teacher

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.940
I was teaching my class about light

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.200
Infrared on the left of the spectrum

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.060
Through to ultraviolet on the right.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.300
I showed them the primary colours

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.260
And drew circles of blue green and red

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.940
I explained that each colour had its own wavelength

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.240
And the pupils wrote down what I said.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.400
While the class settled down to their homework

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.380
One curious boy raised his hand

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.020
He looked troubled with eyes open wide so I asked

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.580
"Is there something you don't understand?"

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.620
Does that mean there aren't any more colours?

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.100
Does that mean that I've seen every one?

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.060
I'd hoped one day to find shades that just blew my mind

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.540
But I'll never have that kind of fun

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.700
If there really aren't any more colours

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.080
And there'll never be new ones to see,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.860
All this time it would seem it was pointless to dream

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.500
And the world seems less colourful to me.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.480
Well I just didn't know what to tell him

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.340
As he stared at me expectantly

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.480
Did he know that I felt just the same way as him

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.220
The day my science teacher told me?

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.340
(♫♫♫)

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.440
It's not true that there are no more colours,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.380
It's not true that you've seen every shade,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.000
All the reds and the greens and the vast in betweens

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.480
Can be blended in endless new ways

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.580
There's an infinite number of colours

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.460
That can shock and delight and surprise.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.840
You can have any shade when you know how it's made

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.180
And it's only a trick of the eyes.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.440
♫ Oooooooooh...
