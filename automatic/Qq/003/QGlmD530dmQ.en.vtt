then<00:01:31.170> I'm<00:01:31.290> gonna<00:01:31.380> hold<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:31.890> about<00:01:31.979> 10

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
then I'm gonna hold it for about 10

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.670 
then I'm gonna hold it for about 10
seconds<00:01:32.850> flip<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> curling<00:01:34.020> rod<00:01:34.170> downward

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
seconds flip the curling rod downward

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.210 
seconds flip the curling rod downward
and<00:01:34.920> release<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.090> coil<00:01:36.840> them<00:01:37.110> back<00:01:37.320> up<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.979> if

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
and release and coil them back up as if

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.980 
and release and coil them back up as if
it<00:01:38.369> were<00:01:38.490> back<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.880> curling<00:01:39.240> rod<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.689> then

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
it were back on the curling rod and then

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.050 
it were back on the curling rod and then
I<00:01:40.140> like<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.470> kind<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.740> pull<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.159> apart<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.909> that

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
I like to kind of pull it apart so that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.359 
I like to kind of pull it apart so that
it's<00:01:42.180> not<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.720> tight<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.619> that's<00:01:44.130> when<00:01:44.280> you

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
it's not so tight and that's when you

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.609 
it's not so tight and that's when you
take<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.610> bobby<00:01:44.850> pin<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.329> pin<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:46.110> at<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.439> base

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
take a bobby pin and pin it at the base

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.080 
take a bobby pin and pin it at the base
so<00:01:47.009> you're<00:01:47.189> gonna<00:01:47.280> leave<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.640> just<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:48.030> that

take spray it with spray the first curl

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.490 
take spray it with spray the first curl
we<00:01:53.250> just<00:01:53.460> did<00:01:53.579> we<00:01:53.759> curled<00:01:54.060> outward<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:55.200> curve

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
we just did we curled outward this curve

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.749 
we just did we curled outward this curve
we're<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.009> curl<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.340> complete
