exercise<00:05:15.889> is<00:05:16.639> to<00:05:17.029> build<00:05:17.479> pika<00:05:18.489> biceps<00:05:19.489> do<00:05:19.699> you

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
exercise is to build pika biceps do you

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.139 
exercise is to build pika biceps do you
get<00:05:19.999> that<00:05:20.179> big<00:05:20.389> round<00:05:20.719> p<00:05:21.049> on<00:05:21.289> your<00:05:21.469> biceps

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:22.149

get that big round p on your biceps
personally<00:05:23.149> I<00:05:23.299> don't<00:05:23.389> think<00:05:23.959> that<00:05:24.079> that's

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:24.649 
personally I don't think that that's

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:27.309 
personally I don't think that that's
actually<00:05:25.299> going<00:05:26.299> to<00:05:26.419> do<00:05:26.569> that<00:05:26.779> for<00:05:27.019> you<00:05:27.199> I

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
actually going to do that for you I

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.469 
actually going to do that for you I
think<00:05:27.649> it<00:05:27.769> obviously<00:05:28.399> does<00:05:28.729> help<00:05:29.029> build<00:05:29.329> the

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
think it obviously does help build the

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.219 
think it obviously does help build the
bicep<00:05:29.989> muscle<00:05:30.409> but<00:05:31.159> um<00:05:31.539> just<00:05:32.539> my<00:05:32.689> personal

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
bicep muscle but um just my personal

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.559 
bicep muscle but um just my personal
opinion<00:05:33.469> on<00:05:34.009> it<00:05:34.189> I<00:05:34.339> think<00:05:34.909> certain<00:05:35.539> people

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:35.569 
opinion on it I think certain people

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.619 
opinion on it I think certain people
their<00:05:36.289> genetics<00:05:36.889> decide<00:05:37.339> whether<00:05:37.699> they<00:05:38.359> get<00:05:38.599> a

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:38.629 
their genetics decide whether they get a

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:41.109 
their genetics decide whether they get a
good<00:05:38.899> round<00:05:39.199> peek<00:05:39.589> at<00:05:39.829> the<00:05:40.159> top<00:05:40.879> of<00:05:40.909> their

00:05:41.109 --> 00:05:41.119 
good round peek at the top of their

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:43.959 
good round peek at the top of their
bicep<00:05:41.629> some<00:05:42.559> people<00:05:42.859> just<00:05:43.099> have<00:05:43.159> the<00:05:43.459> genetics

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:43.969 
bicep some people just have the genetics

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:46.239 
bicep some people just have the genetics
for<00:05:44.179> that<00:05:44.359> other<00:05:44.449> people<00:05:44.869> don't<00:05:45.129> that's<00:05:46.129> just

00:05:46.239 --> 00:05:46.249 
for that other people don't that's just

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:48.429 
for that other people don't that's just
my<00:05:46.489> opinion<00:05:46.519> Oh<00:05:47.089> feel<00:05:47.779> free<00:05:47.809> to<00:05:48.109> do<00:05:48.229> your<00:05:48.409> own

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:23.959 
you can do keep building it up your reps

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:26.679 
you can do keep building it up your reps
your<00:06:24.559> sets<00:06:24.919> that's<00:06:25.609> all<00:06:25.909> up<00:06:26.119> to<00:06:26.149> you<00:06:26.419> whatever

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 
you're comfortable with you start out

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:30.519 
you're comfortable with you start out
and<00:06:28.819> pick<00:06:28.969> up<00:06:29.089> starting<00:06:29.509> point<00:06:29.779> and<00:06:29.929> you<00:06:30.289> go<00:06:30.469> to

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:30.529 
and pick up starting point and you go to

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:32.739 
and pick up starting point and you go to
you<00:06:30.799> build<00:06:31.039> it<00:06:31.219> up<00:06:31.339> you<00:06:32.029> should<00:06:32.089> be<00:06:32.449> able<00:06:32.569> to

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:32.749 
you build it up you should be able to

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:34.929 
you build it up you should be able to
see<00:06:32.929> results<00:06:33.139> within<00:06:33.439> a<00:06:33.709> few<00:06:33.979> weeks<00:06:34.039> you<00:06:34.789> know

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:34.939 
see results within a few weeks you know

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:36.999 
see results within a few weeks you know
if<00:06:35.149> you<00:06:35.329> do<00:06:35.479> it<00:06:35.599> consistently<00:06:35.779> you<00:06:36.739> also

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:37.009 
if you do it consistently you also

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:38.919 
if you do it consistently you also
always<00:06:37.159> want<00:06:37.519> to<00:06:37.579> give<00:06:37.699> yourself<00:06:38.119> a<00:06:38.269> day<00:06:38.779> or

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:38.929 
always want to give yourself a day or

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:41.709 
always want to give yourself a day or
two<00:06:39.079> of<00:06:39.289> rest<00:06:39.799> time<00:06:40.399> in<00:06:40.669> between<00:06:40.849> because

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:41.719 
two of rest time in between because

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:43.779 
two of rest time in between because
that's<00:06:42.169> when<00:06:42.379> your<00:06:42.529> muscles<00:06:42.709> heal<00:06:43.249> your

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:47.179 
muscles grow when you're working out

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:48.909 
muscles grow when you're working out
you're<00:06:47.809> tearing<00:06:48.349> and<00:06:48.499> shredding<00:06:48.859> your

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 
you're tearing and shredding your

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:51.669 
you're tearing and shredding your
muscles<00:06:49.399> in<00:06:49.609> the<00:06:50.329> rest<00:06:50.569> period<00:06:51.079> they're

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:51.679 
muscles in the rest period they're

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:53.559 
muscles in the rest period they're
rejuvenating<00:06:52.639> they're<00:06:52.789> growing<00:06:53.119> back<00:06:53.329> and

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:53.569 
rejuvenating they're growing back and

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:53.980 
rejuvenating they're growing back and
that's

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
that's

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.840 
that's
the<00:06:54.080> muscle<00:06:54.470> actually<00:06:55.010> grows<00:06:55.310> that's<00:06:55.640> when

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:55.850 
the muscle actually grows that's when

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.300 
the muscle actually grows that's when
you<00:06:55.940> see<00:06:56.150> the<00:06:56.270> progress<00:06:56.510> so<00:06:57.290> rest<00:06:57.680> time<00:06:57.950> is

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310 
you see the progress so rest time is

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.330 
you see the progress so rest time is
very<00:06:58.880> very<00:06:59.210> important<00:06:59.900> between<00:07:00.080> you<00:07:00.980> working

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
very very important between you working

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.580 
very very important between you working
out<00:07:01.460> the<00:07:01.610> different<00:07:02.030> muscles<00:07:02.420> so<00:07:02.960> always

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:03.590 
out the different muscles so always

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.320 
out the different muscles so always

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:05.330 
allow yourself to get a proper amount of

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.820 
allow yourself to get a proper amount of
rest<00:07:05.420> or<00:07:05.780> you're<00:07:06.050> going<00:07:06.170> to<00:07:06.230> be<00:07:06.380> wasting<00:07:06.800> your

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830 
rest or you're going to be wasting your

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.980
