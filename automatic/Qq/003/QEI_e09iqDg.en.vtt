is<00:05:46.860> for<00:05:47.070> completing<00:05:47.580> this<00:05:47.700> level<00:05:48.000> since<00:05:48.180> I<00:05:48.360> do

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
is for completing this level since I do

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.900 
is for completing this level since I do
believe<00:05:48.870> it<00:05:49.020> is<00:05:49.080> just<00:05:49.260> a<00:05:49.410> secret<00:05:50.370> level<00:05:50.729> or<00:05:50.880> a

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
believe it is just a secret level or a

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.490 
believe it is just a secret level or a
special<00:05:51.210> level<00:05:51.570> or<00:05:51.780> whatever<00:05:51.990> and<00:05:52.169> what<00:05:52.380> the

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
special level or whatever and what the

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.400 
special level or whatever and what the
hell<00:05:52.620> is<00:05:52.740> that<00:05:52.770> thing<00:05:53.030> that<00:05:54.030> thing<00:05:54.419> is<00:05:54.870> so<00:05:55.110> cool

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
hell is that thing that thing is so cool

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.320 
hell is that thing that thing is so cool
looking<00:05:55.680> and<00:05:56.040> it<00:05:56.100> just<00:05:56.250> made<00:05:56.669> me<00:05:56.820> lose<00:05:56.970> all<00:05:57.180> my

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
looking and it just made me lose all my

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.330 
looking and it just made me lose all my
crystals<00:05:57.810> but<00:05:58.020> at<00:05:58.500> least<00:05:58.620> it<00:05:58.860> looks<00:05:59.010> kind<00:05:59.280> of

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
crystals but at least it looks kind of

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.090 
crystals but at least it looks kind of
cool<00:05:59.520> in<00:05:59.820> my<00:05:59.850> opinion<00:05:59.970> right<00:06:00.900> died<00:06:01.650> there<00:06:02.010> we

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
cool in my opinion right died there we

bit actually if actually I say pink oh
I'm<00:06:24.810> sure<00:06:24.960> that's<00:06:25.140> probably<00:06:25.410> I<00:06:26.130> was<00:06:26.910> before<00:06:27.090> a

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
I'm sure that's probably I was before a

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.879 
I'm sure that's probably I was before a
lot<00:06:27.479> of<00:06:27.599> people's<00:06:27.870> time<00:06:28.110> come<00:06:28.500> to<00:06:28.590> think

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:48.930

level<00:07:49.110> blinder<00:07:49.649> to<00:07:49.770> now<00:07:49.919> because<00:07:50.219> there's

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:50.370 
level blinder to now because there's

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.159 
level blinder to now because there's
more<00:07:50.580> in<00:07:50.729> the<00:07:50.819> level<00:07:51.120> to<00:07:51.240> explore<00:07:51.629> obviously

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:52.169 
more in the level to explore obviously

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:53.450 
more in the level to explore obviously
but<00:07:52.319> I<00:07:52.349> just<00:07:52.379> picked<00:07:52.740> up<00:07:52.830> a<00:07:52.919> puzzle<00:07:53.310> piece

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460 
but I just picked up a puzzle piece

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.550 
but I just picked up a puzzle piece
which<00:07:53.699> I<00:07:54.000> really<00:07:54.629> could<00:07:54.990> have<00:07:55.020> done<00:07:55.379> without

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 
which I really could have done without

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.679 
which I really could have done without
doing<00:07:56.129> because<00:07:56.460> there's<00:07:56.909> probably<00:07:57.270> more<00:07:57.509> for

00:07:57.679 --> 00:07:57.689 
doing because there's probably more for

00:07:57.689 --> 00:07:59.990 
doing because there's probably more for
me<00:07:57.810> to<00:07:57.960> see<00:07:58.169> Porsha<00:07:59.159> yeah<00:07:59.370> I<00:07:59.399> did<00:07:59.789> know<00:07:59.969> that

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 
that finished the level so that kind of

00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:08.419 
that finished the level so that kind of
sucks<00:08:02.430> but<00:08:02.639> yeah<00:08:04.310> how<00:08:05.310> could<00:08:05.550> I<00:08:05.610> had<00:08:05.879> I<00:08:05.909> suppose
