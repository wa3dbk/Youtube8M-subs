00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.270
 Mrs 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.910
 cast out the demons by belcebu 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.910
 prince of the demons 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.670
 [Music] 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.020
 every kingdom divided against itself is 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.020
 devastated 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.149
 and a house divided against if it falls 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.940
 and if you are also nothing you are 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.170
 divided against itself as 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.170
 his kingdom will remain 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.360
 because you say that by belcebú I have done 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.659
 out demons 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:33.860
 Well, if I were the facts by belcebu 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:37.900
 your children by whom they are cast out 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.900
 therefore they will be your judges 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.940
 but if I 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.300
 by the finger of God 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.310
 cast out demons 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.850
 definitely 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.750
 the kingdom of god has come to you 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.510
 [Music] 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.020
 when the strong and armed man keeps 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.310
 his house 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.770
 what he possesses is at peace 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.189
 but if another one comes stronger than the 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:12.190
 Eleven removes all his weapons in 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.190
 who trusted and distributed their spoils 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:21.010
 whoever is not with me or against me is 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.010
 and the one that does not pick up with me 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.969
 [Music] 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.830
 when the unclean spirit comes out of 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.620
 man 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:43.330
 walk through dry places looking for rest 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.200
 and not finding it says 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:51.670
 return to my house where I left 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.209
 and when he comes he finds it swept and 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.209
 decorated 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.480
 then it goes and it takes seven other spirits 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.330
 worse than him 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.490
 and they enter and live there 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.819
 and the final state of that man is 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:14.090
 worse than the first 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.140
 therefore I tell you all forms of sin and 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.810
 blasphemy will be forgiven to men 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.459
 but blasphemy against the spirit does not 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.459
 it will be forgiven them 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.110
 and anyone who speaks against the son 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.460
 of man 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.470
 he will be forgiven 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.170
 but whoever speaks against the spirit 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.290
 holy will not be forgiven even in this 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.020
 world or in the world to come or make 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.530
 good tree and its good fruit or makes the 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.870
 bad tree and its bad fruit because everything 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.230
 Tree is known for its fruit 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.829
 [Music] 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.829
 generation of vipers 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.230
 how can you be bad to speak the good 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.440
 because of the abundance of the heart 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.680
 mouth speaks 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.680
 the good man of the good treasure of 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:13.290
 heart brings out good things and man 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.840
 evil of bad treasure brings out bad things 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.239
 but I tell you that of every word 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.070
 idle that the men speak 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.070
 they will give an account on the day of the trial 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:28.229
 because by your words you will be 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.229
 justified 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.590
 and by your words you will be 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.289
 condemned 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.819
 teacher 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:43.060
 we want to see a signal from you our 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:46.870
 bad and adulterous generation demand signal 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.590
 but signal will not be given but the signal 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.490
 of the prophet jonás 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.060
 [Music] 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.830
 because like jonás he was three days and 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.229
 three nights in the belly of the fish like this 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.790
 will be the son of man three days and 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:05.580
 three nights in the heart of the earth 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.340
 the men of nineve will rise up in 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.070
 the trial with this generation and the 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.260
 condemned 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.510
 because they repented for the 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.990
 preaching of jonah plus fasting greater than 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.570
 jonás here 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.150
 the queen of the south will rise in the 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.870
 judgment with this generation and the 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.030
 condemned 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.190
 because she came from the confines of the 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.190
 earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.730
 but there is one 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:57.999
 one much greater than Solomon here 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:57.999
