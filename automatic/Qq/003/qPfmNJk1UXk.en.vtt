00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.020 

so<00:00:00.870> how<00:00:01.020> many<00:00:01.079> of<00:00:01.230> you<00:00:01.319> have<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:01.979> stuck<00:00:02.669> cup

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
so how many of you have the stuck cup

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.600 
so how many of you have the stuck cup
holder<00:00:03.360> problem<00:00:03.720> with<00:00:03.870> your<00:00:04.790> B<00:00:05.790> 5<00:00:06.029> a4

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.610 
holder problem with your B 5 a4

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.330 
holder problem with your B 5 a4
typically<00:00:08.610> what<00:00:08.730> happens<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:10.340> there's

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
typically what happens is that there's

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.010 
typically what happens is that there's
no<00:00:11.460> longer<00:00:11.580> functions<00:00:12.120> as<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.450> should<00:00:13.700> and

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
no longer functions as it should and

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.390 
no longer functions as it should and
most<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.199> problem<00:00:16.590> comes<00:00:16.830> from<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> little

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
most of that problem comes from a little

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.109 
most of that problem comes from a little
tiny<00:00:18.320> constant<00:00:19.320> force<00:00:19.529> spring<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.850> breaks

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
tiny constant force spring that breaks

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.179 
tiny constant force spring that breaks
off<00:00:21.439> or<00:00:22.439> becomes<00:00:23.130> dislodged<00:00:23.460> somehow<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
off or becomes dislodged somehow and the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.990 
off or becomes dislodged somehow and the
first<00:00:26.400> symptom<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.720> will<00:00:28.349> not<00:00:28.380> open

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
first symptom is that it will not open

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.880 
first symptom is that it will not open
so<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.090> push<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.480> push<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.080> push<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.740> it

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
so you push it push it push it and it

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.530 
so you push it push it push it and it
doesn't<00:00:32.099> open<00:00:32.399> that's<00:00:32.910> because<00:00:33.239> there's<00:00:33.420> no

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
doesn't open that's because there's no

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.840 
doesn't open that's because there's no
spring<00:00:33.780> force<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> pull<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.320> open<00:00:34.670> so<00:00:35.670> if<00:00:35.730> you

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
spring force to pull it open so if you

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.910 
spring force to pull it open so if you
do<00:00:35.940> pry<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.210> open<00:00:36.380> eventually<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.530> can<00:00:37.680> get<00:00:37.800> it

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
do pry it open eventually you can get it

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.010 
do pry it open eventually you can get it
open<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.790> then<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> parts<00:00:39.270> fall<00:00:39.480> back<00:00:39.690> inside

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
open but then the parts fall back inside

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.970 
open but then the parts fall back inside
and<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.620> can't<00:00:40.860> close<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.100> all<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.460> way<00:00:45.980> so

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
and you can't close it all the way so

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.279 
and you can't close it all the way so
don't<00:00:47.579> go<00:00:47.850> buying<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.270> new<00:00:48.420> couple<00:00:48.780> or<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.079> yet

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
don't go buying a new couple or just yet

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.100 
don't go buying a new couple or just yet
because<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.770> might<00:00:49.950> be<00:00:50.070> able<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.340> fix<00:00:50.489> yours

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
because you might be able to fix yours

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.569 
because you might be able to fix yours
first<00:00:52.110> thing<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.289> have<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.469> do<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.890> remove

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
first thing you have to do is remove

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.020 
first thing you have to do is remove
what<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.600> known<00:00:55.170> as<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:56.100> hazard<00:00:56.520> trim<00:00:56.850> which

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
what is known as the hazard trim which

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.900 
what is known as the hazard trim which
goes<00:00:57.239> around<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.070> that<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.340> probably<00:00:59.730> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
goes around here and that is probably a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.130 
goes around here and that is probably a
little<00:01:00.030> bit<00:01:00.239> easier<00:01:00.420> said<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.930> done<00:01:01.550> but<00:01:02.550> I

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
little bit easier said and done but I

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.570 
little bit easier said and done but I
did<00:01:04.140> manage<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.439> get<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:04.890> my<00:01:05.010> section<00:01:05.369> tent

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
did manage to get it on my section tent

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.730 
did manage to get it on my section tent
first<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.330> tried<00:01:06.570> prying<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> corner

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
first I tried prying here in the corner

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.649 
first I tried prying here in the corner
and<00:01:07.920> then<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.820> worked<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.090> well<00:01:09.270> because<00:01:09.420> I

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
and then it worked so well because I

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.510 
and then it worked so well because I
managed<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.820> chip<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.240> ever<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:12.990> slightly

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
managed to chip it just ever so slightly

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.800 
managed to chip it just ever so slightly
then<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.549> found<00:01:14.760> another<00:01:15.030> online<00:01:15.420> resource

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
then I found another online resource

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.670 
then I found another online resource
that<00:01:15.930> shows<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.960> actually<00:01:18.960> hold

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
that shows that you can actually hold

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.910 
that shows that you can actually hold
your<00:01:19.799> cup<00:01:19.979> holder<00:01:20.159> open<00:01:20.640> halfway<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:22.500> right

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
your cup holder open halfway and right

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.800 
your cup holder open halfway and right
in<00:01:23.040> between<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.729> middle<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.630> take<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
in between in the middle if you take a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.230 
in between in the middle if you take a
butter<00:01:25.080> knife<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.920> stick<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.369> up<00:01:26.460> inside

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
butter knife you can stick it up inside

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.480 
butter knife you can stick it up inside
that<00:01:27.509> space<00:01:28.290> between<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.770> cup<00:01:28.950> holder<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
that space between the cup holder and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.830 
that space between the cup holder and
the<00:01:29.820> trim<00:01:30.060> piece<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.950> turn<00:01:31.950> your<00:01:32.840> either

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the trim piece and turn your either

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.319 
the trim piece and turn your either
screwdriver<00:01:34.470> or<00:01:34.860> knife<00:01:35.369> sideways<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.150> it

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
screwdriver or knife sideways and it

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.850 
screwdriver or knife sideways and it
will<00:01:36.540> pry<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.869> off<00:01:38.329> so<00:01:39.329> here's<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.079> trim<00:01:40.650> piece

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
will pry it off so here's the trim piece

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.740 
will pry it off so here's the trim piece
I<00:01:41.009> was<00:01:41.070> referring<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.579> earlier<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.299> hazard

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
I was referring to earlier the hazard

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.310 
I was referring to earlier the hazard
trim<00:01:43.049> or<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.350> center<00:01:44.040> console<00:01:44.399> trim<00:01:44.689> and<00:01:45.689> as

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
trim or the center console trim and as

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.649 
trim or the center console trim and as
you<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.619> see<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.920> did<00:01:47.310> manage<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.820> chip<00:01:48.360> mine

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
you can see I did manage to chip mine

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.139 
you can see I did manage to chip mine
but<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.290> found<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.159> piece<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.549> chipped<00:01:50.909> and

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
but I found the piece that chipped and

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.660 
but I found the piece that chipped and
crazy<00:01:51.780> glue<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.259> back<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.710> we'll<00:01:53.130> see<00:01:53.430> if<00:01:53.520> it

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
crazy glue to back on we'll see if it

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.690 
crazy glue to back on we'll see if it
stays<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:55.700> barely<00:01:56.700> see<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.210> now<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:58.700> when

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
stays just barely see it now and when

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.870 
stays just barely see it now and when
you<00:01:59.790> do<00:01:59.909> pull<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:01.369> here<00:02:02.369> are<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> clips

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
you do pull this out here are the clips

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.240 
you do pull this out here are the clips
that<00:02:03.119> will<00:02:03.390> most<00:02:03.570> likely<00:02:03.780> break<00:02:04.170> off<00:02:04.409> so

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
that will most likely break off so

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.429 
that will most likely break off so
actually<00:02:05.640> five<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.509> six<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.899> mine<00:02:07.049> managed

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
actually five of the six of mine managed

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.309 
actually five of the six of mine managed
to<00:02:07.560> stay<00:02:07.770> intact<00:02:08.160> without<00:02:08.640> breaking<00:02:09.270> but<00:02:10.110> this

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
to stay intact without breaking but this

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.320 
to stay intact without breaking but this
one<00:02:10.590> probably<00:02:11.400> from<00:02:11.610> where<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.819> tried<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.150> pry

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
one probably from where I tried to pry

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.170 
one probably from where I tried to pry
it<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> first<00:02:12.750> time<00:02:12.930> did<00:02:13.200> break<00:02:13.410> off

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
it the first time did break off

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.110 
it the first time did break off
so<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.210> just<00:02:15.480> pushed<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.260> back<00:02:16.440> on<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:16.800> place

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
so I just pushed it back on in place

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.620 
so I just pushed it back on in place
crazy<00:02:18.120> glued<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:19.310> I'm<00:02:20.310> going<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.360> let<00:02:21.510> this

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
crazy glued it and I'm going to let this

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.110 
crazy glued it and I'm going to let this
dry<00:02:21.690> overnight<00:02:22.110> before<00:02:22.860> attempting<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.790> put

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
dry overnight before attempting to put

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.199 
dry overnight before attempting to put
it<00:02:24.209> back<00:02:24.330> in<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.630> car<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:26.340> take<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:26.819> apart

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
it back in the car so take this apart

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.730 
it back in the car so take this apart
you'll<00:02:27.780> see<00:02:27.959> that<00:02:28.080> there's<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.350> little<00:02:28.560> tiny

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
you'll see that there's a little tiny

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.670 
you'll see that there's a little tiny
gear<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.970> backside<00:02:30.420> here<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.930> all<00:02:31.440> that

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
gear on the backside here and all that

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.210 
gear on the backside here and all that
gear<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.010> for<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:33.180> damper<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.590> think<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:34.980> your

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
gear is for is a damper so think of your

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.130 
gear is for is a damper so think of your
classic<00:02:35.670> spring<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.240> vibration<00:02:36.720> down<00:02:36.900> for

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
classic spring and vibration down for

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.410 
classic spring and vibration down for
example<00:02:37.290> where<00:02:37.740> we<00:02:38.430> have<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.640> coiled<00:02:39.060> spring

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
example where we have a coiled spring

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.330 
example where we have a coiled spring
and<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.110> damper<00:02:40.290> just<00:02:40.709> keeps<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.040> from<00:02:41.160> going

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
and the damper just keeps it from going

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.960 
and the damper just keeps it from going
too<00:02:41.550> quickly

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
too quickly

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.040 
too quickly
well<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:43.230> basically<00:02:43.590> just<00:02:43.709> pops<00:02:44.400> out

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
well this basically just pops out

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.820 
well this basically just pops out
there's<00:02:46.050> two<00:02:46.350> little<00:02:46.500> clips<00:02:46.680> inside<00:02:48.830> pushing

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
there's two little clips inside pushing

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.580 
there's two little clips inside pushing
with<00:02:50.070> your<00:02:50.220> finger<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:51.750> just<00:02:51.930> flies<00:02:52.200> right<00:02:52.320> out

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
with your finger it just flies right out

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.259 
with your finger it just flies right out
of<00:02:52.620> there

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
of there

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.180 
of there
next<00:02:54.269> thing<00:02:54.390> when<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.570> open<00:02:54.810> this<00:02:55.010> you'll<00:02:56.010> see

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
next thing when you open this you'll see

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.250 
next thing when you open this you'll see
that<00:02:56.340> there's<00:02:56.550> also<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:59.390> rubber<00:03:00.390> stop<00:03:00.810> here

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
that there's also a rubber stop here

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.340 
that there's also a rubber stop here
teaching<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:01.830> from<00:03:01.980> flying<00:03:02.190> all<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.519> way<00:03:02.610> out

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
teaching it from flying all the way out

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.479 
teaching it from flying all the way out
you<00:03:04.350> can<00:03:04.500> typically<00:03:04.920> just<00:03:05.190> put<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:08.280> just

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
you can typically just put and you just

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.340 
you can typically just put and you just
started<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.970> constant<00:03:09.480> force<00:03:09.690> spring<00:03:10.080> just

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
started the constant force spring just

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.780 
started the constant force spring just
fall<00:03:10.560> apart<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:11.160> can<00:03:11.880> typically<00:03:13.430> take<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.459> tool

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
fall apart you can typically take a tool

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.090 
fall apart you can typically take a tool
like<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.120> small<00:03:15.450> flat<00:03:15.750> bladed<00:03:15.989> screwdriver<00:03:19.100> try

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
like a small flat bladed screwdriver try

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.509 
like a small flat bladed screwdriver try
it<00:03:20.160> under<00:03:20.430> here<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:22.799> a<00:03:22.890> whole<00:03:23.040> unit<00:03:23.340> comes

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
it under here and a whole unit comes

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.789 
it under here and a whole unit comes
apart<00:03:23.850> it's<00:03:24.510> not<00:03:24.720> some<00:03:24.900> two<00:03:25.019> pieces<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.620> guess

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
apart it's not some two pieces and guess

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.600 
apart it's not some two pieces and guess
what<00:03:25.950> flat<00:03:26.130> out<00:03:27.530> your<00:03:28.530> constant<00:03:29.070> force<00:03:29.280> spring

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
what flat out your constant force spring

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.990 
what flat out your constant force spring
and<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.769> little<00:03:31.769> cylinder<00:03:32.010> on<00:03:32.250> which<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.610> rides

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
and a little cylinder on which it rides

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.370 
and a little cylinder on which it rides
on<00:03:35.120> so<00:03:36.120> what<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:36.510> want<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.720> do<00:03:36.810> is<00:03:36.959> make<00:03:37.350> sure

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
on so what you want to do is make sure

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.560 
on so what you want to do is make sure
you<00:03:37.590> clean<00:03:37.860> this<00:03:38.010> up<00:03:38.190> get<00:03:38.940> all<00:03:39.120> sorts<00:03:39.510> of

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
you clean this up get all sorts of

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.360 
you clean this up get all sorts of
residue<00:03:39.930> on<00:03:40.110> there<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.560> should<00:03:40.799> function<00:03:41.010> very

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
residue on there it should function very

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.030 
residue on there it should function very
smoothly<00:03:41.670> by<00:03:41.910> itself<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:43.709> then<00:03:43.799> all<00:03:43.920> that's

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
smoothly by itself and then all that's

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.319 
smoothly by itself and then all that's
left<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.400> this<00:03:44.519> piece<00:03:44.760> now<00:03:44.970> there's<00:03:45.180> no<00:03:45.299> I

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
left of this piece now there's no I

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.150 
left of this piece now there's no I
don't<00:03:45.690> floating<00:03:46.019> around<00:03:46.110> here<00:03:46.470> now<00:03:46.950> that

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
don't floating around here now that

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.819 
don't floating around here now that
really<00:03:47.340> this<00:03:47.430> is<00:03:47.549> a<00:03:47.579> plastic<00:03:47.820> piece<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.829> as

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
really this is a plastic piece that as

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.699 
really this is a plastic piece that as
the<00:03:50.760> is<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.269> light<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.810> little<00:03:52.170> light<00:03:52.380> bulb<00:03:52.590> and

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
the is the light a little light bulb and

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.410 
the is the light a little light bulb and
back<00:03:52.920> you<00:03:53.459> can<00:03:53.640> remove<00:03:53.820> that<00:03:53.880> if<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.180> want<00:03:54.329> to

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
back you can remove that if you want to

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.640 
back you can remove that if you want to
but<00:03:54.540> it's<00:03:54.660> really<00:03:54.690> not<00:03:54.959> necessary<00:03:55.380> for<00:03:55.590> the

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
but it's really not necessary for the

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.699 
but it's really not necessary for the
repair<00:03:58.220> but<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.280> can<00:03:59.430> see<00:03:59.670> where<00:04:00.500> this<00:04:01.500> is

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
repair but you can see where this is

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.990 
repair but you can see where this is
this<00:04:02.459> is<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.760> top<00:04:03.680> facing<00:04:04.680> up<00:04:04.799> right<00:04:05.040> the

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
this is the top facing up right the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.300 
this is the top facing up right the
constant<00:04:06.450> force<00:04:06.690> spring<00:04:07.019> actually<00:04:07.680> sits<00:04:08.160> in

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
constant force spring actually sits in

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.160 
constant force spring actually sits in
here<00:04:09.859> and<00:04:10.859> when<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.040> cupholders<00:04:11.489> inside<00:04:12.170> this

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
here and when the cupholders inside this

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.680 
here and when the cupholders inside this
all<00:04:13.410> stretched<00:04:13.829> up<00:04:14.299> such<00:04:15.299> that<00:04:15.510> when<00:04:15.660> you

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
all stretched up such that when you

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.270 
all stretched up such that when you
actuate<00:04:16.320> it

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
actuate it

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.680 
actuate it
it<00:04:18.850> will<00:04:19.380> want<00:04:20.380> to<00:04:20.560> spring<00:04:20.920> outward<00:04:21.630> so<00:04:22.630> I'm

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
it will want to spring outward so I'm

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.240 
it will want to spring outward so I'm
going<00:04:22.870> to<00:04:22.900> try<00:04:23.110> to<00:04:23.170> stick<00:04:23.560> it<00:04:23.650> in<00:04:23.740> here<00:04:24.010> I'm

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
going to try to stick it in here I'm

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:32.730 
going to try to stick it in here I'm
going<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:24.490> move<00:04:24.640> I<00:04:27.810> put<00:04:28.810> it<00:04:28.900> inside<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:32.590> I'm

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
going to move I put it inside and I'm

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.830 
going to move I put it inside and I'm
not<00:04:32.890> sure<00:04:33.070> if<00:04:33.160> you<00:04:33.220> can<00:04:33.310> see<00:04:33.550> here<00:04:33.730> but<00:04:34.030> now<00:04:34.810> I

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
not sure if you can see here but now I

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.820 
not sure if you can see here but now I
can<00:04:35.020> focus<00:04:35.200> it

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
can focus it

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:43.560 
can focus it
so<00:04:36.250> just<00:04:36.670> fell<00:04:36.850> out<00:04:40.350> I'm<00:04:41.350> going<00:04:41.590> to<00:04:41.650> try<00:04:41.980> to<00:04:42.570> get

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
so just fell out I'm going to try to get

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.000 
so just fell out I'm going to try to get
it<00:04:43.690> in<00:04:43.840> here<00:04:44.050> right<00:04:44.260> on<00:04:44.290> top<00:04:44.560> of<00:04:44.650> this<00:04:44.770> clear

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
it in here right on top of this clear

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:51.900 
it in here right on top of this clear
plastic<00:04:45.040> piece<00:04:46.170> that's<00:04:47.170> the<00:04:48.600> lightbulb<00:04:50.910> path

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
plastic piece that's the lightbulb path

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.330 
plastic piece that's the lightbulb path
I<00:04:52.390> guess<00:04:53.200> it<00:04:53.380> could<00:04:53.500> be<00:04:53.560> like<00:04:53.710> a<00:04:53.740> fiber<00:04:54.130> optic

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
I guess it could be like a fiber optic

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.450 
I guess it could be like a fiber optic
you<00:04:54.760> could<00:04:54.970> call<00:04:55.150> it<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:56.740> it<00:04:56.830> will<00:04:57.040> release<00:04:59.460> if

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
you could call it and it will release if

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.140 
you could call it and it will release if
it's<00:05:00.670> one<00:05:01.300> enough<00:05:02.220> I'm<00:05:03.220> going<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.550> try<00:05:03.760> to<00:05:03.820> push

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
it's one enough I'm going to try to push

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:14.730 
it's one enough I'm going to try to push
it<00:05:04.300> in<00:05:04.420> there<00:05:04.980> and<00:05:05.980> hopefully<00:05:06.220> it'll<00:05:06.520> stay

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.870 

so<00:05:15.740> I<00:05:15.770> might<00:05:15.920> want<00:05:15.980> to<00:05:16.190> bend<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.430> spring<00:05:16.700> back

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
so I might want to bend the spring back

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.080 
so I might want to bend the spring back
a<00:05:16.910> little<00:05:17.120> bit<00:05:17.270> and<00:05:17.540> make<00:05:17.690> sure<00:05:18.820> it<00:05:19.820> clicks

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
a little bit and make sure it clicks

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.750 
a little bit and make sure it clicks
right<00:05:20.330> in<00:05:20.630> there<00:05:21.250> so<00:05:22.250> if<00:05:22.310> you<00:05:22.370> hold<00:05:22.550> it<00:05:22.610> with

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
right in there so if you hold it with

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.540 
right in there so if you hold it with
one<00:05:22.970> finger<00:05:23.440> you<00:05:24.440> can<00:05:24.590> typically<00:05:25.040> get<00:05:25.250> enough

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
one finger you can typically get enough

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:32.050 
one finger you can typically get enough
room<00:05:28.990> get<00:05:29.990> your<00:05:30.230> other<00:05:30.890> fingers<00:05:31.520> in<00:05:31.700> there

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
room get your other fingers in there

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.390 
room get your other fingers in there
of<00:05:32.600> course<00:05:32.900> it's<00:05:33.440> just<00:05:33.710> released<00:05:36.250> and<00:05:37.250> then

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
of course it's just released and then

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:48.880 
of course it's just released and then
air<00:05:37.550> comes<00:05:37.850> out<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.180> bottom<00:05:38.270> again<00:05:47.620> so<00:05:48.620> I<00:05:48.650> put

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
air comes out the bottom again so I put

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:58.210 
air comes out the bottom again so I put
the<00:05:49.010> screwdriver<00:05:49.490> in<00:05:50.680> apart<00:05:56.710> all<00:05:57.710> right<00:05:57.860> Plan

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
the screwdriver in apart all right Plan

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.670 
the screwdriver in apart all right Plan
B<00:05:58.460> I'll<00:05:58.820> see<00:05:59.030> if<00:05:59.120> this<00:05:59.270> works<00:05:59.480> better<00:05:59.720> I'm

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
B I'll see if this works better I'm

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:07.960 
B I'll see if this works better I'm
going<00:06:01.070> to<00:06:02.680> put<00:06:03.680> the<00:06:03.830> spring<00:06:04.130> on<00:06:06.790> stretch<00:06:07.790> it

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
going to put the spring on stretch it

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.550 
going to put the spring on stretch it
out<00:06:08.120> I<00:06:10.810> don't<00:06:11.810> hold<00:06:11.930> it<00:06:12.110> it's<00:06:12.320> a<00:06:12.380> little

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
out I don't hold it it's a little

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:26.190 
out I don't hold it it's a little
slippery<00:06:16.570> put<00:06:17.570> everything<00:06:19.360> back<00:06:20.360> inside

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.590 

would<00:06:27.200> probably<00:06:27.530> help<00:06:27.620> if<00:06:27.800> I<00:06:27.890> have<00:06:28.070> it<00:06:28.600> tucked

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
would probably help if I have it tucked

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.140 
would probably help if I have it tucked
orientation<00:06:30.430> and<00:06:31.430> now<00:06:33.310> with<00:06:34.310> the<00:06:34.460> cupholders

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
orientation and now with the cupholders

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:43.540 
orientation and now with the cupholders
slightly<00:06:35.840> open<00:06:37.660> push<00:06:38.660> the<00:06:38.900> spring<00:06:39.230> in<00:06:42.550> open

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
slightly open push the spring in open

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.290 
slightly open push the spring in open
close<00:06:44.510> this<00:06:44.720> now<00:06:44.930> what<00:06:45.590> the<00:06:46.010> last<00:06:46.220> part<00:06:46.520> is<00:06:46.730> to

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
close this now what the last part is to

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.620 
close this now what the last part is to
put<00:06:47.330> the<00:06:47.510> little<00:06:47.720> damping<00:06:48.500> gear<00:06:48.680> back<00:06:48.860> in<00:06:49.630> with

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
put the little damping gear back in with

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.900 
put the little damping gear back in with
it<00:06:50.780> closed<00:06:51.280> push<00:06:52.280> it<00:06:52.400> in<00:06:52.490> through<00:06:52.670> the<00:06:52.760> hole

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.910 
it closed push it in through the hole

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.990 
it closed push it in through the hole
pop<00:06:53.120> it<00:06:53.300> in<00:06:53.420> and<00:06:54.340> there<00:06:55.340> it<00:06:55.460> is<00:06:55.580> a<00:06:55.610> little

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 
pop it in and there it is a little

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.230 
pop it in and there it is a little
drivetrain<00:06:56.600> so<00:06:57.470> here<00:06:57.880> holding<00:06:58.880> it<00:06:58.970> upside

always try some glue but there should be

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.250 
always try some glue but there should be
enough<00:07:26.669> force<00:07:26.940> on<00:07:27.120> it<00:07:27.330> that<00:07:27.540> it<00:07:27.690> should<00:07:27.930> stay
