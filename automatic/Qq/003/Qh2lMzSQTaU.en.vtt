00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.240 
this thin oh and also I suggest you use
that<00:03:07.580> a<00:03:07.970> copywriter<00:03:08.930> that<00:03:09.290> is<00:03:09.380> not<00:03:09.620> this<00:03:09.950> wide

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
that a copywriter that is not this wide

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.830 
that a copywriter that is not this wide
because<00:03:10.489> that<00:03:11.120> my<00:03:11.570> like<00:03:12.500> come<00:03:12.799> off<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.489> LPS<00:03:13.940> um

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
aside so it can be easy to UM put on

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.090 
aside so it can be easy to UM put on
like<00:03:27.860> access<00:03:28.549> onto<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:29.750> LPS<00:03:30.700> for<00:03:31.700> an<00:03:31.910> example
