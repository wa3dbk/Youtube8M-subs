00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.850
 hardware info tv becomes possible 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.250
 created by msi 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.500
 in this episode of half good 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.500
 idea augustin 323 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.220
 welcome to hearts in for tv and time 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.490
 discussed a cheaper one ago 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.599
 asus windows 8 alleman pc there i was 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.970
 to criticize a few things 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.349
 include tea and screen but 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.620
 now also a more luxurious variant 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.870
 available and that is this in t 23100 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.040
 yes really made a little for for 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.960
 windows 8 of course with 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.269
 touchscreen that is so flat 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.300
 and what what what a bison does indeed work 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.530
 a eps screen full hd and and if you are after 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.879
 the design then looks a bit 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.909
 on that we novo him for a while 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.559
 and have discussed times and the 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:53.909
 technology of this all-in-one 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.799
 he is not behind the screen with you 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.420
 sit in the foot it makes is that she is one 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:58.559
 very handy foot we can put it on 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.479
 can place 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.869
 yes what your foot makes this device 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:05.309
 special because asus actually has something 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.560
 we can't have yours 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.640
 only as a traditional all-man PC 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.530
 I can use it just like that 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.630
 but also and I as a kind 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.950
 large tablet-like device can therefore 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.210
 so you can really do that screen completely 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.740
 so bring it down 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.509
 and then it becomes a kiki kind of a year 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.070
 also compare my bit with one 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.180
 lectern such thing you wherever you 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.130
 give a presentation 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.360
 watch as you go this way with your bag 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.040
 software is working on that of course 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.030
 a lot nicer and if that's in one 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.980
 right in front of you 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.450
 yes then just for your story for you 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.070
 poor is that nicer so just smooth 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.990
 girl keyboard away and so to get started 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.820
 and you want how again with traditional 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.870
 desktop applications get it started 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.450
 you try it high 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.860
 yes and then you can go yes and then what 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.390
 also very special is that you too 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.330
 not just shock and gone but I was him 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.440
 can tilt over there so you have 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.120
 actually a species 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.930
 coffee table actually and that is 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.909
 of course, really great course 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.530
 for example have a game or if you are with 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.670
 looking at each other's pictures 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.409
 then of course it is very funny 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.909
 yes , of course, as there are still 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.250
 not very much in the handkerchief 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.470
 Board games come in in those new ones 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.390
 metro interface or less soft 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.920
 interface should nowadays mention and 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.930
 not that hungry nicely with two and three men 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.569
 so the farmer tired those conversations 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.700
 mark will had before they hit the surface 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.870
 tablet will be so that survey system that 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.519
 the penis now in a different name 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.560
 montana to another name on the market 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.000
 but that is a kind of table with which 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.830
 touch differed 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.569
 applications and that is 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.840
 actually yes I have a whole here 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.549
 cheap service and table to you 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.440
 decision and wants us going is that they 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.690
 was from one 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.370
 nova type of device yes it was for them 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.840
 it also just did not look very luxurious 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.760
 from that it was that that again 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.400
 famous taiwanese easy await you 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.590
 less plastic this is green this looks 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.240
 great to note on a number 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.810
 even they have aluminum 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.400
 applied 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.660
 seeing technically is also pretty good 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.190
 interesting device to sit 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.080
 deepen Intel core processors 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.570
 inner copper version and in five 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.090
 quad-core in the more luxurious version i7 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.770
 3770 even so that is quite powerful 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.440
 turn out that so are the desktop 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.330
 variants not the mobile choir god and and 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.830
 whatever is minus the most expensive 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.350
 which variant is still combines with a 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.940
 gt 630 m well that is a graphic 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.290
 processor that is not very powerful 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.610
 but I just do a little bit 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.590
 offers a bonus compared to the 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.080
 intel hd graphics that are in the process of 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.580
 happened yes I feel this immediately 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.110
 on the side two then the bunch the 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.710
 connections that is on all is anyway 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.440
 really special 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.790
 yes yes look apple has that on of course 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.990
 a row on a number of models me that 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.120
 is indeed a very special one 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.680
 addition and with that they can 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.790
 create a super fast connection with 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.820
 for example an external hard drive 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.110
 cabin with pair of wide discs 3 and or 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.500
 how to example one more screens with 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.270
 the one with and the boat on it or you can have one 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.190
 connecting a network cable goes very well 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.800
 versatile and even has an optical one 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.120
 drive in 2012 sometimes wonder you have me 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.830
 needed but he can sit in it 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.540
 he's just in it and that is handy 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.310
 is that the two HDMI connection group 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.140
 sit one at an extra monitor on 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.030
 to close but also another to 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.290
 to be able to display a screen as a screen 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.209
 so you can use as second 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.320
 use the screen for your laptop but we 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.300
 also found a television tjoene 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.860
 and then connect this screen as one 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.440
 kind televisions use use 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.120
 yes this device goes quite a bit 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.280
 competitors get your in the night because 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.170
 all man with touch screen there we go 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.580
 many of them you rarely see the logo 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.140
 we already tested it a while ago 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.580
 for you with windows 7 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.910
 but now is my 20th on the 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.560
 market come the vaio tap 20 from sony 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.790
 for example and is very much more of it 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.230
 this kind of you actually we have one though 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.730
 the one should pay attention to what for 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.690
 processor is actually there 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.370
 one will of course be quite 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.020
 complicated because you are in the process 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.360
 if you have that s processor shitty 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.130
 Intel's mobile processors are those 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.810
 all have a poor performance level 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.250
 but here it is full 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.690
 desktop processes in new york but already in 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.890
 tns variants that 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.510
 and also that mobile variant it is one 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.400
 all would be just things 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.870
 they're just absolutely a piece 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.310
 slower than the first full-fledged 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.840
 desktop korey so when it comes to you 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.840
 speed then that is this one whole 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.040
 interesting device and whatever else 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.770
 point is what you can watch through how 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.480
 flexible is that device look just like 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.940
 that there is in windows 7 era of course 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.590
 enough were all-in-ones with one 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.030
 touchscreen, we will now be again 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.280
 but we are not going to be very much 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.690
 not with such clever clever black 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.220
 delivered so you all sorts 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.990
 additional options to that screen 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.960
 can not easily put 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.220
 yes then we put all that i that 2220 that 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.850
 we have previously tested that was really one 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.190
 bit 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.630
 the budget model 22 inch that mcm 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.830
 well that costs budgets 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.900
 one hundred thousand euros 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.730
 vinny eelco everything it relative for him 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.830
 this evie 320 dogs wants that 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.740
 more expensive by 1000 euros yes those songs 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.140
 from 12 9 9 the luxury version with a 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.140
 core i7 and then a 630 gt 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.630
 then you're on about 14 9 9 so that is 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.920
 not very cheap but yes for something 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.560
 you get for it is a very nice one 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.450
 configuration, we conclude this 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.400
 episode of hart liver tv 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.560
 don't forget we are one every monday 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.940
 Wednesday and Friday 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.920
 long weather for watching and until the 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.360
 next time 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.630
 you a factory where death used to be 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.310
 star came from 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.990
 he is now moving to toshiba and that 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.670
 have joined together now is just in 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.840
 cooperation with west end is tom that is 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.840
 a very complicated process
