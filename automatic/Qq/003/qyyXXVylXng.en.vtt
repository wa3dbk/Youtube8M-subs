00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.329
 which in the list is positioned exactly 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.600
 halfway between the little fabio

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.950
 but we also believe that it has great 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.380
 potential even in the fleet world 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.780
