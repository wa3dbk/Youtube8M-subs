expands travelling to the ewok dude

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.950 
expands travelling to the ewok dude
because<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:17.790> ought<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.000> saves<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.480> game<00:03:18.660> and

because it ought to saves the game and

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.200 
because it ought to saves the game and
if<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.620> sold<00:03:19.860> more<00:03:20.070> than<00:03:20.220> 21<00:03:20.670> items<00:03:21.000> by

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
if you sold more than 21 items by

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.290

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
armor and you save it you could lose it

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.800 
armor and you save it you could lose it
so<00:03:33.120> it's<00:03:33.390> better<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:33.990> run<00:03:34.230> by<00:03:34.740> back<00:03:35.070> and
