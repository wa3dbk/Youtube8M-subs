this<00:02:07.069> dubbing<00:02:07.490> does<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:08.630> I'm<00:02:08.780> spinning<00:02:09.380> it<00:02:09.440> up

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
this dubbing does so I'm spinning it up

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.290 
this dubbing does so I'm spinning it up
nice<00:02:09.769> and<00:02:09.800> tight<00:02:10.160> I'm<00:02:10.340> wrapping<00:02:10.759> it<00:02:10.819> around<00:02:10.910> my

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
nice and tight I'm wrapping it around my

the length of the dubbing rope and

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.920 
the length of the dubbing rope and
that's<00:02:22.220> going<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.610> pop<00:02:22.910> out<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.330> wiggly<00:02:23.540> legs

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
that's going to pop out the wiggly legs

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.710 
that's going to pop out the wiggly legs
so<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.290> they<00:02:24.530> aren't<00:02:24.970> kind<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.090> tangled<00:02:26.540> and

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
so that they aren't kind of tangled and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.600 
so that they aren't kind of tangled and
it's<00:02:27.290> going<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.590> fluff<00:02:27.830> this<00:02:28.069> up<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.370> little<00:02:28.489> bit

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
it's going to fluff this up a little bit

and cut out the forward portion of it
and<00:05:36.430> this<00:05:36.700> can<00:05:36.880> be<00:05:37.000> a<00:05:37.030> little<00:05:37.180> bit<00:05:37.390> tricky<00:05:37.750> it

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
and this can be a little bit tricky it

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:38.940 
and this can be a little bit tricky it
can<00:05:37.840> be<00:05:38.020> hard<00:05:38.200> to<00:05:38.320> get<00:05:38.410> your<00:05:38.470> scissors<00:05:38.920> in

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
there and get this clean you might end

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.710 
there and get this clean you might end
up<00:05:41.860> with<00:05:42.010> a<00:05:42.070> little<00:05:42.340> tuft<00:05:42.970> of<00:05:43.180> the<00:05:43.540> dub
