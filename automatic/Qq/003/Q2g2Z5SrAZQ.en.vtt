00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.380 
want 236 grams is what we're talking
about<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.829> weight<00:02:05.009> department<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:05.969> I've

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
about in the weight department here I've

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.479 
about in the weight department here I've
already<00:02:06.719> put<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.500> model<00:02:07.829> phone<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.340> the

already put it on the model phone in the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.190 
already put it on the model phone in the
gold<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.000> you'll<00:02:09.119> get<00:02:09.239> an<00:02:09.360> idea<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.810> what<00:02:10.020> this

gold so you'll get an idea of what this

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.199 
gold so you'll get an idea of what this
is<00:02:10.259> going<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.709> look<00:02:10.979> like<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.520> little<00:02:11.940> bit<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.150> a

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
is going to look like a little bit of a

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.820 
is going to look like a little bit of a
lay<00:02:12.330> on<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.599> table<00:02:12.750> design<00:02:12.930> that's<00:02:13.560> what

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
lay on the table design that's what

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.620 
lay on the table design that's what
looks<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:14.160> along<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.760> side<00:02:14.970> again<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:15.480> is

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
looks like along the side again this is

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.260 
looks like along the side again this is
a<00:02:15.660> real<00:02:15.990> aluminum<00:02:16.620> bumper<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.120> other

Burris iron shield this is the vers
crystal<00:02:27.810> mix<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.380> I've<00:02:29.040> got<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.520> two

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
crystal mix and I've got it in two

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.670 
crystal mix and I've got it in two
different<00:02:29.790> colors<00:02:30.180> kind<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.750> it's<00:02:31.500> almost

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
different colors kind of a it's almost

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.560 
different colors kind of a it's almost
like<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:31.920> tiffany<00:02:32.430> blue<00:02:32.730> here<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.270> then<00:02:33.420> that

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
like a tiffany blue here and then that

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.810 
like a tiffany blue here and then that
one's<00:02:33.810> gray<00:02:34.260> here<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.130> packing<00:02:35.520> that<00:02:35.700> it

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
one's gray here is the packing that it

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.180 
one's gray here is the packing that it
comes<00:02:36.060> in<00:02:36.300> now<00:02:36.720> when<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.140> comes<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.950> you

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
are gonna have to peel off a protective

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.630 
are gonna have to peel off a protective
film<00:02:40.110> both<00:02:40.380> on<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:40.740> side<00:02:40.980> as<00:02:41.160> well<00:02:41.280> as<00:02:41.490> on

film both on this side as well as on
this<00:02:41.820> side<00:02:41.880> I'm<00:02:42.420> gonna<00:02:42.600> demo<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:42.960> on<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.530> gray

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
this side I'm gonna demo it on the gray

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.530 
this side I'm gonna demo it on the gray
color<00:02:44.220> but<00:02:44.490> let<00:02:44.610> me<00:02:44.670> pull<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.970> scale<00:02:45.210> into

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
color but let me pull the scale into

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.540 
color but let me pull the scale into
view<00:02:45.720> real<00:02:45.900> quickly<00:02:46.170> here<00:02:46.590> zero<00:02:47.190> grams

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
view real quickly here zero grams

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.250 
view real quickly here zero grams
popping<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.240> on<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.510> scale<00:02:48.750> remember<00:02:49.110> we've

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
popping it on the scale remember we've

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.990 
popping it on the scale remember we've
got<00:02:49.410> those<00:02:49.560> two<00:02:49.620> films<00:02:50.190> on<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.520> ain't<00:02:50.790> really

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
got those two films on it ain't really

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.220 
got those two films on it ain't really
gonna<00:02:51.090> make<00:02:51.240> that<00:02:51.420> much<00:02:51.630> of<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.870> difference

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
gonna make that much of a difference

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.680 
gonna make that much of a difference
though<00:02:52.440> 25<00:02:53.310> grams<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:54.209> what<00:02:54.360> we're<00:02:54.480> talking

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
though 25 grams is what we're talking

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.270 
though 25 grams is what we're talking
about<00:02:54.959> with<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:55.410> one<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.040> pretty

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
about with this one so pretty

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.520 
about with this one so pretty
lightweight<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.970> here<00:02:57.630> is<00:02:57.780> what<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.170> crystal

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
lightweight and here is what the crystal

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.680 
lightweight and here is what the crystal
mix<00:02:58.740> is<00:02:58.890> going<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.250> look<00:02:59.430> like<00:02:59.459> up<00:03:00.150> close<00:03:00.209> a

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
mix is going to look like up close a

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.090 
mix is going to look like up close a
little<00:03:01.080> bit<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> lay<00:03:01.410> on<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.620> table<00:03:01.770> design

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
little bit of a lay on the table design

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.190 
little bit of a lay on the table design
along<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.910> side<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.330> can<00:03:03.480> see<00:03:03.540> what<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:04.020> is

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
along the side you can see what this is

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.970 
along the side you can see what this is
going<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.680> look<00:03:04.890> like<00:03:04.920> up<00:03:05.910> along<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.570> top

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
going to look like up along the top
