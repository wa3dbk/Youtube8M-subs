 topics in the link that is below we live 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.719
 in a society where adults 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.549
 they analyze everything and then it arrives super 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.739
 processed for children that only 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.389
 they want a toy they do not want an example 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.400
 they just want to play alone than in a 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.260
 cool moment comes this doll that does not 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.090
 have any accessories because only 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.400
 wants to be loved as it is instead

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.069
 too much things and even made a 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.090
 video but they are to start the 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.590
 conversation because I think 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.909
 interesting and my perception the breasts 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.200
 they are no longer an audience with which I can 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.579
 have this conversation so the 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.959
 comments please comments 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.430
