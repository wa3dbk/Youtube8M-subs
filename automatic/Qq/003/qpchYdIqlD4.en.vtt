00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Good day to all ours with you 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.660
 channel and today we will draw 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.660
 cone let's go 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.810
 and what we need to do is 1 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.540
 pencil you can take any but 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.619
 preferably the ball is the second 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.930
 eraser and the third is a sheet with 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.000
 what are we going to start drawing our cone for 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.210
 start let's pick an approximate 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.070
 the location of our cone suppose 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.530
 he will be with us in this 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:50.510
 area first we need to spend 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:55.140
 the central axis of our cone is this line 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.000
 being the center of the circle which 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.640
 turn is the foundation of our 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.659
 cone 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:06.570
 after having drawn the axes we draw 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:11.640
 intersection point of base and height 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.909
 of our cone then choose the thickness 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.600
 of our cone let's be with us 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.600
 so here 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.670
 then draw an ellipse which is 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.580
 the base of our cone 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:35.900
 we draw an ellipse because we look 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.810
 on a circle at an angle tilted and 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.979
 it will no longer be a circle 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:49.460
 and the moisture oval must be drawn 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:54.020
 with rounded ends to thickness to 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:58.450
 he looked more beautiful than sharp 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.720
 sharp ends are not very 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.570
 beautiful 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.670
 much nicer to look at the circle 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:12.830
 ellipse with flatter ends then 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:15.310
 connect the points with the highest point of ours 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.310
 cone 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.860
 actually building a cone we 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.070
 fulfilled 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.580
 then erase all additional lines 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.460
 which we drew and leave only 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:41.470
 these two lines connecting these points with 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:41.470
 height and visible part of the circumference 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:01.950
 then to give our cone the volume 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:05.799
 need to make shadows for this let's 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.000
 draw in theory how they will look 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.379
 our shadows to begin with 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.530
 suppose where will our 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:20.560
 the light source then the nearest 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.389
 participated to the light source will 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:28.959
 be according to the teachings as this site 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:32.260
 moves away and will be farther from us those 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:36.060
 than this site in which it will be already 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:40.500
 go black 1 hour as the call and receive 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:44.739
 he will be in the tone of the penumbra that is gray 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:47.099
 Then there is a section of black metal. 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:52.450
 let our light shine 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:57.340
 hence it will be white 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:02.620
 a large part of the penumbra which is his 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.470
 the queue is divided into shadow reflex and semi 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.150
 bti 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.169
 the relationship of these sites will be one to 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.510
 three relatively large penumbra 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:20.500
 first we shade a big one 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:25.630
 received after that we shade 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:27.820
 shadow i mean warmer reflex we 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.460
 We will perform as well as in the cylinder 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.280
 ie paint the first all in one and 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.849
 shadows and more precisely 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.409
 reflex painting over emmet and why just 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.150
 let's go a little bit of erasure 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:45.099
 rubber band so that we have a reflex 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.430
 recall the reflex is a reflection of objects 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:51.430
 or the surface behind the object 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.210
 which we are drawing as we see with us 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.840
 it turned out 5 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.210
 layers or tones of the theme 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.520
 after that just transferring them to 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.830
 I will have a big cone of light 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:10.310
 saint as well as in theory 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.310
 from here and start hatching 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.240
 then after we finished 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:06.960
 hatch can bring our room 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:10.220
 order that is more clearly highlight 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.220
 the boundaries of our cone 

00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:22.139
 then if we stake on 

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:25.319
 any surface desirable 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:30.059
 draw shadow shadows are drawn very 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:31.199
 just from the cone itself gradually 

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:34.050
 lightens tons 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:38.360
 paint over the area located behind 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.360
 cone begin to hatch 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:00.970
 Here we actually started our cone as 

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:04.129
 we see it turned out very good 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:06.830
 the main thing to remember is five 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:10.069
 pitch layers the rest is all just 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.900
 building to theory thanks for watching 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:15.139
 subscribe to our channel put 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.590
 likes comment video thank you all 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:17.590
 until
