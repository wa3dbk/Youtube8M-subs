all I've done off-camera is to situate

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.020 
all I've done off-camera is to situate
my<00:00:08.630> template<00:00:09.230> on<00:00:09.380> here<00:00:09.800> and<00:00:09.980> drill<00:00:10.820> the

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
my template on here and drill the

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.870 
my template on here and drill the
registration<00:00:11.930> holes<00:00:12.200> and<00:00:12.530> you<00:00:13.490> might<00:00:13.700> as<00:00:13.820> well

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
this lower transverse brace ends here I

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.810 
this lower transverse brace ends here I
made<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.290> marks<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:34.160> then<00:00:34.340> I've<00:00:34.460> drawn<00:00:34.790> a

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
made the marks and then I've drawn a

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.200 
made the marks and then I've drawn a
line<00:00:35.120> across<00:00:35.540> here<00:00:36.340> these<00:00:37.340> is<00:00:37.699> just<00:00:38.030> two

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
line across here these is just two

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.400 
line across here these is just two

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
pieces of basswood

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.290 
pieces of basswood
which<00:00:40.160> is<00:00:40.250> about<00:00:40.430> a<00:00:40.460> little<00:00:40.670> over<00:00:40.910> four

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
which is about a little over four

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.630 
which is about a little over four
millimeters<00:00:42.050> in<00:00:42.230> thickness<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:42.920> we're<00:00:43.550> gonna

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
millimeters in thickness and we're gonna

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.880 
millimeters in thickness and we're gonna
cover<00:00:44.030> up<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:44.510> lower<00:00:44.719> back<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:45.350> just<00:00:45.739> the

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
carving here we're going to create a

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.480 
carving here we're going to create a

millimeters<00:01:13.280> lower<00:01:14.270> than<00:01:14.600> flat<00:01:15.079> over<00:01:15.650> here<00:01:15.950> in

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
millimeters lower than flat over here in

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.550 
millimeters lower than flat over here in
order<00:01:17.060> not<00:01:17.270> to<00:01:17.299> have<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.900> sculpt<00:01:18.320> this

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
order not to have to sculpt this

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.350 
order not to have to sculpt this
fingerboard<00:01:19.250> we're<00:01:19.460> going<00:01:19.579> to<00:01:19.640> have<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:20.030> raise

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
fingerboard we're going to have to raise

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.499 
fingerboard we're going to have to raise
this<00:01:20.810> up<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:21.290> little<00:01:21.470> bit<00:01:21.680> so<00:01:22.340> right<00:01:23.090> at<00:01:23.299> this

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
this up a little bit so right at this

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.440 
this up a little bit so right at this
spot<00:01:23.899> where<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.560> fingerboard<00:01:25.180> meets<00:01:26.180> the

spot where the fingerboard meets the
inside<00:01:27.140> part<00:01:27.799> of<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.070> sound<00:01:28.369> hole<00:01:28.729> you<00:01:29.450> want

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
inside part of the sound hole you want

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.350 
inside part of the sound hole you want
to<00:01:29.780> take<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.020> pin<00:01:30.439> and<00:01:30.470> just<00:01:31.280> mark<00:01:31.610> a<00:01:31.850> spot<00:01:32.119> right

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
to take a pin and just mark a spot right

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.410 
to take a pin and just mark a spot right
there<00:01:32.780> that's<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:34.070> break<00:01:34.549> point<00:01:34.939> no<00:01:35.149> is<00:01:35.299> it

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
there that's the break point no is it

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.420 
there that's the break point no is it
will<00:01:35.540> be<00:01:35.659> no<00:01:35.869> fingerboard<00:01:36.619> touching<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.189> top

will be no fingerboard touching the top

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.959 
will be no fingerboard touching the top
beyond<00:01:37.939> that<00:01:38.240> spot<00:01:38.860> measure<00:01:39.860> from<00:01:40.159> here<00:01:40.579> to

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 
beyond that spot measure from here to

the top of the transverse brace or the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.010 
the top of the transverse brace or the
line<00:01:43.460> you<00:01:43.640> made<00:01:43.820> for<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.180> transverse<00:01:44.570> brace

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
line you made for the transverse brace

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.260 
line you made for the transverse brace
then<00:01:45.530> move<00:01:45.860> it<00:01:46.009> over<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.369> here<00:01:46.399> and<00:01:46.939> make

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
then move it over to here and make

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.880 
then move it over to here and make
another<00:01:47.570> mark<00:01:47.930> here<00:01:48.289> which<00:01:48.500> we've<00:01:48.740> already

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
another mark here which we've already

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.190 
another mark here which we've already
done<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.610> then<00:01:50.270> we're<00:01:50.780> going<00:01:50.869> to<00:01:50.930> take<00:01:51.140> a

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
done and then we're going to take a

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.980 
done and then we're going to take a
straightedge<00:01:51.619> connect<00:01:52.520> those<00:01:52.729> two<00:01:53.149> lines<00:01:53.479> and

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
straightedge connect those two lines and

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.889 
straightedge connect those two lines and
bring<00:01:54.890> them<00:01:55.070> outside<00:01:55.670> of<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:55.969> boundaries<00:01:56.509> so

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
bring them outside of the boundaries so

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.660 
bring them outside of the boundaries so
that<00:01:57.049> we<00:01:57.200> can<00:01:57.350> see<00:01:57.680> them<00:01:57.829> when<00:01:58.100> we<00:01:58.219> put<00:01:58.490> the

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
that we can see them when we put the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.240 
that we can see them when we put the
piece<00:01:59.180> of<00:01:59.210> wood<00:01:59.539> on<00:01:59.750> here<00:02:00.079> so<00:02:00.920> what<00:02:01.100> we're

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
piece of wood on here so what we're

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.219 
piece of wood on here so what we're
going<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:01.430> do<00:02:01.700> is<00:02:02.000> put<00:02:02.509> a<00:02:02.539> piece<00:02:02.630> of<00:02:02.840> wood

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
going to do is put a piece of wood

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.310 
going to do is put a piece of wood
that's<00:02:03.950> going<00:02:04.189> to<00:02:04.310> go<00:02:04.579> from<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.570> waist<00:02:05.960> area

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
that's going to go from the waist area

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.190 
that's going to go from the waist area
which<00:02:06.979> would<00:02:07.159> be<00:02:07.310> about<00:02:07.549> here<00:02:08.090> all<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.990> way<00:02:09.140> to

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
which would be about here all the way to

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.160 
which would be about here all the way to
about<00:02:09.770> here<00:02:10.190> because<00:02:10.789> this<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.300> zero<00:02:11.780> and<00:02:12.080> this

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
about here because this is zero and this

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.729 
about here because this is zero and this
is<00:02:13.160> really<00:02:13.790> close<00:02:14.420> enough<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.230> we<00:02:15.440> really

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
is really close enough so we really

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:16.559 
is really close enough so we really
don't<00:02:15.860> have<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.069> worry<00:02:16.250> about

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
don't have to worry about

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.630 
don't have to worry about
this<00:02:16.810> if<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.019> if<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.650> like<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:18.129> can<00:02:18.280> make<00:02:18.340> it

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
this if you if you like you can make it

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.259 
this if you if you like you can make it
out<00:02:18.999> to<00:02:19.239> here<00:02:19.799> at<00:02:20.799> the<00:02:21.040> very<00:02:21.280> outside<00:02:21.909> but

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
out to here at the very outside but

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.789 
out to here at the very outside but
we're<00:02:22.420> going<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.569> make<00:02:22.810> put<00:02:23.139> in<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.379> piece<00:02:23.560> about

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
we're going to make put in a piece about

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.160 
we're going to make put in a piece about
this<00:02:24.159> wide<00:02:24.519> this<00:02:25.239> is<00:02:25.299> going<00:02:25.629> to<00:02:25.689> be<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.989> high

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
this wide this is going to be the high

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.559 
this wide this is going to be the high
spot<00:02:26.650> this<00:02:26.950> line<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:27.819> that<00:02:27.849> we<00:02:28.060> know<00:02:28.269> we<00:02:28.450> need

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
spot this line so that we know we need

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.050 
spot this line so that we know we need
to<00:02:28.780> ramp<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.499> this<00:02:29.680> way<00:02:29.950> on<00:02:30.189> this<00:02:30.370> side<00:02:30.430> align

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
to ramp it this way on this side align

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.410 
to ramp it this way on this side align
and<00:02:31.359> this<00:02:31.930> side<00:02:32.260> from<00:02:32.799> here<00:02:33.010> down<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:34.180> now

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
and this side from here down so now

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.300 
and this side from here down so now
we're<00:02:35.079> going<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.230> find<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.680> piece<00:02:35.859> of<00:02:36.069> basswood

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
we're going to find a piece of basswood

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.940 
we're going to find a piece of basswood
that's<00:02:37.180> big<00:02:37.510> enough<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:37.959> set<00:02:38.439> it<00:02:38.590> right<00:02:38.769> in

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
that's big enough and set it right in

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.159 
that's big enough and set it right in
