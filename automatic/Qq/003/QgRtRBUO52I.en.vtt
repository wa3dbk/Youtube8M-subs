getting<00:00:58.590> older<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.579> he<00:00:59.640> played<00:01:00.030> running<00:01:00.300> back

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480

from<00:01:00.840> Montclair<00:01:01.320> State<00:01:01.500> University<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.789> put

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
from Montclair State University so I put

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.609 
from Montclair State University so I put
him<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> roof<00:01:03.780> instead<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.229> myself

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
him up on the roof instead of myself

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.859 
him up on the roof instead of myself
because<00:01:05.430> if<00:01:05.729> he<00:01:05.820> fell<00:01:06.060> down<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.360> guess<00:01:06.720> he

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
because if he fell down I guess he

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.090 
because if he fell down I guess he
didn't<00:01:07.049> roll<00:01:07.170> off<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> lot<00:01:07.619> easier<00:01:07.830> than<00:01:07.950> I

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
didn't roll off a lot easier than I

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.730
