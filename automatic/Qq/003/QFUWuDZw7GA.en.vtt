00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.610 

here<00:01:43.650> we<00:01:43.800> can<00:01:43.980> create<00:01:44.220> notes<00:01:45.320> we<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.350> actually

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
here we can create notes we can actually

so<00:01:49.050> let's<00:01:49.320> think<00:01:49.830> for<00:01:49.860> example<00:01:50.010> you're

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
so let's think for example you're

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.690 
so let's think for example you're
attending<00:01:50.910> our<00:01:51.210> world<00:01:51.540> congress<00:01:52.700> clicking

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
attending our world congress clicking

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.190 
attending our world congress clicking
you<00:01:53.820> note<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.540> here<00:01:55.500> we<00:01:55.650> can<00:01:55.890> record<00:01:56.550> voice

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
you note and here we can record voice

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.010 
you note and here we can record voice
but<00:01:58.200> actually<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.860> also<00:01:59.100> record<00:02:00.020> no

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
but actually we can also record no

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.290 
but actually we can also record no
sleeping<00:02:01.440> right<00:02:01.590> down<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.640> when<00:02:02.940> we<00:02:03.060> played

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
sleeping right down so when we played

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.850 
sleeping right down so when we played
this<00:02:03.420> bag<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:04.020> will<00:02:04.110> actually<00:02:04.230> see<00:02:04.410> that<00:02:04.710> no

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
this bag you will actually see that no

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.640 
this bag you will actually see that no
appear<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.030> screen<00:02:06.150> when<00:02:07.080> you<00:02:07.110> wrote<00:02:07.470> it

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.390 
appear on the screen when you wrote it
in<00:02:07.800> real<00:02:07.980> time<00:02:08.010> so<00:02:09.740> maintains<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.890> context

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
in real time so maintains the context

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.559 
in real time so maintains the context
that<00:02:11.490> we<00:02:11.550> note<00:02:11.760> taking<00:02:12.150> it

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.890 

rinse<00:02:14.749> and<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:15.049> picture

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
rinse and a picture

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.880 
rinse and a picture
you<00:02:16.989> can<00:02:17.170> also<00:02:17.319> type<00:02:17.860> as<00:02:18.489> your<00:02:18.849> screen<00:02:19.090> here
