00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.279
 every footballer has matches that they are looking forward to 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.679
 for players of fc groningen that include the games against sc 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:12.999
 heerenveen 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.470
 the timing of the north will be on the program again in heerenveen on Sunday 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.000
 this act does not start to live in the city or in the surrounding area, even with fc 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.630
 groningen trainer erwin van de tooi that we are very well known in the pass like that 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.179
 that is the name of the matches that you are looking forward to that the audience is looking forward to 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.729
 but also looking forward as a team full of stadium full of funeral 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.540
 very much very much the derby experience after in wherever you play at every 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.120
 club I have this kind of competitions that he got some extras and so will 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.390
 have to play there are of course great matches and 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.760
 we are looking at rotterdam 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.020
 but that they also have a great game 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.720
 because you can taste your whole environment that the surgeon has a little more 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.570
 competition 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.780
 If you look at the supporters you look at what the people like in my 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.700
 Do environment thinks yes it is beautiful just like other healthy ones 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.310
 rivalry and yes there is clear 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.700
 football meant to be ordinary 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.579
 Fighting out competitions not fighting out but this is a competition in which 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:12.659
 really those women faced each other last weekend 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.670
 heerenveen and leeuwarden always frisian darby 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.450
 in leeuwarden they speak of dkv 30 kilometers away if they are against it 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.609
 play Heerenveen 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:23.160
 zkv you have any idea where that means 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.540
 we don't have it there 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.440
 60 kilometers away 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.950
 and that won't be a problem 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.090
 we are going to play a nice game without 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.469
 to smoke a game 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.720
 to ourselves too long it shows such a match as you that 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.880
 in the final training 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.470
 to get the jogging forest we go for that 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.860
 at the end on wall street 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.100
 I already knew that very well 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.420
 currently five paintings that 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.810
 I think the oldest player then 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.970
 well i got it possible with celebration both 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.960
 a while ago 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.200
 yes that does fix everything had to be a team gives it one 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.560
 And on the basis you noticed that supporters are starting to deliver as well 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.290
 more than a normal match 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.759
 you get that feeling very much and that 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.749
 that image is no different 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:12.979
 the 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:17.349
 the regular followers of the training sessions of FC Groningen 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.869
 we can see that the sharpness is going well this week 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:24.529
 and gradually what the selection again somewhat broad it seems that trainer 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:27.650
 Erwin van de Looi has a wider choice of players 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.110
 compared to last Saturday's game against excelsior we 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.610
 we even hope that we will get more boys, we think 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.809
 the Vondellaan we do everything to that 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:40.689
 to get those on the field löw and the victim was on the on the couch 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.559
 hope he can be used even more in you through good weeks of training 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:47.999
 so we really work on to the Sunday's game timing 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.510
 northern lights among the fans of FC Groningen 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.090
 winning Heerenveen gives everything around the club a big boost, perhaps a 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.240
 cliché but this is such a game mariën nobody should have left 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.849
 to have 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:58.979
 what goes too far 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:00.199
 we have 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.459
 I think we will certainly not go too far if you still motivate people then 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.049
 then they are not suitable 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.730
 the competition lasted an hour and now we actually know because you know that 

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:12.739
 the match day the committee can know that the reason and in the match we are 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:13.899
 motivated 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:15.029
 what for sure
