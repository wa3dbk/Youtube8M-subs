00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.210
 the club was founded in 2003 we were both 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.530
 coaches that we worked for and to whom 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.629
 in schools of rivas and good we decided 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.969
 give a little push to this sport here 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.160
 in rivas and ride a club to start 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.370
 the competition to date not 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.550
 I had currently in school 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.160
 municipal has about 227 girls 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.270
 approximately and we have here in the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.010
 club about 42 the club consists of 8 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.649
 trainers 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.739
 3 we take over the team of 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.430
 competition and the rest are monitors of 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.439
 the municipal schools of the system 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.420
 rhythmic gymnastics competition is a 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.460
 little complex a distinction can be 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.630
 federated competition that is a 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.240
 competition organized by the federation 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.009
 Madrid rhythmic gymnastics and 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.330
 competition not federated the competition 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.000
 not federated what is commonly called 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.190
 Municipalities within the competition of 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.009
 federations are the competitions of 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.020
 basic preferential competitions and 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.450
 all are steps you start by 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.909
 schools are continued by initiation 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.009
 promotion and already preferred that improves 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.289
 rivas gymnast takes longer to get to 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.319
 preferred but arrives more formed we 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.659
 like to give importance to the part 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.100
 artistic not only to the technical side and 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.350
 I believe that now that is being valued 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.450
 much in the rivas club in the gym 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.579
 rhythmic can compete 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.180
 with the five devices that are ball 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.439
 maces hoop tape and rope and also 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.869
 can compete what we call 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.869
 hands-free is without any device 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.620
 at the elite level rhythmic gymnastics is the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.369
 sacrifice is all sacrifice to the 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.290
 girls who come to compete at that level 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.180
 practically do not have to leave 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.740
 many of his habits even spreading 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.660
 sometimes from their families because they pass 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.340
 many hours training the truth is that 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.440
 after so many years of training 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.660
 we see that girls who compete and 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.030
 they compete and train hard they are 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.730
 hooked or they tell us dads 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.770
 and the moms who leave here and continue 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.330
 Girls can not stop at home anymore 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.280
 they are doing a warm up they are 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.260
 working together the team of 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.720
 competition that are ahead with the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.340
 Turquoise shirt and pre-team 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.200
 competition that are the smallest 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.780
 who are behind with the shirt of the 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.120
 strawberry are making a is pay and that is 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.370
 the leg open on the basic floor 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.250
 I always since I was five years old 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.840
 I started in ballet in the colleges to 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.790
 nine years I got into a club 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.320
 elite competition competed at the 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.210
 National Championship in Spain 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.850
 rhythmic gymnastics what I love this 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.230
 sport is the ability of 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.379
 girls to the coaches to create 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.790
 and express through the body and the 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.860
 I'm really excited to see how there are 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.560
 girls who have trained them since well 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.730
 little girl and they have become women 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.709
 more excellent athletes than the truth 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.640
 I'm drooling with them and the most 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:26.160
 I like it is the ball dance and the others 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.879
 the things I was in the 1 of madrid already 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.489
 which denote 17 800 and that after the 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:35.640
 seventh well above is very expressive 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.709
 Very colorful and very beautiful the marches 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.480
 I tried them in the championship of Spain and 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.129
 they were the ones that gave me the best 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.519
 I remember my first contact with the 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:46.410
 rhythmic is I did ballet then at 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.849
 go through one of these areas of 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.410
 training I was spellbound 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.050
 quickly choose and badly I want to do 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.670
 that and from that moment 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.820
 I do not remember when it was the last 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.950
 competition with 15 with 14 15 that stop 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.180

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.270
 coach course there I got to 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.270
 to train 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.410
