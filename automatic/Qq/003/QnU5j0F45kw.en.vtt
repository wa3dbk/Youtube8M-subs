00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
 i 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.389
 very good partners we expect a new 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.460
 video to the channel where we're going to 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.280
 start with the first chapter of 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.720
 photography for beginners let's go 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.420
 watching the succession of the camera and how 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.940
 stand to photograph how to power 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.140
 a scene and we're going to see also the 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.119
 three- thirds rule 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.420
 we are going to show the children and 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.980
 images so you can see examples 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.980
 so let's start 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.579
 the first example let's see how 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.499
 we have to hold the camera 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.140
 as you see the strap on the camera we 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:45.140
 it comes for something and it would be good to use it 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.809
 so we would have to place it 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.020
 correctly or if it is not new to the 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.790
 hands not to lose that valuable apparatus of 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.790
 fit the extra 500 and 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.790
 The holiday runs can be 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.540
 annoying but as you can see the 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.420
 images the way to disassemble it 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.190
 to avoid any surprises and we have 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.520
 this drinks put the camera to make 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.520
 the photograph 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.390
 in these images that we are seeing 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.910
 as we would have to hold the camera 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.010
 it seems ridiculous that he is living 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.080
 but leave the camera to someone and benzema 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.120
 lass it's good for me the right thing is in the 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.820
 reality whose dura 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.540
 and the other hand supported below the 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.990
 objective not to hinder to do 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.659
 the photographs 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.860
 at the time of looking for the objective as 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.439
 you can see there we are not doing 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.530
 well we would have to say slightly the 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.990
 face to create them because the nose or the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.270
 screen allows us to see well what 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.159
 we are from a square 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.320
 well in this video what we are going to see is 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.420
 would be the placement of the feet to 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.250
 tillage in photography 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.350
 there are reactions one that the wind 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.110
 can move and if we stop at speeds 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.780
 based for obstructing and disturbing 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.180
 give him an open photograph infuses 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.149
 I pulsed in front of the other to get 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.599
 later and in this way put more 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.599
 Photos 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.310
 Sometimes it would be convenient to look 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.040
 objects we will support them either 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.569
 some tree a lamppost to get 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.050
 that stability that we need with this 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.050
 Photography 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.850
 so we show you another example more 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.390
 of how to get that stability that 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.390
 we need 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.820
 and here we see another center but our 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.300
 occasion with a handrail for 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.220
 get firm here we show you 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.720
 a little advice on how to give it a little 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.720
 stability to a camera with the strap 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.100
 ok here we're going to see the position that 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.380
 we would have to get with the steels 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.990
 a photograph the effects that is 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.690
 or less the height as you see it would have to 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.600
 put the knee on the floor the other with 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.460
 top of the entrance via 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.170
 and so we would get more 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.170
 stability to make the photograph 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.070
 and finally let's see how 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.440
 we would place the van by photographs 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.170
 as you can see there would not be the position 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.900
 correct the correct thing would be to double the 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.849
 arms waiting to get 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.700
 to get there to have a duration 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.700
 leave with the pictures like this time 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.410
 well now we are going to be showing 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.320
 examples of what would be the frame of 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.790
 a scene based on how how 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.550
 which is the camera as you can see from a 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.710
 horizontal or vertical change much 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.830
 new photography I can not lose 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:52.990
 important details of being to the object 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.570
 personal thing we want to photograph 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.400
 As you can see, there are photographs 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.650
 pressure us prove that we and 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.360
 it seems to us that they have been good if 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.480
 we tested the camera in position at the end 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.239
 vertical we would be otherwise 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.860
 it also happens to us, on the contrary, we are 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.780
 of photographs in which 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.540
 horizontal seems fine but vertical 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.730
 it surprises more the same situation 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.039
 if we want to highlight some detail of 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.190
 that area can also stay more 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.950
 nice if we also rotate the position 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.600
 to the kabbalah 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.730
 in what is the position of the objects 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.860
 we all tend to leave them in the center 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.840
 It would also be convenient to try 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.180
 that leave them aside and photograph 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.330
 something else in the same area that can 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.040
 to do is give a better image or 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.840
 it seems that in these 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.460
 photographs is fine but if we rotate 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.460
 gives us more depth to that street 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:49.300
 this time it's a waterfall 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:52.360
 but obviously if the finish 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.220
 whole is much prettier picture than 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.260
 if we took a piece 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.820
 here we see a little the obvious position 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.870
 is somewhat skewed of the image 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.870
 by would look better 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.130
 we have to also try to avoid the 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.790
 toxicity of an image that means 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:13.700
 that the work these images is a bit 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.500
 more separated and with people it comes 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.000
 more here good we want to settle the 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.230
 image of that person is fine the 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.790
 image 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.080
 but if we want to make a portrait it's 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.180
 convenient if we make a margin 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.340
 we will find that person 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.930
 for a room the last part of this 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.850
 first chapter that would be the rule of 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.070
 three thirds the new one of these 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.160
 prices is those bars that you see there 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:36.800
 lines that mark us three thirds of it 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.030
 of the image serves us well for 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.330
 guide us a little and what is 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.650
 convenient is to put the horizon of a 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.470
 image for example in any of the 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.120
 two lines we have horizontal one 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.780
 person for example in the we have 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.690
 vertical 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.449
 let's see some examples and we're going 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.159
 explaining a little more 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:56.949
 ok let's go see some in herning 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:58.629
 some images that as you see everything tends 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.120
 to shoot at the center of the photograph the 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:02.229
 horizon when it is convenient 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.880
 adjust it to one of those two lines that 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:06.920
 the rule of three thirds marks us 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.780
 and lead are obviously if the 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.820
 will be amazing a heaven and they have 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.160
 some clouds and work interests us 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.470
 You can also leave it at the center 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.740
 the source instead this beige sky that 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.440
 there's hardly cloud does not tell us anything and 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.780
 is removing is not space from another 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.750
 image that could 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.520
 be prettier 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.350
 in photo status what we are going to see now 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.420
 It is the same then the horizon 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.630
 mountains that just in it instead if 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.440
 changed the way of doing this picture 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.550
 the same can be more 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.010
 surprising 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:42.040
 it seems that the road ends in the 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.750
 shit now reset people the 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.700
 animals say it's convenient to leave 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.550
 two of your points 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.280
 focus on that person and the 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.050
 funny picture as you see everything 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.760
 world has some means is convenient 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.040
 they still put one of those two lines 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.520
 vertical and remove another object that has 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:03.310
 people another house whatever so that 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.590
 give us more importance is the image and in 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.380
 this last one let's see who is trying 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.880
 make the picture is somewhat crooked 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.040
 On the other hand, if we change its position 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.150
 we can see that with those two points of 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.810
 earn your prices 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.990
 would be something better 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:20.930
 to return with a the images 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.460
 while we ask for the video 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.020
 let's hope you liked this 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.449
 first chapter of photography for 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.520
 beginners we have also that we 

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:30.919
 continue in our same chapters for 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.539
 be up to date with our videos but that 

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:35.150
 you write that you share it by the 

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:39.310
 vendée may interest 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.310
 and as always a greeting 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.500
 Y 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.500
 ah 

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.530
 Y
