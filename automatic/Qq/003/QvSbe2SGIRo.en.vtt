00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
criticism I have with the film is the

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.229 
criticism I have with the film is the
pacing<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.470> film<00:04:01.769> isn't<00:04:02.160> unreasonably<00:04:02.970> long

pacing the film isn't unreasonably long

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.479 
pacing the film isn't unreasonably long
with<00:04:03.480> a<00:04:03.510> running<00:04:03.720> time<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.050> 122<00:04:04.890> minutes<00:04:05.250> or

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
with a running time of 122 minutes or

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.520 
with a running time of 122 minutes or
just<00:04:05.880> over<00:04:06.060> two<00:04:06.209> hours<00:04:06.239> but<00:04:07.110> when<00:04:07.320> I<00:04:07.350> was

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
just over two hours but when I was

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.930 
just over two hours but when I was
watching<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:08.040> I<00:04:08.070> felt<00:04:08.340> like<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.550> was<00:04:08.700> there<00:04:08.910> for

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
watching and I felt like I was there for

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.420 
watching and I felt like I was there for
a<00:04:09.180> lot<00:04:09.540> longer<00:04:09.810> than<00:04:10.200> I<00:04:10.260> was<00:04:10.530> most<00:04:11.070> of<00:04:11.250> what<00:04:11.400> I

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
a lot longer than I was most of what I

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.190 
a lot longer than I was most of what I
saw<00:04:11.790> in<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.060> film<00:04:12.209> was<00:04:12.360> interesting<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:12.989> I

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
saw in the film was interesting and I

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.870 
saw in the film was interesting and I
generally<00:04:13.920> enjoy<00:04:14.190> films<00:04:14.610> with<00:04:14.760> his

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
interesting characters and for the most

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.890 
interesting characters and for the most
part<00:04:17.100> well<00:04:17.609> written<00:04:17.820> dialogue<00:04:18.269> between<00:04:18.450> them

kind of this film kind of as a

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.760 
kind of this film kind of as a

out of place but I can't stress enough
this<00:04:46.240> movie<00:04:46.569> is<00:04:46.690> really<00:04:46.930> slow<00:04:47.349> moving<00:04:47.680> overall

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
this movie is really slow moving overall

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.589 
this movie is really slow moving overall

I enjoyed interview with the vampire
quite<00:04:50.110> a<00:04:50.139> bit<00:04:50.379> I<00:04:50.560> generally<00:04:51.190> like<00:04:51.340> movies<00:04:51.729> like

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:51.879

quite a bit I generally like movies like
this<00:04:52.030> however<00:04:52.180> so<00:04:52.539> if<00:04:52.659> you<00:04:52.780> are<00:04:52.900> interested<00:04:52.930> in

this however so if you are interested in

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.469 
this however so if you are interested in
the<00:04:53.530> initial<00:04:53.770> premise<00:04:54.190> of<00:04:54.550> a<00:04:54.639> vampire<00:04:55.000> telling

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
the initial premise of a vampire telling

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.570 
the initial premise of a vampire telling
a<00:04:55.599> reporter<00:04:55.629> his<00:04:56.110> life<00:04:56.289> story<00:04:56.560> I<00:04:56.860> probably

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
a reporter his life story I probably

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.600 
a reporter his life story I probably
skip<00:04:58.090> this<00:04:58.210> one<00:04:58.449> I<00:04:59.259> know<00:04:59.530> for<00:05:00.069> some<00:05:00.550> people

that<00:05:00.909> movies<00:05:01.300> like<00:05:01.479> this<00:05:01.659> can<00:05:01.930> be<00:05:02.289> really

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
that movies like this can be really

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.529 
that movies like this can be really
boring<00:05:02.979> and<00:05:03.310> they<00:05:03.370> don't<00:05:03.490> enjoy<00:05:03.880> films<00:05:04.300> heavy

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
boring and they don't enjoy films heavy

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:05.730 
boring and they don't enjoy films heavy
in<00:05:04.690> dialogue<00:05:05.139> and<00:05:05.319> character<00:05:05.710> development

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
in dialogue and character development

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.520 
in dialogue and character development
with<00:05:06.250> a<00:05:06.280> plot<00:05:06.580> moving<00:05:06.970> slowly<00:05:07.690> along<00:05:08.110> but<00:05:08.500> i

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
with a plot moving slowly along but i

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.080 
with a plot moving slowly along but i

necessarily<00:05:13.210> because<00:05:13.509> i<00:05:13.539> don't<00:05:13.810> think<00:05:14.020> this

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
necessarily because i don't think this

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.930 
necessarily because i don't think this
is<00:05:14.199> a<00:05:14.349> horror<00:05:14.620> film<00:05:14.860> and<00:05:15.159> i<00:05:15.460> really<00:05:15.669> don't

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
is a horror film and i really don't

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.309 
is a horror film and i really don't
think<00:05:16.000> that's<00:05:16.270> what<00:05:16.479> it<00:05:16.599> was<00:05:16.630> shooting<00:05:17.020> for<00:05:17.199> it

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:17.319 
think that's what it was shooting for it

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.050 
think that's what it was shooting for it
just<00:05:17.409> kind<00:05:17.680> of<00:05:17.740> gets<00:05:17.830> labeled<00:05:18.159> as<00:05:18.610> a<00:05:18.669> horror

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
just kind of gets labeled as a horror

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.939 
just kind of gets labeled as a horror
film<00:05:19.270> because<00:05:19.690> it<00:05:19.810> has<00:05:19.930> vampires<00:05:20.380> in<00:05:20.620> it<00:05:20.710> I'm
