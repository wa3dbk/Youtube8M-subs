system this is in addition to other
tests<00:01:06.600> out<00:01:06.840> there<00:01:07.049> now<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.770> idea<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.580> creating

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
tests out there now the idea of creating

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.359 
tests out there now the idea of creating
a<00:01:09.360> sandbox<00:01:09.960> using<00:01:10.409> virtual<00:01:10.799> machines<00:01:11.159> is

a sandbox using virtual machines is

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.030 
a sandbox using virtual machines is
nothing<00:01:11.790> new<00:01:11.970> but<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.990> problem<00:01:13.470> remains<00:01:13.500> that

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
nothing new but the problem remains that

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.160 
nothing new but the problem remains that
once<00:01:14.250> they<00:01:14.430> become<00:01:14.760> infected<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.020> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
once they become infected you have to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.469 
once they become infected you have to
wipe<00:01:16.380> reinstall<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.970> device

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
wipe reinstall and so on this device

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.350 
wipe reinstall and so on this device
would<00:01:18.900> eliminate<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.920> need<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.610> now

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
would eliminate the need for that now

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.899 
would eliminate the need for that now
because<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.200> company's<00:01:22.740> engineers<00:01:23.130> many<00:01:23.759> of

isn't too keen right now apparently on
helping<00:01:30.000> them<00:01:30.180> move<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.750> thing<00:01:31.020> along<00:01:31.079> also

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
helping them move this thing along also

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.910 
helping them move this thing along also
the<00:01:32.729> company<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.540> zero<00:01:34.049> was<00:01:34.320> working<00:01:34.799> on

the company in zero was working on

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.670 
the company in zero was working on
simplifying<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.909> code<00:01:36.180> base<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.810> getting

simplifying the code base and getting

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.890 
simplifying the code base and getting
this<00:01:37.829> system<00:01:38.610> down<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.090> where<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.329> might<00:01:39.659> be

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
this system down to where it might be

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.200 
this system down to where it might be
possible<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.530> buy<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.909> some

additional chips for around twenty-five
dollars<00:01:45.950> now<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.310> think<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.360> thing<00:01:48.659> really

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
dollars now I think this thing really

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.770 
dollars now I think this thing really
has<00:01:49.020> some<00:01:49.470> legs<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.210> it<00:01:51.210> may<00:01:51.450> cause

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
has some legs to it and it may cause

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.899 
has some legs to it and it may cause
