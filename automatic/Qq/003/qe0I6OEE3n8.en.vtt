understand<00:06:56.559> locating<00:06:57.559> the<00:06:57.649> cars<00:06:57.860> ain't<00:06:58.129> the

00:06:58.239 --> 00:06:58.249 
understand locating the cars ain't the

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:00.459 
understand locating the cars ain't the
problem<00:06:58.490> in<00:06:59.270> fact<00:06:59.569> I'll<00:06:59.870> tell<00:07:00.199> you<00:07:00.319> exactly

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:00.469 
problem in fact I'll tell you exactly

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:02.409 
problem in fact I'll tell you exactly
where<00:07:01.009> to<00:07:01.039> find<00:07:01.129> them<00:07:01.520> but<00:07:01.759> here's<00:07:02.029> the<00:07:02.149> catch

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:02.419 
where to find them but here's the catch

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:04.869 
where to find them but here's the catch
we<00:07:02.930> can't<00:07:03.229> boost<00:07:03.529> them<00:07:03.800> you<00:07:04.249> gotta<00:07:04.460> win<00:07:04.699> them

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:04.879 
we can't boost them you gotta win them

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:07.089 
we can't boost them you gotta win them
and<00:07:04.969> that's<00:07:05.629> gonna<00:07:05.779> take<00:07:06.020> some<00:07:06.229> serious<00:07:06.559> skill

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:07.099 
and that's gonna take some serious skill

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:08.860 
and that's gonna take some serious skill
right<00:07:07.789> so<00:07:07.999> I'm<00:07:08.059> guessing<00:07:08.449> that<00:07:08.479> we've<00:07:08.689> gotta

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:08.870 
right so I'm guessing that we've gotta

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.019 
right so I'm guessing that we've gotta
win<00:07:09.199> the<00:07:09.469> rest<00:07:09.680> of<00:07:09.860> the<00:07:09.919> cars<00:07:10.189> and<00:07:10.490> unlock<00:07:10.789> them

00:07:11.019 --> 00:07:11.029 
win the rest of the cars and unlock them

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:12.519 
win the rest of the cars and unlock them
somehow<00:07:11.300> like<00:07:11.599> that<00:07:11.749> so<00:07:11.960> we're<00:07:12.110> gonna<00:07:12.229> get<00:07:12.439> the

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:12.529 
somehow like that so we're gonna get the

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:14.889 
somehow like that so we're gonna get the
charger<00:07:13.039> that's<00:07:13.339> our<00:07:13.490> first<00:07:13.759> vehicle<00:07:14.089> of
