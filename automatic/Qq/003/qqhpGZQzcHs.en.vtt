00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.409 
set these aside real quick this is the
very<00:00:25.070> first<00:00:25.519> one<00:00:25.820> that<00:00:25.849> I<00:00:26.269> did<00:00:26.439> and<00:00:27.439> I<00:00:28.130> was<00:00:29.119> very

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
very first one that I did and I was very

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.569 
very first one that I did and I was very
happy<00:00:29.779> with<00:00:29.900> it<00:00:29.960> because<00:00:30.409> I<00:00:30.769> just<00:00:30.859> freehand

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
happy with it because I just freehand

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.430 
happy with it because I just freehand
painted<00:00:32.150> it<00:00:32.300> and<00:00:33.039> this<00:00:34.039> is<00:00:34.219> the<00:00:35.110> no<00:00:36.110> no<00:00:36.410> I

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
painted it and this is the no no I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.220 
painted it and this is the no no I
wouldn't<00:00:36.829> call<00:00:37.039> it<00:00:37.160> a<00:00:37.250> field<00:00:37.520> note<00:00:37.730> size<00:00:38.230> but

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
wouldn't call it a field note size but

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.650 
wouldn't call it a field note size but
Pat<00:00:39.710> it<00:00:39.890> passport<00:00:40.609> would<00:00:40.670> definitely<00:00:41.149> fit<00:00:41.420> I

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
Pat it passport would definitely fit I

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.720 
Pat it passport would definitely fit I
think<00:00:41.960> it<00:00:42.020> might<00:00:42.170> be<00:00:42.199> a<00:00:42.320> little<00:00:42.620> bit<00:00:43.100> wider

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
think it might be a little bit wider

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.069 
think it might be a little bit wider
than<00:00:43.969> the<00:00:44.390> passport<00:00:44.989> but<00:00:46.629> as<00:00:47.629> you<00:00:47.750> can<00:00:47.899> see

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
than the passport but as you can see

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.549 
than the passport but as you can see
it's<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.469> canvas<00:00:48.710> in<00:00:49.100> here<00:00:49.430> and<00:00:50.289> inside<00:00:51.289> is

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
it's the canvas in here and inside is

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.779 
it's the canvas in here and inside is
just<00:00:51.890> a<00:00:52.550> little<00:00:52.789> paper<00:00:53.269> insert<00:00:53.750> but<00:00:54.109> I<00:00:54.410> I<00:00:55.309> did

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
just a little paper insert but I I did

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.119 
just a little paper insert but I I did
do<00:00:55.969> this<00:00:56.210> one<00:00:56.480> with<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.469> elastic<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.100> that

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
do this one with the elastic so that

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.160 
do this one with the elastic so that
goes<00:00:58.489> this<00:00:58.730> way<00:00:58.969> because<00:00:59.750> I<00:00:59.809> didn't<00:00:59.989> want<00:01:00.140> it

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
goes this way because I didn't want it

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.150 
goes this way because I didn't want it
to<00:01:00.320> go<00:01:00.440> across<00:01:00.769> her<00:01:01.070> her<00:01:01.640> face<00:01:02.170> so<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:03.739> I<00:01:03.920> did

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
to go across her her face so and I did

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.370 
to go across her her face so and I did
just<00:01:04.460> taste<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.790> elastic<00:01:05.360> right<00:01:06.020> through

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
just taste the elastic right through

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.250 
just taste the elastic right through
there<00:01:06.620> and<00:01:07.150> I<00:01:08.150> did<00:01:08.330> not<00:01:08.480> seal<00:01:08.780> this<00:01:09.020> one

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
there and I did not seal this one

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.760 
there and I did not seal this one
because<00:01:09.620> I<00:01:09.650> wanted<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.070> see<00:01:10.460> I<00:01:11.350> wanted<00:01:12.350> to<00:01:12.500> see

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
because I wanted to see I wanted to see

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.620 
because I wanted to see I wanted to see
what<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.220> effects<00:01:13.580> would<00:01:13.700> be<00:01:13.970> if<00:01:14.120> it's<00:01:14.330> not

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
what the effects would be if it's not

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.990 
what the effects would be if it's not
sealed<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.320> I<00:01:16.100> can<00:01:16.340> see<00:01:16.580> that<00:01:16.760> it<00:01:16.880> definitely

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
sealed and I can see that it definitely

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.990 
sealed and I can see that it definitely
should<00:01:17.510> be<00:01:17.660> sealed<00:01:20.080> because<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:22.000> acrylic

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
should be sealed because the acrylic

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.360 
should be sealed because the acrylic
paint<00:01:23.240> which<00:01:23.420> I<00:01:23.570> use<00:01:23.720> I<00:01:24.050> use<00:01:24.530> just<00:01:24.980> Kraft

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.580 
paint which I use I use just Kraft

inside because it's there's already a

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.810 
inside because it's there's already a
video<00:02:21.790> on<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.150> one<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:23.500> um<00:02:23.830> that's<00:02:24.610> the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
video on this one but um that's the

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.850 
video on this one but um that's the
peacock<00:02:25.210> and<00:02:25.830> then<00:02:26.830> my<00:02:27.430> daughter<00:02:28.560> plays<00:02:29.560> that

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
peacock and then my daughter plays that

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.550 
peacock and then my daughter plays that
on<00:02:30.280> what<00:02:30.520> does<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.820> Fox<00:02:31.060> say<00:02:31.210> all<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:32.350> time

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
on what does the Fox say all the time

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.590 
on what does the Fox say all the time
and<00:02:32.950> so<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.940> decided<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.810> paint<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.650> fox<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:37.240> I

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
and so I decided to paint a fox and I

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.730 
and so I decided to paint a fox and I
think<00:02:37.960> he's<00:02:38.110> cute

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
think he's cute

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.630 
think he's cute
and<00:02:39.460> I<00:02:39.700> didn't<00:02:40.030> want<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:41.110> elastic<00:02:41.740> going

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
and I didn't want the elastic going

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.420 
and I didn't want the elastic going
across<00:02:42.970> it<00:02:43.450> because<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.990> could<00:02:44.170> see<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:45.190> kind

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
across it because you could see it kind

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.030 
across it because you could see it kind
of<00:02:45.520> like<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:46.180> don't<00:02:46.900> know<00:02:46.960> I<00:02:47.170> don't<00:02:47.260> really<00:02:47.770> care

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
of like I don't know I don't really care

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.070 
of like I don't know I don't really care
for<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.430> so<00:02:49.240> I<00:02:50.280> put<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.580> I<00:02:51.970> put<00:02:52.270> a<00:02:52.330> grommet<00:02:52.720> here

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
for it so I put the I put a grommet here

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.340 
for it so I put the I put a grommet here
and<00:02:53.410> I<00:02:53.800> painted<00:02:54.130> it<00:02:54.280> black<00:02:54.490> and<00:02:54.940> holding<00:02:55.930> the

on by another small button and writing

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.810 
on by another small button and writing
on<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:17.110> really<00:03:17.739> is<00:03:17.860> not<00:03:18.040> going<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.310> be<00:03:18.519> a

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
on it really is not going to be a

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.949 
on it really is not going to be a
problem<00:03:19.510> especially<00:03:20.019> if<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.560> get<00:03:20.769> you<00:03:21.610> know

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
problem especially if you get you know

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.930 
problem especially if you get you know
two<00:03:22.959> or<00:03:22.989> three<00:03:25.440> inserts<00:03:26.440> in<00:03:26.650> there<00:03:26.860> but<00:03:27.640> anyway

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
two or three inserts in there but anyway

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.759 
two or three inserts in there but anyway
you<00:03:28.000> just<00:03:28.269> wrap<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.870> elastic<00:03:28.930> around<00:03:29.470> the

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
you just wrap the elastic around the

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.780 
you just wrap the elastic around the
button<00:03:30.070> and<00:03:31.000> there's<00:03:31.540> plenty<00:03:32.110> of<00:03:32.140> room<00:03:32.410> for

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
button and there's plenty of room for

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.220 
button and there's plenty of room for
you<00:03:33.790> know<00:03:33.880> to<00:03:33.970> add<00:03:34.150> some<00:03:34.390> chunkiness<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:35.080> it

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
you know to add some chunkiness to it

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.170 
you know to add some chunkiness to it
and<00:03:35.620> if<00:03:36.070> you<00:03:36.160> need<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.340> bigger<00:03:36.519> elastic<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.120> can

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
and if you need a bigger elastic you can

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.380 
and if you need a bigger elastic you can
always<00:03:37.480> add<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.780> bigger<00:03:38.050> elastic<00:03:38.590> but<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.850> kind

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
always add a bigger elastic but I kind

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.880 
always add a bigger elastic but I kind
of<00:03:40.450> like<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:40.720> way<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:41.050> one<00:03:41.170> turned<00:03:41.410> out<00:03:41.560> and

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
of like the way that one turned out and

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.870 
of like the way that one turned out and
again<00:03:42.400> I<00:03:42.430> use<00:03:42.519> grommets<00:03:43.269> and<00:03:44.580> these<00:03:45.580> are<00:03:45.730> big

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
again I use grommets and these are big

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.780 
again I use grommets and these are big
enough<00:03:46.120> if<00:03:46.420> you<00:03:46.570> wanted<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:46.989> add<00:03:47.140> more<00:03:47.790> the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
enough if you wanted to add more the

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.970 
enough if you wanted to add more the
elastics<00:03:49.209> inside<00:03:49.600> you<00:03:50.110> certainly<00:03:50.500> could<00:03:50.769> just

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
elastics inside you certainly could just

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.100 
elastics inside you certainly could just
use<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.250> same<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:52.150> same<00:03:52.330> holes<00:03:52.800> so<00:03:55.110> that's

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
use the same the same holes so that's

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.259 
use the same the same holes so that's
that's<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.340> Fox<00:03:57.610> I<00:03:58.230> like<00:03:59.230> him<00:03:59.410> I<00:03:59.590> think<00:03:59.680> he's

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
that's the Fox I like him I think he's

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.530 
that's the Fox I like him I think he's
foxy<00:04:01.350> and<00:04:02.459> then<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.910> last<00:04:04.090> one<00:04:04.360> that<00:04:04.390> I

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
foxy and then the last one that I

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.150 
foxy and then the last one that I
painted<00:04:05.110> is<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:06.459> seahorse<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.930> is<00:04:08.410> on<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.830> dark

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
painted is a seahorse it is on a dark

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.630 
painted is a seahorse it is on a dark
grey<00:04:09.640> background<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.780> it<00:04:11.380> all<00:04:12.070> the<00:04:12.280> rest<00:04:12.459> of

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
grey background and it all the rest of

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.000 
grey background and it all the rest of
these<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:13.060> did<00:04:13.480> put<00:04:13.720> a<00:04:13.830> protective<00:04:14.830> coat<00:04:15.190> on<00:04:15.459> and

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
these I did put a protective coat on and

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.880 
these I did put a protective coat on and
he's<00:04:18.010> a<00:04:18.040> red<00:04:18.459> sea<00:04:18.790> horse<00:04:19.140> that<00:04:20.140> I<00:04:20.169> painted<00:04:20.650> on

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
he's a red sea horse that I painted on

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.250 
he's a red sea horse that I painted on
the<00:04:21.039> dark<00:04:21.250> gray<00:04:21.280> background

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
the dark gray background

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.230 
the dark gray background
and<00:04:22.410> I<00:04:22.920> just<00:04:23.160> did<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:23.400> traditional<00:04:23.900> elastic<00:04:25.040> and

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
and I just did a traditional elastic and

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.020 
and I just did a traditional elastic and
this<00:04:27.240> one<00:04:27.510> because<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.500> canvas<00:04:28.890> is<00:04:29.310> so<00:04:29.580> tight

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
this one because the canvas is so tight
