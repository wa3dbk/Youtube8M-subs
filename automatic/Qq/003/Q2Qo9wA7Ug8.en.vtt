00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.820
 but 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.210
 Hello, my name is jan and I want you to 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.750
 introduce our team 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.140
 this is fritz best of the assistants 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.289
 Martha manages the finances 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.770
 Rolf provides us with everything necessary 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:39.770
 markus is the head of department 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.820
 Let's take a look at the example of one 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.980
 ship crew in front of a department 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.280
 in a larger organization 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.280
 usually work 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.030
 The captain gets into appearances one 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.719
 valuable and sensitive delivery 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.789
 to bring a remote island 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.949
 The way over the sea is long and hard 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.909
 The taxman must be at the time of fixing 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.500
 the route exactly works with it 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.690
 fragile goods intact 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.899
 she must safely reach the port of destination 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.310
 the troubled become more promoted today 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.899
 the ship should leave the harbor 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.820
 while the steuermann the course 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.250
 calculated and put on the over 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.860
 he does not think about them anymore 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.390
 delicate cargo of the ship 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.490
 because the boatman is not over the loaded one 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.659
 he was not informed 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.580
 provide for special safety measures 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.409
 the cargo slipped through the sea 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.330
 back and forth and finally went to 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:45.280
 break the hungry sailor can his 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.280
 work is not possible 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.040
 Unfortunately, the ship's cook can not do it 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.620
 take care because he has no 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.780
 food is because of that 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.780
 Boatsman has the job to save 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.280
 this situation is encountered so often in 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.119
 Organizations are not themselves 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.399
 reflects every single thing done 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.860
 his task does not think about it 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.290
 according to how his tasks with 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.800
 the tasks of the colleagues and the goals 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.160
 the organization are networked 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.110
 as a result, the efficiency and 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.269
 sometimes also suffer the effectiveness 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.830
 ignorance of the goals of 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.390
 Organization and the tasks of 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.070
 Colleagues inhibits the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.570
 Working explains resources like 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.489
 finance but also know and 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.989
 working time was not the goal of 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.989
 organization used accordingly 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.050
 there is no communication about goals and 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.900
 tasks are missing 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.730
 flexibility and dynamism in itself 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.480
 changed environmental conditions rapidly 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.190
 Often the daily work becomes more 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.600
 of internal rules of the ice 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.380
 needs of customers or clients 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.380
 Ã¼berlingen 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.180
 also for the lack of common 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.530
 The objectives developed and agreed upon 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.139
 the strategic goals of the organization 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.749
 have the look that the 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:15.549
 cooperating little can and networking 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:17.950
 plays critical questions or 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.120
 there are no conflicts at all 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.040
 are not the occasion for a 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.900
 continuous development 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.639
 taken but consume resources 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.819
 without a positive impact on the 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.819
 Result 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.730
 Organizations that are always active 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.790
 become more complex in internal and 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.849
 specify external conditions 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.439
 We as a learning organization 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.359
 they try in the most current 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:48.159
 situation the most effective and 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.959
 most efficient way of achieving the 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.689
 to develop and agree on agreed goals 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.849
 go 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:57.430
 to work effectively and efficiently 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.790
 an organization has to be a learner 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.189
 Organization will be the way to 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.579
 Learning organization engages five customers 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:08.349
 rose in lohr in the learner 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.879
 Organization become the personal 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.620
 skills and abilities of 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.840
 single employee discovered and 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.120
 promoted 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.829
 uses the resulting motivation 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.599
 the development of the personality is 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.590
 individual and thus also the 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.710
 further development of the whole 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.539
 Organization for the successful 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.650
 implementation of the strategic goals 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.389
 it needs to be clarified 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.729
 ideas about the desired 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.220
 future of the organization so one 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.720
 vision 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.090
 this vision must be shared by all employees 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.950
 be known and should as common 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.360
 vision shared by all 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.880
 the members of a learner 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.920
 Organization are about the goals and 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.890
 tasks of the individual departments and 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.570
 the whole organization informs you 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.260
 are at the sustainable achievement of 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.090
 personally interested in the goals 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.430
 learning organization creates groups 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.140
 promotes knowledge and the interaction the 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.120
 further development of the working groups 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.400
 not only happens in the training and 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.580
 Seminars but primarily in the 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:12.320
 working day learning by doing open 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:14.900
 dialogues discussions exchange of experiences 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.090
 yes even the constructive processing 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.000
 Conflicts open up manifold ones 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.010
 learning potential to call such a group 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.510
 we team up for the performance of a team 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.000
 is not just the addition 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.750
 of individual services but in their 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.910
 multiplication the belly is the vision 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.400
 An organization is formed by its values 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.960
 ethics we call the attitude and the 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.420
 Behavior of the members of the 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.850
 We call ethos ethics and organization 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.800
 ethos do not always coincide with that 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.080
 away become a learning organization 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.850
 is not it easy about that 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.000
 aimed at actually lived works 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.500
 exchange and agree 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.590
 it does not necessarily have to be in one 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.720
 formal mission process happen well 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.670
 thoughtfully systematically offered 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.830
 Possibilities of communication and 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:04.840
 value development to often sustainable 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.840
 for the organization and its members 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.120
 through a holistic view 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.560
 It will be easier in the complex 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.630
 the reality of an organization 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.270
 find your way 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.900
 Here are hierarchies and formal 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.240
 organizational structures more and more 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.550
 superfluous and through a network with 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.770
 Replaced various node points 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.570
 from such a systemic 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.140
 networked think out discovers that 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.490
 organization in mistakes and failures 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:37.130
 welcome impulses for innovation 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:38.570
 new approaches show a team that 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.100
 is borne by common goals 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.300
 can be increasingly complex tasks 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.380
 and overcome challenges 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.120
 critical situations are for one 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.910
 learning organization welcome 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.040
 opportunities for further development 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.450
 how does it work? 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.280
 different skills and 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.650
 skills in a team together 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.630
 come out also the most effective 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.670
 if by the particular person the 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.710
 the skills were self-directed 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.840
 can be through the common 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.970
 Goal takes every team member 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.610
 Part of the control and leadership was 

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:14.330
 the rally driven will work 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:16.340
 through networked sit those in the team 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.690
 Existing competitions will become 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.150
 Development of the best possible 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.890
 solution used 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:24.440
 Conflicts become constructive and active 

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.530
 it works to become the engine 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.080
 a continuous development and 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.660
 improvement process 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.440
 the co-workers are not afraid 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.090
 develop your own initiative 

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.510
 this contributes to the success of the entire 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:39.310
 Both teams are organizing like that 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.440
 develop your day-to-day business 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.690
 High efficiency costs are for 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.760
 change processes well positioned 

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.560
 Crises are not considered a threat to 

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.150
 existence perceived but as 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.950
 welcome impulsors and 

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.850
 Energy sources for the successful 

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.850
 shaping the future
