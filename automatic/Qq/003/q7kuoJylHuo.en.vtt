vegan diet I always made dinner and this

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.110 
vegan diet I always made dinner and this
was<00:06:51.740> what's<00:06:51.950> for<00:06:52.190> dinner<00:06:52.280> if<00:06:52.580> they<00:06:52.790> didn't

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
was what's for dinner if they didn't

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.820 
was what's for dinner if they didn't
want<00:06:53.330> it<00:06:53.450> they<00:06:53.630> could<00:06:53.900> go<00:06:54.050> without<00:06:54.410> dinner

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830

want it they could go without dinner
and<00:06:55.450> kids<00:06:57.040> generally<00:06:58.040> will<00:06:58.400> eat<00:06:58.580> the<00:06:58.730> dinner

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880 
and kids generally will eat the dinner

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.610 
and kids generally will eat the dinner
yes<00:06:59.390> they<00:06:59.690> definitely<00:06:59.960> went<00:07:00.230> to<00:07:00.410> bed<00:07:00.530> without

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:00.620

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.150 
yes they definitely went to bed without
dinner<00:07:01.000> a<00:07:02.000> number<00:07:02.630> of<00:07:02.750> times<00:07:03.050> but<00:07:03.800> kids<00:07:04.070> are

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 
dinner a number of times but kids are

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.159 
dinner a number of times but kids are
programmed<00:07:04.610> for<00:07:04.820> survival<00:07:05.060> they're<00:07:05.810> really

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:06.169 
programmed for survival they're really

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:08.200 
programmed for survival they're really
not<00:07:06.410> going<00:07:06.650> to<00:07:06.710> starve<00:07:07.100> themselves<00:07:07.400> to<00:07:08.000> death

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.210 
not going to starve themselves to death

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.780 
not going to starve themselves to death
and<00:07:08.540> I<00:07:09.290> noticed<00:07:09.890> that<00:07:10.220> if<00:07:10.370> you<00:07:10.400> keep

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:10.790 
and I noticed that if you keep

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.670 
and I noticed that if you keep
introducing<00:07:11.660> an<00:07:11.900> item

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 
introducing an item

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.190 
introducing an item
sometimes<00:07:13.400> it<00:07:13.580> takes<00:07:13.730> introducing<00:07:14.419> it<00:07:14.540> 7<00:07:15.050> to

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:15.200 
sometimes it takes introducing it 7 to

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.409 
sometimes it takes introducing it 7 to
10<00:07:15.410> times<00:07:15.680> before<00:07:16.310> they<00:07:16.850> eat<00:07:17.060> it<00:07:17.180> and<00:07:17.330> they

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:17.419 
10 times before they eat it and they

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:19.120 
10 times before they eat it and they
begin<00:07:17.720> to<00:07:17.780> like<00:07:18.110> it<00:07:18.320> and<00:07:18.530> their<00:07:18.650> taste<00:07:18.890> buds

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.130 
begin to like it and their taste buds

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.700 
begin to like it and their taste buds
change<00:07:19.250> but<00:07:20.210> it<00:07:20.330> will<00:07:20.570> happen<00:07:20.930> just<00:07:21.380> be

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:21.710 
change but it will happen just be

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.590 
change but it will happen just be
consistent<00:07:22.370> it's<00:07:22.580> just<00:07:22.940> like<00:07:23.120> with<00:07:23.300> adults

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:23.600 
consistent it's just like with adults

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.450 
consistent it's just like with adults
and<00:07:24.760> kids<00:07:25.760> will<00:07:26.090> change<00:07:26.450> it's<00:07:27.440> possible<00:07:28.100> so

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.460 
and kids will change it's possible so

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.350
