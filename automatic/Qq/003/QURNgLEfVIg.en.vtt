 they are back masters of the orange ball the telebras will sell adopted the 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.549
 as a philosophy of life for eight years she has worked in the formation of 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.529
 future athletes 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:19.339
 is more important than to make a point to who passes by here is and the people 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.379
 have a business with the kids who attack you like you get on the 

00:00:23.379 --> 00:00:26.560
 block already with a good start but what will be done 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.090
 They have a great affinity for us. It's a great affection, you. 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.520
 comes to the court with effort the first of the day what one sees the child context 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.770
 hugging the team playing with the desire to do the assembly here to do something 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.220
 because the father sent the attack because it is 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.220
 the small 11-year-old Giulia is one of the 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:50.089
 the csa is sure and the girl is inspired by the teachers 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.690
 we had a picture 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.130
 c so it does not happen we have to decide on that amount of 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.309
 children regardless of location 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.420
 that future players future athletes that when they have until a little 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.789
 more selfish watching on TV defending the Brazilian national team 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:13.530
 who knows in the next Pan-American even in Brazil and speaking of a fine so the 

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:18.469
 players of the Brazilian basketball team are pan-American medalists 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:23.099
 in a month they will be in the river to prestige the selection I think 

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:26.919
 is the moment of always in the very good sense within the sport in the zone 

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:29.490
 of the euro during the Pan-American in Brazil 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.850
 We expect all home selections 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.120
 a peraÃ­ opa that the female and male basketball 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.500
 has a very good performance in the Pan-American this will also bring 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.060
 more children being part of the basketball choices 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.250
 it's the law every action has a reaction 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.100
 is the story of the mirror and the reflection 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.040
 here who start to start the first steps on the court 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.200
 well on top not only the sixth one of them down to an arrival time of the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.200
 athlete all that we can be something wrong 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.520
 then you have to respect the property year until next week that workout 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.210
 the understanding of certification a few weeks before the pan of Brazil with the 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.220
 around these future athletes we 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:15.259
 companies want us to do
