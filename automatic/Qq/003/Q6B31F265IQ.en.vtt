I<00:00:18.380> was<00:00:18.500> teaching<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.070> intro<00:00:19.550> because<00:00:20.390> I

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
I was teaching the intro because I

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.800 
I was teaching the intro because I

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
didn't know at the time because I hadn't

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.859 
didn't know at the time because I hadn't
seen<00:00:23.929> the<00:00:24.109> video<00:00:24.380> yet<00:00:24.490> the<00:00:25.490> music<00:00:25.789> video<00:00:25.939> but

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
part of the intro a little bit

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.760 
part of the intro a little bit
differently<00:00:32.420> than<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:33.050> way<00:00:33.080> I<00:00:33.200> showed<00:00:33.530> you

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
differently than the way I showed you

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.810 
differently than the way I showed you
and<00:00:34.010> I<00:00:34.910> wanted<00:00:35.120> to<00:00:35.210> show<00:00:35.390> you<00:00:35.420> how<00:00:36.110> he<00:00:36.170> plays<00:00:36.470> it

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
but first I wanted to demonstrate

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.690 
but first I wanted to demonstrate
something<00:00:39.260> okay<00:00:41.050> the<00:00:42.050> guitar<00:00:42.200> is<00:00:42.650> unique<00:00:43.430> in

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
something okay the guitar is unique in

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.080 
something okay the guitar is unique in
that<00:00:44.740> for<00:00:45.740> just<00:00:45.860> about<00:00:46.010> any<00:00:46.310> given<00:00:46.670> note<00:00:46.880> you

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
that for just about any given note you

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.380 
that for just about any given note you
can<00:00:47.120> have<00:00:47.420> up<00:00:47.660> to<00:00:47.690> six<00:00:48.380> different<00:00:48.860> places<00:00:49.390> to

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
can have up to six different places to

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.250 
can have up to six different places to
play<00:00:50.900> that<00:00:51.110> note<00:00:51.350> in<00:00:51.590> one<00:00:51.860> octave<00:00:52.460> okay<00:00:53.060> so<00:00:53.990> if

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
play that note in one octave okay so if

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.890 
play that note in one octave okay so if
that<00:00:54.770> doesn't<00:00:55.370> make<00:00:55.430> sense<00:00:55.490> to<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:56.000> don't

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
that doesn't make sense to you don't

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.290 
that doesn't make sense to you don't
worry<00:00:57.110> I'm<00:00:57.290> going<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.470> demonstrate<00:00:57.650> it<00:00:58.300> let's

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
worry I'm going to demonstrate it let's

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.650 
worry I'm going to demonstrate it let's
take<00:00:59.480> one<00:00:59.990> note<00:01:00.230> for<00:01:00.440> example<00:01:00.890> let's<00:01:01.130> take<00:01:02.000> the

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
take one note for example let's take the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.810 
take one note for example let's take the
high<00:01:02.810> E<00:01:02.840> string

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820

six different places to say to play the
same<00:01:40.940> note<00:01:41.210> now<00:01:41.990> if<00:01:42.440> you<00:01:42.650> have<00:01:42.800> a<00:01:42.830> melody<00:01:43.370> for

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
same note now if you have a melody for

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.480 
same note now if you have a melody for
example<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:44.570> has<00:01:44.780> maybe<00:01:45.440> three<00:01:45.860> notes<00:01:46.100> in<00:01:46.370> it

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
example that has maybe three notes in it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.750 
example that has maybe three notes in it
then<00:01:47.360> that<00:01:47.920> compounds<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.280> know<00:01:49.400> how<00:01:49.580> many

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
then that compounds you know how many

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.080 
then that compounds you know how many
places<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:50.360> can<00:01:50.390> play<00:01:50.800> that<00:01:51.800> that<00:01:52.310> melody<00:01:52.880> on

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
places you can play that that melody on

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.620 
places you can play that that melody on
the<00:01:53.240> neck<00:01:53.590> in<00:01:54.590> fact<00:01:54.980> it<00:01:55.270> compounds<00:01:56.270> at<00:01:56.390> three

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
the neck in fact it compounds at three

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.580 
the neck in fact it compounds at three
times<00:01:57.070> six<00:01:58.070> three<00:01:58.700> times<00:01:58.940> up<00:01:59.180> to<00:01:59.390> six<00:01:59.660> so<00:02:00.440> just

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
times six three times up to six so just

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:12.510 
times six three times up to six so just
to<00:02:00.740> demonstrate<00:02:01.390> let's<00:02:02.390> take<00:02:02.480> a<00:02:02.540> melody<00:02:02.930> like

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:25.470 

yeah<00:02:13.520> you<00:02:13.580> can<00:02:13.790> also<00:02:13.940> play<00:02:14.209> here

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:44.180 

it's<00:02:25.959> counting

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.200 

and<00:02:45.060> if<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.300> have<00:02:45.420> 24<00:02:45.930> frets

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.760 

so<00:02:51.210> I<00:02:51.240> do<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.690> wasn't<00:02:52.140> counting<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.560> don't

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
so I do I wasn't counting that I don't

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.980 
so I do I wasn't counting that I don't
know<00:02:52.830> how<00:02:52.950> many<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.220> was<00:02:53.370> but<00:02:53.730> that's<00:02:54.690> how<00:02:54.810> many

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
know how many it was but that's how many

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.080 
know how many it was but that's how many
places<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.530> can<00:02:55.560> play<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.860> melody<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:56.850> i<00:02:56.880> just

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
places you can play a melody so i just

want to show you that before i show you
the<00:03:00.230> real<00:03:01.230> way<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:02.040> Billie<00:03:02.310> Joe<00:03:02.550> Armstrong

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
the real way that Billie Joe Armstrong

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.480 
the real way that Billie Joe Armstrong
pleasant<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:04.320> I<00:03:04.350> believe<00:03:04.920> when<00:03:05.280> i<00:03:05.310> was

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
pleasant so I believe when i was

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.910 
pleasant so I believe when i was
teaching<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.850> intro<00:03:06.150> before<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:06.540> said<00:03:07.020> you

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
teaching the intro before I said you

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:20.600 
teaching the intro before I said you
know<00:03:08.010> on<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.310> G<00:03:08.490> chord

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.720 

it<00:03:21.060> works<00:03:21.300> but<00:03:21.960> in<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.680> video<00:03:22.950> he<00:03:23.280> plays<00:03:23.520> it

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
it works but in the video he plays it

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:31.729 
it works but in the video he plays it
like

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.660 

so<00:03:32.739> if<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:32.980> ever<00:03:33.040> played

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.760 

so<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:38.210> be<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.780> melody<00:03:39.140> is<00:03:39.260> really<00:03:39.560> on<00:03:39.680> the

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
so that be the melody is really on the

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:46.990 
so that be the melody is really on the
second-stringers

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.340 

so<00:03:47.710> you<00:03:48.710> know<00:03:48.800> obviously<00:03:48.830> I've<00:03:49.430> taught<00:03:50.350> that

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
so you know obviously I've taught that

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.170

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
aspect about the guitar before and

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
usually the question comes up well with

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.350 
usually the question comes up well with
so<00:03:57.950> many<00:03:58.100> different<00:03:58.220> places<00:03:58.520> to<00:03:58.880> play<00:03:59.150> the
