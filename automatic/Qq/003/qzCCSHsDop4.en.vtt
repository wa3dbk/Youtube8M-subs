00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 and hello to all swami indices again 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.010
 today I would like to tell you how 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.070
 counter minera there are such characters 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.900
 which can of contrite because for 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.099
 each character has a character who 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.400
 contrit him 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.039
 well and today i wanted to show on 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.260
 freon example could also show it 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.460
 on the example of the code there is some kind of enigma 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.740
 lycanthropine panel contract is not very 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.590
 because why I say all these 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.320
 characters because they have everything 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:38.070
 slept and who call beings such 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.149
 like a wagon for example he calls his 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.840
 trentov what does it give us is you 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.379
 knowing where you stand is just leading your 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.640
 trent 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.480
 and you can say you give it away 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.260
 you take away the wines of the mine 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.190
 and don't die from them so better better 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.860
 just go and check one trent. 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.920
 this is where you are almost sure that there are mines 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.590
 for example you packing and your allies what 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.460
 mine is there and you go there alone 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.890
 trend and kill this mine like this 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.400
 that's the way you see you just like that 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:25.860
 go through and kill but how do you know 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.530
 there is still such a thing as barrels 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.350
 me on it ulta which causes too 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.350
 a lot of damage how to cope with it 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.250
 let's show you first with us 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.329
 we may be 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.159
 or by whom or if of orion rather 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.880
 all you will collect nekra who 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.240
 help you 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.840
 kill these barrels for example you recognize 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.009
 these micro 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:55.409
 so you learned and you can already tell 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:59.850
 i need some kind of gene or center 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.530
 you take kill one barrel of course 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.710
 will kill for a long time but still not 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:10.370
 kill print and . dying or you 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.260
 just get yourself and kill it 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.390
 by freon itself 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.870
 still no damage is done and count 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.680
 what you already can't rely we miner 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.879
 the last spam which does not consist of 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.489
 min is he doing suicide when he is you 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:32.299
 runs up you not necessarily warship and he 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.190
 women wants to go on it all and he was 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:38.680
 windex subscribe to the channel put
