00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.210
 very good combination for our 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.239
 body 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.059

 granola is basically a mixture of 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.750
 cereals nuts and dried fruits 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.149
 anyone can make the granola in 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.610
 house that according to your taste but 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.980
 attention is better to eat granola in the morning 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.719
 since it is an energetic food, nothing 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.890
 prevents it from being consumed in the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.899
 afternoon snack 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.640
 now if it's a granola made with 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.710
 pretty brown 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.650
 there it is better not to eat at night 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.350
 nuts have a high fat content and 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.380
 this can make digestion difficult for the 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.170
 our recipe a suggestion is to use half 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.420
 tea cup about 40 grams of 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.420
 every product come on 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.869
 between the cereals we choose flakes of 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.030
 rice and oats in the group of 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.180
 almond nuts 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.409
 the raisin enters as an option of fruits 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.170
 dry and to complete honey the recipe 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.170
 it yielded two and a half pounds and cost 21 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.250
 reais and thirty cents per kilo leaves at 8 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.220
 reais and 52 cents about 30% more 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.049
 cheaper than the average of the finished products 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.509
 the price falls even more with the 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.509
 replacement of the most expensive items 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.579
 others more like peanuts in the 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.670
