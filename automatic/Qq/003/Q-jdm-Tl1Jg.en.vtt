00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
today's lesson is matter now what is

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.520 
today's lesson is matter now what is
matter<00:00:46.969> the<00:00:47.969> law<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.390> conservation<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.260> matter

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
matter the law of conservation of matter

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.040 
matter the law of conservation of matter
states<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.460> matter<00:00:50.760> will<00:00:51.090> remain<00:00:51.449> constant

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
states that matter will remain constant

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.319 
states that matter will remain constant
over<00:00:52.140> time<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.770> cannot<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:53.730> created<00:00:53.969> nor

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.529 
destroyed in an isolated system it's
what<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.890> refer<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.190> as<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.550> law<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.879> no

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
what I like to refer to as the law of no

seat in the corner let's take one last
look<00:01:55.920> at<00:01:56.280> matter<00:01:57.229> as<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.530> all<00:01:58.709> experiment

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
look at matter as with all experiment

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.300 
look at matter as with all experiment
safety<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.000> paramount<00:02:00.289> so<00:02:01.289> let<00:02:01.679> us<00:02:01.709> put<00:02:01.860> on<00:02:02.160> our

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
safety is paramount so let us put on our

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.820 
safety is paramount so let us put on our
safety<00:02:02.700> goggles

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.830 

splendid<00:02:10.830> for<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.820> demonstration<00:02:12.090> we<00:02:12.810> will

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
splendid for this demonstration we will

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.010 
splendid for this demonstration we will
be<00:02:13.110> using<00:02:13.290> an<00:02:13.590> ordinary<00:02:14.070> household<00:02:14.610> pie<00:02:15.020> if

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
be using an ordinary household pie if

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.080 
be using an ordinary household pie if
you<00:02:16.290> apply<00:02:16.560> force<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.190> pie<00:02:17.460> what<00:02:17.970> do<00:02:18.030> you

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
you apply force to a pie what do you

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.530 
you apply force to a pie what do you
think<00:02:18.150> will<00:02:18.450> happen<00:02:19.610> let's<00:02:20.610> observe<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:21.390> see

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
think will happen let's observe to see

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:31.070 
think will happen let's observe to see
if<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.780> are<00:02:21.810> right<00:02:28.580> in<00:02:29.580> summation<00:02:30.210> if<00:02:30.570> you<00:02:30.900> do

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
if you are right in summation if you do

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.720 
if you are right in summation if you do
not<00:02:31.200> apply<00:02:31.530> an<00:02:31.740> external<00:02:31.830> force<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.550> matter

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
not apply an external force to matter

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.000 
not apply an external force to matter
then<00:02:33.210> it<00:02:33.450> doesn't<00:02:33.780> matter<00:02:33.960> what<00:02:34.440> kind<00:02:34.860> of

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
then it doesn't matter what kind of

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.740 
then it doesn't matter what kind of
matter<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.430> was<00:02:35.610> until<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.390> matter<00:02:36.540> is

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
matter it was until the matter is

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.000 
matter it was until the matter is
allowed<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.200> be<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> different<00:02:38.010> matter<00:02:38.220> indeed

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
allowed to be a different matter indeed

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.310 
allowed to be a different matter indeed
