00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.970
 well found friends android life today 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.890
 we're going to see how to install a 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.580
 modified kernel on your own 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.650
 android device doing many 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.240
 reviews of various kernels are me 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.670
 noticed that some of you didn't know 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.830
 precisely how to implement the procedure of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.670
 installation and therefore for this I have 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.689
 decided to have a video dedicated to us 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.340
 then in the meantime you will need the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.349
 root permissions 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.599
 I made a guide how to get 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.759
 root permissions on the nexus e 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.770
 of course a modified recovery 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.200
 once you've got this 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.399
 you will have to go and look for a kernel 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.590
 compatible with your device 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.430
 I for example now we're going to install 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.260
 the free kernel is to install it there is 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.750
 the traditional way and then there are others 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.870
 for example I usually go to 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.379
 install via the franc app 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.539
 kernel that allows me to go 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.090
 to install and download it 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.070
 automatically tapping here on the last one 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.840
 automatic flash version now the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.750
 normal procedure the procedure 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.430
 universal is another 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.430
 to install a kernel so we should 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.080
 enter the recovery and we can do it 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.820
 or if you have any roms 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.330
 holding down the shutdown button 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.740
 and doing it restarts in recovery or if not 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.310
 you have no recovery so far 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.930
 we will both first have to take us 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.220
 turning off the kim ok device spain 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.840
 flight 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.869
 once turned off we will have to go to 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.640
 turn it on in fastboot mode then 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:39.299
 power button and volume on 2 June 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.520
 we pressed ok we are in this one 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.770
 screen here with the volume keys there 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.540
 let's move into recovery mode 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.070
 mode confirming with the power button 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.259
 the recovery will naturally have to be 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.930
 you had to have a modified recovery 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.600
 already installed previously for me 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.210
 example the TV in recovery however anyway 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.950
 the procedure goes well with all the others 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.140
 at this point to install a dog there 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.830
 procedure is really simple 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.670
 once downloaded naturally 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.500
 we do install we will go to sd card e 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.240
 let's go and choose the folder where 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.100
 we saved the club 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.080
 I saved it in this folder here at 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:23.560
 rom here is frank kernel r 51 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:29.140
 we select the swipe let's do it 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.390
 to install it ok completed now 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.100
 we will have to have the kernel installed not 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.450
 we need to go and do a 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.190
 wipe cash from bic for kernels is not 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.410
 no wipe needed we go to 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.530
 reboot the system and see if it is 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.709
 present now and frank x men before real 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.170
 a kernel stop 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.240
 this and many roms another thing I have 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.450
 already reviewed we now enter the 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.160
 device 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.880
 here we go to the settings 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.100
 phone info 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.900
 we have the franc so this is the 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.480
 really simple procedure once that 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.120
 you have root permissions for recovery 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.620
 modified really very simple vi 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.840
 I still recommend always going to 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.130
 check curling compatibility 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.930
 that you downloaded with yours 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.970
 device 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.970
 greetings to all from android life
