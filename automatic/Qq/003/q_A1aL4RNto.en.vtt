at<00:00:56.620> once<00:00:56.920> you<00:00:57.070> get<00:00:57.250> them<00:00:57.370> a<00:00:57.430> bit<00:00:57.579> higher<00:00:57.820> if

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
at once you get them a bit higher if

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.940 
at once you get them a bit higher if
you're<00:00:58.059> using<00:00:58.239> smaller<00:00:58.570> monitors<00:00:59.200> they<00:00:59.620> tend
