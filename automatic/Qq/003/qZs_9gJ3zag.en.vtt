00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
you know people go to tennis pros

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.060 
you know people go to tennis pros
because<00:00:15.210> they've<00:00:15.839> developed<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.529> system

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
because they've developed a system

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.130 
because they've developed a system
that's<00:00:17.520> not<00:00:17.940> working<00:00:18.240> for<00:00:18.420> them<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.810> now

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
that's not working for them and now

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.050 
that's not working for them and now
they're<00:00:19.470> inefficient<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.369> they<00:00:20.730> have<00:00:20.910> to

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
they're inefficient and they have to

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.390 
they're inefficient and they have to
become<00:00:21.390> efficient<00:00:22.020> well<00:00:22.590> it's<00:00:23.010> frustrating

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
become efficient well it's frustrating

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.720 
become efficient well it's frustrating
and<00:00:24.060> we<00:00:24.570> know<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.080> we<00:00:25.590> know<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.580> to

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
and we know that we know that we have to

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.070 
and we know that we know that we have to
give<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:26.910> some<00:00:27.180> support<00:00:27.390> while<00:00:27.869> we're

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
give you some support while we're

give you some support while we're
working<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.590> things<00:00:28.890> but<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.519> problem<00:00:29.730> is

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
working on things but the problem is

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.269 
working on things but the problem is
that<00:00:30.720> people<00:00:30.750> very<00:00:31.260> often<00:00:31.679> get<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.040> frustrated

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
that people very often get so frustrated

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.670 
that people very often get so frustrated
they<00:00:32.759> go<00:00:32.910> back<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.420> old<00:00:33.570> stroke<00:00:33.960> they<00:00:34.350> just

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
they go back to the old stroke they just

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.950 
they go back to the old stroke they just
can't<00:00:35.040> handle<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.880> frustration<00:00:36.540> I've<00:00:36.719> said

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
can't handle the frustration I've said

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.060 
can't handle the frustration I've said
it<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.140> thousand<00:00:37.620> times

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
it a thousand times

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.520 
it a thousand times
if<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.579> pain<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.090> suffer<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.750> losing<00:00:40.410> to

if the pain you suffer in losing to

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.130 
if the pain you suffer in losing to
people<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.980> know<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.219> should<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:42.140> greater

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
people you know you should be is greater

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.810 
people you know you should be is greater
than<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.620> pain<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.980> suffer<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.430> making<00:00:44.730> a

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
than the pain you suffer in making a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.220 
than the pain you suffer in making a
change<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.270> your<00:00:45.420> game<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:45.960> painful

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
change in your game and it's painful

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.250 
change in your game and it's painful
then<00:00:47.010> your<00:00:47.190> prognosis<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:48.030> very<00:00:48.090> good<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:49.200> if

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
then your prognosis is very good but if

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.500 
then your prognosis is very good but if
the<00:00:49.379> pain<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.950> suffer<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.670> making<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.180> change

the pain you suffer in making a change

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.569 
the pain you suffer in making a change
is<00:00:51.809> greater<00:00:52.410> than<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.770> pain<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.129> suffering

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
is greater than the pain you suffering

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.670 
is greater than the pain you suffering
losing<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.059> people<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.899> probably<00:00:55.379> won't

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
losing to people you probably won't

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.189 
losing to people you probably won't
change<00:00:56.039> only<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.660> make<00:00:57.870> that

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
change only you can make that

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.860 
change only you can make that
determination<00:00:59.000> you<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.420> make<00:01:00.629> that

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
determination you have to make that

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.920 
determination you have to make that
judgment<00:01:01.640> when<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.670> go<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.239> tennis<00:01:03.660> school

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
judgment when you go to a tennis school

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.170 
judgment when you go to a tennis school
they<00:01:04.650> are<00:01:04.860> trying<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.339> get<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.670> out<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:06.000> all

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
they are trying to get you out of all

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.850 
they are trying to get you out of all
those<00:01:06.390> little<00:01:06.600> adjustments<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.380> made<00:01:07.590> for

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
those little adjustments you made for

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.160 
those little adjustments you made for
example<00:01:07.950> if<00:01:08.520> you're<00:01:09.030> too<00:01:09.240> high<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.960> ball

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
example if you're too high on the ball

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.800 
example if you're too high on the ball
the<00:01:10.950> rackets<00:01:11.430> coming<00:01:11.729> down<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> elbow<00:01:12.750> is

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
the rackets coming down and the elbow is

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.109 
the rackets coming down and the elbow is
going<00:01:12.900> up<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.890> make<00:01:14.130> sure<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.729> racket

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
going up to make sure that the racket

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.940 
going up to make sure that the racket
gets<00:01:15.330> underneath<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.930> ball<00:01:16.140> well<00:01:16.680> when<00:01:16.830> you

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
gets underneath the ball well when you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.429 
gets underneath the ball well when you
do<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.400> now<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.240> brain<00:01:18.720> picks<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.140> up<00:01:19.259> and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
do that now the brain picks it up and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.990 
do that now the brain picks it up and
says<00:01:19.590> okay<00:01:19.950> I've<00:01:20.070> got<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.759> it

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
says okay I've got it I like it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.149 
says okay I've got it I like it
but<00:01:21.479> now<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.689> brain<00:01:22.049> doesn't<00:01:22.439> want<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.950> let<00:01:23.100> go

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
but now the brain doesn't want to let go

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.020 
but now the brain doesn't want to let go
so<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.330> very<00:01:24.689> frustrating<00:01:25.080> situation<00:01:26.030> now

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
so it's a very frustrating situation now

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.609 
so it's a very frustrating situation now
the<00:01:27.090> tendency<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.930> when<00:01:28.140> you're<00:01:28.259> taking

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
the tendency is when you're taking

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.370 
the tendency is when you're taking
lessons<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:29.430> get<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.299> lose<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.570> you'll

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
lessons you get it you lose it you'll

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.499 
lessons you get it you lose it you'll
have<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.799> for<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> moment<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.549> then<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.180> lose

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
have it for a moment and then you lose

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.960 
have it for a moment and then you lose
it<00:01:33.720> right<00:01:33.930> away<00:01:34.049> why<00:01:34.680> because<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.729> brain

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
it right away why because the brain

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.359 
it right away why because the brain
wants<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.689> old<00:01:36.720> motor<00:01:37.409> program<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.159> more

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
wants the old motor program it's more

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.609 
wants the old motor program it's more
comfortable<00:01:38.970> with<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.530> be

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
comfortable with it so you have to be

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.010 
comfortable with it so you have to be
very<00:01:40.860> patient<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:41.759> yourself<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.509> pat

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
very patient with yourself and pat

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.080 
very patient with yourself and pat
yourself<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.680> back<00:01:43.829> once<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> while<00:01:44.610> for

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
yourself on the back once in a while for

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.840 
yourself on the back once in a while for
just<00:01:45.390> trying<00:01:45.689> something<00:01:46.049> new<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:47.159> before<00:01:47.670> you

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
just trying something new but before you

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.139 
just trying something new but before you
try<00:01:48.060> anything<00:01:48.390> new<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:49.049> key<00:01:49.560> issue<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.159> does<00:01:50.790> it

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
try anything new a key issue is does it

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.899 
try anything new a key issue is does it
make<00:01:51.479> sense<00:01:51.930> does<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.950> pro<00:01:53.220> does<00:01:53.549> your<00:01:53.759> friend

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
make sense does the pro does your friend

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.940 
make sense does the pro does your friend
whoever<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.450> helping<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.899> give<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.920> the

right rationale which will help you

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.730 
right rationale which will help you
understand<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.250> particular<00:01:59.610> stroke<00:02:00.439> so<00:02:01.439> think

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
understand a particular stroke so think

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.160 
understand a particular stroke so think
about<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.100> get<00:02:02.340> good<00:02:02.579> information<00:02:02.930> then<00:02:03.930> get

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
about it get good information then get

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.560 
about it get good information then get
out<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.380> start<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.890> work<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.369> run<00:02:06.180> tests

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
out and start to work on it run tests

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.779 
out and start to work on it run tests
because<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.170> can<00:02:07.350> run<00:02:07.530> tests<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.009> everything

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
because you can run tests on everything

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.360 
because you can run tests on everything
that<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.970> process<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.959> then<00:02:10.770> when<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.069> run<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
that a process and then when you run the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.130 
that a process and then when you run the
test<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.849> like<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.300> now<00:02:12.720> you're<00:02:12.930> going<00:02:13.080> to

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
test and you like it now you're going to

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.880 
test and you like it now you're going to
run<00:02:13.290> into<00:02:13.470> a

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
run into a

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.310 
run into a
with<00:02:14.100> yourself<00:02:14.280> your<00:02:15.120> own<00:02:15.360> brain<00:02:15.750> says<00:02:16.080> eight

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
with yourself your own brain says eight

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.710 
with yourself your own brain says eight
you<00:02:16.980> know<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.130> had<00:02:17.490> this<00:02:17.640> old<00:02:18.000> one<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.420> kind

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
you know I had this old one and I kind

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.380 
you know I had this old one and I kind
of<00:02:18.810> liked<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.290> well<00:02:19.920> don't<00:02:20.640> worry<00:02:20.880> it'll<00:02:21.270> all

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
of liked it well don't worry it'll all

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.720 
of liked it well don't worry it'll all
come<00:02:21.420> about<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.170> about<00:02:22.470> how<00:02:22.800> long<00:02:23.040> well<00:02:23.550> we

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
come about in about how long well we

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.880 
come about in about how long well we
find<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.180> if<00:02:24.300> you<00:02:24.390> stick<00:02:24.720> with<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.470> stroke

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
find that if you stick with the stroke

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.790 
find that if you stick with the stroke
you'll<00:02:26.790> have<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.060> tendency<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:28.020> get<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.650> you

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
you'll have a tendency you get it you

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.360 
you'll have a tendency you get it you
lose<00:02:29.010> it

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
lose it

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.190 
lose it
but<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.760> get<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.240> lose<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.900> time

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
but you get it you lose it and the time

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.170 
but you get it you lose it and the time
between<00:02:31.410> those<00:02:31.800> two<00:02:32.010> points<00:02:32.220> begins<00:02:32.940> to

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
between those two points begins to

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.260 
between those two points begins to
decrease<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:33.900> pretty<00:02:34.500> soon<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.580> find<00:02:35.850> out<00:02:36.090> in

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
decrease and pretty soon you find out in

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.330 
decrease and pretty soon you find out in
about<00:02:36.390> eight<00:02:36.870> weeks<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.770> you've<00:02:37.980> got<00:02:38.190> the

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
about eight weeks that you've got the

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.310 
about eight weeks that you've got the
new<00:02:38.490> one<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.850> we<00:02:39.300> find<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.780> when<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.140> get<00:02:40.260> up

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
new one and we find that when you get up

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.650 
new one and we find that when you get up
to<00:02:40.440> about<00:02:40.709> seven<00:02:41.250> out<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.400> ten<00:02:41.760> doing<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.510> the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
to about seven out of ten doing it the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.440 
to about seven out of ten doing it the
new<00:02:42.900> way<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.860> brain<00:02:44.130> then<00:02:44.459> begins<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:44.910> adapt

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
new way the brain then begins to adapt

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.260 
new way the brain then begins to adapt
and<00:02:45.690> adopt<00:02:45.990> that<00:02:46.500> new<00:02:46.770> way<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.820> get<00:02:47.970> some

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
and adopt that new way and you get some

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.270 
and adopt that new way and you get some
variation<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.020> new<00:02:49.200> one<00:02:49.350> not<00:02:49.830> of<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.070> old

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
variation of the new one not of the old

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.140 
variation of the new one not of the old
one<00:02:50.520> so<00:02:51.360> be<00:02:51.630> patient
