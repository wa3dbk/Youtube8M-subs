it<00:03:29.610> so<00:03:30.390> small<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.870> didn't<00:03:31.080> you<00:03:31.140> have<00:03:31.260> a

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
it so small it didn't you have a

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.440 
it so small it didn't you have a
stoplight<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:33.720> go<00:03:33.930> from<00:03:34.200> one<00:03:35.209> pinpoint<00:03:36.209> to

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.759 
the closest pinpoint to your location
and<00:03:38.880> then<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.750> would<00:03:39.870> figure<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.320> actual

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
and then you would figure the actual

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:47.270 
and then you would figure the actual
miles<00:03:41.040> from<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:43.850> location<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:46.280> highway

miles from the location to highway
junctions<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:48.060> then<00:03:48.450> figure<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.750> up<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.140> add

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
junctions and then figure it up and add

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.860 
junctions and then figure it up and add
it<00:03:49.380> up<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.830> it<00:03:50.700> was<00:03:50.820> open<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.299> interpretation

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
it up and it was open to interpretation

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.470 
it up and it was open to interpretation
and<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:53.220> know<00:03:53.340> there<00:03:54.000> were<00:03:54.090> some<00:03:54.269> problems

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
and you know there were some problems

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.990 
and you know there were some problems
with<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:55.019> but<00:03:55.230> at<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:55.590> time<00:03:55.830> it<00:03:56.400> was<00:03:56.880> the

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
with it but at that time it was the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.500 
with it but at that time it was the
industry<00:03:57.450> standard

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
industry standard

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.720 
industry standard
and<00:03:58.659> that's<00:03:59.319> how<00:03:59.439> the<00:03:59.530> term<00:03:59.830> book<00:04:00.129> miles<00:04:00.370> came

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
and that's how the term book miles came

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.630
