00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 
here is my beehive that is approximately

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.199 
here is my beehive that is approximately
one<00:00:07.230> month<00:00:07.410> after<00:00:07.680> installing<00:00:08.219> the<00:00:08.339> bees<00:00:11.209> the

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:12.209 
one month after installing the bees the

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:29.800 
one month after installing the bees the
bee<00:00:12.389> numbers<00:00:12.719> have<00:00:13.019> increased<00:00:14.119> quite<00:00:15.119> a<00:00:15.150> bit

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810

we'll open up the window cover to see
how<00:00:34.760> much<00:00:35.630> of<00:00:35.900> the<00:00:36.610> comas<00:00:37.610> being<00:00:37.820> built

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.389 

as<00:00:51.670> you<00:00:51.910> can<00:00:52.030> see<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.829> hive<00:00:54.070> is<00:00:56.219> pretty<00:00:57.219> much

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
as you can see the hive is pretty much

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:04.410 
as you can see the hive is pretty much
full<00:00:59.370> it's<00:01:00.370> like<00:01:00.579> they<00:01:00.760> have<00:01:00.969> about<00:01:03.119> one<00:01:04.119> top

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
full it's like they have about one top

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.380 
full it's like they have about one top
bar<00:01:04.629> left<00:01:04.839> to<00:01:04.989> build<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.909> we're<00:01:07.030> going<00:01:07.119> to<00:01:07.240> make

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
bar left to build so we're going to make

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.670 
bar left to build so we're going to make

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.350 
sure that they don't build on the last
one<00:01:08.979> so<00:01:09.399> we're<00:01:09.520> able<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:09.790> get<00:01:09.909> into<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:10.210> hype
