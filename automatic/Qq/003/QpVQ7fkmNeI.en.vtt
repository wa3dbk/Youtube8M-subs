00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.379
 as you say, spanish 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.540
 Welcome to all who are 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.250
 have rang again here to a 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.199
 further forecast from matt forecast we 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.910
 Exclusive to youtube and we are always 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.310
 still in the wm qualification for 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.810
 Brazil 2014 South America and the match 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.869
 what we want to look at now is 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.969
 the duel between peru and chile 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.680
 I have to be honest when I say that 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.559
 game is so look at me without 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.670
 any data then i would 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.219
 Actually it's almost a saying 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.120
 very balanced duel 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.399
 so let's have a look 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.180
 the teams have been so set up 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:52.820
 now many currently sixth peru 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:57.480
 eighth so the eight meets the 6 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:01.590
 and yes performance of peru montan 64 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.719
 percent of Chile's 43 percent being 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.240
 one must say in chile four 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.810
 defeats on the piece 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.310
 last but 23 victories in the piece good 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.340
 against haiti maybe not now 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.840
 that very hard game but then 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.820
 at least against the senegal and against 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.520
 There were twice a 2 1 as Egypt can 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.290
 you also build it up and 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.530
 especially the team has with already 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.170
 played three times then perhaps 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.070
 not that unimportant either 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.439
 then ever so a bit of a 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.610
 plays because you know maybe 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.049
 you could still pack it in the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.759
 wm-quali in peru, however, herner 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.329
 wm-quali twice draw last 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.960
 in a 1 0 defeat against paraguay 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:48.930
 and sets a maues 0 0 at honduras and 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.600
 1 2 0 victory against the low and Tobago 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.700
 that probably not quite so 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.259
 the great art should be against 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.530
 trinidad and tobago win too 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.610
 if i do not have the team there now 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.119
 wants to do worse than her 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.659
 probably is up to now in 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.340
 the wm quali 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.869
 even through my first and television 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.580
 is pretty crashed now 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.930
 last three games I also 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:18.440
 does not know if this graphic is intended 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:22.400
 bit funny but okay peru 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.709
 however, they were on the third 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.150
 place at the beginning for fifth then went 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.819
 It's down to number eight 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.230
 again up to seventh place 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:36.769
 and now on the eighth place again 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.879
 so let's take a look who are 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:44.060
 because the best players of both teams and 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:47.840
 let me tell you, peru is the 41st 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.579
 the world ranking and chile is the 22nd 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.900
 the world ranking and yes let's go 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.650
 Who is the most expensive player? 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.709
 from Peru what a surprise 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.170
 jefferson farfan 16 million 14 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.030
 million euro market value of the fc schalke 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.640
 04 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.540
 the right outside the schalker then juan 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:15.829
 vargas of moment the geneva geneva with 6 8 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:19.160
 million and andré carrillo with 5 5 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.690
 millions of sporting lisbon's 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.169
 currently also not so good in 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.269
 the Portuguese league is still there 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:30.380
 maybe paolo guerrero mentions the ex 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.730
 player from hsv and bavaria with 5 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.470
 millions and of course the 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.889
 current player of bavaria claudio 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.720
 pizarro the general purpose weapon with three 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.950
 million euro currently address the stars 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.599
 the team remains the goalkeeper diego 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.760
 Fernandez is the current goalkeeper of 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:51.889
 fc dallas and yes with the chileans 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.430
 Of course the most expensive player Alexis 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:56.870
 sanchez 25 million euro market value of 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.989
 fc barcelona last with a very 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:04.489
 on rising form curve of the right outside 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.200
 then of course the girls of athletes 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.810
 excuse me then from the fc sevilla 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.120
 matias fernandez from ac florence 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.620
 june you should maybe 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.470
 knows about bayer leverkusen 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.320
 Claudio Bravo from Real Sociedad San 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.030
 sebastian and 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.590
 angelo henríquez of wigan athletic 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.480
 I'm just watching if it 's us yet 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.230
 someone I know or know 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:32.130
 who might even say something to me there 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:35.050
 but could not be the case now 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.880
 so let me come to a conclusion 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:42.910
 and tell you my tips for that 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:44.770
 very many are actually just ahead 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.330
 Finally, they have one more 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:54.370
 definitely rising form curve shown 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:56.020
 and that's why my tip will be many 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.560
 enforce this duel and indeed 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.560
 with 2
