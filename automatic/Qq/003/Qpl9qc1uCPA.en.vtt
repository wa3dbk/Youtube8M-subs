play a pirated game right and that's

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.080 
play a pirated game right and that's

doesn't work in my jailbreak and I made

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.229 
doesn't work in my jailbreak and I made
a<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.890> know<00:02:44.010> specific<00:02:44.489> effort<00:02:44.790> while<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.000> was

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
a you know specific effort while I was

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.449 
a you know specific effort while I was
working<00:02:45.450> on<00:02:45.720> this<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.260> try<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.160> enable

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
working on this to try to enable

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.250 
working on this to try to enable

homebrew without enabling things I do

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.860 
homebrew without enabling things I do
not<00:02:49.650> support<00:02:50.040> like<00:02:50.280> piracy<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.360> then<00:02:51.480> what<00:02:51.810> do

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
not support like piracy so then what do

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.150 
not support like piracy so then what do
you<00:02:51.930> think<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.170> issue<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.410> what<00:02:52.650> exactly<00:02:53.040> are

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
you think the issue is what exactly are

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.199 
you think the issue is what exactly are
you<00:02:53.250> being<00:02:53.459> sued<00:02:53.700> for<00:02:53.760> here<00:02:55.670> making<00:02:56.670> Sony<00:02:56.910> mad

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
you being sued for here making Sony mad

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.440 
you being sued for here making Sony mad
ah<00:02:58.160> that'll<00:02:59.160> do<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.370> you<00:03:00.150> were<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.330> first

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
ah that'll do it you were the first

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.210 
ah that'll do it you were the first
person<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.780> unlock<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.200> iPhone<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.950> then<00:03:02.040> of

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
person to unlock the iPhone and then of

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.300 
person to unlock the iPhone and then of
course<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.489> went<00:03:02.580> on<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.850> jailbreak<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.720> iPad

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
course you went on to jailbreak the iPad

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
course you went on to jailbreak the iPad
why<00:03:05.310> did<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.580> turn<00:03:05.700> your<00:03:05.820> attention<00:03:05.880> on<00:03:06.239> the

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
why did you turn your attention on the

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.240 
why did you turn your attention on the
ps3<00:03:06.570> were<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.019> hacking<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.470> simultaneously

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
ps3 were you hacking it simultaneously

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.289 
ps3 were you hacking it simultaneously
in<00:03:08.850> parallel<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.860> initially<00:03:11.640> what<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:11.820> did<00:03:12.060> last

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
in parallel so initially what I did last

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.060 
in parallel so initially what I did last
year<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.750> was<00:03:12.900> playing<00:03:13.200> around<00:03:13.350> in<00:03:13.620> other<00:03:13.769> AHS

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
year I was playing around in other AHS

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.430 
year I was playing around in other AHS
and<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.610> couldn't<00:03:14.880> get<00:03:15.030> access<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.750> full

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
and I couldn't get access to the full

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.319 
and I couldn't get access to the full
access<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.950> video<00:03:17.130> card<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.150> know<00:03:18.299> I

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
access to the video card so you know I

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.449 
access to the video card so you know I
wanted<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.750> get<00:03:19.019> access<00:03:19.230> there<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.920> once<00:03:20.310> I

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
wanted to get access there and once I

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.380 
wanted to get access there and once I
did<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.670> let<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.030> go

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
did I let it go

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.910 
did I let it go
I<00:03:21.420> didn't<00:03:21.750> play<00:03:21.840> around<00:03:22.050> with<00:03:22.170> gameis<00:03:22.590> at<00:03:22.770> all

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
I didn't play around with gameis at all

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.030 
I didn't play around with gameis at all
then<00:03:23.580> come<00:03:24.030> April<00:03:24.180> Sony<00:03:24.900> releases<00:03:25.260> an<00:03:25.470> update

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
then come April Sony releases an update

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.740 
then come April Sony releases an update
that<00:03:26.129> removes<00:03:26.519> other<00:03:26.760> office<00:03:27.030> entirely<00:03:27.299> and

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
that removes other office entirely and

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.220 
that removes other office entirely and
so<00:03:28.680> um<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.640> wanted<00:03:30.269> that<00:03:30.420> access<00:03:30.780> so<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:30.959> went

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
so um you wanted that access so I went

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.990 
so um you wanted that access so I went
poking<00:03:31.500> around<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:32.010> then<00:03:32.159> you<00:03:32.640> decided<00:03:32.939> to

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
poking around and then you decided to

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.569 
poking around and then you decided to
release<00:03:33.209> it<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.420> world<00:03:34.040> exactly<00:03:35.040> well<00:03:35.549> a

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
release it to the world exactly well a

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:36.589 
release it to the world exactly well a
federal<00:03:35.790> court<00:03:36.150> has<00:03:36.239> ruled<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:36.540> that

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
federal court has ruled that that

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.479

a fallout from this case definitely I

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.920 
a fallout from this case definitely I
think<00:04:44.190> this<00:04:44.490> case<00:04:44.699> is<00:04:44.909> about<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.180> lot<00:04:45.449> more<00:04:45.479> than

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
think this case is about a lot more than

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.290 
think this case is about a lot more than
what<00:04:46.260> I<00:04:46.289> did<00:04:46.650> and<00:04:46.830> me<00:04:47.010> it's<00:04:47.340> about<00:04:47.639> whether

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
what I did and me it's about whether

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.870 
what I did and me it's about whether
whether<00:04:49.050> you<00:04:49.169> really<00:04:49.650> own<00:04:49.830> that<00:04:49.860> device<00:04:50.610> that

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
whether you really own that device that

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.510 
whether you really own that device that
you<00:04:50.970> purchased<00:04:51.449> and<00:04:52.310> hypothetically<00:04:53.310> let's

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
you purchased and hypothetically let's

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.159 
you purchased and hypothetically let's
