00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.270
 hello together frank fisherman ff 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.699
 Photo school today with a short video 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.369
 on the subject flash with in the backlight 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.980
 party one sees that I am such a 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.520
 little happy face on the last 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.980
 weekend 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.949
 we had our beach event at the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.010
 Schleswig-Holstein's Baltic Sea coast and 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.199
 As always, we have to conclude 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.059
 our hensel party in the back light 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.370
 worked 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.260
 many thanks to hÃ¤nsel for this 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.640
 sponsoring law import the very much 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.040
 explain briefly how to do it 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.470
 proceeds as the board and 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.820
 the participants acted like the one 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.040
 portier magic use and to the 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.360
 I have matching lighting comes 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.729
 thought okay the motto others 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.510
 interested callers once briefly the 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.090
 statement 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.909
 how does it all I can so the whole 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.490
 do as it does professionally 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:19.270
 would 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:23.560
 or just like I did locally 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.299
 I would be professional all the same 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.340
 solve with a report in the knife we 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.350
 also have a big sky here 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.329
 Many thanks also to leave many ask 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.249
 from the light meter the benefit 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.530
 Also very much in my studio where it 

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:37.479
 It's not difficult to measure 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.950
 and where you probably with several 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.179
 Light sources works in this 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.450
 parameter had two light sources on 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:47.439
 beach namely once the sun and 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.729
 once the lightning and the challenge 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.319
 is a clean first then I am 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.600
 should get on the background as 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:55.210
 do you do that so the camera puts in 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.240
 the on the aperture preset mode so the 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:02.770
 automatic timer the few mode or av 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.689
 mode and measure, for example, quiet times 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.270
 with the spot measurement in a government 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:11.610
 the sky where it is so relatively blue 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.410
 correspond to the exposure and 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.990
 betrayed the direction in which the sun 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.850
 in the back light is and remembers the 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.340
 values 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.810
 I dully drowned on it 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.879
 dazzle 22 with the 1dx and the 24 70 out 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.349
 a very simple reason because I 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.800
 this beautiful star effect and the 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.120
 wanted to have the sun in 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.550
 if you go the aperture very strong 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.720
 closes because the sunbeams 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.490
 have this punctiform light source 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.210
 at the transitions of the diaphragm blades 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.810
 break 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.490
 you can see the whole picture here 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.080
 I thought okay, that's all 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.670
 still a small steak up to bright 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.980
 At aperture 22 we had a 60 countries 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.330
 further advantage 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.820
 interspersed we come to the areas 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.050
 in the field of lightning 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.590
 synchronization time and that one 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:04.930
 Of course, the picture is like that too 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.960
 said too bright and then I have the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.000
 camera in manual mode 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.990
 have voted again at 22 and then have 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.930
 the exposure time significantly shortened 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.940
 and in a two hundredths and 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.950
 the result still completely without matching 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.080
 bildausschnitt and so on just around the 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.240
 background clean dark full blue too 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.710
 Do not report on the sun and on the sun 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.180
 everything in the environment of the sun the sky 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.080
 totally over radiate 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.280
 the result hides 22 and how 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.760
 said a hundredth 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.660
 you see here now in the picture and then 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.590
 follow that done 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.260
 we just have the model in front of the 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.540
 sun positioned na how was so nice 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.130
 taught and also then 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.250
 I just made a picture 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.500
 without flashing just so with the 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.440
 same setting end 22 2 hundredths 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.000
 and nawid in the light of the result 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.790
 Looks like you see it in principle 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.260
 Thus, the silhouette was created 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.520
 foreground where it is totally 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.900
 lies darkly this year in the shadow and in the 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.420
 background is just this very bright 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.980
 light back on it radiates the sun 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.830
 In spite of that, the sky is still 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.730
 reasonably correctly exposed one 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.260
 interrupt small tick 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.810
 that's what i do as a picture effect 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.320
 wanted and he is just total 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.850
 dark 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.859
 Now you could do it all with one 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.640
 reflector we have ourselves or similar 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.650
 regulate 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.510
 that has me the day also diverse 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.160
 made male it is in fact in 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.440
 to work against the sundance 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.440
 because I hardly believe the navi the 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.669
 could keep our eyes open if we 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.199
 directly the sun 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.550
 the relatively low stands in rain 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:43.229
 reflect because sunspots tel 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.349
 so far that is not a solution and there 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:49.050
 we have the pott ii fired the 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.490
 focus again plugged and I have the 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.610
 party put to the full power 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.740
 a channel is used and a normal one 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.120
 reflector to the head because I made 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.560
 yes very strongly directed light have 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.690
 I really just wanted that 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.340
 on the model that is not and not 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.840
 the whole background is illuminated 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.759
 and light gets lost on the sides 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.880
 and I wanted to have a very direct light 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:12.349
 the model and this part on highest 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:16.020
 level 1000 seconds and have triggered 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:18.210
 so the result you can see here 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.389
 the result what you see is that 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.220
 end result because of bit 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:26.940
 Experience the maximum performance 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.289
 exactly to the photo fit and to the 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.280
 popular lighting situation against 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.539
 sanne to flash 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.800
 it's related to me now 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.449
 first with games against the places 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.800
 have and clear that they are much 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.840
 performance would need the distance 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.229
 By the way, between the lightning head and the 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:46.289
 model was maybe two and a half thirty-four 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:49.469
 300 m 103 meters it is just in this 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.479
 exactly the right distance to exactly 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:55.529
 the right effect and sufficient 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:57.779
 light in front of the flash and just how 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:01.680
 before and violence reported 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:04.020
 background tells everything is yes no 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.669
 perhaps no party is and maybe 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.110
 legally the Hansel because that is not quite 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.729
 cheap purchase first love him 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.449
 because he is so reliable and so 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:14.279
 insane many lightning can fall off and 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.719
 but it is really robust 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:17.759
 Does not matter to the whole one can also 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:19.259
 transferred to systems places or 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.969
 another mobile flash solution 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:23.340
 the focus are the same as i would like 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:24.509
 First the background is best in the 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.370
 Dimming preset mode as the time 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.319
 automatically select correct 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.199
 If necessary change then we notice 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:35.669
 the values then change to manual 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:38.580
 mode and then position the model in 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:40.259
 gegenlicht and celebrated the lightning and 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.460
 you come to fit relatively quickly 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:42.870
 result is still increasing 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.759
 one doubts the highest achievement the 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.229
 the lightning provides if he already too little 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:49.800
 is not you want dark well then will 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:50.910
 the whole thing will be nothing but her 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.650
 do it all a little bit more 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:56.430
 for example or has a second or 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.660
 something like that if it is too bright the 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.190
 foreground as model too strong 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.419
 is illuminated by the lightning yes then 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.199
 regulates next to now just down to 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:03.840
 comes here very fast to one 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:06.300
 matching results back was the 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.910
 end result blind 220 two hundredths 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.479
 porti 1200 seconds normal reflector of 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.160
 ahead 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:13.259
 I hope you liked it as 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.770
 brought and have fun in the 

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:17.479
 program
