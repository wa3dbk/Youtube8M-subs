this<00:02:07.920> map<00:02:08.160> at<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:08.940> bomb<00:02:09.149> site<00:02:09.179> near<00:02:09.599> where<00:02:09.720> I

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
this map at the bomb site near where I

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.400 
this map at the bomb site near where I
am<00:02:09.929> now

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
am now

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.980 
am now
not<00:02:10.500> sure<00:02:10.650> it<00:02:10.740> was<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> or<00:02:11.040> b<00:02:11.280> bomb<00:02:11.550> site<00:02:11.990> but

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
that will really high up the rankings to

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.350 
that will really high up the rankings to
a<00:02:19.380> proper<00:02:19.680> pump<00:02:19.920> because<00:02:20.130> you're<00:02:20.340> winning<00:02:20.730> you

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
a proper pump because you're winning you

know something like 31 we were pretty

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.970 
know something like 31 we were pretty
much<00:02:23.310> noobs<00:02:23.670> at<00:02:23.910> GBA<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.600> then<00:02:25.290> on<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.800> last

much noobs at GBA and then on the last
round<00:02:26.370> my<00:02:26.640> friend<00:02:26.910> put<00:02:27.090> down<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.270> decoy<00:02:27.720> see<00:02:27.960> for

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
round my friend put down a decoy see for

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.310 
round my friend put down a decoy see for
not<00:02:29.220> realizing<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:31.880> other<00:02:32.880> team<00:02:33.210> saw<00:02:34.110> it

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
not realizing and the other team saw it

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.810 
not realizing and the other team saw it
and<00:02:34.500> they<00:02:34.620> captured<00:02:35.070> it<00:02:35.160> on<00:02:35.190> whatever<00:02:35.430> and

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820

down<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.470> c4<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.700> we<00:02:38.820> cheated<00:02:39.150> and

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
down a c4 and that we cheated and

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.470 
down a c4 and that we cheated and
dispute<00:02:40.320> or<00:02:40.380> whatever<00:02:40.940> absolutely<00:02:41.940> good<00:02:42.090> cuz

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
dispute or whatever absolutely good cuz

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.920

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
we had to put that game down as a lot

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.340 
we had to put that game down as a lot
which<00:02:46.160> really<00:02:47.160> sucked<00:02:47.520> but<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:47.850> was<00:02:47.970> pretty

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
which really sucked but I was pretty

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.110 
which really sucked but I was pretty
pretty<00:02:49.350> good<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.650> might<00:02:49.800> get<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.220> UAV<00:02:50.760> for<00:02:51.060> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
pretty good that might get a UAV for the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.730 
pretty good that might get a UAV for the
team<00:02:51.300> there<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.690> was<00:02:51.900> pretty<00:02:52.020> good<00:02:52.230> going<00:02:52.410> that

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
team there I was pretty good going that

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.790 
team there I was pretty good going that
helped<00:02:53.040> out<00:02:53.570> yeah<00:02:54.570> so<00:02:54.900> we<00:02:55.140> lost<00:02:55.350> that<00:02:55.530> much

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
helped out yeah so we lost that much

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.440 
helped out yeah so we lost that much
which<00:02:56.130> would<00:02:56.370> have<00:02:56.460> put<00:02:56.640> us<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:57.120> know<00:02:57.240> up<00:02:57.420> in

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
which would have put us you know up in

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.870 
which would have put us you know up in
the<00:02:57.690> rankings<00:02:58.020> that<00:02:58.260> was<00:02:58.380> like<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.770> third<00:02:59.460> gb

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
the rankings that was like a third gb

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.640 
the rankings that was like a third gb
match<00:03:00.090> or<00:03:00.330> something<00:03:00.450> certain<00:03:01.170> destroy<00:03:01.470> on

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
know the middle warehouse we can climb

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.490 
know the middle warehouse we can climb
up<00:03:20.100> on<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.340> roof<00:03:20.490> and<00:03:20.790> just<00:03:21.240> off<00:03:21.390> there<00:03:21.690> that

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
up on the roof and just off there that

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.780 
up on the roof and just off there that
would<00:03:22.620> have<00:03:22.709> been<00:03:22.740> epic<00:03:23.070> I<00:03:23.370> should<00:03:23.550> have<00:03:23.670> done

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
would have been epic I should have done

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.070 
would have been epic I should have done
that<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:23.970> should<00:03:24.150> have<00:03:24.240> climbed<00:03:24.540> up<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.900> then

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
that I should have climbed up and then

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.140 
that I should have climbed up and then
just<00:03:25.320> drop<00:03:25.800> c4<00:03:26.310> on<00:03:26.340> them<00:03:26.790> because<00:03:26.880> there<00:03:27.060> are<00:03:27.120> a

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
just drop c4 on them because there are a

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.790 
just drop c4 on them because there are a
lot<00:03:27.300> of<00:03:27.330> them<00:03:27.420> around<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.900> area<00:03:28.200> just<00:03:28.260> drop<00:03:28.650> C

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
lot of them around the area just drop C

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.930 
lot of them around the area just drop C
for<00:03:28.980> blowing<00:03:29.220> them<00:03:29.370> up<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.550> might<00:03:29.700> have<00:03:29.820> got

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
for blowing them up I might have got

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.390 
for blowing them up I might have got
like<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.090> few<00:03:30.330> doubles<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.870> stuff<00:03:31.110> oh<00:03:31.320> man<00:03:32.190> that

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
like a few doubles and stuff oh man that

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.100 
like a few doubles and stuff oh man that
have<00:03:32.520> been<00:03:32.610> epic<00:03:32.840> hindsight<00:03:33.840> is<00:03:33.990> a<00:03:34.020> wonderful

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
have been epic hindsight is a wonderful

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.790 
have been epic hindsight is a wonderful
thing<00:03:34.740> but<00:03:35.580> yeah<00:03:36.540> that's<00:03:36.810> another<00:03:37.170> kind<00:03:37.590> of

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
thing but yeah that's another kind of

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.310 
thing but yeah that's another kind of
little<00:03:38.520> tip<00:03:38.760> if<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.180> like<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.720> mean<00:03:40.230> it's

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
little tip if you like I mean it's

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.110 
little tip if you like I mean it's
fairly<00:03:40.500> common<00:03:40.739> sense<00:03:41.130> but<00:03:41.400> if<00:03:41.640> you're<00:03:41.850> using

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
fairly common sense but if you're using

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.510 
fairly common sense but if you're using
explosive<00:03:42.989> weapon<00:03:43.350> or<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.530> high<00:03:43.830> ground<00:03:44.190> it's

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
explosive weapon or a high ground it's

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.990 
explosive weapon or a high ground it's
always<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.060> place<00:03:45.270> to<00:03:45.450> be<00:03:45.860> just<00:03:46.860> because<00:03:47.100> you

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
always the place to be just because you
