00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.000
- Hi.
- Hello!

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.200
- Hello.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let's talk about the weather and other things, okay?

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.000
Look at the sketch and let's practice the sentences.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.160
My name is Takamisawa. Nice to meet you.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.200
Where are the students coming from?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.040
All over Europe, Korea, China, Thailand and other countries.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.000
In other classes there are people from The Philippines, Egypt, Vietnam-

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.000
-and last year we had one student from Myanmar, so we are-

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.160
-teaching students from a lot of different countries.
0:00:53.000,0:00:52.160
Also, we teachers always try to help each other to level up our skills.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.170
The students are both serious and gentle,-

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.010
-so I think the atmosphere of the school is overall very nice.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.150
My name is Anders and I'm from Norway.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.150
- When did you come to Japan?
- I came to Japan 3 months ago.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.250
I chose this school becase after looking around on the internet-

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.140
-and also contacting a few schools, to try to figure out what I'd like.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.010
- Right.
- This was the school that gave me the best impression.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.040
I'm studying to be able to enter a Japanese university.
0:01:41.050,0:01:38.010
- So you have the...
- I'm gonna take the Japanese Language Proficiency Test.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.280
- Oh, is it level 1 or 2?
- It's level 2.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.000
I would like to live here in the future.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.000
- What's the matter?
- I have a sore throat.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.040
- Then you should drink a lot of water.
- Yes, I will.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.240
Why should western students choose your school?

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.240
Right. I think there are a lot of people that have-

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.240
-an interest in characteristic Japanese culture.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.240
Many western students say that they get to experience things that-

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.100
-they've never seen before or even thought could be possible.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.180
If you want experiences like that, this school is the right place.
0:02:33.190,0:02:27.100
We try to come up with nice plans and visit a lot of places.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.100
We put this in the curriculum because we want the students-

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.140
-to experience a lot of things and have fun when they are in Japan.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.250
Everyone, here at System Toyo Gaigo we gather very kind teachers.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.250
We give everyone a warm welcome-

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.250
-and the possibility to have exciting experiences.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.200
I hope you can get a feel for the atmosphere of our school-

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.020
-and ultimately choose to come and study with us.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.250
We'll be waiting for you.
