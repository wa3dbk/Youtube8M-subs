00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
well first you select a stump I call it

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
it's a section of a tree and you pick a

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.819 
it's a section of a tree and you pick a
hardwood<00:00:38.489> as<00:00:39.450> hard<00:00:39.660> as<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.870> can

the<00:00:41.219> one<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.149> ash<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.590> ideal<00:00:43.980> for

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the one I have is ash it's ideal for

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.810 
the one I have is ash it's ideal for
this<00:00:44.850> I've<00:00:45.059> had<00:00:45.090> mine<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:46.460> over<00:00:47.460> thirty<00:00:47.730> years

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
this I've had mine for over thirty years

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.920 
this I've had mine for over thirty years
and<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:49.050> still<00:00:49.320> serves<00:00:49.590> me<00:00:49.829> well<00:00:49.980> every<00:00:50.430> day

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
and it still serves me well every day

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.170 
and it still serves me well every day
and<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> new<00:00:53.340> one<00:00:53.489> here<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.059> I'm

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and so this is a new one here and I'm

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.700 
and so this is a new one here and I'm
just<00:00:54.239> doing<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.870> show<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.199> how<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.469> can

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
just doing this to show you how you can

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.529 
just doing this to show you how you can
build<00:00:55.890> your<00:00:56.070> own<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:57.120> one's<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.449> little

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
build your own this one's a little

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.700 
build your own this one's a little
smaller<00:00:57.960> than<00:00:58.109> mine

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
smaller than mine

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.610 
smaller than mine
and<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.120> see<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.440> first

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
and what you can see here is the first

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.160 
and what you can see here is the first
thing<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:02.010> did<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.489> peeled<00:01:03.210> off<00:01:03.420> all<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.870> bark

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
thing I did is I peeled off all the bark

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.039 
thing I did is I peeled off all the bark
and<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.610> reason<00:01:05.610> for<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.090> wood

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
and the reason for that is because wood

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.780 
and the reason for that is because wood
was<00:01:07.260> outside<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.310> bit<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.640> moisture

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
was outside and it was a bit of moisture

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.179 
was outside and it was a bit of moisture
in<00:01:09.270> there<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.350> wanted<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.740> try<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.010> out

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
in there and I wanted to try it out

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.429 
in there and I wanted to try it out
completely<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.479> best<00:01:12.659> way<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.260> is

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
completely so the best way to do that is

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.789 
completely so the best way to do that is
to<00:01:13.590> remove<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.070> bark<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:15.229> let<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.350> let<00:01:16.740> it

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
to remove the bark and let it let it

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.830 
to remove the bark and let it let it
cure<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.820> one's<00:01:18.000> been<00:01:18.150> sitting<00:01:18.180> around<00:01:18.509> for

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
cure this one's been sitting around for

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.450 
cure this one's been sitting around for
a<00:01:18.900> long<00:01:19.049> time<00:01:19.409> that's<00:01:19.650> why<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.920> bark<00:01:20.250> is

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
a long time that's why the bark is

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.580 
a long time that's why the bark is
fairly<00:01:20.729> easy<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.270> know<00:01:21.960> because<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.380> pretty

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
fairly easy to know because it's pretty

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.090 
fairly easy to know because it's pretty
dry<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:24.390> I'm<00:01:24.659> using<00:01:24.840> an<00:01:25.080> old<00:01:25.170> rebel<00:01:25.590> spike

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
dry and I'm using an old rebel spike

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.100 
dry and I'm using an old rebel spike
which<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.460> has<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> pretty<00:01:27.180> sharp<00:01:27.450> edge<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.049> I

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
which it has a pretty sharp edge and I

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.600 
which it has a pretty sharp edge and I
have<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> lot<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.560> them<00:01:28.950> that's<00:01:29.130> why<00:01:29.340> I'm<00:01:29.460> using

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
have a lot of them that's why I'm using

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.030 
have a lot of them that's why I'm using
it<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.659> real<00:01:30.840> easy<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.259> peel<00:01:31.470> off<00:01:31.650> all<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
it it's real easy to peel off all the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.100 
it it's real easy to peel off all the
park<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:34.850> that's<00:01:35.850> that's<00:01:36.390> what<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.780> can<00:01:36.930> see

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
park and that's that's what you can see

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.240 
park and that's that's what you can see
I'm<00:01:37.320> doing<00:01:37.350> here<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:39.990> see<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> next<00:01:41.009> step

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
I'm doing here and see the next step

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.940 
I'm doing here and see the next step
that<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.540> want<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.170> all<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.649> can

it's<00:01:47.210> approximately<00:01:48.770> like<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.829> football<00:01:50.159> and

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
it's approximately like a football and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.670 
it's approximately like a football and
yeah<00:01:52.590> about<00:01:52.740> 14<00:01:53.340> inches<00:01:53.490> across<00:01:54.170> 12<00:01:55.170> 14<00:01:55.649> inches

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
yeah about 14 inches across 12 14 inches

yeah about 14 inches across 12 14 inches
that's<00:01:56.100> that's<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.520> real<00:01:56.759> nice<00:01:57.560> small<00:01:58.560> portable

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
that's that's a real nice small portable

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.880 
that's that's a real nice small portable
enough<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.610> carry<00:01:59.850> around<00:02:00.110> yet<00:02:01.110> very

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
enough to carry around yet very

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.920 
enough to carry around yet very

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.219 

okay<00:02:07.650> let's<00:02:08.160> see<00:02:08.429> there's<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.179> top<00:02:09.479> view<00:02:09.509> notice

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
okay let's see there's a top view notice

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.680 
okay let's see there's a top view notice
there's<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.500> little<00:02:11.220> Aryans<00:02:11.850> in<00:02:12.240> the<00:02:12.420> left

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
there's a little Aryans in the left

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.510 
there's a little Aryans in the left
there<00:02:12.960> it's<00:02:13.230> actually<00:02:13.650> where<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.890> branch<00:02:14.220> was

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
there it's actually where a branch was

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.410 
there it's actually where a branch was
growing<00:02:14.940> out<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.390> tree<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:16.020> then<00:02:16.800> makes

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
growing out of this tree and then makes

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.750 
growing out of this tree and then makes
it<00:02:18.420> makes<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.810> really<00:02:18.960> difficult<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:20.130> split<00:02:20.460> if

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
it makes it really difficult to split if

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.520 
it makes it really difficult to split if
you<00:02:20.850> were<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.120> split<00:02:21.300> this<00:02:21.540> wood<00:02:21.750> for<00:02:22.080> for

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
you were to split this wood for for

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.860 
you were to split this wood for for
firewood<00:02:22.950> which<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:24.000> ideal<00:02:24.360> for<00:02:24.390> this<00:02:24.720> because

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
firewood which is ideal for this because

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.330 
firewood which is ideal for this because
you<00:02:25.080> don't<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:25.410> want<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.740> splitting<00:02:26.160> on

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
you don't really want it splitting on

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.660 
you don't really want it splitting on
you<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:27.530> if<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.709> select<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.190> piece<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.550> wood

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
you so if you select the piece of wood

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.850 
you so if you select the piece of wood
that<00:02:29.820> has<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.000> lot<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.360> branches<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.470> that's

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
that has a lot of branches that that's

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.699 
that has a lot of branches that that's
probably<00:02:32.190> really<00:02:32.580> good<00:02:33.020> okay<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.050> think<00:02:34.140> miss<00:02:34.680> a

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
probably really good okay I think miss a

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.230 
probably really good okay I think miss a
little<00:02:34.920> bit<00:02:35.010> here<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:35.430> basically<00:02:35.880> what<00:02:36.120> I'm

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
little bit here but basically what I'm

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.460 
little bit here but basically what I'm
doing<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.660> I'm<00:02:36.990> drilling<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.890> hole<00:02:38.570> it's<00:02:39.570> 3/4<00:02:40.440> of

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
doing is I'm drilling a hole it's 3/4 of

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.699 
doing is I'm drilling a hole it's 3/4 of
an<00:02:40.709> inch<00:02:40.830> Spade<00:02:41.430> drills<00:02:41.760> what<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.060> used<00:02:42.470> if<00:02:43.470> you

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
an inch Spade drills what I used if you

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.340 
an inch Spade drills what I used if you
drill<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.220> three<00:02:44.430> quarter<00:02:44.730> inch<00:02:44.910> hole<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.540> barrel

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
drill a three quarter inch hole a barrel

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.140 
drill a three quarter inch hole a barrel
spike<00:02:46.680> will<00:02:46.920> fit<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.280> there<00:02:47.459> perfectly<00:02:47.520> see

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
spike will fit in there perfectly see

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.220 
spike will fit in there perfectly see
I'm<00:02:48.480> using<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:49.110> leather<00:02:50.040> mallet<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:51.020> set<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.140> in

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
I'm using a leather mallet to set it in

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.650 
I'm using a leather mallet to set it in
place<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:52.770> you<00:02:52.920> don't<00:02:53.250> damage<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.970> surface<00:02:54.510> of

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
place so you don't damage the surface of

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.790 
place so you don't damage the surface of
the<00:02:54.810> highly<00:02:55.440> polished<00:02:55.680> rebel<00:02:56.190> spike<00:02:57.680> then<00:02:58.680> I

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
the highly polished rebel spike then I

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.740 
the highly polished rebel spike then I
have<00:02:59.040> figured<00:02:59.880> I'm<00:02:59.970> gonna<00:03:00.090> put<00:03:00.300> about<00:03:00.480> three

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
have figured I'm gonna put about three

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.979 
have figured I'm gonna put about three
different<00:03:00.900> spikes<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.770> here<00:03:02.070> or<00:03:02.220> stakes<00:03:02.989> so

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
different spikes in here or stakes so

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.010 
different spikes in here or stakes so
there's<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.739> second<00:03:05.250> hole<00:03:05.540> drilling<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.810> by

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
there's the second hole drilling it by

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.820 
there's the second hole drilling it by
and<00:03:07.200> there's<00:03:07.350> a<00:03:07.440> third<00:03:08.180> so<00:03:09.180> I'm<00:03:09.600> gonna<00:03:10.530> have

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
and there's a third so I'm gonna have

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.150 
and there's a third so I'm gonna have
three<00:03:11.190> different<00:03:11.400> tools<00:03:11.850> in<00:03:12.090> here<00:03:12.799> maybe<00:03:13.799> more

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
three different tools in here maybe more

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.539 
three different tools in here maybe more
you<00:03:14.519> can<00:03:14.640> always<00:03:14.820> add<00:03:15.530> this<00:03:16.530> particular<00:03:16.920> one

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
you can always add this particular one

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.729 
you can always add this particular one
oh<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.850> holes<00:03:18.090> there<00:03:18.600> Oh<00:03:18.630> inch<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.709> half

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
oh the holes there Oh inch and a half

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.910 
oh the holes there Oh inch and a half
inch<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.280> 3/4<00:03:20.910> is<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.660> good<00:03:21.989> depth<00:03:22.290> for<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.680> very

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
inch and 3/4 is a good depth for a very

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.800 
inch and 3/4 is a good depth for a very
real<00:03:23.070> spike<00:03:23.400> it'll<00:03:24.090> set<00:03:24.360> in<00:03:24.480> there<00:03:24.660> really

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
real spike it'll set in there really

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.289 
real spike it'll set in there really
tight<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:27.200> it's<00:03:28.200> very<00:03:28.470> very<00:03:28.650> functional<00:03:29.299> you

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
tight and it's very very functional you

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.509 
tight and it's very very functional you
notice<00:03:30.570> that<00:03:30.660> I'm<00:03:30.840> kind<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:31.890> putting<00:03:32.280> the

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
notice that I'm kind of putting the

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.340 
notice that I'm kind of putting the
working<00:03:32.970> end<00:03:33.180> of<00:03:33.360> each<00:03:33.510> stake<00:03:33.840> towards<00:03:34.230> the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
working end of each stake towards the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.920 
working end of each stake towards the
outside<00:03:34.830> it's<00:03:35.400> easier<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:35.940> work<00:03:36.120> on<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.570> edge

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
outside it's easier to work on the edge

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.710 
outside it's easier to work on the edge
of<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.410> stomp<00:03:37.709> down<00:03:37.950> like<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.120> curved<00:03:39.450> one

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
of the stomp down like that curved one

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.479 
of the stomp down like that curved one
there<00:03:39.989> that's<00:03:40.170> excellent<00:03:40.920> for<00:03:41.100> making

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
there that's excellent for making

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.199 
there that's excellent for making
bracelets<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.180> shaping<00:03:42.570> bracelets<00:03:43.140> and<00:03:44.209> the

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
bracelets and shaping bracelets and the

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.900 
bracelets and shaping bracelets and the
flat<00:03:45.450> one<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:48.560> and<00:03:49.560> now<00:03:49.769> I'm<00:03:49.920> making<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.459> hole<00:03:50.700> on

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
flat one is and now I'm making a hole on

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.150 
flat one is and now I'm making a hole on
the<00:03:50.970> side<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.989> you<00:03:52.290> notice<00:03:52.590> I've<00:03:52.739> got<00:03:52.890> about<00:03:53.100> a

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
the side and you notice I've got about a

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.780 
the side and you notice I've got about a
though<00:03:53.700> but<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.060> thirty<00:03:54.450> degree<00:03:54.630> angle<00:03:54.870> maybe

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
though but a thirty degree angle maybe

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.250 
though but a thirty degree angle maybe
so<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.880> don't<00:03:57.090> want<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.329> put<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.600> straight<00:03:57.750> in

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
so you don't want to put it straight in

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.390 
so you don't want to put it straight in
you<00:03:58.470> want<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:59.790> hole<00:04:00.000> slightly<00:04:00.420> angled<00:04:01.079> up<00:04:01.400> to

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
you want the hole slightly angled up to

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.489 
you want the hole slightly angled up to
put<00:04:02.640> your<00:04:02.910> ring<00:04:03.090> mandrel<00:04:03.329> in<00:04:03.660> there

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:04.499 
put your ring mandrel in there

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:06.949 
put your ring mandrel in there
my<00:04:04.950> ring<00:04:05.189> mandrel<00:04:05.459> is<00:04:05.849> a<00:04:05.879> one-inch<00:04:06.659> diameter

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
my ring mandrel is a one-inch diameter

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.110 
my ring mandrel is a one-inch diameter
at<00:04:07.439> the<00:04:07.560> day<00:04:07.709> so<00:04:07.769> this<00:04:08.219> is<00:04:08.400> drilling<00:04:08.819> a

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
at the day so this is drilling a

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.319 
at the day so this is drilling a
one-inch<00:04:09.540> diameter<00:04:09.989> hole<00:04:10.790> some<00:04:11.790> mandrels<00:04:12.239> are

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
one-inch diameter hole some mandrels are

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:13.670 
one-inch diameter hole some mandrels are
actually<00:04:12.659> three<00:04:12.930> quarters<00:04:13.290> of<00:04:13.319> an<00:04:13.560> inch

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
actually three quarters of an inch

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.559 
actually three quarters of an inch
they're<00:04:13.950> smaller<00:04:14.310> so<00:04:14.639> you<00:04:14.730> check<00:04:15.329> your

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
they're smaller so you check your

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.509 
they're smaller so you check your
mandrel<00:04:16.259> and<00:04:16.440> see<00:04:16.560> what<00:04:16.709> size<00:04:16.919> hole<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.340> have

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
mandrel and see what size hole you have

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.370 
mandrel and see what size hole you have
to<00:04:17.639> drill<00:04:19.729> so<00:04:20.729> once<00:04:21.030> it's<00:04:21.209> in<00:04:21.359> there<00:04:21.539> it's<00:04:21.690> that

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
to drill so once it's in there it's that

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.260 
to drill so once it's in there it's that
angle<00:04:22.860> there<00:04:23.009> is<00:04:23.039> makes<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:23.460> really<00:04:23.729> nice<00:04:24.060> to

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
angle there is makes it really nice to

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.920 
angle there is makes it really nice to
work<00:04:24.419> on<00:04:25.400> okay<00:04:26.400> so<00:04:27.180> now<00:04:27.360> we<00:04:27.419> have<00:04:27.780> three<00:04:28.910> spikes

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
work on okay so now we have three spikes

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.320 
work on okay so now we have three spikes
we<00:04:30.930> have<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.080> curved<00:04:31.560> a<00:04:31.710> dome<00:04:31.949> and<00:04:32.220> a<00:04:32.400> flat<00:04:32.699> those

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
we have a curved a dome and a flat those

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.450 
we have a curved a dome and a flat those
are<00:04:33.479> the<00:04:33.570> most<00:04:33.750> popular<00:04:34.110> ones<00:04:34.440> that<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:34.979> use<00:04:35.220> I

use those all the time here's a

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.680 
use those all the time here's a
comparison<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.699> old<00:04:38.849> rare<00:04:39.060> will<00:04:39.240> spike<00:04:39.509> when

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
comparison the old rare will spike when

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.890 
comparison the old rare will spike when

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
highly polished you can see it this is a

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.900 
highly polished you can see it this is a
domed<00:04:45.389> one<00:04:45.690> here<00:04:45.960> it's<00:04:46.949> like<00:04:47.130> a<00:04:47.190> mirror<00:04:47.639> and

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
domed one here it's like a mirror and

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.700 
domed one here it's like a mirror and
that's<00:04:48.210> exactly<00:04:48.720> what's<00:04:49.110> underneath<00:04:49.440> all

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
that's exactly what's underneath all

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.320
