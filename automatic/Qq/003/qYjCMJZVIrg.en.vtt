00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.779
 let's talk about willpower is not 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.700
 the most correct way nor suitable for 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.410
 achieve the goals you want for 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.990
 the goal that is set to lower 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.020
 access because because the strength of 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.080
 will is an internal desire that we have 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.080
 we are an impulse towards something towards 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.789
 a fact towards a prey which does not 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.310
 we do with that's what they're going 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.310
 forging through time and we won 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.160
 greater power no greater desire to do something 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.470
 greater will now but because we 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.650
 serves to lose weight because during 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.120
 a lot of time we say if you go to 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.220
 have greater willpower to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.470
 lose weight if you do not have strength 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.200
 willingness to express a routine of 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.230
 exercises if I go to the gym if I go to 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.390
 run although pc nobody is all bacÃ¡n 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.880
 we started and then everything ends 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.140
 we started also and started to go down to 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.750
 lower it down and we stay there 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.120
 So that in other words is the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.870
 willpower like that starts and 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.870
 disappears 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.470
 for these exercises here I do not have 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.240
 willpower to do diets and 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.549
 we invest willpower to leave 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.740
 to eat chocolates or fats or sodas 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.509
 or everything that hurts me or I do not have 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.290
 strength will to start this new 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.940
 regime and can not can not because 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.000
 because willpower 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.340
 without me and in the mind part 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.370
 conscious what happens what is it that I'm going 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.670
 to say look when you want to do 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.440
 something you want to lose weight you want 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.190
 have willpower and sex what 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:42.010
 you have but you are fighting against your 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.410
 instincts are fighting against the part 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.660
 of your subconscious mind and that creates 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.600
 this this is going to create a kind of 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.090
 resistance to your body because because you 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.390
 you have an idea an idea that is in the 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.270
 conscious part where the force gets 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.890
 of will is an idea that you want 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.750
 I want willpower to do 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.880
 this and it appears in the conscious part 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.060
 but the problem is that the low 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.429
 subconscious your body your mind what 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.890
 deeper inside and to be 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.750
 programmed to be fat and is 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.270
 scheduled not to exercise and 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.550
 is programmed to eat fat and is 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.950
 programmed to have anxiety then 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.540
 when you want something quickly that 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.700
 if something is going to be tremendous to say 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.459
 simply 5 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.500
 subconscious part is going to be 95 that's going to 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.230
 I do not want to say no to exercise 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.810
 I want to do diets I do not want to stop 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.910
 eat this I like fat I like the 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.860
 food with high caloric content 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.170
 they like desserts and your strength will 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.540
 to go to 5 yes but I want to go down I want to 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.610
 leave the subconscious part will say no what 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.980
 I'm going to do, I'm not going to do it and what's 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.440
 going to want the fight a strong 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.590
 resistance a barrier and you will not be able to 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.290
 fight against that at best maybe the 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.870
 conscious part of desire strength 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.610
 bruta will go up 10 maybe it's more but 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.769
 later he will be healthier and you are not going to 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.200
 to be able to fight against that I say again 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.500
 that what creates resistance why that 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.829
 the blessed word strength will not 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.910
 works works when your mind was 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:18.610
 the program just there will work 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.550
 80 no longer in 10 but as long as they are not 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.060
 those new to power because the part of 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:28.510
 the subconscious mind remembers 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.850
 focuses not on what you want but on 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.150
 what you believe what is admitted here 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.430
 in the deepest it focuses on that and if 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.680
 you in exercise the part of the mind 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.170
 subconscious you will achieve the best 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.400
 objectives that you propose and you are going to lower 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.470
 of weight so before saying that I 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.450
 Willpower I would recommend 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.890
 What would you say 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.440
 I want to reprogram my mind 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.270
 subconscious so that my mind 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.790
 subconscious tell my body I want 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.940
 be delegated I want to lose weight 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.760
 I want to be fully integrated 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.100
 I want to stop eating this junk this 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.470
 food full of fat sold by 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.480
 calories when you tell your mind 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.640
 subconscious in now and someone 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.490
 visualization exercises that yes 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.980
 continue so that you have greater strength of 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.570
 will to have more energy 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.060
 older resists 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.340
 yes there is but it will not be useful 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.850
 until it was reported in the mind 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.850
 subconscious 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.230
 that's why I tell you again if you say here 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.240
 two willpower to do 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.190
