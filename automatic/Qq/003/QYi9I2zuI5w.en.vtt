00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.230
 that also organizes all the information 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.700
 of each athlete that we train in a 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.710
 online platform that allows us not 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.140
 only save information but 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.040
 also train emotional senses

 acumen headquarters has two areas of 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.510
 training one that is physical 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.040
 cognitive where you train in 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.229
 physical abilities physical abilities 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.240
 but always combined with stimuli 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.130
 cognitive and emotional senses are 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.920
 works in a very personalized way 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.780
 or with a maximum of eight people and with 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.979
 schedules is not always something that one 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.470
 You can not even when you want to work 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.240
 very focused mind and apart as they 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.040
 I counted every athlete has his 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.770
 information in a personal microsite 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.840
 that allows you to train apart outside of 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.580

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.350
 visual cognitive abilities handling 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.000
 of stress and more oriented all to what 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.920
 is tracking the objectives the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.480
 coaching and to be focused on that 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.330
 objective that are posed to medium and 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.340
 long term to eat is born in 2006 by 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.810
 ideas that arise from my brother's 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.640
 Sebastian talking to each other 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.020
 we realize that there is a sector 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.720
 there he is not so busy with the 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.489
 encouragement and mental training then it 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.020
 incorporates the doctor rossi who is a doctor 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.940
 sportsman and specialist in 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.739
 neurosciences applied to sports and is 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.680
 when we give it shape after 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.680
 seven years of work to this method that 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.239
 today it is expanding in different 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.880
 parts of the world with a very possibility 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.140
 firm to be able to be executed in 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.760
 Anywhere where there are people 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.739
 passion for the sport and the 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.900
 development and good performance of 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.400
 people is now a unique method not 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.510
 we only contribute to the body from the 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.040
 what is the prevention of injuries and 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.209
 correction of postures mainly 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.739
 we stimulate from the point of view 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.540
 sensory training of the 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.860
 visual skills such as the 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.260
 reaction time the speed 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.120
 response the peripheral visual field the 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.099
 movements here said that is the change of 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.019
 focus of the eyes from the point of view 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.269
 cognitive we work memory the 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.920
 concentration the party's attention 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.720
 emotionally we work a lot with the 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.459
 mindfulness methodology where 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.530
 we point out that the athlete is 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.660
 practice and train the connection with the 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.610
 present this is the methodology that 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.920
 train and that today in situations with the 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.200
 that we live in the majority of place 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.520
 the world there is a permanent stimulus in 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.730
 English to the brain and the more 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.569
 We deliver care concentration 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.940
 the focus the memory surely better 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.080
 we will respond in competition and in 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.970
 different stations that represents the 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.430
 life was not originally born as a 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.410
 training method oriented to 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.540
 high performance elite 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.069
 we have many stories and credentials 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.450
 to show respect to training 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.100
 with athletes that today triumphs in 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.810
 outside how can it be 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.880
 Radamel Falcao at the time we train 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.140
 to the lionesses to the cougars what are you going to 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.010
 have a way we realized that in 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.560
 reality is a totally method 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.930
 applicable to anyone who has 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.720
 brain then we also got to 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.400
 talk to him and communicate to the common 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.799
 people al kun of people and today 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.109
 we are just an expansion 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.389
 oriented not only to train the high 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.000
 liszt's performance but also to the 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.950
 more people would say common by calling it 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.530
 in some way that are probably going to 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.639
 have not so personalized attention 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.380
 but that also has marked them a 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.729
 difference in their performance and in their 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.350
 quality of life especially in its 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.870
 wellness coaches who work 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.449
 in acumen are all professionals of the 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.490
 sport 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.279
 prepares benefits in the case of the area 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.749
 of mental and physical training 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:49.419
 sports psychologists can be a 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:51.669
 doctor also in the mental area and you 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.680
 and we had very good experiences with ex 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.319
 high performance athletes who 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.349
 by training them they could transfer them to 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:00.729
 other athletes who want to be 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.289
 recognized or do well with the 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.409
 high performance experiences 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.339
 just today we are starting to 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.960
 transit the entire period of 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:10.270
 training of other trainers 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.650
 because the platform that we have online 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.629
 It is a platform that allows loyalty 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.580
 much to every athlete that one trains 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:18.159
 and allows just any 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.529
 propitious that the trainer staff also 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:21.939
 gather the information of each athlete 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:23.469
 that trains in three so have in your 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:24.909
 phone that can have your tablet or that 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:27.819
 can from any computer that 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:30.400
 part of the online world acumen has its 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:32.770
 headquarters in Núñez Buenos Aires today 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.629
 is in a very short time also opening 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.580
 its new headquarters in Mendoza and also in 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:39.460
 Montevideo Uruguay and then have a 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.539
 series of relations more than alliance like 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.479
 for example with students the silver 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:44.919
 club that developed a space water and 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.169
 also an online platform for 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.270
 organization and sense of belonging 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.639
 we just signed an agreement with the 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.099
 global franchise master consultant who 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.830
 is a very well-known consultancy 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:58.629
 worldwide in what franchises them 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.310
 they are based in singapore three years ago 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:02.319
 Weeks traveled the company show 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.819
 harris bable and with him we are 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.969
 developing an entire platform with the 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:09.270
 goal of gathering around 500 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:11.169
 franchises in five years looking 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.449
 masterfranquiciados in different countries 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.669
 to develop the method in their countries 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:19.719
 they say cities and even in neighborhoods because 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:21.999
 today when pointing to a client not so high 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:23.909
 performance although if in fact this 

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:26.919
 is for high performance also allows 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:29.259
 expand the client's target a bit and 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:32.199
 that new venues can be run in 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:34.599
 neighborhoods or in geographical areas where the 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:37.389
 client is close to any 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:40.210
 way not the value of the service varies in 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:42.520
 based on the number of people who are in 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.930
 every hour of training the athlete 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.159
 of list by the mind I have a plan more 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.169
 expensive because they actually have 

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:49.240
 custom trainers one by one 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:51.639
 with him someone is not so elite and not 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.770
 can prepare such a high plan what 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:55.240
 we do is share that encouragement 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.970
 now training with others 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.710
 athletes that also allows you 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.569
 train senses and emotions brain and 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.280
 body not only unconventional 

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:06.190
 also where is our 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.830
 goal is for more and more people to take 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.419
 awareness that you can train 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.550
 senses emotions brain and body a 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:14.020
 from setting specific objectives and 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.840
 that these objectives can be achieved 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.979
 leave a constancy an attitude 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.210
 customs and habits that lead to 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:22.300
 some finally to have a good 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.530
 quality of life , well - being that 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.729
 allow just to reach 

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.729
 fulfillment of these objectives
