00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.650 
hard use knife you know that's meant to
take<00:02:07.500> anything<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.979> throw<00:02:08.250> at<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.599> look<00:02:09.599> at

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
take anything you throw at it look at

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.030 
take anything you throw at it look at
the<00:02:09.750> size<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.259> stop<00:02:11.220> in

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
the size of the stop in

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.970 
the size of the stop in
right<00:02:12.219> there<00:02:12.489> stop<00:02:13.120> column<00:02:13.870> more<00:02:14.319> like<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.799> mean

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
right there stop column more like I mean

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.369 
right there stop column more like I mean
that<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.340> just<00:02:15.579> gigantic<00:02:16.000> this<00:02:16.780> smaller<00:02:17.109> one

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
that is just gigantic this smaller one

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.899 
that is just gigantic this smaller one
right<00:02:17.409> there<00:02:17.739> that's<00:02:17.890> actually<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.549> closed

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
right there that's actually the closed

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.020 
right there that's actually the closed
position<00:02:19.180> stop<00:02:19.750> him<00:02:20.129> so<00:02:21.129> it<00:02:21.250> doesn't<00:02:21.579> use<00:02:21.760> the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
position stop him so it doesn't use the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.729 
position stop him so it doesn't use the
same<00:02:22.060> in<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.569> open<00:02:22.840> or<00:02:22.930> closed<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:23.620> the

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
same in the open or closed so the

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.000 
same in the open or closed so the
opening<00:02:24.099> stop<00:02:24.370> in<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:25.170> gigantic<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.650> closest

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
opening stop in is gigantic the closest

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.880 
opening stop in is gigantic the closest
one<00:02:27.129> is<00:02:27.159> much<00:02:27.459> smaller<00:02:28.349> huge<00:02:29.349> plunge<00:02:29.620> lock

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
one is much smaller huge plunge lock

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.839 
one is much smaller huge plunge lock

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:41.469 
like this you can also do a saber grip

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:45.059 
like this you can also do a saber grip
like<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.420> very<00:02:43.420> comfortable<00:02:44.049> you<00:02:44.739> put<00:02:44.920> your
