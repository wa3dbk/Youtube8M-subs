00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.060
 runs on asphalt is overrated and 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.490
 look if it's overrated that I in 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.440
 change here space-time that of 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.110
 I was suddenly transported 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.179
 through the forest and through the forest this is 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.340
 lozoyuela and now I tell you what the 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:18.130
 thing because running on asphalt is 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.789
 overrated and this has to run in 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.529
 road to the tip of the brush was 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.349
 it was that here you have to cross and not 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.419
 nobody else good and now you know the 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.999
 fucking Sanjuán this you have here 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.910
 ahead every day he runs that 6 8 10 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:36.520
 12 kilometers every day every day every day 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.650
 and every day what we lacked and the only 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.090
 reiterates what happens in Barcelona and that 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.820
 you will tell me humans go to the road of 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.640
 the waters is dear and I live down there at 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.850
 side of the forum and with which both the 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.830
 short runs of 10 as long as 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.329
 25 that you already see in him he was and 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.570
 damn I leave you here below me 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.610
 I was then just doing them in 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.160
 asphalt and there two things happen one 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.430
 you punish a lot of joints 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.540
 fuck you're there running in the smoke 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.409
 between such / I do not know what here 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.180
 paquita 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.430
 or the vaquita how are you 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.530
 do not flinch then there instead of 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.220
 greet cows saludos drivers who 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.200
 He told us that it's worse and a lot of smoke 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.780
 circuits are shorter and in the end to 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.530
 stick a long bite because no 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.250
 the little unevenness works very well 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.340
 when I have to go by road 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.740
 federal and above all impact on 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.810
 joints and this and I think more 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.180
 all things because they punish a lot 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.340
 more when you go by asphalt than from 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.740
 suddenly when you go here 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.350
 here it's cool too because at the level 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.140
 physiological pussy every track is different 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.869
 you have to watch each one like pizzas 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.759
 how do you do how do you jump here then 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.190
 well all this is very good because 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.160
 it also makes you more agile level 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.050
 articulate good said which because you 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.390
 I tell all this 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.640
 and some day my son all this you see 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.850
 it will be yours and we could do it of the king 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.850
 Lion' 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:16.310
 well I tell you all this because I 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.260
 I'm detoxifying from the road 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.210
 this means that as far as 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.620
 possible good and before I only ran by 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.760
 road and this year you will have seen that 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.250
 there's one I've done here over 100 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.830
 I have made marathons of sabers 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.360
 250 kilometers I have cost chalets 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.360
 with a fucking difference that there is a little more 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.310
 and I'm dying 250 kilometers too 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.630
 made the path of san juan that is 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.430
 true that sometimes you deviated towards the 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.740
 road but above all you did 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.380
 I walk if such and apart the experience 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.170
 it was beautiful then doing all this 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.600
 I realize that my friend jaume jaume 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.790
 how do I want to charge you then my friend 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.650
 Jaume Gomà when he goes to the mountain has 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.510
 reason and that I'm a little crazy already 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.060
 running too much on asphalt in the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:05.459
 I can not escape but 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.620
 make the camera, you are escaped 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.180
 then on weekends yes that 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.800
 I can do things like this and play 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.239
 get away I tell you all this because 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.500
 we can share some careers 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.989
 you know that I run with where is the 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.849
 limit and that where is the limit organizes 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.400
 some races and in this case trailers 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.769
 where is the limit trail dotcom the 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.330
 holding here down what is this going 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.489
 that on June 15 we come here 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.519
 for Madrid and we can run together here 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.920
 in Lozoyuela which is 40 km from Madrid 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.430
 and we come here we run and 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.440
 we can run or 12 km or 22 km that of 12 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.200
 it's shorter and obviously but 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.840
 let's also say that the difference in level is less 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.510
 and the ground as this call is 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.310
 less technical that of 22 is a little bit 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.040
 more but well there you can do well 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.930
 the difference is not very big 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.849
 and the rhythm, because each one is going to take 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.190
 the sodium this is going to be a festival going to 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.790
