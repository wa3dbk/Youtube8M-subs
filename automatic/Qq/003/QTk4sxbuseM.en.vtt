00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
points but the whole point of contra is

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.800 
points but the whole point of contra is
the<00:01:43.399> replayable<00:01:44.000> because<00:01:44.329> of<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.600> type<00:01:44.780> of

of<00:01:52.850> oh<00:01:53.060> my<00:01:53.270> god<00:01:53.479> Black<00:01:53.689> team<00:01:53.810> is<00:01:54.020> so<00:01:54.170> hard<00:01:54.350> it

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
of oh my god Black team is so hard it

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:55.809 
of oh my god Black team is so hard it
took<00:01:54.500> me<00:01:54.770> months<00:01:54.920> of<00:01:55.100> constant<00:01:55.340> play<00:01:55.610> to<00:01:55.670> be

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
took me months of constant play to be

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.910 
took me months of constant play to be
able<00:01:55.939> to<00:01:56.030> bake<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:56.869> it's<00:01:56.899> one<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.500> those<00:01:57.560> things

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
able to bake so it's one of those things

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.710 
able to bake so it's one of those things
that<00:01:58.039> you<00:01:58.580> should<00:01:58.819> at<00:01:59.030> least<00:01:59.060> get<00:01:59.360> some<00:01:59.390> player

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
that you should at least get some player

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.960 
that you should at least get some player
value<00:01:59.990> out<00:02:00.140> but<00:02:00.429> graphically<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:01.759> game<00:02:01.789> looks

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
value out but graphically the game looks

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.389 
value out but graphically the game looks
fantastic<00:02:02.810> I<00:02:02.899> think<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.500> well<00:02:04.130> it<00:02:04.250> looks

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
fantastic I think and well it looks

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:05.649 
fantastic I think and well it looks
right<00:02:04.610> or<00:02:04.789> anywhere<00:02:05.119> and<00:02:05.209> that's<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.479> type<00:02:05.630> of

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
right or anywhere and that's the type of

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.419 
right or anywhere and that's the type of
thing<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:05.959> I<00:02:05.990> like<00:02:06.259> some<00:02:06.860> people<00:02:07.189> might<00:02:07.340> have

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
thing that I like some people might have

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.550 
thing that I like some people might have
wanted<00:02:07.610> more<00:02:07.849> realistic<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.569> like<00:02:08.899> more

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
wanted more realistic and like more

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.710 
wanted more realistic and like more
polished<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.160> stuff<00:02:10.369> but<00:02:10.549> I<00:02:10.610> like<00:02:11.329> the<00:02:11.540> feel

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
polished and stuff but I like the feel

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.809

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
of the floor to it and musically it

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.490 
of the floor to it and musically it
sounds<00:02:14.209> just<00:02:14.450> as<00:02:14.569> good<00:02:14.690> as<00:02:14.840> they<00:02:14.930> used<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.170> so
