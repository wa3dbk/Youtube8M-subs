00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.519
 because today's murder review is about 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:12.389
 armor axes shovels peek access and 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.660
 swords and generally scrap metal what 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.650
 becomes garbage and this in turn becomes 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.380
 back to metal 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.449
 this time it's about scrap metal murder 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.720
 and what he can we see after that 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.720
 intro 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.820
 this place is one 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.670
 mods of you iron things broken 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.530
 allowed to melt in turn broken 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.579
 For example, if you have a broken one 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.230
 sword I'll leave it even a sword 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.860
 heal if it is broken now you put it 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.900
 in here and you get scrap metal yes 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.309
 The same is true for example even if 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.260
 her a mw so clean here is in 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.120
 Made iron gets her scrap 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.769
 metal what looks so as well with 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.289
 You can make iron here 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:01.930
 put a pixar and armor without armor 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.000
 for you see, you have everything like that if you are 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.550
 that then trot, we say it 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.369
 times like that and the new oven goes and then 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.560
 here again a coal reinlegt and 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.360
 your scrap metal then burns her 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.810
 simply it is melted down and 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.020
 tilted recycle bares metal out so 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.880
 new iron for old iron actually 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.920
 really horny open iron one I 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.770
 already a bit too much online or 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.240
 there is online is especially present is 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.490
 that's a cool mod you can do with it 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.860
 really really cool things easy 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.320
 get back again is so one 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.720
 recycling is recycling 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.250
 actually quite nice i can not 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.100
 complain but to rate this time 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.509
 write me about in the comments what 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.280
 my motto but keep my things 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.649
 My team flipped or not 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.570
 oh what the hell take us again 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.340
 a little bit out there have to act 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.070
 we will come back and see that is 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.689
 This script metal does that have 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.500
 so is a mixture of pipes should that 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.649
 be some mix of pipes and such 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.369
 continue 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:06.340
 and yes that hold easily on board 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.659
 I think it's cool because of what 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.670
 New is the one you should see 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.709
 is with anyway a junk press mod 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.269
 cared for with vision or something 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.709
 a driving force and so this whole 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.900
 there is perhaps that with it 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.209
 but so we have individual motto of 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.940
 Traps reflect because I have something 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.370
 have broken in the crafting 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.359
 box melt and re-energize the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.359
 are first review
