00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Oleg due to the second week already one of 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.170
 important topics discussed by the city remains 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.360
 confrontation between the two carriers Sasse 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.309
 fighting more precisely for seven of the first route 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.110
 old and new old have great 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.480
 popular support and rally and 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.609
 rallies gather a lot on the side of the new 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.220
 the law of the judgment is like urban 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.779
 authorities will resolve this situation until 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.609
 the situation is really heating up and on 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.570
 My view is already so quietly moving 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:35.790
 in hysteria though the situation 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:38.730
 clear enough and understandable this first 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.899
 the dispute between two economic entities is 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.860
 the first second is the corresponding 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.670
 arbitration court decision which 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.920
 such cases dot the spirit when 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.489
 business entities are arguing 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.260
 so here's the city administration as if 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.960
 urged us to change today 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.659
 administration decision not able not 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.189
 such rights 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:12.360
 administrative body does not comply 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.670
 judicial bow and so therefore here are the appeals 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.970
 why don't you hear you don't 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.670
 understand and so on they are not legitimate 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.259
 we all see it beautifully everything is beautiful 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.869
 hear and see and see meetings 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.600
 the number of people who turn in 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.090
 support is a good reason for 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.689
 in order to seek a compromise to decide 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.189
 this question but only there is a court decision we 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.990
 and will not be the third time this 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.479
 I repeat that today you can do well 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.830
 first of course you need this one 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.070
 political 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:53.560
 the atmosphere around this issue of course 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.420
 same translate in the discussion and 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.760
 discussion should be 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.470
 today's constructive possibilities 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.580
 what are the possibilities of the transportation department 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.590
 together with the translator should Kargin them 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.910
 separately with translator mosquito shackles 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.980
 separately this work is already underway 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.850
 develop measures for which will 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.130
 court decision it will work 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.440
 no other way is possible and of course 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.080
 so if carrier such as kargin 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.730
 good we have and he has his 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.260
 transport and if it has labor 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.690
 the team needs to give him the opportunity 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.440
 work is not an easy task only in one 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.630
 If there will be emotions 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:41.600
 demand from give everything as possible 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:45.770
 give if the court decision so I will say so 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.090
 what's about the competition many 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.190
 They say that we need a new competition 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.049
 lead this is possible only in case 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.840
 if today's 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.280
 According to the carrier who passed it 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.840
 court right 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.590
 he voluntarily refuses this 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.280
 intends to make the carrier in execution 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.489
 of those conditions when he signed 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.459
 agreement 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:11.660
 bought new buses he took on himself 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.489
 credit commitments are big and he 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.769
 says that I am not guilty of anything 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.420
 I went through three and a half years of court 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.730
 proceedings proved its case and 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.680
 so I demand that I am ok 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.560
 worked did not create power created him 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.570
 conditions I also met with 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.709
 other carriers that also 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.330
 note that existing orders 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.680
 so maybe if they are bad let's 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.209
 revise these orders 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:42.290
 but no less a system has an urban 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.790
 Duma approved selection criteria and we all 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.269
 these selection criteria have passed 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:51.110
 if someone did not like the court decision 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:55.700
 it happens in this case we must 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:59.090
 we will change everything to obey now 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.970
 based on the results of this situation, we will change 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.209
 mandatory criterion and what is missing 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.220
 Well, in the first place is not enough of such an important 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:11.390
 criterion as consumer opinion about what 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.700
 Today our passenger speaks Nizhny Novgorod 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.890
 they say why not take into account our 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.260
 opinion and really why then 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.479
 need to lead this criterion which 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.169
 called consumer attitudes and either 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.630
 these are complaints 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.919
 either it is thanks in the end 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.169
 good old book of complaints and suggestions 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.750
 here it does not hurt anyone to 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.160
 take into account when summing up the competition 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.560
 how do we crash 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.810
 considering so consider the change 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.160
 consumers is an important element of course 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.620
 lacks the most normal normal 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.150
 union carriers that could in 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.310
 such a question again managing 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.229
 subjects , including in their own 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.820
 business professional environment 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:54.890
 here it is not 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.050
 judicial and here we are in these very 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:00.950
 narrow framework trying to find it 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.770
 compromise desire to eat i'm sure that 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:07.550
 we will find a way out of this created 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.340
 situation in the interests of our residents 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.320
 interests of passengers of these route 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.789
 taxi has accumulated a lot of problems here 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.550
 they see that way and 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.680
 pops up by the way as for here 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.540
 use experience 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.240
 Kargin carrier I can you today 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.250
 say about what we are interested in 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.860
 his professional qualities and ready 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.100
 offer him for example to work in 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.940
 the city administration for example the same 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.280
 Nizhny Novgorod passenger car 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.520
 huge enterprise which today 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.080
 organize work 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.420
 most social routes by 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.450
 the city has clicked does not invite the official 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:48.510
 my proposal will direct to 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:53.880

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:55.950

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:09.410
 this is the most important direction and we will be happy 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:13.760
 if he and his experience lead us 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.760
