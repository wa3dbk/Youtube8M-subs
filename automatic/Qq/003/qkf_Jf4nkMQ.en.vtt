some insulation what kind of insulation
as<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.610> that's<00:00:44.820> fiberglass

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
as this like that's fiberglass

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.570 
as this like that's fiberglass
insulation<00:00:45.810> and<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:46.860> generally<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.430> use

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
insulation and we generally can use

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.190 
insulation and we generally can use
fiberglass<00:00:47.970> insulation<00:00:48.420> or<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:48.990> can<00:00:49.170> use

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
fiberglass insulation or we can use

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.990 
fiberglass insulation or we can use
cellulose<00:00:49.890> insulation<00:00:50.100> either<00:00:50.730> one

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
cellulose insulation either one

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.970 
cellulose insulation either one
generally<00:00:51.870> we<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.320> use<00:00:52.440> cellulose

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
generally we like to use cellulose

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.620 
generally we like to use cellulose
insulation<00:00:53.190> because<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.000> has<00:00:54.120> higher<00:00:54.270> r-value

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
insulation because it has higher r-value

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.590 
insulation because it has higher r-value
you<00:00:55.380> know<00:00:55.500> before<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.010> put<00:00:56.190> insulation<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:57.090> an

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
you know before we put insulation in an

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.780 
you know before we put insulation in an
attic<00:00:57.990> of<00:00:58.710> course<00:00:58.920> everybody<00:00:59.400> kind<00:00:59.700> of

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
attic of course everybody kind of

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.370 
attic of course everybody kind of
understands<00:01:00.240> and<00:01:00.480> make<00:01:00.600> their<00:01:00.750> house<00:01:01.080> more

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
understands and make their house more

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.450 
understands and make their house more
comfortable<00:01:01.800> they're<00:01:01.950> going<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.130> need<00:01:02.220> more

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
comfortable they're going to need more

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.030 
comfortable they're going to need more
insulation<00:01:03.090> than<00:01:03.240> what<00:01:03.360> they<00:01:03.480> have<00:01:03.690> but

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
insulation than what they have but

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.230 
insulation than what they have but
there's<00:01:05.040> some<00:01:05.550> pretty<00:01:05.700> important<00:01:06.060> things

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
there's some pretty important things

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.210 
there's some pretty important things
that<00:01:06.480> someone<00:01:07.110> would<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.440> to<00:01:07.590> do<00:01:07.740> before

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
that someone would have to do before

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.710 
that someone would have to do before
they<00:01:08.370> go<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.060> start<00:01:09.270> blowing<00:01:09.510> in

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
they go in and start blowing in

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.540 
they go in and start blowing in
insulation<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.410> an<00:01:10.530> attic<00:01:10.800> that's<00:01:11.010> correct

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
insulation in an attic that's correct

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.190 
insulation in an attic that's correct
there's<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.940> lot<00:01:12.120> of<00:01:12.240> spaces<00:01:12.510> underneath<00:01:13.050> that

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
there's a lot of spaces underneath that

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.930 
there's a lot of spaces underneath that
insulation<00:01:13.650> before<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.280> insulation<00:01:14.670> was

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
insulation before that insulation was

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.570 
insulation before that insulation was
blown<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.360> there<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.990> leaked<00:01:16.290> air<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.310> all

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
blown in there that leaked air so all

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.120 
blown in there that leaked air so all
that<00:01:17.850> warm<00:01:18.120> air<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:19.050> was<00:01:19.320> heated<00:01:19.740> up<00:01:19.860> by<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
that warm air that was heated up by the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.760 
that warm air that was heated up by the
furnace<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.300> the<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.230> the<00:01:22.290> winter<00:01:22.620> or

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
furnace in the in the in the winter or

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.000 
furnace in the in the in the winter or
the<00:01:23.160> cool<00:01:23.400> air<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:24.240> was<00:01:24.930> brought<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.410> by<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
the cool air that was brought in by the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.590 
the cool air that was brought in by the
air<00:01:26.190> conditioner<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> summer<00:01:27.120> all<00:01:27.390> that

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
air conditioner in the summer all that

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.750 
air conditioner in the summer all that
air<00:01:27.750> sits<00:01:28.020> underneath<00:01:28.230> the<00:01:28.470> attic<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.340> because

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
air sits underneath the attic so because

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.420 
air sits underneath the attic so because
there<00:01:29.909> are<00:01:30.060> leaks<00:01:30.300> or<00:01:30.600> places<00:01:31.590> where<00:01:31.830> air<00:01:32.190> can

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
there are leaks or places where air can

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.310 
there are leaks or places where air can
leak<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:33.060> air<00:01:33.300> can<00:01:33.510> leak<00:01:33.570> right<00:01:33.900> up<00:01:34.080> through

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
leak that air can leak right up through

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.050 
leak that air can leak right up through
and<00:01:34.650> unfortunately<00:01:35.370> it'll<00:01:35.610> leak<00:01:35.820> right

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
and unfortunately it'll leak right

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.880 
and unfortunately it'll leak right
through<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.420> insulation<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.470> all<00:01:37.710> has

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
through the insulation so that all has

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.440 
through the insulation so that all has
to<00:01:38.010> be<00:01:38.130> sealed<00:01:38.460> before<00:01:38.760> you<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.180> put<00:01:39.330> this

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
to be sealed before you can put this

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.600 
to be sealed before you can put this
insulation<00:01:40.020> down<00:01:40.200> well<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:40.980> think<00:01:41.190> it's<00:01:41.460> pretty

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
insulation down well I think it's pretty

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.040 
insulation down well I think it's pretty
easy<00:01:41.730> for<00:01:42.120> anybody<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.450> understand<00:01:42.900> that

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
easy for anybody to understand that

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.080 
easy for anybody to understand that
whether<00:01:43.260> we<00:01:43.440> have<00:01:43.620> blown<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.520> fiberglass

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
whether we have blown in fiberglass

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.140 
whether we have blown in fiberglass
insulation<00:01:45.450> or<00:01:45.930> fiberglass<00:01:46.590> batts<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.520> down

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
insulation or fiberglass batts like down

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.060 
insulation or fiberglass batts like down
there<00:01:48.450> which<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:49.020> know<00:01:49.140> would<00:01:49.260> be<00:01:49.320> existing

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
there which you know would be existing

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.920 
there which you know would be existing
in<00:01:50.159> someone's<00:01:50.550> attic<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.120> this<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.720> pretty

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
in someone's attic that this is pretty

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.690 
in someone's attic that this is pretty
porous<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.500> fact<00:01:52.680> your<00:01:52.800> furnace<00:01:53.159> filter<00:01:53.520> is

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
porous in fact your furnace filter is

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.850 
porous in fact your furnace filter is
made<00:01:53.940> out<00:01:54.120> of<00:01:54.270> fiberglass<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.229> scare<00:01:55.620> goes

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
made out of fiberglass so scare goes

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.660 
made out of fiberglass so scare goes
right<00:01:56.100> through<00:01:56.340> it

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
right through it

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.039 
right through it
that's<00:01:56.970> right<00:01:57.180> air<00:01:57.510> will<00:01:57.659> come<00:01:57.840> right<00:01:58.020> through

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
that's right air will come right through

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.680 
that's right air will come right through
it<00:01:58.380> unless<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:58.830> sealed<00:01:59.520> first<00:01:59.940> that<00:02:00.510> will

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
it unless it's sealed first that will

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.140 
it unless it's sealed first that will
make<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.229> our<00:02:02.010> value<00:02:02.430> or<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.700> value<00:02:03.000> of

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
make the our value or the value of

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.539 
make the our value or the value of
having<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:03.479> insulation<00:02:04.080> put<00:02:04.260> in<00:02:04.440> way<00:02:05.340> more

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
having the insulation put in way more

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.399 
having the insulation put in way more
effective<00:02:05.940> than<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.150> would<00:02:06.270> be<00:02:06.299> otherwise<00:02:06.420> you

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
effective than it would be otherwise you

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.520 
effective than it would be otherwise you
know<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:08.399> someone<00:02:09.090> was<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.509> put<00:02:09.869> insulation<00:02:10.170> in

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
know if someone was to put insulation in

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.080 
know if someone was to put insulation in
their<00:02:10.679> attic<00:02:10.920> without<00:02:11.039> air<00:02:11.430> sealing<00:02:11.940> then

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
their attic without air sealing then

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.200 
their attic without air sealing then
that<00:02:12.330> would<00:02:12.510> be

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
that would be

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.560 
that would be
that<00:02:13.780> would<00:02:13.900> be<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.320> problem<00:02:14.860> because<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:16.360> air

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
that would be a problem because the air

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.610 
that would be a problem because the air
would<00:02:16.810> leak<00:02:17.020> right<00:02:17.200> up<00:02:17.350> through<00:02:17.530> the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
would leak right up through the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.500 
would leak right up through the
insulation<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.430> it's<00:02:18.610> correct<00:02:18.880> in<00:02:19.150> order<00:02:19.420> to

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
insulation and it's correct in order to

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.840 
insulation and it's correct in order to
fix<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.560> leaks<00:02:20.830> are<00:02:21.010> even<00:02:21.190> harder<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.700> get

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
fix it the leaks are even harder to get

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.420 
fix it the leaks are even harder to get
to<00:02:22.000> you've<00:02:22.150> got<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.390> get<00:02:23.140> through<00:02:23.440> all<00:02:23.950> this

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
to you've got to get through all this

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.610 
to you've got to get through all this
blown-in<00:02:25.120> insulation<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:26.050> through<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.350> bats

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
blown-in insulation and through the bats

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.520 
blown-in insulation and through the bats
that<00:02:26.800> were<00:02:26.950> underneath<00:02:27.910> there<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:29.230> get<00:02:29.380> to

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
that were underneath there and to get to

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.840 
that were underneath there and to get to
the<00:02:29.620> air<00:02:29.800> leaks<00:02:30.070> it<00:02:30.400> would<00:02:30.520> almost<00:02:30.640> be

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
the air leaks it would almost be

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.120 
the air leaks it would almost be
impossible<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:31.450> do<00:02:31.630> if<00:02:32.410> you<00:02:32.620> tried<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:32.920> do<00:02:33.040> it

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
impossible to do if you tried to do it

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.700 
impossible to do if you tried to do it
afterwards<00:02:33.520> yeah<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:34.540> as<00:02:34.840> professionals<00:02:35.620> we

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
afterwards yeah so as professionals we

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.710 
afterwards yeah so as professionals we
would<00:02:36.010> never<00:02:36.370> insulate<00:02:37.300> an<00:02:37.420> attic<00:02:37.660> without

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
would never insulate an attic without

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.780 
would never insulate an attic without
air<00:02:38.050> sealing<00:02:38.380> first<00:02:38.590> that's<00:02:38.860> correct<00:02:39.160> yeah

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
air sealing first that's correct yeah

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.540 
air sealing first that's correct yeah
you<00:02:40.270> know<00:02:40.920> insulating<00:02:41.920> believe<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.340> or<00:02:42.460> not

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
you know insulating believe it or not

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.870 
you know insulating believe it or not
you<00:02:43.480> know<00:02:43.860> visually<00:02:44.860> when<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.490> look<00:02:45.640> in<00:02:45.760> an

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
you know visually when you look in an

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.300 
you know visually when you look in an
attic<00:02:46.180> from<00:02:46.390> before<00:02:46.990> an<00:02:47.350> attic<00:02:47.710> has<00:02:47.890> blown<00:02:48.130> an

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
attic from before an attic has blown an

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.370 
attic from before an attic has blown an
insulation<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.970> after<00:02:49.450> visually<00:02:50.020> looks<00:02:50.230> like

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
insulation to after visually looks like

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.740 
insulation to after visually looks like
wow<00:02:50.680> they<00:02:51.190> did<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.400> lot<00:02:51.580> of<00:02:51.670> work<00:02:51.820> right<00:02:52.090> that's

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
wow they did a lot of work right that's

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.100 
wow they did a lot of work right that's
correct

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
correct

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.130 
correct
really<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.400> insulation<00:02:55.090> is<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.510> easy<00:02:55.840> part

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
really the insulation is the easy part

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.680 
really the insulation is the easy part
we<00:02:57.040> go<00:02:57.250> in<00:02:57.430> with<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.700> hose<00:02:57.970> as<00:02:58.240> a<00:02:58.270> blowing

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
we go in with a hose as a blowing

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.990 
we go in with a hose as a blowing
machine<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.380> you<00:02:59.890> kind<00:03:00.190> of<00:03:00.340> wave<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.790> hose

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
machine and you kind of wave the hose

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.680 
machine and you kind of wave the hose
around<00:03:01.450> like<00:03:01.720> this<00:03:01.990> for<00:03:02.290> about<00:03:03.150> 45<00:03:04.150> minutes<00:03:04.180> or

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
around like this for about 45 minutes or

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.690 
around like this for about 45 minutes or
so<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:05.170> bam<00:03:05.740> the<00:03:06.010> whole<00:03:06.190> attic<00:03:06.520> is<00:03:06.670> insulated

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
so and bam the whole attic is insulated

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.850 
so and bam the whole attic is insulated
and<00:03:07.390> that's<00:03:07.510> really<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:08.020> easy<00:03:08.200> part<00:03:08.530> isn't<00:03:08.710> it

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
and that's really the easy part isn't it

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.840 
and that's really the easy part isn't it
that's<00:03:09.040> correct<00:03:09.340> yes

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
that's correct yes

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.460 
that's correct yes
yes<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.390> air<00:03:10.510> sealing<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.050> really<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.350> more

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
yes the air sealing is really the more

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.170 
yes the air sealing is really the more
difficult<00:03:11.890> part<00:03:12.100> because<00:03:12.700> you<00:03:12.820> really<00:03:13.030> got<00:03:13.150> to

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
difficult part because you really got to

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.580 
difficult part because you really got to
get<00:03:13.360> in<00:03:13.480> there<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:13.630> got<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:13.930> move<00:03:14.050> all<00:03:14.260> of<00:03:14.470> this

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
get in there you got to move all of this

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.250 
get in there you got to move all of this
existing<00:03:15.250> batt<00:03:15.550> insulation<00:03:15.580> out<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.110> way

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
existing batt insulation out of the way

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.050 
existing batt insulation out of the way
so<00:03:17.800> you<00:03:17.860> literally<00:03:18.190> have<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.550> take<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:18.940> and

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
so you literally have to take it and

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.610 
so you literally have to take it and
move<00:03:19.210> it<00:03:19.300> all<00:03:19.450> out<00:03:19.600> of<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.780> way<00:03:19.930> then<00:03:20.350> you<00:03:20.470> got

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
move it all out of the way then you got

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.290 
move it all out of the way then you got
to<00:03:20.740> get<00:03:20.860> in<00:03:20.980> there<00:03:21.160> with<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.400> different<00:03:22.210> a

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
to get in there with a different a

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.290 
to get in there with a different a
variety<00:03:22.660> of<00:03:22.690> different<00:03:22.900> spray<00:03:23.350> foam<00:03:23.620> guns<00:03:23.980> and

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
variety of different spray foam guns and

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.200 
variety of different spray foam guns and
and<00:03:25.300> seal<00:03:25.690> all<00:03:25.960> those<00:03:26.320> areas<00:03:26.830> up<00:03:27.210> there's

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
and seal all those areas up there's

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.300 
and seal all those areas up there's
there's<00:03:28.630> sometimes<00:03:29.350> can<00:03:29.680> lights<00:03:29.950> in<00:03:30.130> there

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
there's sometimes can lights in there

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.810 
there's sometimes can lights in there
yeah<00:03:30.670> so<00:03:31.000> we<00:03:31.210> we<00:03:31.630> have<00:03:31.870> these<00:03:32.050> these<00:03:32.820> special

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
yeah so we we have these these special

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.480 
yeah so we we have these these special
boxes<00:03:34.360> that<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:35.830> are<00:03:35.920> constructed

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
boxes that that are constructed

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.130 
boxes that that are constructed
specifically<00:03:37.120> for<00:03:37.300> can<00:03:37.480> lights<00:03:37.750> that<00:03:37.960> fit

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
specifically for can lights that fit

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.990 
specifically for can lights that fit
over<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.410> top<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.770> that<00:03:38.800> and<00:03:39.100> of<00:03:39.550> course<00:03:39.790> those

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
over the top of that and of course those

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.110 
over the top of that and of course those
are<00:03:40.060> all<00:03:40.330> foamed<00:03:41.080> and<00:03:41.350> caulked<00:03:42.130> and<00:03:42.310> sealed<00:03:42.400> as

are all foamed and caulked and sealed as

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.210 
are all foamed and caulked and sealed as
well<00:03:43.330> so<00:03:44.110> we've<00:03:44.260> got<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.500> put<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.680> basically<00:03:45.100> an

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
well so we've got to put a basically an

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.550 
well so we've got to put a basically an
airtight<00:03:45.550> hat<00:03:45.820> over<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.660> top<00:03:46.870> of<00:03:47.050> a<00:03:47.140> can<00:03:47.380> light

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
coming through in a lot of different

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.730 
coming through in a lot of different
places<00:03:59.950> exhaust<00:04:00.910> fans<00:04:01.360> all<00:04:01.900> of<00:04:02.320> those<00:04:02.470> things

places exhaust fans all of those things

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.620 
places exhaust fans all of those things
will<00:04:02.950> leak<00:04:03.160> so<00:04:03.760> if<00:04:03.880> you<00:04:03.970> don't<00:04:04.150> get<00:04:04.300> in<00:04:04.450> there

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
will leak so if you don't get in there

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.050 
will leak so if you don't get in there
and<00:04:04.780> get<00:04:04.900> them<00:04:05.080> all<00:04:05.290> sealed<00:04:05.790> you're<00:04:06.790> still

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
and get them all sealed you're still

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.220 
and get them all sealed you're still

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
joint between the drywall and the top of

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:25.500 
joint between the drywall and the top of
a<00:04:24.910> wall

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
a wall

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.330 
a wall
err<00:04:25.780> that's<00:04:26.080> right<00:04:26.350> and<00:04:26.590> what<00:04:26.950> a<00:04:26.980> lot<00:04:27.220> of

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
err that's right and what a lot of

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.250 
err that's right and what a lot of
people<00:04:27.580> don't<00:04:27.670> realize<00:04:27.850> is<00:04:28.060> that<00:04:28.510> interior

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
people don't realize is that interior

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.830 
people don't realize is that interior
walls<00:04:29.770> like<00:04:30.040> separating<00:04:30.520> bedrooms<00:04:30.880> those<00:04:31.660> are

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
walls like separating bedrooms those are

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.900 
walls like separating bedrooms those are
hollow<00:04:32.020> so<00:04:32.860> you<00:04:32.920> have<00:04:33.160> your<00:04:33.430> electrical

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
hollow so you have your electrical

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.420 
hollow so you have your electrical
outlets<00:04:34.000> there<00:04:34.450> and<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:35.590> top<00:04:35.860> plates<00:04:36.190> on

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
outlets there and the top plates on

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.150 
outlets there and the top plates on
those<00:04:36.640> walls<00:04:37.000> will<00:04:37.390> leak<00:04:37.660> at<00:04:38.320> the<00:04:38.380> attic<00:04:38.830> level

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
those walls will leak at the attic level

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160 
those walls will leak at the attic level
so<00:04:39.610> you<00:04:39.670> get<00:04:39.880> a<00:04:39.910> lot<00:04:40.120> of<00:04:40.150> air<00:04:40.390> that<00:04:40.600> is<00:04:40.750> being

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
so you get a lot of air that is being

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.650 
so you get a lot of air that is being
drawn<00:04:41.530> through<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.130> outlets<00:04:42.730> through<00:04:43.480> the

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
drawn through the outlets through the

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.720 
drawn through the outlets through the
center<00:04:44.050> of<00:04:44.080> those<00:04:44.350> walls<00:04:44.800> and<00:04:45.010> then<00:04:45.340> into<00:04:45.610> the

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
center of those walls and then into the

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.880 
center of those walls and then into the
Attic<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.120> then<00:04:46.240> lost<00:04:46.780> to<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.230> to<00:04:47.800> the

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
Attic and then lost to the to the

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.530 
Attic and then lost to the to the
outside<00:04:48.220> then<00:04:48.760> we<00:04:48.880> have<00:04:49.000> some<00:04:49.150> really<00:04:49.450> big

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
outside then we have some really big

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.260 
outside then we have some really big
leaks<00:04:49.990> like<00:04:50.260> around<00:04:50.530> chimneys<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.910> building

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
leaks like around chimneys the building

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.020 
leaks like around chimneys the building
code<00:04:52.450> says<00:04:52.750> that<00:04:52.780> you<00:04:53.050> have<00:04:53.140> to<00:04:53.200> keep<00:04:53.350> all<00:04:53.680> the

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
leaves a big opening all the way around

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.780 
leaves a big opening all the way around
a<00:05:02.560> chimney<00:05:02.950> all<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.160> way<00:05:03.280> to<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:03.490> basement

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
a chimney all the way to the basement

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.360 
a chimney all the way to the basement
where<00:05:04.330> lots<00:05:04.930> of<00:05:05.080> air<00:05:05.260> leaks<00:05:05.500> out<00:05:05.710> yeah<00:05:06.190> there

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
where lots of air leaks out yeah there

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.250 
where lots of air leaks out yeah there
are<00:05:06.460> other<00:05:06.610> forms<00:05:07.000> of<00:05:07.090> chases<00:05:07.720> like<00:05:07.900> that<00:05:08.080> as

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
are other forms of chases like that as

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.170 
are other forms of chases like that as
well<00:05:08.470> where<00:05:09.010> a<00:05:09.040> builder<00:05:09.460> may<00:05:09.610> decide<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:09.970> run

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
well where a builder may decide to run

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.350 
well where a builder may decide to run
everything<00:05:10.690> up<00:05:11.110> one<00:05:11.560> main<00:05:12.310> square<00:05:12.850> area

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
everything up one main square area

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.940 
everything up one main square area
that's<00:05:13.660> through<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:13.930> entire<00:05:14.320> house<00:05:14.560> from<00:05:14.830> the

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
that's through the entire house from the

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.560 
that's through the entire house from the
basement<00:05:15.370> all<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:15.610> way<00:05:15.730> up<00:05:15.850> so<00:05:16.300> they'll<00:05:16.480> bring

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
basement all the way up so they'll bring

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.390 
basement all the way up so they'll bring
all<00:05:16.840> the<00:05:17.050> electric<00:05:17.500> and<00:05:17.680> all<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:18.040> plumbing

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
all the electric and all the plumbing

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.610 
all the electric and all the plumbing
and<00:05:18.460> everything<00:05:18.850> through<00:05:19.030> that<00:05:19.060> one<00:05:19.390> area<00:05:19.750> and

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
and everything through that one area and

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.200 
and everything through that one area and
just<00:05:20.830> leave<00:05:20.950> it<00:05:21.070> all<00:05:21.160> exposed<00:05:21.520> you<00:05:21.790> know<00:05:21.850> so

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
just leave it all exposed you know so

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.230 
just leave it all exposed you know so
all<00:05:22.420> that<00:05:22.660> air<00:05:22.840> just<00:05:23.080> leaks<00:05:23.320> its<00:05:23.530> way<00:05:23.680> out<00:05:24.240> so

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
all that air just leaks its way out so

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.390 
all that air just leaks its way out so
what<00:05:25.720> about<00:05:25.810> ducks<00:05:26.350> in<00:05:26.620> turn<00:05:26.740> attic<00:05:27.040> really

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
what about ducks in turn attic really

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.640 
what about ducks in turn attic really
two<00:05:27.550> things<00:05:27.580> Ducks<00:05:28.300> that<00:05:28.600> are<00:05:29.050> you<00:05:29.560> know

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
two things Ducks that are you know

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.710 
two things Ducks that are you know
they're<00:05:30.070> bringing<00:05:30.310> heat<00:05:30.490> you<00:05:31.150> know<00:05:31.270> into<00:05:31.570> that

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
they're bringing heat you know into that

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.820 
they're bringing heat you know into that
attic<00:05:32.020> they<00:05:32.140> have<00:05:32.230> heat<00:05:32.410> running<00:05:32.620> through

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
attic they have heat running through

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.580 
attic they have heat running through
them<00:05:32.980> or<00:05:33.190> cool<00:05:33.460> air<00:05:33.730> and<00:05:34.170> so<00:05:35.170> let's<00:05:35.350> say<00:05:35.440> you're

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
them or cool air and so let's say you're

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.930 
them or cool air and so let's say you're
bringing<00:05:35.830> heat<00:05:36.040> in<00:05:36.220> and<00:05:36.430> it's<00:05:36.550> the<00:05:36.670> middle<00:05:36.790> of

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
bringing heat in and it's the middle of

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.850 
bringing heat in and it's the middle of
winter<00:05:37.000> and<00:05:37.390> that<00:05:37.450> attic<00:05:38.140> could<00:05:38.290> be<00:05:38.440> you<00:05:38.740> know

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
winter and that attic could be you know

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.130 
winter and that attic could be you know
zero<00:05:39.220> degrees<00:05:39.580> so<00:05:40.180> you<00:05:40.270> got<00:05:40.420> this<00:05:40.540> warm<00:05:40.870> air

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
zero degrees so you got this warm air

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.540 
zero degrees so you got this warm air
running<00:05:41.470> through<00:05:41.740> these<00:05:41.890> ducts<00:05:42.220> and<00:05:42.430> you're

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
running through these ducts and you're

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.880 
running through these ducts and you're
losing<00:05:43.000> all<00:05:43.180> of<00:05:43.240> that<00:05:43.540> warm<00:05:43.960> air<00:05:44.230> to<00:05:44.470> that<00:05:44.500> cold

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
losing all of that warm air to that cold

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.190 
losing all of that warm air to that cold
environment<00:05:45.430> or<00:05:45.580> the<00:05:46.270> reverse<00:05:46.600> in<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:46.960> summer

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
environment or the reverse in the summer

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.780 
environment or the reverse in the summer
where<00:05:47.440> you're<00:05:47.560> losing<00:05:47.860> all<00:05:47.950> that<00:05:48.130> cool<00:05:48.400> air<00:05:48.610> to

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
where you're losing all that cool air to

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.700 
where you're losing all that cool air to
the<00:05:48.910> warm<00:05:49.120> environment<00:05:49.690> so<00:05:50.140> the<00:05:50.320> first<00:05:50.530> thing

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
the warm environment so the first thing

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.020 
the warm environment so the first thing
we<00:05:50.800> have<00:05:50.950> to<00:05:50.980> do<00:05:51.160> with<00:05:51.280> the<00:05:51.400> Ducks<00:05:51.610> is<00:05:51.790> we<00:05:51.910> have

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
we have to do with the Ducks is we have

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.030 
we have to do with the Ducks is we have
to<00:05:52.180> seal<00:05:52.450> them<00:05:52.690> just<00:05:53.350> like<00:05:53.440> we<00:05:53.500> had<00:05:53.710> to<00:05:53.800> seal

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
to seal them just like we had to seal

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.370 
to seal them just like we had to seal
this<00:05:54.250> here<00:05:54.610> we<00:05:55.030> have<00:05:55.180> to<00:05:55.300> seal<00:05:55.600> all<00:05:55.900> the<00:05:55.930> areas

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
this here we have to seal all the areas

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.100 
this here we have to seal all the areas
on<00:05:57.040> the<00:05:57.280> ducks<00:05:57.550> that<00:05:57.790> could<00:05:57.970> leak<00:05:58.270> air<00:05:58.510> into

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
on the ducks that could leak air into

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.710 
on the ducks that could leak air into
that<00:05:59.230> environment<00:05:59.800> and<00:06:00.100> then<00:06:00.160> once<00:06:00.880> the<00:06:01.120> once

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
that environment and then once the once

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.630 
that environment and then once the once
those<00:06:01.900> leaks<00:06:02.200> are<00:06:02.410> sealed<00:06:02.710> then<00:06:03.220> we<00:06:03.370> need<00:06:03.520> to

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
those leaks are sealed then we need to

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.130 
those leaks are sealed then we need to
insulate<00:06:04.030> those<00:06:04.240> ducts<00:06:04.570> so<00:06:04.750> that<00:06:04.930> we<00:06:05.020> don't

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
insulate those ducts so that we don't

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.290 
insulate those ducts so that we don't
lose<00:06:05.380> that<00:06:05.440> air<00:06:05.860> so<00:06:06.160> you<00:06:06.610> can<00:06:06.730> actually<00:06:06.910> lose

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
lose that air so you can actually lose

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.720 
lose that air so you can actually lose
heat<00:06:07.660> in<00:06:08.620> a<00:06:08.950> couple<00:06:09.250> of<00:06:09.310> ways<00:06:09.460> either

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
heat in a couple of ways either

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.890 
heat in a couple of ways either
conductive<00:06:10.450> Lee<00:06:10.600> through<00:06:10.900> the<00:06:11.050> metal<00:06:11.320> or

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
conductive Lee through the metal or

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.210 
conductive Lee through the metal or
convectively<00:06:13.900> which<00:06:14.230> means<00:06:14.500> that<00:06:14.740> air<00:06:15.040> is

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
convectively which means that air is

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.490 
convectively which means that air is
just<00:06:15.340> leaking<00:06:15.760> out<00:06:15.910> the<00:06:15.940> joint<00:06:16.500> very

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
just leaking out the joint very

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.620 
just leaking out the joint very
important<00:06:18.010> to<00:06:18.190> take<00:06:18.760> care<00:06:18.790> of<00:06:18.970> ducks<00:06:19.330> in<00:06:19.510> an

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
important to take care of ducks in an

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.540 
important to take care of ducks in an
attic<00:06:19.960> and<00:06:20.140> and<00:06:20.320> so<00:06:20.800> there's<00:06:21.010> lots<00:06:21.250> of<00:06:21.400> things

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
attic and and so there's lots of things

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.610 
attic and and so there's lots of things
that<00:06:21.790> we<00:06:21.880> have<00:06:22.060> to<00:06:22.210> do<00:06:22.330> before<00:06:22.570> we<00:06:23.140> just<00:06:23.380> blow

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
that we have to do before we just blow

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.530 
that we have to do before we just blow
in<00:06:23.830> whether<00:06:24.340> it<00:06:24.430> be<00:06:24.520> fiberglass<00:06:25.090> or<00:06:25.300> our

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540 
in whether it be fiberglass or our

preferences cellulose insulation in
order<00:06:29.440> to<00:06:29.620> get<00:06:30.190> the<00:06:30.310> job<00:06:30.340> done<00:06:30.670> right<00:06:30.730> that's

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
order to get the job done right that's

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.940 
order to get the job done right that's
right<00:06:31.420> we<00:06:31.690> also<00:06:31.870> have<00:06:32.170> to<00:06:32.320> do<00:06:32.440> something<00:06:32.770> else

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950 
right we also have to do something else

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.770 
right we also have to do something else

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.290 
here which is what these baffles are for
those<00:06:35.650> baffles<00:06:35.950> are<00:06:36.310> put<00:06:36.550> on<00:06:36.670> these<00:06:36.850> here<00:06:37.120> so

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
those baffles are put on these here so

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.910 
those baffles are put on these here so
that<00:06:37.510> the<00:06:37.750> the

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:38.920 
that the the

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.340 
that the the
insulation<00:06:39.760> that<00:06:40.030> you<00:06:40.090> blow<00:06:40.420> in<00:06:40.660> does<00:06:41.140> not

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.350 
insulation that you blow in does not

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.590 
insulation that you blow in does not
clog<00:06:41.740> up<00:06:42.010> the<00:06:42.190> soffit<00:06:42.640> vents<00:06:42.970> see<00:06:43.450> there's

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
clog up the soffit vents see there's

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.020 
clog up the soffit vents see there's
vents<00:06:43.990> back<00:06:44.200> there<00:06:44.560> and<00:06:45.130> those<00:06:45.280> vents<00:06:45.670> let<00:06:45.880> in

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030 
vents back there and those vents let in

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.240 
vents back there and those vents let in
cool<00:06:46.570> air<00:06:46.900> to<00:06:47.110> keep<00:06:47.290> the<00:06:47.440> underside<00:06:47.980> of<00:06:48.010> the

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
cool air to keep the underside of the

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.820 
cool air to keep the underside of the
roof<00:06:48.400> cool<00:06:48.820> in<00:06:49.060> the<00:06:49.180> winter<00:06:49.480> and<00:06:50.470> then<00:06:50.620> that

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
roof cool in the winter and then that

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.590 
roof cool in the winter and then that
air<00:06:51.100> is<00:06:51.250> vented<00:06:51.460> out<00:06:51.790> through<00:06:52.090> the<00:06:52.210> top<00:06:52.390> of<00:06:52.420> the

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.600 
air is vented out through the top of the

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.390 
air is vented out through the top of the
roof<00:06:52.840> but<00:06:53.470> the<00:06:53.590> reason<00:06:53.920> that<00:06:53.950> we<00:06:54.040> need<00:06:54.280> the

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 
roof but the reason that we need the

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.490 
roof but the reason that we need the
underside<00:06:54.880> of<00:06:54.910> this<00:06:55.180> cool<00:06:55.540> is<00:06:56.020> so<00:06:56.260> that<00:06:56.410> we

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
underside of this cool is so that we

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.370 
underside of this cool is so that we
don't<00:06:56.680> warm<00:06:57.160> the<00:06:57.400> roof<00:06:57.610> up<00:06:57.880> and<00:06:58.300> create<00:06:59.110> ice

00:06:59.370 --> 00:06:59.380 
don't warm the roof up and create ice

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.440 
don't warm the roof up and create ice
dams<00:06:59.710> because<00:07:00.190> what<00:07:00.370> will<00:07:00.490> happen<00:07:00.820> is<00:07:00.940> when

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.450 
dams because what will happen is when

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.390 
dams because what will happen is when
the<00:07:01.600> snow<00:07:01.900> comes<00:07:02.140> on<00:07:02.320> the<00:07:02.470> roof<00:07:02.680> a<00:07:02.890> layer<00:07:03.130> of

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 
the snow comes on the roof a layer of

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.400 
the snow comes on the roof a layer of
that<00:07:03.580> snow<00:07:03.940> will<00:07:04.150> melt<00:07:04.390> and<00:07:04.720> start<00:07:04.930> to<00:07:05.050> run<00:07:05.230> off

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 
that snow will melt and start to run off

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.780 
that snow will melt and start to run off
the<00:07:05.590> roof<00:07:05.830> and<00:07:06.040> that's<00:07:06.340> where<00:07:06.490> you<00:07:06.580> see<00:07:06.700> all

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:06.790 
the roof and that's where you see all

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.420 
the roof and that's where you see all
those<00:07:06.880> big<00:07:07.120> icicles<00:07:07.690> so<00:07:08.470> we<00:07:08.710> put<00:07:08.920> these<00:07:09.070> of

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:09.430 
those big icicles so we put these of

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.910 
those big icicles so we put these of
baffles<00:07:10.330> in<00:07:10.480> in<00:07:10.690> order<00:07:10.870> to<00:07:11.020> keep<00:07:11.200> that<00:07:11.410> airflow

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:11.920 
baffles in in order to keep that airflow

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.880 
baffles in in order to keep that airflow
going<00:07:12.240> and<00:07:13.240> so<00:07:13.540> that<00:07:13.750> they're<00:07:13.900> not<00:07:14.050> clogged<00:07:14.560> by

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:14.890 
going and so that they're not clogged by

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.980 
going and so that they're not clogged by
all<00:07:15.130> this<00:07:15.310> insulation<00:07:15.790> right<00:07:16.180> so<00:07:16.450> it's<00:07:16.660> not<00:07:16.780> as

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
all this insulation right so it's not as

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.290 
all this insulation right so it's not as
easy<00:07:17.140> as<00:07:17.380> just<00:07:17.440> going<00:07:17.770> up<00:07:17.980> there<00:07:18.220> and<00:07:18.430> blowing

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:19.300 
easy as just going up there and blowing

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.030 
easy as just going up there and blowing
in<00:07:19.450> insulation<00:07:19.900> there's<00:07:20.350> things<00:07:20.650> that<00:07:20.770> have

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:21.040 
in insulation there's things that have

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.220 
in insulation there's things that have
