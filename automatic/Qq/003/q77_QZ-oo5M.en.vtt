work<00:01:54.310> like<00:01:54.760> the<00:01:54.970> main<00:01:55.270> characters<00:01:55.990> good<00:01:56.560> god

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
work like the main characters good god

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.130 
work like the main characters good god
are<00:01:57.640> they<00:01:57.820> boring<00:01:58.300> when<00:01:58.720> I<00:01:58.750> think<00:01:58.990> of<00:01:59.080> a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
are they boring when I think of a

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.350 
are they boring when I think of a
stereotypical<00:01:59.680> boring<00:02:00.310> princess<00:02:00.850> this<00:02:01.180> is

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
stereotypical boring princess this is

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.690 
stereotypical boring princess this is
who<00:02:01.510> I<00:02:01.540> think<00:02:01.690> of<00:02:02.170> she<00:02:02.560> does<00:02:02.770> nothing<00:02:03.340> she<00:02:03.520> has

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
who I think of she does nothing she has

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.700 
who I think of she does nothing she has
little<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.180> no<00:02:04.210> character<00:02:04.960> she<00:02:05.200> just<00:02:05.440> sort<00:02:05.620> of

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
little to no character she just sort of

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.830 
little to no character she just sort of
sings<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:06.520> looks<00:02:06.730> pretty<00:02:06.820> I<00:02:07.450> don't<00:02:07.690> even

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
sings and looks pretty I don't even

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.750 
sings and looks pretty I don't even
think<00:02:07.960> she's<00:02:08.229> that<00:02:08.410> pretty<00:02:08.649> but<00:02:09.520> how<00:02:09.640> about

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
think she's that pretty but how about

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.610 
think she's that pretty but how about
the<00:02:10.000> prince<00:02:10.240> he's<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.720> dashing<00:02:11.140> hero<00:02:11.380> in<00:02:11.530> the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
the prince he's the dashing hero in the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.470 
the prince he's the dashing hero in the
end<00:02:11.770> surely<00:02:12.130> he<00:02:12.250> must<00:02:12.430> be<00:02:12.550> interesting<00:02:13.060> right

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
end surely he must be interesting right

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.630 
end surely he must be interesting right
actually<00:02:14.020> he's<00:02:14.170> even<00:02:14.440> more<00:02:14.710> boring<00:02:15.070> do<00:02:15.550> you

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
actually he's even more boring do you

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.580 
actually he's even more boring do you
realize<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.300> last<00:02:16.330> line<00:02:16.870> he<00:02:17.140> says<00:02:17.410> in

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
realize that the last line he says in

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.380 
realize that the last line he says in
this<00:02:17.680> movie<00:02:18.010> is<00:02:18.130> goodbye<00:02:18.490> father<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:19.210> that's

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
this movie is goodbye father and that's

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.840 
this movie is goodbye father and that's
about<00:02:19.570> half<00:02:19.900> way<00:02:20.200> through<00:02:20.680> after<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.490> he

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
about half way through after that he

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.730 
about half way through after that he
doesn't<00:02:22.210> get<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.330> line<00:02:22.630> he<00:02:23.140> just<00:02:23.350> runs<00:02:23.620> around

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
doesn't get a line he just runs around

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.920 
doesn't get a line he just runs around
swinging<00:02:24.280> his<00:02:24.430> sword<00:02:24.460> that's<00:02:25.210> it

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
swinging his sword that's it

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.840 
swinging his sword that's it
at<00:02:26.200> least<00:02:26.410> she<00:02:26.590> has<00:02:26.770> an<00:02:26.920> excuse<00:02:27.310> she's<00:02:27.520> put<00:02:27.730> to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
at least she has an excuse she's put to

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.670 
at least she has an excuse she's put to
sleep<00:02:28.000> for<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.450> second<00:02:28.750> half<00:02:28.900> him

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
sleep for the second half him

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.590 
sleep for the second half him
could<00:02:30.310> we<00:02:30.430> get<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.610> grunt<00:02:31.030> or<00:02:31.240> an<00:02:31.330> O<00:02:31.570> for

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
could we get a grunt or an O for

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.320 
could we get a grunt or an O for
absolving<00:02:32.590> there's<00:02:33.220> also<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.520> lot<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.910> filler

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
absolving there's also a lot of filler

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.150 
absolving there's also a lot of filler
in<00:02:34.600> this<00:02:34.810> movie<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.500> maybe<00:02:35.680> that's<00:02:35.920> one<00:02:36.100> of

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
in this movie and maybe that's one of

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.560 
in this movie and maybe that's one of
the<00:02:36.220> reasons<00:02:36.580> why<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.760> main<00:02:36.970> characters<00:02:37.420> are

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
the reasons why the main characters are

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.780 
the reasons why the main characters are
so<00:02:37.720> bland<00:02:38.050> I<00:02:38.350> think<00:02:38.710> this<00:02:38.890> movie<00:02:39.040> really<00:02:39.430> liked

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
so bland I think this movie really liked

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.000 
so bland I think this movie really liked
its<00:02:39.970> side<00:02:40.209> characters<00:02:40.690> much<00:02:40.959> more<00:02:41.290> most<00:02:41.920> of

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
its side characters much more most of

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.740 
its side characters much more most of
the<00:02:42.070> time<00:02:42.280> is<00:02:42.459> spent<00:02:42.550> with<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.970> fairies<00:02:43.510> the

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
the time is spent with the fairies the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.020 
the time is spent with the fairies the
villains<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.380> two<00:02:44.740> kings<00:02:45.220> that<00:02:45.459> really

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
villains the two kings that really

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.000 
villains the two kings that really
doesn't<00:02:46.300> lead<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.690> anything<00:02:46.870> so<00:02:47.470> really<00:02:47.800> it's

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
doesn't lead to anything so really it's

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.510 
doesn't lead to anything so really it's
a<00:02:48.130> very<00:02:48.540> unbalanced<00:02:49.540> film<00:02:49.870> but<00:02:50.530> again<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:51.130> guess

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
a very unbalanced film but again I guess

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.250 
a very unbalanced film but again I guess
like<00:02:51.700> most<00:02:51.880> Disney<00:02:52.180> films<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.840> stuff<00:02:53.080> that

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
like most Disney films the stuff that

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.500 
like most Disney films the stuff that
works<00:02:53.410> well<00:02:53.709> works<00:02:54.010> really<00:02:54.370> really<00:02:54.520> well<00:02:54.790> the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
works well works really really well the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.140 
works well works really really well the
villain<00:02:55.959> is<00:02:56.140> great<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.920> fairies<00:02:57.400> are<00:02:57.580> great

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
villain is great the fairies are great

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.870 
villain is great the fairies are great
the<00:02:58.390> animation<00:02:58.989> is<00:02:59.200> great<00:02:59.650> that<00:03:00.190> ending<00:03:00.640> fight

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
the animation is great that ending fight

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.540 
the animation is great that ending fight
scene<00:03:01.180> is<00:03:01.390> just<00:03:01.450> friggin<00:03:02.260> fantastic<00:03:03.010> so<00:03:03.430> it's

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
scene is just friggin fantastic so it's

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.220 
scene is just friggin fantastic so it's
kind<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.820> hard<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.030> judge<00:03:04.360> this<00:03:04.630> movie<00:03:04.989> seeing

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
kind of hard to judge this movie seeing

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.420 
kind of hard to judge this movie seeing
how<00:03:05.350> not<00:03:05.560> only<00:03:05.590> does<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:05.890> have<00:03:06.070> some<00:03:06.250> good

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
how not only does it have some good

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.190 
how not only does it have some good
things<00:03:06.459> but<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:07.060> has<00:03:07.180> some<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.630> best<00:03:07.989> of

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
things but it has some of the best of

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.440 
things but it has some of the best of
any<00:03:08.500> of<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.800> Disney<00:03:08.980> films<00:03:09.550> bonding<00:03:10.239> goes

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
any of the Disney films bonding goes

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.840 
any of the Disney films bonding goes
beyond<00:03:10.900> just<00:03:11.080> typical<00:03:11.709> visuals<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.459> actually

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
beyond just typical visuals it actually

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.640 
beyond just typical visuals it actually
does<00:03:13.030> have<00:03:13.209> some<00:03:13.420> very<00:03:13.630> good<00:03:13.720> characters<00:03:14.350> even

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
does have some very good characters even

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.620 
does have some very good characters even
if<00:03:14.709> they<00:03:14.830> are<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.130> side<00:03:15.370> characters<00:03:15.940> for<00:03:16.450> that

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
if they are the side characters for that

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.630 
if they are the side characters for that
I<00:03:16.870> think<00:03:17.320> it<00:03:17.410> holds<00:03:17.650> up<00:03:17.769> for<00:03:17.800> several<00:03:18.160> viewings

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
I think it holds up for several viewings

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.310 
I think it holds up for several viewings
I<00:03:18.910> did<00:03:19.180> see<00:03:19.360> this<00:03:19.480> film<00:03:19.690> quite<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.930> few<00:03:20.140> times

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
I did see this film quite a few times

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.080 
I did see this film quite a few times
growing<00:03:20.590> up<00:03:20.860> and<00:03:21.070> I<00:03:21.160> did<00:03:21.310> like<00:03:21.459> it<00:03:21.670> every<00:03:21.910> time

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
growing up and I did like it every time

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.759 
growing up and I did like it every time
there's<00:03:22.540> just<00:03:22.600> several<00:03:23.050> scenes<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.470> liked<00:03:23.680> a

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
there's just several scenes I liked a

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.620 
there's just several scenes I liked a
lot<00:03:23.920> more<00:03:24.130> than<00:03:24.310> others<00:03:24.459> but<00:03:25.090> they<00:03:25.239> are<00:03:25.390> good

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
lot more than others but they are good

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.720 
lot more than others but they are good
scenes<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.230> they<00:03:26.290> are<00:03:26.440> good<00:03:26.680> characters<00:03:27.250> so

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
scenes and they are good characters so
