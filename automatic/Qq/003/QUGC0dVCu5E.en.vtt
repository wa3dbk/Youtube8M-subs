00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.540
 a friend of selling cell les 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:09.980
 introduced the new 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:13.580
 then the 4.7-inch 100 with 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:17.690
 screen hd technology dsp 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.700
 that is, a dual core of 1.2 travelers 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.240
 this is the latest metric processor 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.270
 85 77 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.410
 very fast that is also complemented with 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.410
 an internal climate 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.300
 this graphic 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.820
 very similar to the galaxy to bring 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.809
 and will mount some applications 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.650
 how fast is the phone 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.350
 a great fluidity that has a fast 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.350
 response to touch 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.690
 Y 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.690
 let's see what you tell us 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.350
 we are compared with other mobile other 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:16.820
 let's see how it goes 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.820
 then election 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.180
 there is loading on youtube 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.180
 let's go to the bar 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.330
 in the third of several positions in 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.570
 our mobile 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:39.370
 puts them a little under the samsung 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:44.060
 galaxy note and about the optimal gym all 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:47.649
 this is done by buying ram 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.649
 graphic card to the cpu 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.159
 of other things 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.159
 that is to say a pretty mobile 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.420
 fast recommended a price more than 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.060
 accessible 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.960
 if we compare it with other phones that 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.330
 they are over low on this smartphone 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.210
 Any questions can be directed to 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.780
 through the website or through the 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.780
