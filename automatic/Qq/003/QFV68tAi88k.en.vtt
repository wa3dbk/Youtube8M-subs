00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
beautiful new design in here and I'm

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.950 
beautiful new design in here and I'm
just<00:00:16.170> gonna<00:00:16.260> send<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:17.420> arrange<00:00:18.420> send<00:00:18.840> to

just gonna send this arrange send to
back<00:00:19.490> and<00:00:20.490> as<00:00:20.820> long<00:00:21.510> as<00:00:21.779> your<00:00:21.990> design<00:00:22.769> doesn't

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
back and as long as your design doesn't

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.929 
back and as long as your design doesn't
go<00:00:23.369> over<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.850> edges<00:00:25.189> you<00:00:26.189> could<00:00:26.400> just<00:00:26.609> take

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
go over the edges you could just take

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.720 
go over the edges you could just take
these<00:00:27.119> components<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.080> drag<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.039> here<00:00:29.070> and

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
these components and drag it in here and

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.580 
these components and drag it in here and
then<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.420> can<00:00:30.599> test<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.470> I'm<00:00:31.560> just

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
then you can test this and I'm just

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.770 
then you can test this and I'm just
going<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.830> make<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> bigger<00:00:32.579> area<00:00:33.090> obviously

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
going to make a bigger area obviously

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.110 
going to make a bigger area obviously
and<00:00:34.020> then<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:35.040> what<00:00:35.219> my<00:00:35.370> repeat<00:00:35.730> looks<00:00:35.940> like

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
and then see what my repeat looks like

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.910 
and then see what my repeat looks like
so<00:00:36.270> that's<00:00:36.450> already<00:00:36.600> pretty<00:00:36.989> cool<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:37.770> we

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
so that's already pretty cool but we

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.650 
so that's already pretty cool but we
want<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.219> do<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> real<00:00:38.670> seamless<00:00:39.149> tile<00:00:39.420> so

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
want to do a real seamless tile so

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.069 
want to do a real seamless tile so
therefore<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.860> start<00:00:41.040> with<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.520> basic<00:00:42.420> color

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
therefore we start with a basic color

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.610 
therefore we start with a basic color
which<00:00:43.379> has<00:00:43.770> no<00:00:44.750> stroke<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:45.989> set<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.469> none

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
which has no stroke so set that to none

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.740 
which has no stroke so set that to none
I'm<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.370> gonna<00:00:47.660> drag<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.399> then<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:51.120> I'm

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
I'm just gonna drag and then on this I'm

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.080 
I'm just gonna drag and then on this I'm
just<00:00:51.840> gonna<00:00:51.989> put<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.850> beautiful<00:00:53.850> artwork

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
just gonna put this beautiful artwork

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.029 
just gonna put this beautiful artwork

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
Center front a little bit bigger okay

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.150 
Center front a little bit bigger okay
and<00:00:59.280> then<00:00:59.510> what<00:01:00.510> we're<00:01:00.690> gonna<00:01:00.809> do<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.230> cut<00:01:01.710> this

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
and then what we're gonna do is cut this

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.579 
and then what we're gonna do is cut this
design<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.329> need<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> box<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.170> has<00:01:04.320> no

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
design so we need a box that has no

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.649 
design so we need a box that has no
filler<00:01:04.890> no<00:01:05.010> stroke<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> way<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.479> do

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
filler no stroke in the way that we do

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.330 
filler no stroke in the way that we do
this<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.500> need<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> same

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
this is we need it to be in the same

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.300 
this is we need it to be in the same
position<00:01:08.760> as<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.380> box<00:01:10.380> here<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:10.950> I'm<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
position as the box here so I'm going to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.870 
position as the box here so I'm going to
copy<00:01:11.760> which<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.360> control-c<00:01:13.140> or<00:01:13.260> command-c

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880

and ride away so let me do this again
copy<00:01:26.490> paste<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.030> back<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.659> see<00:01:27.930> it

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
copy paste and back so you can see it

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.300 
copy paste and back so you can see it
looks<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.560> nothing<00:01:28.890> happened<00:01:29.040> but

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
looks like nothing happened but

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.010 
looks like nothing happened but
something<00:01:29.759> actually<00:01:29.880> happened<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.750> box

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
something actually happened so this box

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.380 
something actually happened so this box
in<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.259> back<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.619> now<00:01:31.770> selected<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.610> when<00:01:33.360> I

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
in the back is now selected and when I

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.080

take the color out it appears as if it's
still<00:01:36.270> there<00:01:36.390> but<00:01:36.570> that's<00:01:36.689> because<00:01:36.900> there's

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
still there but that's because there's

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.289 
still there but that's because there's
two<00:01:37.439> boxes<00:01:37.829> ones<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.759> top<00:01:38.970> right<00:01:39.270> now

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
that's going to Kat has the attributes

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.850

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
stroke because we need to now align this

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.459 
stroke because we need to now align this
artwork<00:01:55.850> on<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.060> bottom<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.259> show

chopped off and if it's no error here it

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.860 
chopped off and if it's no error here it

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
means you can't change that color so

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.950 
means you can't change that color so
we're<00:05:25.020> going<00:05:25.110> to<00:05:25.260> say<00:05:25.380> all<00:05:25.850> not<00:05:26.850> Auto<00:05:27.120> at<00:05:27.780> all

we're going to say all not Auto at all

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.710 
we're going to say all not Auto at all
and<00:05:28.380> then<00:05:29.160> if<00:05:29.280> we<00:05:29.430> can<00:05:29.790> double<00:05:30.330> click<00:05:30.480> on<00:05:30.630> each

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
and then if we can double click on each

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.920 
and then if we can double click on each
of<00:05:30.900> these<00:05:31.230> and<00:05:31.500> then<00:05:32.060> say<00:05:33.060> ok<00:05:33.360> you<00:05:33.420> can<00:05:33.660> see<00:05:33.810> how

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
of these and then say ok you can see how

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.440 
of these and then say ok you can see how
the<00:05:33.990> color<00:05:34.380> changes<00:05:34.700> so<00:05:35.700> that's<00:05:35.820> one<00:05:36.210> way<00:05:36.420> of

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
the color changes so that's one way of

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.630 
the color changes so that's one way of
changing<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:36.990> color<00:05:37.340> another<00:05:38.340> thing<00:05:38.520> that's

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
changing the color another thing that's

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.790 
changing the color another thing that's
cool<00:05:38.880> is<00:05:38.940> that<00:05:39.090> whatever<00:05:39.750> folder<00:05:40.350> of<00:05:40.500> color

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
cool is that whatever folder of color

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.310 
cool is that whatever folder of color
swatches<00:05:41.490> you<00:05:41.730> have<00:05:41.850> here<00:05:42.030> will<00:05:42.240> appear<00:05:43.140> here

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
swatches you have here will appear here

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.110 
swatches you have here will appear here
in<00:05:43.440> your<00:05:43.560> color<00:05:43.740> groups<00:05:44.040> so<00:05:44.610> you<00:05:44.640> could<00:05:44.910> just

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
in your color groups so you could just

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.390 
in your color groups so you could just
click<00:05:45.660> on<00:05:45.870> this<00:05:46.110> for<00:05:46.410> example<00:05:46.800> bright<00:05:47.010> and

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
click on this for example bright and

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.510 
click on this for example bright and
then<00:05:48.150> we<00:05:48.540> have<00:05:48.690> this<00:05:48.960> automatic<00:05:49.830> randomly

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
then we have this automatic randomly

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.270 
then we have this automatic randomly
change<00:05:50.790> color<00:05:51.060> order<00:05:51.450> so<00:05:52.230> it<00:05:52.380> will<00:05:52.530> only<00:05:52.770> work

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
change color order so it will only work

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.440 
change color order so it will only work
with<00:05:53.430> colors<00:05:53.730> from<00:05:53.880> in<00:05:54.000> here<00:05:54.120> and<00:05:54.210> so<00:05:54.270> that's

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
with colors from in here and so that's

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.170 
with colors from in here and so that's
what<00:05:54.600> I<00:05:54.630> did<00:05:54.750> so<00:05:55.110> just<00:05:55.650> click<00:05:56.160> in<00:05:56.430> see<00:05:56.940> if<00:05:57.030> you
