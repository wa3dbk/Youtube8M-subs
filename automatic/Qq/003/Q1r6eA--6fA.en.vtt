consoles<00:04:21.240> it's<00:04:22.240> just<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.840> think<00:04:23.140> it's<00:04:23.560> too

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
consoles it's just I think it's too

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.440 
consoles it's just I think it's too
little<00:04:23.860> too<00:04:24.010> late<00:04:24.310> I<00:04:24.520> mean<00:04:24.700> this<00:04:24.820> may<00:04:25.060> be

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
little too late I mean this may be

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.470 
little too late I mean this may be
or<00:04:25.540> appealing<00:04:26.020> if<00:04:26.170> it<00:04:26.290> has<00:04:26.440> Tegra<00:04:26.830> 4<00:04:26.860> in<00:04:27.160> it

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
or appealing if it has Tegra 4 in it

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.120 
or appealing if it has Tegra 4 in it
because<00:04:28.480> it's<00:04:28.630> a<00:04:28.720> much<00:04:28.900> more<00:04:29.110> capable<00:04:29.620> chipset

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
because it's a much more capable chipset

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.370 
because it's a much more capable chipset
and<00:04:30.310> much<00:04:31.030> more<00:04:31.270> badass<00:04:31.510> games<00:04:32.020> will<00:04:32.170> be<00:04:32.260> able

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
and much more badass games will be able

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.170 
and much more badass games will be able
to<00:04:32.500> run<00:04:32.650> on<00:04:32.830> it<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.070> controller<00:04:33.460> looks<00:04:33.760> great

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
to run on it the controller looks great

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.900 
to run on it the controller looks great
I<00:04:34.450> just<00:04:35.260> don't<00:04:35.710> see<00:04:35.920> a<00:04:35.950> future<00:04:36.220> with<00:04:36.700> these
