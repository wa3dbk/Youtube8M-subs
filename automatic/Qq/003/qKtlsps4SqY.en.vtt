modern style and then the vintage so
we'll<00:00:46.660> go<00:00:46.719> through<00:00:46.960> both<00:00:47.079> but<00:00:47.320> if<00:00:47.410> we<00:00:47.500> want<00:00:47.620> to

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
we'll go through both but if we want to

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.380 
we'll go through both but if we want to
get<00:00:47.769> started<00:00:47.980> okay<00:00:48.489> we'll<00:00:48.969> start<00:00:49.179> with<00:00:49.300> the

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
get started okay we'll start with the

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.209 
get started okay we'll start with the
modern<00:00:49.660> style<00:00:49.899> first<00:00:50.440> of<00:00:50.620> all<00:00:50.710> is<00:00:50.800> this<00:00:50.980> tool

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
modern style first of all is this tool

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.009 
modern style first of all is this tool
which<00:00:51.429> is<00:00:51.579> an<00:00:51.670> Allen<00:00:51.910> wrench<00:00:51.940> it<00:00:52.239> comes<00:00:52.449> in<00:00:52.719> the

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
which is an Allen wrench it comes in the

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.340 
which is an Allen wrench it comes in the
kit<00:00:53.410> with<00:00:53.829> your<00:00:53.980> guitar<00:00:54.129> which<00:00:54.969> is<00:00:55.420> used<00:00:56.140> for

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
kit with your guitar which is used for

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.560 
kit with your guitar which is used for
the<00:00:56.469> truss<00:00:56.739> rod<00:00:56.920> adjustment<00:00:57.120> now<00:00:58.120> you'll

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
the truss rod adjustment now you'll

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.569 
the truss rod adjustment now you'll
notice<00:00:58.809> here<00:00:59.140> at<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.289> top<00:00:59.409> of<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.100> headstock

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
notice here at the top of the headstock

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.630 
notice here at the top of the headstock
is<00:01:00.850> an<00:01:01.030> opening<00:01:01.420> and<00:01:02.320> behind<00:01:03.070> that<00:01:03.129> as<00:01:03.339> a<00:01:03.370> truss

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
is an opening and behind that as a truss

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.050 
is an opening and behind that as a truss
rod<00:01:04.020> this<00:01:05.020> is<00:01:05.260> designed<00:01:06.160> to<00:01:06.250> fit<00:01:06.430> right<00:01:06.460> in<00:01:06.790> and

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
rod this is designed to fit right in and

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.060 
rod this is designed to fit right in and
you<00:01:07.570> can<00:01:07.600> tighten<00:01:08.020> or<00:01:08.260> loosen<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.680> truss<00:01:08.920> rod

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
you can tighten or loosen the truss rod

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.040 
you can tighten or loosen the truss rod
now<00:01:09.550> the<00:01:09.880> reason<00:01:10.180> there's<00:01:10.330> a<00:01:10.390> truss<00:01:10.690> right<00:01:10.900> on

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
now the reason there's a truss right on

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.950 
now the reason there's a truss right on
a<00:01:11.080> guitar<00:01:11.350> is<00:01:11.740> because<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:13.030> tension<00:01:13.300> of<00:01:13.690> the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
a guitar is because the tension of the

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.370 
a guitar is because the tension of the
strings<00:01:15.000> tightened<00:01:16.000> up<00:01:16.030> onto<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.570> bridge

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
strings tightened up onto the bridge

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.010 
strings tightened up onto the bridge
there<00:01:17.740> with<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.460> tuners<00:01:18.850> will<00:01:19.210> create<00:01:19.690> a

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
there with the tuners will create a

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.740 
there with the tuners will create a
forward<00:01:20.590> pull<00:01:20.830> and<00:01:21.210> will<00:01:22.210> create<00:01:22.420> what<00:01:22.630> we

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
forward pull and will create what we

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.350 
forward pull and will create what we
call<00:01:22.780> relief<00:01:23.350> or<00:01:23.650> a<00:01:23.680> space<00:01:24.040> between<00:01:24.550> the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
call relief or a space between the

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.640 
call relief or a space between the
strings<00:01:25.750> and<00:01:26.050> the<00:01:26.710> fret<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.630> what<00:01:29.200> we<00:01:29.350> need<00:01:29.530> to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
strings and the fret so what we need to

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.730 
strings and the fret so what we need to
do<00:01:29.800> is<00:01:30.070> first<00:01:30.370> of<00:01:30.520> all<00:01:30.780> check<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.930> see<00:01:32.140> where

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
do is first of all check to see where

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.800 
do is first of all check to see where
the<00:01:32.890> adjustment<00:01:33.400> is<00:01:33.550> if<00:01:33.820> it's<00:01:34.000> if<00:01:34.330> it's

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
the adjustment is if it's if it's

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.890 
the adjustment is if it's if it's
buzzing<00:01:35.140> chances<00:01:36.100> are<00:01:36.310> that<00:01:36.580> the<00:01:37.240> test<00:01:37.510> rod<00:01:37.750> is

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
buzzing chances are that the test rod is

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.320 
buzzing chances are that the test rod is
too<00:01:38.080> tight<00:01:38.380> if<00:01:38.680> it's<00:01:39.040> very<00:01:39.280> stiff<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:39.970> the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
too tight if it's very stiff and the

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.090 
too tight if it's very stiff and the
strings<00:01:40.630> are<00:01:40.810> far<00:01:41.020> away<00:01:41.260> from<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.710> fret<00:01:42.070> board

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
strings are far away from the fret board

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.640 
strings are far away from the fret board
that<00:01:43.060> means<00:01:43.300> if<00:01:43.480> the<00:01:43.570> truss<00:01:43.810> rod<00:01:43.930> is<00:01:44.110> probably

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
that means if the truss rod is probably

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.700 
that means if the truss rod is probably
too<00:01:44.830> loose<00:01:45.100> so<00:01:46.080> it's<00:01:47.080> important<00:01:47.500> that<00:01:47.620> you

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
too loose so it's important that you

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.070 
too loose so it's important that you
understand<00:01:48.250> which<00:01:48.640> way<00:01:48.880> you<00:01:48.940> need<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.360> go<00:01:49.540> for

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
understand which way you need to go for

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.220 
understand which way you need to go for
the<00:01:50.200> truss<00:01:50.440> rod<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:51.550> adjust<00:01:51.910> it<00:01:52.030> correctly

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
the truss rod to adjust it correctly

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.090 
the truss rod to adjust it correctly
because<00:01:53.230> you<00:01:53.380> don't<00:01:53.650> want<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:53.890> over<00:01:54.070> tighten

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
because you don't want to over tighten

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.340 
because you don't want to over tighten
it<00:01:54.460> if<00:01:54.610> you<00:01:54.760> continue<00:01:55.540> to<00:01:55.660> tighten<00:01:55.900> it<00:01:56.170> it

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
it if you continue to tighten it it

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.460 
it if you continue to tighten it it
could<00:01:56.710> strip<00:01:57.040> out<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.520> screw<00:01:58.050> back<00:01:59.050> here<00:01:59.320> that

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
could strip out the screw back here that

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.060 
could strip out the screw back here that
we're<00:01:59.590> in<00:01:59.710> so<00:01:59.950> how<00:02:00.880> this<00:02:01.090> works<00:02:01.360> is<00:02:01.630> from<00:02:02.590> where

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
we're in so how this works is from where

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.360 
we're in so how this works is from where
I'm<00:02:03.190> standing<00:02:03.340> now<00:02:04.110> clockwise<00:02:05.190> moving<00:02:06.190> this

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
I'm standing now clockwise moving this

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.460 
I'm standing now clockwise moving this
direction<00:02:06.880> will<00:02:07.330> tighten<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.780> truss<00:02:07.960> rod<00:02:08.110> and

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
direction will tighten the truss rod and

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.230 
direction will tighten the truss rod and
then<00:02:09.369> moving<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.850> opposite<00:02:10.179> direction

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
then moving the opposite direction

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.840 
then moving the opposite direction
counterclockwise<00:02:10.990> will<00:02:11.740> loosen<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.460> you

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
counterclockwise will loosen it and you

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.160 
counterclockwise will loosen it and you
should<00:02:13.060> never<00:02:13.330> have<00:02:13.870> to

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
should never have to

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.620 
should never have to
earn<00:02:14.260> more<00:02:14.530> than<00:02:14.800> about<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.520> eighth<00:02:16.030> to<00:02:16.599> a

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
earn more than about a eighth to a

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.680 
earn more than about a eighth to a
quarter<00:02:17.080> of<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.290> turn<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:18.069> get<00:02:18.220> a<00:02:18.250> just

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
quarter of a turn to get a just

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.540 
quarter of a turn to get a just
adjustment<00:02:19.690> of<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:20.020> truss<00:02:20.260> rod<00:02:20.500> if<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:20.800> go<00:02:21.489> too

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
adjustment of a truss rod if you go too

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.900 
adjustment of a truss rod if you go too
far<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:23.200> could<00:02:23.380> definitely<00:02:23.530> strip<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.310> so

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
far you you could definitely strip it so

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.199 
far you you could definitely strip it so
if<00:02:25.209> we<00:02:25.330> have<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.739> bow<00:02:26.739> shape<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:27.640> we<00:02:27.790> want<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.060> we

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
if we have a bow shape so we want it we

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.150 
if we have a bow shape so we want it we
want<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.390> tighten<00:02:29.020> it<00:02:29.110> yeah<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:29.739> it's<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:30.010> bit

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
want to tighten it yeah so it's a bit

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.770 
want to tighten it yeah so it's a bit
loose<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.610> correct<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.090> if<00:02:31.150> it's<00:02:31.270> if<00:02:31.569> you<00:02:31.660> say

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
loose and correct and if it's if you say

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.750 
loose and correct and if it's if you say
like<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:31.959> back<00:02:32.260> bow<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:33.069> opposite<00:02:33.400> way<00:02:33.520> like<00:02:33.730> a

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
like a back bow the opposite way like a

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.490 
like a back bow the opposite way like a
hump<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.600> means<00:02:34.780> it's<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.050> tight<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.440> we

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
hump that means it's you tight and we

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.470 
hump that means it's you tight and we
need<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.770> need<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.040> loosen<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.489> yeah<00:02:36.790> now<00:02:37.390> in

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
need to need to loosen it yeah now in

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.290 
need to need to loosen it yeah now in
some<00:02:37.690> cases<00:02:38.130> when<00:02:39.130> you<00:02:39.280> get<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.730> truss<00:02:40.180> rod

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
some cases when you get the truss rod

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.540 
some cases when you get the truss rod
adjusted<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.140> right<00:02:41.319> area<00:02:41.680> and<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.400> need

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
adjusted to the right area and you need

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.070 
adjusted to the right area and you need
to<00:02:42.670> go<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.819> little<00:02:43.030> further<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.750> it's<00:02:43.870> too

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
to go a little further and it's too

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.979 
to go a little further and it's too
tight<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.680> will<00:02:45.250> take<00:02:45.489> a<00:02:45.519> nut<00:02:46.180> driver<00:02:46.330> like<00:02:46.720> this

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
tight I will take a nut driver like this

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.080 
tight I will take a nut driver like this
and<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.739> can<00:02:47.890> place<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.100> over<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.640> truss<00:02:48.970> rod

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
and you can place it over the truss rod

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.280 
and you can place it over the truss rod
and<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.480> will<00:02:49.690> help<00:02:49.930> give<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.200> some

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
and that will help give you some

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.470 
and that will help give you some
leverage<00:02:50.800> but<00:02:51.459> you<00:02:51.640> need<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:51.910> be<00:02:52.060> really

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
leverage but you need to be really

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.840 
leverage but you need to be really
careful<00:02:52.690> you<00:02:53.080> don't<00:02:53.280> having<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.370> leverage<00:02:54.700> like

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
careful you don't having a leverage like

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.270 
careful you don't having a leverage like
this<00:02:55.060> makes<00:02:55.330> it<00:02:55.480> very<00:02:55.630> easy<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:56.110> go<00:02:56.200> too<00:02:56.260> far<00:02:56.620> so

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
this makes it very easy to go too far so

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.800 
this makes it very easy to go too far so
you<00:02:57.310> really<00:02:57.790> want<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.090> take<00:02:58.269> your<00:02:58.420> time<00:02:58.630> with

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
you really want to take your time with

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.500 
you really want to take your time with
this<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.200> normally<00:02:59.890> in<00:03:00.010> a<00:03:00.069> setup<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.610> would<00:03:00.910> use

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
this and normally in a setup I would use

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.190 
this and normally in a setup I would use
a<00:03:01.540> feeler<00:03:01.989> gauge<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.880> see<00:03:04.120> where<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.930> string

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
a feeler gauge to see where the string

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.580 
a feeler gauge to see where the string
is<00:03:05.410> around<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:05.920> ninth<00:03:06.100> fret<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:08.080> distance

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
is around the ninth fret the distance

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.080 
is around the ninth fret the distance
between<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:09.100> string<00:03:09.370> of<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.580> ninth<00:03:09.760> fret<00:03:09.970> and

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
between the string of the ninth fret and

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.449 
between the string of the ninth fret and
the<00:03:10.480> and<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.989> fret<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.860> how<00:03:12.130> you<00:03:12.190> measure

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
the and the fret is how you measure

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.640 
the and the fret is how you measure
relief<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.420> what<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:13.750> want<00:03:13.930> is<00:03:14.080> slide<00:03:14.470> them

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
relief and what you want is slide them

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.860 
relief and what you want is slide them
out<00:03:14.739> about<00:03:14.890> I<00:03:15.040> think<00:03:15.370> it's<00:03:15.459> about<00:03:15.640> 0.01<00:03:16.180> Elbon

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
out about I think it's about 0.01 Elbon

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.850 
out about I think it's about 0.01 Elbon
okay

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
okay

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.910 
okay
but<00:03:18.690> these<00:03:19.690> days<00:03:19.959> because<00:03:20.440> I've<00:03:20.560> done<00:03:20.709> this<00:03:20.769> a

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
but these days because I've done this a

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.830 
but these days because I've done this a
lot<00:03:21.160> I<00:03:21.340> just<00:03:21.549> do<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.700> by<00:03:21.910> feel<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.150> can<00:03:22.510> tell<00:03:22.690> by

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
lot I just do it by feel I can tell by

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.380 
lot I just do it by feel I can tell by
feeling<00:03:22.870> if<00:03:23.470> if<00:03:24.280> there<00:03:24.820> needs<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.090> be<00:03:25.180> more

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
feeling if if there needs to be more

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.890 
feeling if if there needs to be more
relief<00:03:25.780> or<00:03:25.989> less<00:03:26.560> relief<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.510> certain<00:03:28.510> styles

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
relief or less relief and certain styles

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.660 
relief or less relief and certain styles
like<00:03:29.079> more<00:03:29.350> relief<00:03:29.650> blues<00:03:30.010> players<00:03:30.250> like<00:03:30.549> to

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
like more relief blues players like to

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.640 
like more relief blues players like to
have<00:03:30.820> more<00:03:30.970> resistance<00:03:31.299> so<00:03:32.079> they<00:03:32.290> will<00:03:32.470> make

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
have more resistance so they will make

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.979 
have more resistance so they will make
more<00:03:32.859> relief<00:03:33.160> whereas<00:03:33.850> you<00:03:34.239> know<00:03:34.269> metal

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
more relief whereas you know metal

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.900 
more relief whereas you know metal
players<00:03:35.260> or<00:03:35.620> jazz<00:03:35.890> players<00:03:36.220> in<00:03:36.459> some<00:03:36.640> cases

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
players or jazz players in some cases

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.390 
players or jazz players in some cases
that<00:03:37.359> play<00:03:37.540> very<00:03:37.750> fast<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.350> fluid<00:03:38.680> might<00:03:39.160> want

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
that play very fast and fluid might want

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.220 
that play very fast and fluid might want
a<00:03:39.459> really<00:03:39.850> really<00:03:39.880> low<00:03:40.299> action<00:03:40.750> so<00:03:40.900> they'll<00:03:41.079> do

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
a really really low action so they'll do

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.500 
a really really low action so they'll do
it<00:03:41.350> almost<00:03:41.590> straight<00:03:41.950> straight<00:03:42.250> okay<00:03:42.609> okay<00:03:43.000> so

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
it almost straight straight okay okay so

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.490 
it almost straight straight okay okay so
that's<00:03:43.750> the<00:03:44.170> basics<00:03:44.650> of<00:03:45.870> headstock<00:03:46.870> adjusting

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
that's the basics of headstock adjusting

that's the basics of headstock adjusting
truss<00:03:48.040> rod<00:03:48.250> all<00:03:48.790> right<00:03:48.910> Chris<00:03:49.060> let's<00:03:49.269> take<00:03:49.420> a

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
truss rod all right Chris let's take a

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.900 
truss rod all right Chris let's take a
look<00:03:49.630> at<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.810> vintage<00:03:50.440> style<00:03:50.739> okay<00:03:51.489> it's<00:03:51.790> a

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
look at the vintage style okay it's a

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.610 
look at the vintage style okay it's a
little<00:03:52.329> bit<00:03:52.540> more<00:03:52.690> complicated<00:03:53.079> and

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
little bit more complicated and

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.150 
little bit more complicated and
definitely<00:03:54.519> more<00:03:55.510> difficult<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:56.170> do<00:03:56.350> so<00:03:56.380> again

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
definitely more difficult to do so again

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.650 
definitely more difficult to do so again
this<00:03:57.850> is<00:03:58.060> something<00:03:58.390> if<00:03:58.510> you're<00:03:58.630> not

comfortable with this type of mechanical
stuff<00:04:00.790> much<00:04:01.269> better<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.720> take<00:04:01.750> it<00:04:01.959> to<00:04:02.290> your

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
stuff much better to take it to your

this<00:04:08.470> one<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:09.310> truss<00:04:09.670> rod<00:04:09.760> adjusting<00:04:10.359> screw

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
this one the truss rod adjusting screw

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.099 
this one the truss rod adjusting screw
is<00:04:11.290> on<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:12.370> bottom<00:04:12.670> of<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.819> neck<00:04:13.030> instead<00:04:13.989> of

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
is on the bottom of the neck instead of

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.830 
is on the bottom of the neck instead of
up<00:04:14.200> on<00:04:14.319> the<00:04:14.440> headstock<00:04:14.920> so<00:04:15.579> in<00:04:16.090> order<00:04:16.419> to<00:04:16.600> do

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
up on the headstock so in order to do

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.960 
up on the headstock so in order to do
this<00:04:16.989> adjustment<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:18.370> first<00:04:18.609> thing<00:04:18.789> you<00:04:18.880> have

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
this adjustment the first thing you have

anything<00:05:08.979> else<00:05:09.129> on<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.400> instrument<00:05:09.849> again

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
anything else on the instrument again

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.730 
anything else on the instrument again
just<00:05:12.099> like<00:05:12.189> on<00:05:12.340> a<00:05:12.370> guitar<00:05:13.169> if<00:05:14.169> I<00:05:14.379> turn<00:05:14.620> it

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
just like on a guitar if I turn it

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.769 
just like on a guitar if I turn it
clockwise<00:05:14.830> I'm<00:05:15.340> going<00:05:15.460> to<00:05:15.520> tighten<00:05:15.879> the<00:05:16.569> truss

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:16.779 
clockwise I'm going to tighten the truss

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:19.439 
clockwise I'm going to tighten the truss
rod<00:05:16.930> which<00:05:17.680> will<00:05:17.919> bring<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.520> strings<00:05:18.879> closer

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
rod which will bring the strings closer

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.379 
rod which will bring the strings closer
to<00:05:19.990> the<00:05:20.110> top<00:05:20.469> of<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.680> fretboard<00:05:20.919> and<00:05:21.250> if<00:05:22.060> the

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
to the top of the fretboard and if the

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:23.730 
to the top of the fretboard and if the
strings<00:05:22.659> are<00:05:22.779> already<00:05:23.110> too<00:05:23.289> close<00:05:23.529> to<00:05:23.650> the

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
strings are already too close to the

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.409 
strings are already too close to the
fretboard<00:05:23.979> I'm<00:05:24.310> going<00:05:24.550> to<00:05:24.610> go

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
fretboard I'm going to go

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:26.959 
fretboard I'm going to go
counterclockwise<00:05:25.810> and<00:05:26.439> that<00:05:26.560> will<00:05:26.680> loosen

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
counterclockwise and that will loosen

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:31.499 
counterclockwise and that will loosen
the<00:05:27.969> the<00:05:28.509> truss<00:05:29.050> rod<00:05:29.139> and<00:05:29.529> make<00:05:30.190> the<00:05:30.819> neck<00:05:31.300> bow
