cartwheels a pyramid uh not so today and
that's<00:00:51.809> what's<00:00:52.020> leading<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.289> all<00:00:52.410> these

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
that's what's leading to all these

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.650 
that's what's leading to all these
injuries<00:00:52.949> yeah<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.430> intensity<00:00:53.969> has<00:00:54.059> changed

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
injuries yeah the intensity has changed

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.000 
injuries yeah the intensity has changed
I<00:00:54.809> mean<00:00:54.960> there's<00:00:55.140> tumbling<00:00:55.680> there's

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
I mean there's tumbling there's

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.220 
I mean there's tumbling there's
gymnastic<00:00:56.940> exercises<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.719> are<00:00:57.750> much<00:00:57.989> more

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
gymnastic exercises that are much more

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.560 
gymnastic exercises that are much more
advanced<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.309> think<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.030> touched<00:01:00.359> on

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
advanced and I think that you touched on

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.299 
advanced and I think that you touched on
the<00:01:00.750> idea<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:01.079> catastrophic<00:01:01.410> injury<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the idea of catastrophic injury and

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.009 
the idea of catastrophic injury and
that's<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.030> type<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.210> thing<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.840> cause

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
that's the type of thing that can cause

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.810 
that's the type of thing that can cause
serious<00:01:04.350> brain<00:01:04.739> injury<00:01:05.129> spinal<00:01:05.339> cord

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
trauma to the abdomen that can cause

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.100

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
on a mat right look at the stands I know

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.460 
on a mat right look at the stands I know
look<00:01:18.150> at<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.479> these<00:01:18.689> are<00:01:18.750> gymnast<00:01:19.259> that's

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
look at this is these are gymnast that's

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.020 
look at this is these are gymnast that's
no<00:01:19.619> joke<00:01:19.920> they're<00:01:20.189> not<00:01:20.369> just<00:01:20.400> cheerleaders

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
no joke they're not just cheerleaders

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.340 
no joke they're not just cheerleaders
they're<00:01:21.180> gymnasts<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:21.750> well<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.200> guess

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
they're gymnasts as well and I guess

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.289 
they're gymnasts as well and I guess
that<00:01:22.860> accounts<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:23.610> part<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.150> they

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
that accounts for part of it but they

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.990 
that accounts for part of it but they
say<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.710> cheerleaders<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.670> more

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
say that that cheerleaders have more

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.600 
say that that cheerleaders have more
injuries<00:01:27.600> than<00:01:27.680> gymnasts<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.799> part<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.369> gather

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
injuries than gymnasts in part I gather

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.520 
injuries than gymnasts in part I gather
because<00:01:29.850> they're<00:01:30.210> not<00:01:30.390> using<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.049> proper

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
because they're not using the proper

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.770 
because they're not using the proper
safety<00:01:32.220> techniques<00:01:32.880> sure<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.570> not

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
safety techniques sure it's not

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.050 
safety techniques sure it's not
regulated<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.950> people<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.460> are<00:01:35.610> training

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
regulated the people that are training

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.030 
regulated the people that are training
them<00:01:36.299> aren't<00:01:36.479> necessarily<00:01:36.930> certified<00:01:37.590> so

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
them aren't necessarily certified so

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.370 
them aren't necessarily certified so
that's<00:01:38.280> really<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.390> setup<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.990> more

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
that's really just a setup for more

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.050 
that's really just a setup for more
accidents<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.189> saw<00:01:41.610> some<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.970> those

tumbles those girls were being tossed

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.679 
tumbles those girls were being tossed
thirty<00:01:44.009> feet<00:01:44.189> into<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> air<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.509> don't

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and this is we're talking guys and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.990 
and this is we're talking guys and
girls<00:02:13.379> are<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:13.680> girls<00:02:13.830> this<00:02:14.220> study<00:02:14.879> was

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
girls are just girls this study was

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.210 
girls are just girls this study was
looking<00:02:15.120> at<00:02:15.420> women<00:02:15.810> but<00:02:16.049> it<00:02:16.290> goes<00:02:16.739> across<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
looking at women but it goes across the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.470 
looking at women but it goes across the
board<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.670> think<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.120> thing<00:02:18.329> you

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
board and I think that the thing you

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.569 
board and I think that the thing you
have<00:02:18.629> to<00:02:18.720> also<00:02:18.900> remember<00:02:19.170> is<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:20.159> not

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
have to also remember is is not

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.880 
have to also remember is is not
necessarily<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.209> recognised<00:02:21.840> sport<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.709> many

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
necessarily a recognised sport in many

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.039 
necessarily a recognised sport in many
states<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.819> it's<00:02:24.150> sometimes<00:02:24.510> considered<00:02:24.930> an

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
states so it's sometimes considered an

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.899 
states so it's sometimes considered an
activity<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.010> some<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.430> data<00:02:26.640> may<00:02:26.879> be

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
activity so some of this data may be

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.449 
activity so some of this data may be
actually<00:02:27.390> underreported<00:02:28.230> what<00:02:28.650> what<00:02:29.310> would

actually underreported what what would

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.160 
actually underreported what what would
you<00:02:29.579> recommend<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:30.060> mean<00:02:30.209> I<00:02:30.269> honestly<00:02:30.480> as<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:30.989> say
