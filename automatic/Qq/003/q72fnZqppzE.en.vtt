00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 further goes back to the Middle Ages while doing a preview with 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.419
 good luck with a full 

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:13.249
 this is medieval preses at the infoplein completely middle ages with 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.289
 ladies and and the riders and crashes 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.599
 that difference the big news that I have I tell no no is still there 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.369
 have seen for the performance during this read also 2010 in which 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.599
 england yes but the biggest surprise game just 3 all the way to hell 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.420
 yes loses all day what I do like to lock sims in the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.730
 bathroom by putting large closet in front of the door 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.440
 and then see 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.560
 adjusted there of course that is now only possible in a rose 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.370
 the field yes 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.440
 the money and the care 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.160
 popaanhuis with a year earlier 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.170
 serving jimmy on earthlings is the sims trying to make life as acid as possible 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.860
 to make 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.880
 must do no it has nothing to do with campbell and I think that then the sims 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.910
 is at its best but I have a lot of things it can go on after all 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.850
 because they had come crossing dog walks from the pet store 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.050
 I can certainly do the only thing you couldn't do 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.950
 yes to sword fighting, and therefore it is no longer sword fighting today 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.840
 will be a little weird if you are already put off the third suspect 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.480
 since I am that last year because there was still heavy fighting after it 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.390
 first view of talat and the midday middle ages the casteleyn jonckheere and 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.620
 ladies and yes, making the shirt from drink is actually all of it 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.820
 parts that this game for comeback will make of drink alarm clock yes the 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.780
 selling drinks is making the other channel feel good he feels 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.780
 complained about ado won in this game though 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.660
 I just feel asleep 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.910
 I would be honest I have never played to sacrifice being happily married 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.000
 agents felt 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.440
 because it has been prepared all the time 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.380
 except what is absolutely not even about dixit stop it is stupid 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.630
 the words of injury at the gate of the residents 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.230
 yeah actually ashamed 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.370
 yes but you should not even get out I have I have you certainly played and 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.099
 he was also having them come over from all over the world everything will be nicer 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.289
 and all that is accessible is the package to fascinate me not so much 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:12.130
 but 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.870
 critical of the middle ages i must say i know 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.909
 many girls are crazy about the series of tours 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.909
 has denied this is a pet icon about one 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.049
 Bas Nijhuis in particular watch the tour since one the series that one over 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.919
 zealand advertising agency 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:30.339
 and after very much like the sims medieval to the case if you have the 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:34.289
 admission ticket and you love video games during the sims medieval one 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:37.509
 and a serious situation 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:42.139
 3 let's go miss it all reason to play yes absolutely I think so too 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:44.939
 a good time is to continue playing because 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.300
 then all tenants have one 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.349
 is certain after a few questions 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.060
 I have said it
