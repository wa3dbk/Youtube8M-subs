00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.339
 what hello lovers recharge their 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.010
 coxae 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:12.299
 today we will expose the chip tuning 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.170
 and so we have two controllers here 10 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:18.900
 our standard 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.740
 the keyway is absolutely no tuning in 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.400
 motor is not all standard and here we are 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.289
 two controllers one controller 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.430
 this is bosch standard controller 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.520
 and the second is the January controller which 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.109
 recorded the most running super-duper 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.879
 tuning program 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:43.829
 plus one hundred and five hundred horsepower which 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:47.069
 in theory should increase nebicheski 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.389
 power of our motor and what we are now 

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:54.210
 do i have a program which 

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:57.030
 detects the acceleration of the car completely 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.859
 itâ€™s high overclocking to 100 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:05.580
 time for someone per kilometer per mile all 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.570
 spotted now we first put 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.480
 standard controller and we will pass and 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.670
 measure and then put our not love 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.659
 Chesku super-duper chip tuning program 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.140
 in control 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.850
 January is we going to drive and we will measure it 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:27.119
 let's see what he gives or not 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.630
 here so first we put the standard 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.630
 controller 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.460
 January we remove 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:41.000
 here is our campus controller bosch 21 answer 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.000
 now we have it in the window 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.229
 well everything is ready 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.240
 mom arrange check in with standard 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.369
 bosch controller now we will pass 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.380
 one kilometer in a straight line so that we have 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.659
 all the time and a puncher per kilometer 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.350
 overclocking to 100 and so on shorter 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.350
 getting started 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.659
 act 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:54.260
 the song that made the first race 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:58.070
 the results we do not often put 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.090
 control vintar look standards 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.090
 control year 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:11.250
 let's set our tuning chip in january 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:15.030
 program and such tracks super-duper 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.030
 power epic 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.240
 all is ready 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.850
 and make a second run 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:31.760
 check that it gave us our 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.270
 already we have is the chip tuning controller 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.890
 january so here's a measurement went on so 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.890
 we start one kilometer 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.319
 they are a little over 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.840
 for them kilometer 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:29.100
 so let's review the results mean 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:32.760
 Apparently, Paris is the result of our time. 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:36.030
 chip tuning is almost identical 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.900
 nak often even a quarter mile 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:42.730
 slower than standard controller 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.730
 On the other hand, this is due to the fact that we 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.220
 exactly also a little bit about waffles restart 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:53.550
 here we have plus zero three first 60 feet 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:56.730
 and we also have this way up to 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.260
 quarter mile here we have four more 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.830
 only one kilometer in chip tuning 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.790
 showed time slightly faster than 0.3 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:09.460
 seconds 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:12.580
 we managed to win the same chip 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:16.060
 tuning and program for 0.8 seconds 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.630
 showed faster acceleration from 80 to 120 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.330
 kilometers per hour but everything is so 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:25.510
 insignificantly all this within 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.460
 errors and external factors on but all 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:31.450
 it could affect the good start 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:34.480
 a bad start so this one can be 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.640
 let that our chip tuning perfectly 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:41.890
 no noticeable results to us 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:43.690
 brought on a separate item even a little 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.740
 slower car drove 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.600
 than the standard controller well the truth of 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.110
 a separate point she drove a little 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.440
 faster I can say that equal 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.500
 the result so that you can end up 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.090
 the conclusion is that our chip tuning 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:05.810
 this is alma that we have the result 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:08.270
 and how do you see the results of the car with 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.700
 chip tuning drove even a little 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.400
 slower than 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.090
 standard 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.689
 i.e 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.360
 chip tuning 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:20.490
 increase the power of your motor 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.350
 that is, fucking you don't get shorter 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.780
 by saying 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.770
 Now I'm driving a car with a program 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.669
 recorded 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.669
 why did you take 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.629
 freezing 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.629
 bottom below 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.990
 how is this feeling achieved 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.920
 the fact that as if the car was faster 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.810
 in fact, the point is 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.210
 at low revs 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.800
 help reconfiguration that is today 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.930
 copper 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.460
 the mixture is a little enriched it becomes 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:57.529
 richer and low speed 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.670
 joint up to about three 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:02.810
 able to spin a little more 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.920
 due to this, you feel someone 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.900
 trimming 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.770
 it was better to go for it 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:14.930
 no grain and improved torque 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.930
 you forget significant halych 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.150
 so that 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.200
 acrylics it turned out today 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:25.249
 chip tuning 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.220
 handle regal 

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:30.230
 so that 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.230
 write down or not this is an important decision 

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:38.090
 I do not really look at fuel consumption 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:41.490
 so I decided to record and leave our 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:44.460
 an army of three programs ride on it 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:45.449
 that's all your father sign today 

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.749
 I'll see you 

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:47.749
 or
