00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.530 
it is very difficult to separate the two
take<00:01:43.409> me<00:01:43.619> for<00:01:43.860> instance<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.670> reason<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.180> can

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
take me for instance the reason I can

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.749 
take me for instance the reason I can
trade<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:45.899> Ryan<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.770> because<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.310> can't

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
trade with Ryan is because I can't

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.999 
trade with Ryan is because I can't
separate<00:01:48.299> my<00:01:48.360> view<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.869> him<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.320> my<00:01:49.500> husband<00:01:49.979> to

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
separate my view of him as my husband to

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.120 
separate my view of him as my husband to
him<00:01:50.759> being<00:01:51.090> my<00:01:51.299> boss<00:01:51.509> even<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.439> cases<00:01:52.680> where

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
him being my boss even in cases where

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.630 
him being my boss even in cases where
people<00:01:53.310> are<00:01:53.790> they<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.329> manager<00:01:55.049> or<00:01:55.290> any<00:01:56.130> sort<00:01:56.460> of

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
people are they a manager or any sort of

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.899 
people are they a manager or any sort of
leader<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.299> their<00:01:57.780> job<00:01:58.290> or<00:01:58.649> their<00:01:58.740> career<00:01:59.610> it

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
leader in their job or their career it

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.010 
leader in their job or their career it
is<00:02:00.600> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
is a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.200 
is a
thing<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.979> lot<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.189> people<00:02:02.460> can't<00:02:03.000> be

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
thing to do a lot of people can't be

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.910 
thing to do a lot of people can't be
friends<00:02:03.600> with<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.869> people<00:02:03.990> they<00:02:04.350> leave<00:02:04.560> just

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
friends with the people they leave just

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.980 
friends with the people they leave just
because<00:02:05.219> they<00:02:05.369> can't<00:02:05.640> separate<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.509> two<00:02:06.719> and

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
because they can't separate the two and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.009 
because they can't separate the two and
again<00:02:07.469> fortunately<00:02:08.069> for<00:02:08.489> me<00:02:08.519> Ryan<00:02:09.119> recognizes

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
again fortunately for me Ryan recognizes

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.190 
again fortunately for me Ryan recognizes
this<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.590> he<00:02:10.800> doesn't<00:02:11.099> tend<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:12.000> try<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.660> lead

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
this so he doesn't tend to try to lead

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.110 
this so he doesn't tend to try to lead
me<00:02:13.500> he<00:02:13.769> tries<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.220> teach<00:02:14.400> me<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.790> be<00:02:14.910> patient
