brutal but I think that that was easier
than<00:02:56.990> this

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
than this

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:07.319 
than this
alright<00:02:59.600> speed<00:03:00.080> yes<00:03:00.800> how<00:03:01.400> do<00:03:01.459> we<00:03:01.640> set<00:03:01.880> that

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.959 

speed<00:03:08.230> level<00:03:08.590> how<00:03:09.010> do<00:03:09.069> I<00:03:09.459> know<00:03:09.610> what

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:11.969 
speed level how do I know what

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:16.410 
speed level how do I know what
like<00:03:14.219> what's<00:03:15.219> fast<00:03:15.459> what<00:03:15.730> slow<00:03:16.000> give<00:03:16.269> me<00:03:16.359> a

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420

all<00:04:07.970> right

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.600 

that's<00:04:11.400> super<00:04:11.700> intelligent

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
that's super intelligent

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.340 
that's super intelligent
is<00:04:14.060> that<00:04:14.270> slow

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
is that slow

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.909 
is that slow
it<00:04:16.920> doesn't<00:04:17.400> see

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
it doesn't see

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:25.089 
it doesn't see
thousands<00:04:19.639> going<00:04:19.819> to<00:04:19.879> be<00:04:19.969> any<00:04:20.060> slower<00:04:24.009> can<00:04:25.009> you

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
thousands going to be any slower can you

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:29.520 
thousands going to be any slower can you
tell<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.400> difference

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.089 

ah<00:04:29.670> give<00:04:30.670> over

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:42.280 

mmm

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.910 

I<00:04:42.320> wonder<00:04:43.040> if<00:04:43.070> it's<00:04:43.280> not<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.490> number<00:04:44.650> I'll<00:04:45.650> see

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
I wonder if it's not a number I'll see

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.579 
I wonder if it's not a number I'll see
what<00:04:46.040> happens<00:04:46.130> if<00:04:46.340> I'd<00:04:46.460> type

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:50.589 

00:04:50.589 --> 00:05:02.780 

speed<00:04:51.189> level<00:04:51.689> s<00:04:53.669> slow<00:04:56.969> as<00:04:57.969> my<00:04:58.179> working

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.600 

five

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.080 

firing<00:05:06.610> rate<00:05:07.150> I<00:05:08.010> don't<00:05:09.010> know<00:05:09.100> let's<00:05:09.580> put<00:05:09.760> 5<00:05:10.030> on

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
firing rate I don't know let's put 5 on

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
firing rate I don't know let's put 5 on
that<00:05:10.390> as<00:05:10.540> well

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.469 

and<00:05:14.620> for<00:05:15.039> those<00:05:15.189> with<00:05:15.550> pink<00:05:15.909> eye<00:05:16.060> oh<00:05:16.120> no<00:05:16.449> I

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
and for those with pink eye oh no I

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.360 
and for those with pink eye oh no I
think<00:05:16.720> it<00:05:17.139> wouldn't<00:05:17.439> be<00:05:17.500> Galaxian<00:05:18.099> if<00:05:18.220> they

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
think it wouldn't be Galaxian if they

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.869 
think it wouldn't be Galaxian if they
weren't<00:05:18.580> swooping<00:05:19.270> really<00:05:19.599> would<00:05:19.780> it<00:05:20.879> let's

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:21.879 
weren't swooping really would it let's

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:25.920 
weren't swooping really would it let's
give<00:05:22.150> it<00:05:22.180> a<00:05:22.300> go<00:05:22.569> and<00:05:24.180> watch<00:05:25.180> me<00:05:25.419> depth<00:05:25.719> of

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
give it a go and watch me depth of

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.629 
give it a go and watch me depth of
bloody<00:05:26.349> well<00:05:26.949> that<00:05:27.069> doesn't<00:05:27.250> appear<00:05:27.550> to<00:05:27.580> have

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
bloody well that doesn't appear to have

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.029 
bloody well that doesn't appear to have
made<00:05:27.819> any<00:05:27.879> difference<00:05:28.090> at<00:05:28.539> all<00:05:28.599> oh<00:05:29.039> no

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
made any difference at all oh no

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.399 
made any difference at all oh no
actually<00:05:30.909> it<00:05:31.180> has<00:05:31.330> they're<00:05:31.719> they're<00:05:32.080> firing

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
actually it has they're they're firing

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:37.409 
actually it has they're they're firing
even<00:05:33.039> more<00:05:33.250> I'm<00:05:34.000> getting<00:05:34.360> hammered<00:05:36.150> well<00:05:37.150> I

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
even more I'm getting hammered well I

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:38.999 
even more I'm getting hammered well I
couldn't<00:05:37.810> got<00:05:37.990> much<00:05:38.169> more<00:05:38.409> hammered<00:05:38.770> than<00:05:38.919> I

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
couldn't got much more hammered than I

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:45.330 
couldn't got much more hammered than I
was<00:05:39.159> anyway<00:05:39.340> but<00:05:39.759> you<00:05:39.969> know<00:05:42.330> go<00:05:44.009> now<00:05:45.009> alright

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
was anyway but you know go now alright

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.959 
was anyway but you know go now alright
that's<00:05:45.699> that

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:47.969 
that's that

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:50.490 
that's that
yeah<00:05:48.969> it's<00:05:49.240> technically<00:05:49.719> impressive<00:05:50.020> in<00:05:50.379> the

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
yeah it's technically impressive in the

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.200 
yeah it's technically impressive in the
speed<00:05:50.740> that<00:05:50.889> they<00:05:51.039> get<00:05:51.250> out<00:05:51.400> of<00:05:51.580> it<00:05:51.729> as<00:05:51.969> are<00:05:52.180> a

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
speed that they get out of it as are a

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.390 
speed that they get out of it as are a
lot<00:05:52.419> of<00:05:52.449> zx81<00:05:53.349> games<00:05:53.620> but<00:05:53.889> in<00:05:53.979> terms<00:05:54.219> of

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
lot of zx81 games but in terms of

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.629 
lot of zx81 games but in terms of
playability<00:05:54.819> that<00:05:55.300> is<00:05:55.449> too<00:05:55.659> brutal<00:05:56.199> and<00:05:56.639> the

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
playability that is too brutal and the

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.939 
playability that is too brutal and the
options<00:05:58.300> to<00:05:58.569> change<00:05:58.780> the<00:05:58.960> speed<00:05:59.379> and<00:05:59.650> stuff

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
options to change the speed and stuff

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:01.230 
options to change the speed and stuff
just<00:06:00.159> don't<00:06:00.400> seem<00:06:00.759> to<00:06:00.849> do<00:06:01.000> anything

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
just don't seem to do anything

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.450 
just don't seem to do anything
meaningful<00:06:01.780> so<00:06:02.530> I<00:06:05.219> don't<00:06:06.219> personally

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
meaningful so I don't personally

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.999 
meaningful so I don't personally
