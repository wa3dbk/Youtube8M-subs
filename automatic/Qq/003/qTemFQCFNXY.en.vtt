as many as you can you could probably do

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:51.090 
as many as you can you could probably do
it<00:06:48.850> all<00:06:48.940> in<00:06:49.030> one<00:06:49.180> go<00:06:49.389> if<00:06:49.630> you're<00:06:50.380> lucky<00:06:50.710> but<00:06:50.919> if

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
it all in one go if you're lucky but if

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.600 
it all in one go if you're lucky but if
you're<00:06:51.220> not

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
you're not

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.730 
you're not
he<00:06:51.729> just<00:06:51.940> morphs<00:06:52.300> whatever's<00:06:52.870> left<00:06:53.169> back<00:06:53.440> into

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740 
he just morphs whatever's left back into

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.170 
he just morphs whatever's left back into
another<00:06:53.889> one<00:06:54.100> and<00:06:54.160> then<00:06:54.430> you<00:06:54.550> have<00:06:54.669> to<00:06:54.820> repeat

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
another one and then you have to repeat

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.879 
another one and then you have to repeat
the<00:06:55.330> cycle<00:06:55.479> so<00:06:55.810> there's<00:06:55.990> really<00:06:56.110> no<00:06:56.350> set

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:56.889 
the cycle so there's really no set

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:59.550 
the cycle so there's really no set
amount<00:06:57.009> of<00:06:57.280> hits<00:06:57.550> or<00:06:58.449> turns<00:06:58.780> I<00:06:58.960> guess<00:06:59.139> for<00:06:59.440> this

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
amount of hits or turns I guess for this

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.529 
amount of hits or turns I guess for this
in<00:06:59.740> particular<00:07:00.009> boss<00:07:00.370> battle<00:07:00.789> it's<00:07:00.940> just<00:07:01.120> how
