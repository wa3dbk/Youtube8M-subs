and<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.699> ticker<00:01:00.030> four<00:01:00.809> chambers<00:01:01.410> two

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
and in this ticker four chambers two

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.570 
and in this ticker four chambers two
down<00:01:02.760> there<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.359> two<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.439> here<00:01:04.739> right<00:01:05.010> now

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
down there and two up here right now

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.200 
down there and two up here right now
then<00:01:05.790> these<00:01:06.270> chambers<00:01:06.659> are<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:08.100> right-hand<00:01:08.970> one

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
then these chambers are a right-hand one

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.690 
then these chambers are a right-hand one
called<00:01:09.689> an<00:01:09.840> atrium<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.500> right-hand<00:01:11.220> one<00:01:11.400> called

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
called an atrium a right-hand one called

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.810 
called an atrium a right-hand one called
a<00:01:11.820> ventricle<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> then<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> left-hand

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
a ventricle and then the left-hand

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.490 
a ventricle and then the left-hand
ventricle<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.180> left<00:01:15.210> hand<00:01:15.600> atrium<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
ventricle and the left hand atrium the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.010 
ventricle and the left hand atrium the
one<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.920> doesn't<00:01:17.100> work<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.729> my<00:01:17.790> case<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
one that doesn't work in my case is the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.899 
one that doesn't work in my case is the
left<00:01:19.229> hand<00:01:19.500> atrium<00:01:19.979> I'll<00:01:20.220> explain<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.850> why

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
left hand atrium I'll explain to you why

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.179 
left hand atrium I'll explain to you why
the<00:01:21.600> left<00:01:21.810> hand<00:01:22.049> atrium<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.799> pumping

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the left hand atrium is the pumping

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.310 
the left hand atrium is the pumping
chamber<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.180> supposed<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.689> go<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:25.020> this

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
chamber so it's supposed to go like this

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.999 
chamber so it's supposed to go like this
watch<00:01:26.009> whoosh<00:01:26.700> whoosh<00:01:27.360> whoosh<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.409> pump<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
watch whoosh whoosh whoosh and pump the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.429 
watch whoosh whoosh whoosh and pump the
blood<00:01:29.159> out<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.240> heart<00:01:30.270> around<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.259> body

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
blood out of the heart around the body

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.620 
blood out of the heart around the body
ok<00:01:31.890> which<00:01:32.310> then<00:01:32.549> sends<00:01:32.790> oxygen<00:01:33.299> around<00:01:33.390> your

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
ok which then sends oxygen around your

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.810 
ok which then sends oxygen around your
body<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.140> keeps<00:01:34.619> fluids<00:01:35.009> flowing<00:01:35.250> what's

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
body and keeps fluids flowing what's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.630 
body and keeps fluids flowing what's
happening<00:01:36.240> my<00:01:36.360> case<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.409> wash<00:01:37.619> wash<00:01:38.189> wash

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
happening my case is the wash wash wash

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.020 
happening my case is the wash wash wash
is<00:01:38.970> more<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.840> excuse<00:01:40.439> me<00:01:40.619> whoosh<00:01:41.280> whoosh

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
is more of a excuse me whoosh whoosh

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.270 
is more of a excuse me whoosh whoosh
whoosh<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:43.020> doesn't<00:01:43.409> come<00:01:43.890> back<00:01:43.920> together

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
whoosh it doesn't come back together

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.249 
whoosh it doesn't come back together
again<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> rubber<00:01:45.840> band<00:01:46.049> that's

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
again it's like a rubber band that's

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.109 
again it's like a rubber band that's
been<00:01:46.350> over<00:01:46.680> stretched<00:01:47.119> unfortunately

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
been over stretched unfortunately

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.730 
been over stretched unfortunately
there's<00:01:48.540> not<00:01:48.659> enough<00:01:48.869> pressure<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.229> force<00:01:49.590> the
