00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.269
 in my spirit to camus the droid did 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.879
 they announce something very curious that killed by 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.369
 innovative subscriber plan gamer and good 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.869
 juliÃ¡n thanks but I do not know exactly 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.970
 where I get this does not tell me where 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.579
 he only took out I do not send it by twitter and 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.399
 good as they listen is a freckle of 8 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:30.910
 but bring music I stayed wat and 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.290
 see they do not listen or it looks identical 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.750
 if you are watching here the screen starts 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.050
 it's the same did not move anything else and in fact 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.879
 this 11 the difficulty here in the settings 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.800
 They bring nothing of music or it is not 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.359
 the switch since we will acquire the help 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.789
 from the launcher blog later to have the 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.309
 switch and others that shut up or listen 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.679
 bring about 34 songs and good to me 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.170
 several people said that at the time 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:55.449
 of playing is no longer heard but sometimes 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.120
 sometimes it does not happen because it even happens 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.180
 version of windows or suddenly 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.680
 we are going to enter here suddenly no longer 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.540
 you listen and listen because that's the way 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.010
 music in minecraft windows 10 and pocket 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.710
 he stays silent for a long time and I'm going 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.080
 to listen now the freckle you just want the 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.460
 description for those who like to try it 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.470
 where most music sounds is in the intro 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.180
 and the funny thing about this is that they do not believe that 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.700
 it looks normal to me but I put myself 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.320
 investigate the files you already know what 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.159
 unzip what is the zip and good the 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.560
 music comes here in assets sounds music 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.009
 they wrote music from the menu we're going to 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.009
 listen to it 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.800
 ahead is the music that we are that 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.720
 while it is bringing in four songs 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.490
 As for the menu and for the game 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.400
 enough we have music from the never 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.140
 we have music in creative and we have the 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.180
 music then normal that suddenly they are in 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.340
 any kind of world then they are 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.470
 enough songs the game if it goes up 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.650
 quite what is the heavy apk ends 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.510
 thinking with 91 megabytes of 14 went to 92 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.870
 megas with the music then if you're 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.310
 Something pesadito hopefully that's someone who 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.080
 he took the sounds of the version of 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.570
 windows and got him into the freckle of this 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.610
 version then how is the same 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.920
 basically the game recognizes them and the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.600
 start playing but like in this 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.040
 version we remove the slider from the 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.670
 music when we can change the volume 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.440
 but also this one is supposed not to 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.420
 It was planned for poker but already 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.920
 with this we see that if it works and how 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.800
 I tell them it's possibly music taken out 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.330
 the windows version and well this 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.520
 that is all for that video I hope they 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.130
 serve I hope some time that is 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.380
 seeing this then when it comes out so 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.360
 I ironed it well with supplements 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.500
 create a complement to have the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.290
 switches and all 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.240
 of music since I do not think that you take 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.470
 heard add to hopefully yes and if not 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.540
 they want them like that with a way 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.370
 we can add the legally already to the menu 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.840
 and therefore also good for now there 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.670
 here with what is the apk they took from 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.490
 sure what is the folder the mention 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.709
 at the sip of the other files and the 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.090
 they signed again and pum and they are the freckle 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.760
 but I did not think that the 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.090
 music as an experiment the truth is 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.860
 whoever did it I do not know in what way 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.090
 he was and looked for the concert agent for 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.920
 been the link will be in the 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.690
 destruction either at 90 megs something 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.739
 pesadito but it is worth it to install them 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.470
 well that is to install the version that 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.850
 have previously and I and 4 have to go up 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.260
 this video once today because 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.470
 possibly tomorrow come the uy 9 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.360
 then nothing else is a matter of whether 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.010
 they want to make their own apk with music 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.810
 lowers them in the tutorial description of 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.239
 how to make freckles and then nothing else 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.850
 here the music folder is copied in the 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.830
 folder of the wii 9 files and it 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.850
 create their own apk with the tutorial that 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.650
 I told them to leave them in the description 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.230
 and so you can have your music in the 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.000
 wii 9 10 etc. etcetera 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.620
 why by the way perceived I'm like 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.690
 this guy that like 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.000
 intriguing as they did to him I do not have 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.680
 idea but great that business of music 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.900
 so here it is for you to create music 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.900
 2 in this video are taken care of and bye
