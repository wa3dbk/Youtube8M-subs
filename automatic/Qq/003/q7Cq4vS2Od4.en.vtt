00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Doing sucks 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.480
 To make them here, I take a couple of different colors and blend them together 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.000
 Not so it gets solid, but so you have this mix of colors 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.720
 I put this little ball through my paste machine in one of the smallest settings 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.240
 Like this 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.140
 And then I have my sticker 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.120
 This 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.120
 and I make the bottom piece 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.260
 Of the pacifier with this one 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.740
 I make a few 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.200
 And as you can see, it has a lot of pattern on it and it's nice 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.040
 Patterns 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.720
 That's the part of the pacifier 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.200
 And I'll save this piece for later 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.320
 And then I have 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.660
 Slightly light brown / light orange 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.720
 And I make several pieces 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.600
 In the same size 1.. 2. . 3. . 4. . 5. . 6 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.620
 1.. 2. . 3. . 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.700
 4 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.760
 5 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.760
 6 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.020
 And this is rolled out in the same thickness, as the bottom part of the pacifier 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.420
 Now I just roll small balls, like this one 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.300
 And I place it in the middle 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.660
 Of the first part, here 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.740
 I don't know if you can see it 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.900
 Like this one, and I do it once more so you can see it 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.760
 Like this 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.100
 Just in the middle of the pacifier 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.440
 Again 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.960
 And I do it all with them 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.420
 And here 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.000
 And this one 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.460
 And the last 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:42.240
 Now I take the rest of the clay from the bottom of my pacifier 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.800
 And I roll it to a good ball 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.680
 Like this 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.480
 Then I take my clay extruder 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.540
 and a part with a very small hole 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.360
 Let me see if you can see it here. Very small hole 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.240
 And I put the clay into it here 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.180
 And I collect my clay extruder 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.680
 With hollow part 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.240
 Now I make the handle 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.900
 For the nuts 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.260
 By printing out a thin stripe 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.140
 Like this 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.620
 What I do is take a small wooden stick (toothpick) 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.280
 Just a moment 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.080
 And I bend it to a small hook 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.380
 Or what you call it 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.940
 Like this 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.940
 And then I'm baking it like this 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.120
 And I do enough for all of them, let me see there were 6 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.540
 So I'm gonna make 6 of them here 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.040
 Don't make them too big, it will look strange 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.820
 3 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.140
 4 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.660
 5 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.600
 And another 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.040
 Do not think so much about the ends of them here, we cut them off when they are baked 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.260
 And then I glue them firmly, but I'll show you later 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.880
 And that's how I make the nuts 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.020
 First part of it 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.600
 And then I bake the pieces for 5 to 10 minutes 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.000
 I have baked my small pieces, so 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.900
 Now I'm lying the little ones to the side 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.240
 And I start with the little things for the "handle" 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.160
 And I have one 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.900
 (Sorry don't even know what happens here) 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.040
 Second glue here, I use it here 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.560
 And now I'm starting with 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.720
 to cut the ends of this small "handle" 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.640
 Just a little bit of it 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.780
 But so it gets straight 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.880
 And 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.200
 And I put a little bit of glue on it 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.620
 It's probably not easy to see 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.380
 Just a little bit of glue 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.380
 And I put it 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.720
 on the pacifier 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.800
 I keep it just a second 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.440
 And there I have my pacifier 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.780
 A little bit 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.760
 Small mini one 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.280
 And that was that 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.160
 And I do that with all my sucks 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.540
 I hope you liked my video made by me
