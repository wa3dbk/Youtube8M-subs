definitely all right so it's time to
bend<00:04:09.260> some<00:04:09.440> tubes<00:04:09.650> together<00:04:09.860> yes<00:04:10.519> we<00:04:11.450> are

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
bend some tubes together yes we are

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.680 
bend some tubes together yes we are
going<00:04:11.900> to<00:04:12.230> start<00:04:12.650> out<00:04:12.860> with<00:04:13.540> cutting<00:04:14.540> our

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
going to start out with cutting our

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.590 
going to start out with cutting our
material<00:04:15.230> our<00:04:15.470> raw<00:04:16.190> material<00:04:16.669> it<00:04:16.790> comes<00:04:17.180> in<00:04:17.419> we

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
material our raw material it comes in we

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.990 
material our raw material it comes in we
cut<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:17.959> put<00:04:18.470> our<00:04:18.620> angles<00:04:19.010> on<00:04:19.250> it<00:04:19.280> and

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
cut it put our angles on it and

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.990 
cut it put our angles on it and
everything<00:04:20.209> up<00:04:20.690> to<00:04:20.900> spec<00:04:21.320> so<00:04:21.790> this<00:04:22.790> obviously

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
everything up to spec so this obviously

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.190 
everything up to spec so this obviously
looks<00:04:23.389> like<00:04:23.540> the<00:04:23.660> brains<00:04:23.900> of<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.169> operation

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
looks like the brains of the operation

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.520 
looks like the brains of the operation
nothing<00:04:24.800> against<00:04:25.190> you<00:04:25.340> date<00:04:25.550> oh<00:04:25.729> yes<00:04:26.260> yes<00:04:27.260> it's

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
all automated and from here that goes

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.530 
all automated and from here that goes
into<00:04:31.310> production<00:04:31.669> and<00:04:31.910> we<00:04:32.090> like<00:04:32.270> things

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
into production and we like things

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:40.390 
into production and we like things
automated<00:04:33.200> around<00:04:33.530> here<00:04:33.830> that<00:04:33.979> namely<00:04:34.790> game
