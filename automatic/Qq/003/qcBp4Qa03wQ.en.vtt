unfortunately this thing is a bit too

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.700

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.580 
is going to topple back and forth a
little<00:00:54.420> bit<00:00:54.539> took<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> lot<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.079> me<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.320> balance

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
little bit took a lot for me to balance

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.250 
little bit took a lot for me to balance
it<00:00:55.820> but<00:00:56.820> fortunately<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.840> thing<00:00:58.109> actually

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
it but fortunately this thing actually

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.069 
it but fortunately this thing actually
isn't<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.710> big<00:00:58.859> part<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.219> figure<00:01:00.079> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
isn't a big part of the figure the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.049 
isn't a big part of the figure the
figure<00:01:01.350> just<00:01:01.649> alone<00:01:01.890> by<00:01:02.370> itself<00:01:02.399> without<00:01:02.730> this

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
figure just alone by itself without this

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.679 
figure just alone by itself without this
is<00:01:03.239> really<00:01:03.449> cool<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.799> thing<00:01:04.979> fires<00:01:05.689> and

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
so much more that the others don't as a

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.810 
so much more that the others don't as a
lot<00:02:44.110> more<00:02:44.290> accessories<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.160> they're<00:02:45.430> good

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
lot more accessories and they're good

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.000 
lot more accessories and they're good
accessories<00:02:46.360> i<00:02:46.570> like<00:02:46.840> them<00:02:47.080> especially<00:02:47.980> that

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
accessories i like them especially that

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:56.910 
accessories i like them especially that
pistol<00:02:48.580> oh<00:02:53.700> yeah<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.910> head<00:02:55.420> will<00:02:55.630> turn<00:02:55.920> gum

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
pistol oh yeah the head will turn gum

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.770 
pistol oh yeah the head will turn gum
down<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.220> little<00:02:57.400> bit<00:02:57.550> especially<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.420> pistol

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
down a little bit especially the pistol

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.720 
down a little bit especially the pistol
and<00:02:58.959> i<00:02:59.350> think<00:02:59.709> probably<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.190> shield<00:03:00.550> is

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
and i think probably the shield is

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.000 
and i think probably the shield is
supposed<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.120> go<00:03:01.239> on<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.570> this<00:03:01.690> hand<00:03:02.050> because

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
supposed to go on to this hand because

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.530 
supposed to go on to this hand because
the<00:03:03.060> actual<00:03:04.060> fist<00:03:04.390> is<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:04.630> lot<00:03:05.010> smaller<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:07.180> it

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
the actual fist is a lot smaller so it

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:15.270 
the actual fist is a lot smaller so it
will<00:03:07.690> hold<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.110> band<00:03:08.560> better<00:03:12.180> ya<00:03:13.180> see<00:03:14.280> doesn't

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
will hold the band better ya see doesn't

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.140 
will hold the band better ya see doesn't
move<00:03:15.370> as<00:03:15.519> much<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:17.670> that's<00:03:18.670> why<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:18.910> shield

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
move as much so that's why the shield

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.479 
move as much so that's why the shield
supposed<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.510> be<00:03:19.600> on<00:03:19.830> this<00:03:20.830> guy<00:03:21.040> is<00:03:21.100> really

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.310

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830
