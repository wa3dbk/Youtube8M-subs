00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:29.380
 well hi to all these spinet 353 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.930
 today we find ourselves on the 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.930
 new dlc map second assault i 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.790
 named caspian border the famous caspian 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.340
 border then there I show you 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.309
 currently the big wall they put 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.930
 on this map on this teaching any 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.190
 simply in accelerated speed 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.940
 so first interaction with mans 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.650
 it's at the level of the big radio tower 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.500
 there now I show you 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.670
 the elevator you will interact with 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.100
 the elevator to know that the elevator 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.830
 you can climb but by cons for 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.410
 go down again you will have to use others 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.200
 means that lift because this lift 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.899
 once he is at the top 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.390
 as we will see right after he 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.780
 automatically goes back down it's not 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.540
 I who make it go down is the same 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.500
 principle that on metro operations the 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.690
 elevator down alone what 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.190
 beautiful magic is leases lift 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.190
 technological goods 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.750
 second interaction with ama on 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.340
 Caspian borders 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:44.640
 these species of vehicle blocker I 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.100
 do not know how too much it's called 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.380
 buttons that are in the hut kits to 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.070
 right and left 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.800
 you can bring down both 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.310
 blockers who are at the road level 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.960
 right for the right hut and for 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.250
 the hut on the left will be both 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.390
 bloggers who are on the road to 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:10.350
 left third and last interaction 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.080
 with ama it will be the same explosion that 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.209
 Surout if you know so for 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.700
 go to the basement so you need 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.130
 go to the car radio you take 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.150
 the staircase but the stairs to the 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.040
 beat on little one my place to take 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.570
 the elevator you have lightly on the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.420
 left for us could see it and you 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.459
 take the stairs going down one 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.910
 time that you are in this space 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.610
 so you will have a counter on the wall 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.700
 and in the left room so you 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.890
 will have a computer that is marked which 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.860
 scored by two or three minutes you 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.850
 can trigger the counter by 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.040
 yourself 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.760
 the radio timeout asset to your own 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.640
 average simply it's not 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.710
 grace 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.050
 my ticket restaurant or even 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.680
 something else it's really through your 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.770
 own means 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.450
 so you just have to trigger the 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.270
 storyteller who is on the computer 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.830
 you can like on having stopped the 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.470
 driver simply 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.410
 so that can be your ally 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.030
 your enemy everyone can 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.190
 stop it simply 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.380
 but in any case the interaction with this 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.040
 radio radio really drummed through our 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.680
 own means 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.849
 unlike bf3 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:28.469
 so once you've triggered the 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:30.909
 counter on the computer you will have 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:33.489
 grant hill who will take you the 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.650
 ears have you heard of a 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.900
 once the contract comes to term 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.000
 we have a big explosion with a 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.340
 numerous and of all the tower read people 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.359
 gorgeous you liked the same words of 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.739
 specs of this famous explosion and to I 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.540
 come back to the scene to see if the 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.169
 flame burns us but actually 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.430
 this is the case rather nice little 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:56.200
 passage to remember here 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.590
 here I hope in any case that this 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.079
 little video on the famous border 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.120
 Caspian will have pleased you if that's the case 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.519

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.439
