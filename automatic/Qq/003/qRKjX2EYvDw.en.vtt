they<00:00:00.840> were<00:00:00.930> having<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.230> look<00:00:01.380> at<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.650> velbon

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
they were having to look at the velbon

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.940 
they were having to look at the velbon
DF<00:00:02.460> 61<00:00:03.149> and<00:00:03.899> we're<00:00:04.020> going<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.170> do<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.650> little

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
DF 61 and we're going to do a little

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.039 
DF 61 and we're going to do a little
improvement<00:00:05.640> on<00:00:06.000> it<00:00:06.150> it's<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.629> nice<00:00:06.810> little

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
improvement on it it's a nice little

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.110 
improvement on it it's a nice little
tripod<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.799> it<00:00:07.890> only<00:00:08.040> costs<00:00:09.860> 35<00:00:10.860> euros<00:00:11.400> and

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
tripod and it only costs 35 euros and

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.730 
tripod and it only costs 35 euros and
you<00:00:12.210> can't<00:00:12.420> complain<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:13.139> does<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.530> job

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
you can't complain it does the job

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.650 
you can't complain it does the job
there's<00:00:14.340> just<00:00:14.549> one<00:00:14.700> little<00:00:14.849> niggly<00:00:15.420> thing

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
there's just one little niggly thing

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.920 
there's just one little niggly thing
that<00:00:15.870> gets<00:00:16.080> on<00:00:16.260> my<00:00:16.379> nerves<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.920> that's<00:00:17.900> set<00:00:18.900> in

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
that gets on my nerves and that's set in

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.109 
that gets on my nerves and that's set in
this<00:00:19.260> thing<00:00:19.529> here<00:00:19.680> cuz<00:00:19.920> if<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.100> move<00:00:20.880> this

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
this thing here cuz if you move this

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.439 
this thing here cuz if you move this
handle<00:00:21.630> sometimes<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.830> hard<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.369> get<00:00:24.000> level

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
handle sometimes it's hard to get level

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.990 
handle sometimes it's hard to get level
again<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.859> thought<00:00:26.099> if<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.400> just<00:00:26.699> put<00:00:26.970> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
again and I thought if you just put a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.410 
again and I thought if you just put a
mark<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.570> there<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.349> might<00:00:28.500> not<00:00:28.650> be<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> bad<00:00:29.010> idea

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
mark on there it might not be a bad idea

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.110 
mark on there it might not be a bad idea
so<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.689> how<00:00:30.810> I'm<00:00:30.990> gonna<00:00:31.140> do<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.850> so<00:00:32.850> first

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
so this is how I'm gonna do it so first

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.670 
so this is how I'm gonna do it so first
of<00:00:33.329> all<00:00:33.590> get<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> bubble<00:00:35.070> as<00:00:35.700> near<00:00:36.030> as<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
of all get the bubble as near as the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.619 
of all get the bubble as near as the
middle<00:00:37.680> as<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.969> don't<00:00:39.210> forget<00:00:39.510> this

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
middle as you can and don't forget this

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.830 
middle as you can and don't forget this
is<00:00:39.750> only<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.050> 45<00:00:40.620> euro<00:00:40.950> tripod<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.030> it's<00:00:42.629> not

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
is only a 45 euro tripod so it's not

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.660 
is only a 45 euro tripod so it's not
going<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.110> be<00:00:43.200> super<00:00:43.500> position

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
going to be super position

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.290 
going to be super position
precision<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.500> we'll<00:00:46.920> get<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.280> thing<00:00:47.879> set<00:00:48.180> in

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
precision so we'll get that thing set in

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.889 
precision so we'll get that thing set in
the<00:00:48.420> middle<00:00:48.719> as<00:00:48.840> well<00:00:49.410> as<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:51.809> that's

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
the middle as well as we can so that's

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.410 
the middle as well as we can so that's
pretty<00:00:52.230> level<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.770> looks<00:00:52.980> okay<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:53.699> because

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
pretty level that looks okay but because

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.270 
pretty level that looks okay but because
it's<00:00:54.629> not<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.809> super<00:00:55.140> high<00:00:55.379> precision<00:00:55.829> track

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
it's not a super high precision track

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.310 
it's not a super high precision track
tripod<00:00:56.879> even<00:00:57.149> though<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.420> bubbles<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
tripod even though the bubbles in the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.570 
tripod even though the bubbles in the
center<00:00:58.680> there<00:00:58.890> when<00:00:59.579> we<00:00:59.730> spin<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.390> round<00:01:04.580> on

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
center there when we spin this round on

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.380 
center there when we spin this round on
this<00:01:05.880> angle<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.450> not<00:01:06.659> level<00:01:06.869> anymore<00:01:08.390> well

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
this angle it's not level anymore well

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.469 
this angle it's not level anymore well
you<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.630> live<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.229> suppose<00:01:11.270> if<00:01:12.270> it

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
you can live with that I suppose if it

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.490 
you can live with that I suppose if it
was<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:13.490> super<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.700> 500<00:01:15.509> euro<00:01:15.840> trike<00:01:16.170> what<00:01:16.380> do<00:01:16.439> you

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
was a super a 500 euro trike what do you

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.230 
was a super a 500 euro trike what do you
expect<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> same<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.119> that

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
expect it to be the same but for that

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.749 
expect it to be the same but for that
price<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.689> can't<00:01:18.930> really<00:01:19.140> expect<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.580> bit

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
price you can't really expect it's a bit

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.969 
price you can't really expect it's a bit
perfect<00:01:21.409> so<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.439> don't<00:01:22.650> think<00:01:22.830> there's

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
perfect so I don't think there's

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.039 
perfect so I don't think there's
anything<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.549> do<00:01:23.790> about<00:01:23.820> that

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
anything you can do about that

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.960 
anything you can do about that
you<00:01:25.350> can<00:01:25.560> adjust<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:26.310> much<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.759> want

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
you can adjust it as much as you want

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.219 
you can adjust it as much as you want
but<00:01:27.180> you're<00:01:27.270> never<00:01:27.450> gonna<00:01:27.659> get<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.080> because

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
but you're never gonna get it because

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.300 
but you're never gonna get it because
this<00:01:28.770> thing<00:01:29.040> might<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.490> slightly<00:01:30.180> askew<00:01:31.170> but

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.340 

just<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.430> make<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> reference<00:01:36.240> point<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:37.170> can

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
just to make a reference point we can

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.289 
just to make a reference point we can
get<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.590> level<00:01:37.950> at<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.250> point<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.850> we'll<00:01:39.090> use

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
get it level at one point and we'll use

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.249 
get it level at one point and we'll use
this<00:01:39.720> point<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:40.619> where<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.979> velbon<00:01:41.490> name<00:01:41.939> is

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
this point here where the velbon name is

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.399 
this point here where the velbon name is
and<00:01:43.259> what<00:01:43.470> I'm<00:01:43.560> gonna<00:01:43.740> do<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:45.380> score<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
and what I'm gonna do is just score a

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.330 
and what I'm gonna do is just score a
line<00:01:46.740> through<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.549> thing<00:01:47.850> here<00:01:48.409> there<00:01:49.409> and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
line through this thing here there and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.319 
line through this thing here there and
there<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.990> then<00:01:52.110> put<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> dot<00:01:52.649> there<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.490> there

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
there and then put a dot there and there

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.440 
there and then put a dot there and there
and<00:01:54.590> then<00:01:55.590> I'll<00:01:55.740> be<00:01:55.920> able<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.250> at<00:01:56.700> least<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.210> one

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
and then I'll be able to at least in one

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.609 
and then I'll be able to at least in one
aspect<00:01:58.110> I'll<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.189> get<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> spot<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.409> so<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.439> know

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
aspect I'll be I get a spot on so I know

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.429 
aspect I'll be I get a spot on so I know
it's<00:02:01.979> lined<00:02:02.250> up<00:02:02.490> perfect<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.869> all<00:02:04.049> set<00:02:04.320> up

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
it's lined up perfect if it's all set up

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.080 
it's lined up perfect if it's all set up
there<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.159> always<00:02:05.280> get<00:02:05.549> my<00:02:05.700> camera

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090
