00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.690
 hello people get to dark souls today 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.230
 show you a little panic method for 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.990
 Souls and first you have to open the gate 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.000
 have in the world in the painted value 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.770
 from areals so this shortcut you 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.369
 you have to forget something like that 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.029
 No 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.529
 you can see a lot of colors 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.560
 souls actually so I feel 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.040
 rich that actually has at the moment 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.059
 and yes it goes up here so I show 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.100
 Make a shortcut the best 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.170
 can open the canister so short 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.550
 in a small trick you have to do the fast 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.079
 Show role before I show 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.149
 you already times that place 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.820
 is necessary because you are much more 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.010
 Can pick up so much faster so you 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.809
 you have to sprint and so jump the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.520
 jump out and come to the corner 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.570
 means from here above from the edge 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.050
 jump is there who does not have to work out 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.879
 really start or best there 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.719
 then I just made it to her 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.189
 you just have to touch the corner perfectly 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.740
 and then you can then just the gate 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.780
 to do this 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.450
 and yes it is indeed best to something 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.970
 bonfire a little bit is the glass again 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.460
 it sounded like her again, and yes, she was her 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.689
 must harm about 300 to 400 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.960
 So at least I think so 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:30.200
 are strong 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.200
 picking the best could be pretty annoying 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.200
 You can now do it in front 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.950
 Before they get too funny this late 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.720
 You can simply wear carrier 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.980
 kill in one go 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.780
 for analyzing and running to the right 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.820
 best then see the three of you 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.370
 Already away, unfortunately, could be best once 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.900
 beat it and you harm yes 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.370
 So I hurt properly like war 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.680
 for every mod 500 souls always show 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.750
 the wires are running beautifully right now 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.480
 easy and there you can just every time 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.180
 the repeat 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.980
 and if he can get the mini 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.460
 So head has from the box of this 

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:14.380
 coast lives its head yet you get 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.300
 more souls for that and with the silver ring 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.940
 I think you can do more than that 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.620
 well that's the best way 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.700
 see to pick 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.370
 but since I have these two items 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.800
 I can not have you here unfortunately 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.180
 not show but maybe that is 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.190
 best way you see i have now 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:37.120
 get here about 6000 souls 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.260
 this short time and yes there is even 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.900
 then nothing more to say he goes again 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.370
 back to the bonfire snaps there completely 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.480
 short 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.750
 and then they will automatically all 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.300
 enemies are saved and up there again 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.750
 new ones are the weird grinders 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.680
 comes back and kills again 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.920
 always these little subjects kill them 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.019
 just you find yourself pretty annoying 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.800
 we are running and we are 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:11.050
 beat so careful these four had 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.200
 pretty much the sloppier there in front 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.080
 but they are back have 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.370
 just resolved and yes i hope so 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.100
 could help you with any 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.100
 ask to write and that I say poof
