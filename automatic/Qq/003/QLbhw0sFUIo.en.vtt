00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.140
 nobody 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.750
 I was studying in industrial school in 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:11.659
 pernambuco in reef uefs a course of 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.399
 solfejo sung with one more mario cance 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.479
 So who's in the orchestra? 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:16.700
 school 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.310
 After a long time I did not have my 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.990
 name is knowledge of what if it were a 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.690
 guitar a guitar never never caught 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.270
 Magano guitar to make those chords 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.970
 what do people do if you follow them? 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.520
 the planet only asks for one note at a time 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.759
 I would like to study harmony, feel 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.679
 harmony and then I told a guitar goes 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.450
 to study by the method of the planet I 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.810
 I liked music a lot and I studied 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.060
 some music did not have to 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.770
 intention to be a professional had a 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.670
 singer in my father who worked in the branch 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:53.030
 in a nightclub in reef and almost forced the 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.159
 to live and work 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.690
 with him and I started thus playing 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.690
 guitar in the night from pernambuco 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.560
 is 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:17.820
 the party expresses itself speaking of one of a 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.550
 way I think anyone plays equal to 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.800
 unless you want to avoid one and 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.050
 another finalist is in a way 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.520
 conscious but I think every box 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.710
 had your language 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.980
 Wish or not my difference was over 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.870
 It is striking as well as account 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.220
 perceptible after the year in the time of 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.590
 new quartet that we proposed 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.180
 had a philosophy to work 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.400
 when the new quartet that was 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.050
 besides the arrangements being Brazilian to 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.250
 people wanted to create a language of 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.860
 improvisation 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.320
 now it would also have to be Brazilian 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.320
 great promise but we listen to 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.440
 a lot of music said that I had to pay 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:02.160
 more attention to folklore and legend 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.530
 and was creating a mixture of 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.630
 fife than the phrase of Libya of other 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.020
 and the guitar players and other repentistas 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.540
 gonzaga compositions do not know 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.070
 that I erred and was creating a language 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.799
 which is not very clear on the 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.680
 quartet because the space is small for 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.959
 updates on the hard drive beat us 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.820
 develop this more in the 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.630
 unlocked quartet and no disc before 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.790
 childbirth does not have improvisations to compete 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:34.700
 with this type of language entronizations 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:36.760
 arms 800 dc but in transactions not 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.760
 Hmm 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.240
 in the hotel room marriott and guitar 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.400
 it is not 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.750
 I never stopped playing military and never 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.120
 I had nothing against 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.070
 and it was in this river have to march 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.100
 first a meeting and told me that 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.500
 had the empty chair with is the numeral 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.060
 the hill as if he had missed a 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.520
 commitment 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.440
 perhaps for this reason the confusion of the 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.500
 people never ask 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.850
 I would never say ideologically linked to 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.850
 It's too late 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.039
 all conceived is very difficult to 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.800
 you and found the baby was usually 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.870
 is delighted with it and is also 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.479
 wrong is just an instrument you can 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.280
 put your philosophy on it your way 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.750
 what do you want do you think if you are 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.690
 Brazilian if it is not 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:33.560
 metallica is an instrument in a 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:35.690
 poor does not have no opinion and 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.669
 Brazilian music of indycar not having 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.620
 We do not have Brazilian instruments. 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:42.229
 is in power in our realm in our 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.720
 case here we and so from there what is ours 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:47.770
 in so good it leave in the beginning things 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.770
 that are not our forests is not 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.770
 think
