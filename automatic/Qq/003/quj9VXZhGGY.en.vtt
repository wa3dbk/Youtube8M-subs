00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
 social media is a burden for an actor 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.760
 agree or disagree 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.650
 I have I have six statements and before 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.210
 say you agree or disagree 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.700
 count to 3 so you both 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.740
 at the same time a jump in saying 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.180
 talent is the same as blue eyes 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.320
 not care if you have it but what you do 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.699
 participate 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.640
 agree or disagree the two of you disagree 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.470
 yes disagree with the and we have a yes your best 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.420
 a lot of talented people what do you have 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.420
 done with the talent that you do the job 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.600
 can act to work extremely hard 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.550
 hard work and for example one 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.800
 teacher who died underneath us so 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.270
 both dosed to be a waiter 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.950
 teaches you that it goes all the way 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.629
 Anyone can have talents it goes 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.670
 about discipline and that is about 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.770
 dedication because many people who are in that 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.730
 who then want to go brand resources card 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.250
 at the bucket 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.020
 but does not work for everyone is 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.489
 then they have to go a lot of books 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.840
 read or in what way do you see then 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.910
 the work but those people then have 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.500
 so maybe not the talent you rub 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.149
 I do believe that there are already talent 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.280
 otherwise it makes no sense 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.200
 and part of that talent is that too 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.130
 that that unceasing passion and 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.750
 dedication 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.979
 you die the melo tree on the hill 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.299
 for example, says in first year 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.840
 is setting the stage jump 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.100
 to sit 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.380
 drives one together to choose 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.390
 now fine the empty room yes that something else 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.340
 can play then stab some we are 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.229
 finger because the door is not really 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.090
 once a terrible often one alone 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.100
 if you can do anything else after 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.350
 mathijsen your case both parents who 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.640
 were not already busy in the film trade 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.140
 it is already there for you 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.240
 to do that naturally 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.280
 to go further in it or in the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.970
 indeed in a kind of weird way 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.549
 rolled in 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.920
 and because of that I had to go really fast 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.750
 work to keep the trunk under why 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.479
 I go asylum for a long time 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.340
 naturally and then you might go 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.619
 Acting on your talent because you all don't 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.729
 have you back for that too because you say 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.869
 from both parents and they are anyway 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.790
 working on the 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.829
 or create a film series and then go 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.570
 actually there to also further 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.440
 you do not feel a certain pressure we do not 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.600
 thereby me 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.830
 or blast through which I submit myself and 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.440
 I also have Maastricht 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.050
 theater academy yea boulder need hard 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.850
 what alina says what what am I doing 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.760
 actually why we behind it oh 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.980
 yes i have until now am and alina in you 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.780
 case when you find out ok me 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.310
 have a talent people say that against 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.810
 me but now I'm really my job the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.340
 I actually already knew about it 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.080
 when I was six then I felt that 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.280
 is what i am doing now so not why me 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.870
 I know they think of you give me 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.500
 service is just not so irena 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.900
 see 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.820
 order two a character without 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.270
 development is not interesting to 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.040
 play 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.570
 three two one owner and i went find it 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.000
 some extras very cool because they 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.560
 the love for me is very colorful 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.540
 not necessarily development but it 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.740
 going kind of extreme 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.900
 to color 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.290
 to give the story more color so that 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.670
 the so that the main character are 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.830
 development through and through so through a 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.490
 stay color or they will ever be mine 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.870
 create you 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.000
 contrast for the main character you 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.270
 referred to it as Wingman's kind 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.590
 it is extremely large large color preferably 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.910
 development but you have to 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.860
 I do not develop inside that can 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.290
 maybe a scene or something like that 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.480
 where your character can be extremely extreme 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.459
 bet another minute from which actor 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.200
 wanting to be boring and a wingman both 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.160
 link when will i I have a party 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.140
 to become 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.480
 because would you want an actor yourself? 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.430
 want to play a role in which you 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.890
 actually only one color has a little 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.490
 developments with seems to me quite that 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.520
 seems very nice 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.200
 now happy to do I now think of like 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.730
 do not know if he does have development 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.220
 go through development again but think 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.540
 to brad pitt in burn after reading that 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.040
 I find example the characters with a 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.470
 extreme 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.360
 color is the extreme character and that 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.650
 he doesn't have to really do that for me 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.090
 in development by it seems that find 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.820
 I am very funny to look at 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.100
 so in short you would dare to put yourself up 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.180
 sacrifice for playing the lead role in it 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.980
 as may choose 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.840
 I 'd rather play a character quite a bit 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.180
 many different parts you bring it 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.440
 whole spectrum than experienced but this is 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.750
 very often with my home that is often 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.850
 the supporting roles are interesting 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.440
 film because in many with you the leading 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.940
 lady on the leading him and is beautiful and 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.040
 with whom the audience has to go so that is 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.750
 often some natural things in it 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.290
 its the evil witch's price 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.090
 to speak 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.250
 even though you sometimes have a conservatory or 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.320
 she can indeed do that and that is free 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.580
 right then can be very fun to do 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.170
 when this film was my character 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.040
 also no extreme development by anyway 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.780
 I like doing it 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.040
 okay because then I will actually join the 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.200
 next one 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.500
 the third empathy statement for one 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:30.780
 character is more important than sympathy 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.780
 3d 115 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.720
 well i think in the oil feet often 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.490
 otherwise it is thought that is how one 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.810
 movie stars just love it there 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.670
 sympathetic character to play 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.660
 because they are busy with being there 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.400
 not acting 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.870
 I really don't like sympathy 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.390
 interesting I also have a stage actor 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.070
 sorry say no to the audience because of this 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.500
 continue to love me then 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.300
 the boost and leg dealer shared a bike 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.220
 she's right for now I don't want this I think 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.080
 as unsafe as people with that sort of thing 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.520
 Things are busy how can you still do everything 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.440
 show yourself whatever you do 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.690
 every role in the for you before that 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.830
 therefore dependent 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.660
 while you prefer as an actor 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.920
 would like to feel independent so that 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.720
 keep you close to yourself 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.540
 I do not I want the glory v themselves 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.640
 that the public should be allowed to mine 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.760
 I just want to be busy even playing 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.280
 I a horrible one 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.200
 fire me to the bone 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.090
 Defend Man Only Duncan Audience 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.890
 face difficult ones 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.690
 things in the world and start thinking 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.160
 such as empathy 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.860
 sympathy but not even empathy 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.900
 People might also allowed me 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.900
 subscribe to your mother as being 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.000
 for example, put it on your character 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.270
 empathy in your role from boys 7 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.310
 I myself by a moment ago 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.870
 to see from whom is this these women 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.520
 yes what do I have with that and filmer this was 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.260
 also not a huge role for me to study 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.600
 this was something that we are close to myself 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.190
 and that it is nicer to my amazon 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.750
 I tell your mother if you need an actor 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:56.490
 don't take yourself so seriously but you 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:06:02.780
 fuck as many as three two one eat, eat or host 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.780
 yes, once for a long time, full growth 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.030
 another one because to finish this alone is 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.560
 that's a one need to explain this or 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.030
 or no statement are just jerk 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.310
 stars but what I find interesting 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.780
 is well i am myself i have a youtube 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.930
 channel a lot of factory with him 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.490
 social media is my work and then 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.840
 I noticed that you have an interview app 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.400
 put I actually do I have none 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.170
 facebook page I met on twitter 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.690
 but find your alina'll come find 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.880
 So the statement is social media is one 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.360
 burden for an actor agree or disagree 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.380
 online space I don't necessarily have it now 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.220
 something against it 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.190
 but I find it a bit myself 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.680
 confusing or honest i notice that 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.720
 I find it annoying if maybe 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.230
 I if I don't because 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.610
 actor and but anime you are you are 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.960
 then this one but i am i want some 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.640
 actually it's an action or not one 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.780
 absolutely do not have to because then it goes 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.120
 He also didn't do well if this wasn't 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.860

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.730

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.970
 I like it on twitter I find it 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.830

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:09.720
 only it was performing puppet for 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.370

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.240

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.340
 think about laughing or there so me 

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.570
 definitely use it to advertise 

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.650
