relax channel I've been pondering on the
idea<00:00:07.470> of<00:00:07.740> replacing<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:09.269> old<00:00:09.510> blah<00:00:09.929> fan<00:00:10.320> motor

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
lot of arm power the day we have to take

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.560 
lot of arm power the day we have to take
it<00:00:22.740> up<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.890> 100<00:00:23.189> volts<00:00:23.490> in<00:00:23.609> it's<00:00:23.789> like<00:00:24.029> spinning

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
it up to 100 volts in it's like spinning

like crazy anyell arm air I've our fully
disassembled<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:33.750> fan<00:00:34.079> blade<00:00:34.410> system

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
disassembled the the fan blade system

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.360 
disassembled the the fan blade system
from<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.640> fan<00:00:36.390> units<00:00:36.930> from<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.920> motor

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
from the fan units from the motor

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.900 
from the fan units from the motor
spindle<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.300> looks<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:40.020> all<00:00:40.170> worn<00:00:40.559> out

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
spindle that looks to be all worn out

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.580 
spindle that looks to be all worn out
the<00:00:41.910> commutator<00:00:42.809> metal<00:00:43.739> pieces<00:00:43.980> are<00:00:44.460> like

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
the commutator metal pieces are like

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.650 
the commutator metal pieces are like
pretty<00:00:46.590> well<00:00:46.770> fuse<00:00:47.100> together<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.420> would<00:00:48.539> be

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
pretty well fuse together so it would be

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.510 
pretty well fuse together so it would be
probably<00:00:48.960> shorts<00:00:49.469> under<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.890> inhibit<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
probably shorts under it inhibit the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.060 
probably shorts under it inhibit the
performance<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> motor<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.719> believe<00:00:52.199> or

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
performance of the motor I believe or

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.790 
performance of the motor I believe or
make<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.579> not<00:00:53.760> work<00:00:54.000> at<00:00:54.210> all<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.899> yeah<00:00:55.559> I've

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
make it not work at all and yeah I've

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.500 
make it not work at all and yeah I've
removed<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.190> fan<00:00:56.430> blade<00:00:56.730> I'm<00:00:57.059> sort<00:00:57.480> of

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
removed the fan blade I'm sort of

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.979 
removed the fan blade I'm sort of
looking<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.140> good<00:00:58.949> shaft<00:00:59.789> system<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.539> stick

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
looking for a good shaft system to stick

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.130 
looking for a good shaft system to stick
it<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.250> 92<00:01:02.250> some<00:01:02.460> our<00:01:02.640> connector<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.300> this

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
it on 92 some our connector to this

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.219 
it on 92 some our connector to this
motor<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:05.330> somehow<00:01:06.330> fix<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:08.060> to<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
motor and somehow fix that to the to the

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.490 
motor and somehow fix that to the to the
fan<00:01:10.229> blade<00:01:10.560> hood<00:01:10.890> system<00:01:12.320> which<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.470> course

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
fan blade hood system which of course

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.149 
fan blade hood system which of course
would<00:01:14.119> concentrate<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.890> cool<00:01:16.890> air<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:19.009> to<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
would concentrate the cool air to to the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.890 
would concentrate the cool air to to the
side<00:01:20.460> exit<00:01:21.150> area<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.799> blight<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.900> valves

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
side exit area and blight to the valves

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.359 
side exit area and blight to the valves
and<00:01:26.150> also<00:01:27.150> blow<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.259> air<00:01:28.530> forward<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
and also blow the air forward to the

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.980 
and also blow the air forward to the
power<00:01:32.369> transformer<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> inside<00:01:33.780> that

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
power transformer on the inside that

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.100 
power transformer on the inside that
enclosure<00:01:34.530> inside<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.600> power<00:01:36.600> supply<00:01:36.780> units

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
enclosure inside the power supply units

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.300 
enclosure inside the power supply units
anyway<00:01:40.939> yeah<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:41.970> found<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.600> rod<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.619> decently

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
anyway yeah I found a rod that decently

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.840 
anyway yeah I found a rod that decently
fits<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.720> arm<00:01:45.960> fixed<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.189> with<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.490> little

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
fits this is arm fixed on with a little

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.679 
fits this is arm fixed on with a little
grub<00:01:48.420> screw<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> inside<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.240> connects

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
grub screw on the inside so it connects

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.440 
grub screw on the inside so it connects
quite<00:01:52.020> well

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.690 

and<00:01:56.450> I<00:01:56.720> reckon<00:01:56.960> all<00:01:57.080> probably<00:01:57.830> source<00:01:58.340> section

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
and I reckon all probably source section

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.399 
and I reckon all probably source section

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
came from a laser print I believe this

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.540 
came from a laser print I believe this

back<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.269> clone<00:02:20.480> modem<00:02:20.840> sooo<00:02:21.050> very<00:02:21.790> i<00:02:22.790> can

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
back to clone modem sooo very i can

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.479 
back to clone modem sooo very i can
power<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.080> up<00:02:24.170> a<00:02:24.319> bit<00:02:24.349> to<00:02:24.500> show<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.980> how<00:02:25.400> much

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
power it up a bit to show you how much

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.440 
power it up a bit to show you how much
parrot<00:02:26.390> has<00:02:27.850> obvious<00:02:28.850> that<00:02:29.030> has<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.300> have<00:02:29.420> a

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
parrot has obvious that has to have a

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.440 
parrot has obvious that has to have a
lot<00:02:29.600> of<00:02:29.630> power<00:02:29.959> so<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:31.400> vacuum<00:02:31.790> cleaner<00:02:31.940> can

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
lot of power so the vacuum cleaner can

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.580 
lot of power so the vacuum cleaner can
totally<00:02:33.110> suck<00:02:34.900> because<00:02:35.900> obviously<00:02:36.110> you<00:02:36.440> want

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
totally suck because obviously you want

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.470 
totally suck because obviously you want
a<00:02:36.650> vacuum<00:02:37.069> cleaner<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:37.519> really<00:02:37.880> sucks<00:02:40.480> good

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
a vacuum cleaner that really sucks good

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.759 
a vacuum cleaner that really sucks good
of<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.920> bad<00:02:42.920> joke<00:02:42.950> there<00:02:44.380> anyway<00:02:45.380> i'm<00:02:45.530> just

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
of a bad joke there anyway i'm just

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.520 
of a bad joke there anyway i'm just
going<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.010> connect<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.549> mains<00:02:47.180> leads<00:02:47.660> i<00:02:48.110> have

mark free power supply and the other i
think<00:03:48.170> i'll<00:03:48.290> probably<00:03:48.470> have<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.709> put<00:03:49.459> a<00:03:49.489> log<00:03:49.819> i

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
think i'll probably have to put a log i

think i'll probably have to put a log i
have<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:50.930> work<00:03:51.140> out<00:03:51.410> what<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:52.099> RPM<00:03:52.819> speed<00:03:53.030> of

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
have to work out what the RPM speed of

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.050 
have to work out what the RPM speed of
this<00:03:53.510> load<00:03:53.959> is<00:03:54.290> ends<00:03:54.819> work<00:03:55.819> out<00:03:56.120> how<00:03:56.660> many

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
this load is ends work out how many

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.970 
this load is ends work out how many
volts<00:03:59.060> so<00:03:59.359> i<00:03:59.420> need<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.690> put<00:03:59.989> in<00:04:00.200> this<00:04:00.349> to<00:04:00.650> make

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
volts so i need to put in this to make

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.970 
volts so i need to put in this to make
it<00:04:01.280> run<00:04:01.609> at<00:04:01.760> about<00:04:01.940> 2,500<00:04:02.709> like<00:04:03.709> I'm<00:04:03.829> gonna

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
it run at about 2,500 like I'm gonna

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.270 
it run at about 2,500 like I'm gonna
probably<00:04:04.400> run<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:04.700> bit<00:04:04.940> well<00:04:05.510> on<00:04:05.720> that<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:06.280> the

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
probably run a bit well on that the the

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.640 
probably run a bit well on that the the
faster<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.120> blows<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.690> more<00:04:08.900> cooler<00:04:09.290> the

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
faster it blows the more cooler the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.349 
faster it blows the more cooler the
electronics<00:04:10.609> will<00:04:10.849> be<00:04:11.500> but<00:04:12.500> yeah<00:04:13.359> doesn't

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
electronics will be but yeah doesn't

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.439 
electronics will be but yeah doesn't
need<00:04:14.569> a<00:04:14.599> lot<00:04:14.840> of<00:04:14.900> volts<00:04:15.410> to<00:04:15.709> run<00:04:16.310> it<00:04:16.489> very<00:04:17.120> arm

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
need a lot of volts to run it very arm

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:22.270 
need a lot of volts to run it very arm
high<00:04:17.750> speed<00:04:19.510> any<00:04:20.510> out<00:04:20.660> hopefully<00:04:21.590> be<00:04:22.010> a<00:04:22.039> way<00:04:22.250> I

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
high speed any out hopefully be a way I

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.089 
high speed any out hopefully be a way I
can<00:04:22.430> I<00:04:23.169> can<00:04:24.169> assemble<00:04:24.590> this<00:04:24.860> merger<00:04:25.550> with<00:04:25.880> the

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
can I can assemble this merger with the

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:31.920 
can I can assemble this merger with the
fan<00:04:28.099> hood<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:28.789> the<00:04:29.260> fan<00:04:30.260> blade<00:04:30.590> system<00:04:30.950> and

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
fan hood and the fan blade system and

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.430 
fan hood and the fan blade system and
it'd<00:04:32.930> be<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.320> good<00:04:33.770> replacement<00:04:34.010> for<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.820> old

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
it'd be a good replacement for the old

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.740 
it'd be a good replacement for the old
motor<00:04:36.440> that's<00:04:36.889> pretty<00:04:37.550> well<00:04:37.820> stuffed<00:04:40.750> yeah

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
motor that's pretty well stuffed yeah

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.690 
motor that's pretty well stuffed yeah
I'm<00:04:42.050> not<00:04:42.200> sure<00:04:42.560> if<00:04:42.710> this<00:04:42.860> murder<00:04:43.550> is

I'm not sure if this murder is
repairable<00:04:44.570> or<00:04:44.840> not<00:04:45.080> I<00:04:45.470> don't<00:04:46.099> know<00:04:46.450> if<00:04:47.450> the

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
repairable or not I don't know if the

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.779 
repairable or not I don't know if the
