hey<00:00:00.690> guys<00:00:00.870> so<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:01.560> next<00:00:01.770> organism<00:00:02.490> that<00:00:02.580> I

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
hey guys so the next organism that I

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.070 
hey guys so the next organism that I
want<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.879> talk<00:00:03.030> about<00:00:03.210> is<00:00:03.570> something<00:00:03.870> called

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
want to talk about is something called

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.680 
want to talk about is something called
Mycobacterium<00:00:04.500> marinum<00:00:05.390> which<00:00:06.390> is

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
Mycobacterium marinum which is

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.089 
Mycobacterium marinum which is
responsible<00:00:07.049> for<00:00:07.410> something<00:00:07.890> called

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
responsible for something called

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.209 
responsible for something called
aquarium<00:00:08.730> granuloma<00:00:09.420> in<00:00:09.809> humans<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.500> it

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
aquarium granuloma in humans and it

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.250 
aquarium granuloma in humans and it
causes<00:00:11.460> fish<00:00:11.940> tuberculosis<00:00:12.900> in<00:00:13.309> fish<00:00:15.260> so

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
causes fish tuberculosis in fish so

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.050 
causes fish tuberculosis in fish so
Mycobacterium<00:00:17.160> marinum<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> free-living

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
Mycobacterium marinum is a free-living

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.060 
Mycobacterium marinum is a free-living
bacteria<00:00:18.359> that's<00:00:19.140> found<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.560> fresh<00:00:19.800> and

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
bacteria that's found in fresh and

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.910 
bacteria that's found in fresh and
saltwater<00:00:20.600> and<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:21.960> what<00:00:22.170> happens<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.800> can

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
saltwater and so what happens is it can

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.310 
saltwater and so what happens is it can
infect<00:00:23.279> fish<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.449> actually<00:00:24.630> can<00:00:25.019> cause

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
infect fish and it actually can cause

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.339 
infect fish and it actually can cause
opportunistic<00:00:26.130> infections<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:26.820> humans<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.449> in

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
opportunistic infections in humans so in

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.859 
opportunistic infections in humans so in
fish<00:00:28.849> Mycobacterium<00:00:29.849> marinum<00:00:29.880> like<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.660> said

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
fish Mycobacterium marinum like I said

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.560 
fish Mycobacterium marinum like I said
is<00:00:30.960> responsible<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:31.560> fish<00:00:32.009> TB<00:00:32.520> or<00:00:32.790> wasting

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
is responsible for fish TB or wasting

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.400 
is responsible for fish TB or wasting
disease<00:00:34.489> so<00:00:35.489> because<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.270> meronym<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> free

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
disease so because a meronym is a free

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.530 
disease so because a meronym is a free
living<00:00:37.649> organism<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.820> doesn't<00:00:39.149> require<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
living organism and doesn't require a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.869 
living organism and doesn't require a
host<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.110> survive<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:41.160> freely<00:00:41.399> live<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.790> an

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
host to survive can freely live in an

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.369 
host to survive can freely live in an
aquarium<00:00:42.329> or<00:00:42.420> other<00:00:42.570> body<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.899> water<00:00:42.989> without

aquarium or other body of water without
any<00:00:43.680> problem<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:45.149> humans<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.960> meronym

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
any problem and in humans a meronym

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.380 
any problem and in humans a meronym
infection<00:00:47.280> typically<00:00:47.820> occurs<00:00:48.120> following

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
infection typically occurs following

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.709 
infection typically occurs following
skin<00:00:49.050> or<00:00:49.200> soft<00:00:49.410> tissue<00:00:49.680> injury<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.449> then<00:00:51.449> what

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
skin or soft tissue injury and then what

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.529 
skin or soft tissue injury and then what
happens<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.559> person<00:00:52.890> exposes<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.059> open

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
happens is a person exposes this open

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.170 
happens is a person exposes this open
area<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.610> an<00:00:56.610> aquatic<00:00:57.440> environment<00:00:58.640> that<00:00:59.640> has

area to an aquatic environment that has

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.510 
area to an aquatic environment that has
this<00:01:00.629> bacteria<00:01:01.260> living<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> or<00:01:01.980> has<00:01:02.160> fish

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520

infected<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.239> em<00:01:03.420> meronym<00:01:03.930> living<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.680> it

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
infected with em meronym living in it

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.510 
infected with em meronym living in it
and<00:01:05.570> what<00:01:06.570> happens<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.860> bacteria<00:01:08.369> then

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
and what happens is this bacteria then

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.440 
and what happens is this bacteria then
gains<00:01:08.820> access<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> skin<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:11.450> typically

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
gains access to the skin and typically

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.859 
gains access to the skin and typically
people<00:01:13.350> will<00:01:14.130> get<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.490> infection<00:01:15.150> during

then<00:02:17.010> progress<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:18.240> larger<00:02:19.850> purple<00:02:20.850> nodule

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
then progress to a larger purple nodule

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.170 
then progress to a larger purple nodule
and<00:02:22.100> these<00:02:23.100> lesions<00:02:23.310> are<00:02:23.640> most<00:02:23.820> commonly

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
and these lesions are most commonly

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.270 
and these lesions are most commonly
found<00:02:24.240> on<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.690> elbows<00:02:25.110> fingers<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.920> backs<00:02:26.100> of

found on the elbows fingers and backs of

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.670 
found on the elbows fingers and backs of
the<00:02:26.370> hand<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.810> makes<00:02:28.020> sense<00:02:28.140> because

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
the hand and this makes sense because

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.200 
the hand and this makes sense because
these<00:02:28.860> are<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.100> areas<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.520> are<00:02:29.820> most<00:02:29.940> likely

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
these are the areas that are most likely

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.970 
these are the areas that are most likely
to<00:02:30.420> come<00:02:30.570> in<00:02:30.690> contact<00:02:30.900> with<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.530> aquarium

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
to come in contact with the aquarium

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.160 
to come in contact with the aquarium
water<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.520> fish<00:02:32.760> when<00:02:33.300> someone's<00:02:33.630> doing<00:02:33.900> tank

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
maintenance when some people these

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.380

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
nodules can actually break down and then

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.760 
nodules can actually break down and then
they<00:02:39.570> can<00:02:39.750> become<00:02:39.870> secondarily<00:02:40.530> infected

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
they can become secondarily infected

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.530 
they can become secondarily infected
because<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.640> patient<00:02:41.970> will<00:02:42.060> be<00:02:42.090> walking

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
because the patient will be walking

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.080

should isolate them in a quarantine tank
so<00:05:20.310> that<00:05:20.460> they<00:05:20.580> can<00:05:20.730> be<00:05:20.850> treated<00:05:21.290> and

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
so that they can be treated and

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.380 
so that they can be treated and
specifically<00:05:23.010> if<00:05:23.220> you<00:05:23.370> suspect<00:05:23.820> fish<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.210> be

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
specifically if you suspect fish to be

TB in any of your fish that are meant
for<00:05:26.760> human<00:05:27.240> consumption<00:05:27.660> such<00:05:28.110> as<00:05:28.260> in

for human consumption such as in

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.220 
for human consumption such as in
aquaponics<00:05:29.300> you<00:05:30.300> obviously<00:05:30.660> should<00:05:30.840> not<00:05:30.990> eat

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
aquaponics you obviously should not eat

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.380 
aquaponics you obviously should not eat
them<00:05:31.440> and<00:05:31.620> you<00:05:32.280> need<00:05:32.400> to<00:05:32.520> be<00:05:32.610> careful<00:05:33.060> with

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
them and you need to be careful with

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.680 
them and you need to be careful with
adding<00:05:34.260> fish<00:05:34.470> medications<00:05:35.130> to<00:05:35.910> tank<00:05:36.270> because

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
adding fish medications to tank because

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.830 
adding fish medications to tank because
some<00:05:37.290> of<00:05:37.320> these<00:05:37.530> contain<00:05:38.310> some<00:05:38.840> substances

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
some of these contain some substances

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.690 
some of these contain some substances
that<00:05:39.990> are<00:05:40.050> carcinogenic<00:05:40.860> and<00:05:41.100> toxic<00:05:41.580> to

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
that are carcinogenic and toxic to

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.930 
that are carcinogenic and toxic to
humans<00:05:42.090> I<00:05:43.050> also<00:05:43.500> think<00:05:43.770> it's<00:05:43.890> a<00:05:44.310> good<00:05:44.640> idea<00:05:44.760> to

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
humans I also think it's a good idea to

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.550 
humans I also think it's a good idea to
not<00:05:45.210> eat<00:05:45.480> any<00:05:45.690> vegetables<00:05:46.260> that<00:05:46.350> have<00:05:46.470> been

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
not eat any vegetables that have been

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.230 
not eat any vegetables that have been
exposed<00:05:47.070> to<00:05:47.220> water<00:05:47.430> that<00:05:47.730> contains<00:05:48.090> this

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
exposed to water that contains this

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.990 
exposed to water that contains this
pathogen<00:05:49.010> because<00:05:50.010> there<00:05:50.190> are<00:05:50.310> case<00:05:50.550> reports

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
pathogen because there are case reports

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.360 
pathogen because there are case reports
of<00:05:51.120> gastrointestinal<00:05:52.370> Mycobacterium
