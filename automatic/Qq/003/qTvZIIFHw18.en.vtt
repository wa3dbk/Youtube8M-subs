00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello how about youtube friends this 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:10.290
 video is directed to those people 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.929
 who have used windows for years 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.240
 have jumped to use what is a 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.680
 mac and especially for those who are 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.600
 beginners for those who are already 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.869
 experts because they waste their time in this 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.820
 video very good friends then I what they 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.269
 I recommend what I would have liked to know 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.580
 when I started using to use my macbook 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.250
 for the first time is how to download 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.690
 free applications because as 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.239
 You already saw it, because here is the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.399
 app store that is the store of apple 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.090
 where you can download all the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.059
 applications but they have some like 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.340
 this one for example that they are pretty good 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:51.180
 I have nothing to say against 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.550
 its price because really no no no 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.010
 anyone has access to them 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.809
 true not because having a mistress means 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.699
 that you have enough resources to 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.260
 be throwing away your money in 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.210
 applications that are good but that 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.400
 end of accounts 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.130
