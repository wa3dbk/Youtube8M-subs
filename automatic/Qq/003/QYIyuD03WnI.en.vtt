00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.380 
it's good yeah so I just leg it after it
and<00:03:56.220> I'm<00:03:56.280> trying<00:03:56.580> to<00:03:56.610> get<00:03:56.790> as<00:03:56.910> close<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.360> as

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
and I'm trying to get as close to it as

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.600 
and I'm trying to get as close to it as
possible<00:03:57.510> and<00:04:00.500> it's<00:04:01.500> up<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.830> tree<00:04:02.010> at<00:04:02.100> 30<00:04:02.340> feet

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
possible and it's up the tree at 30 feet

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:11.090 
possible and it's up the tree at 30 feet
within<00:04:02.850> a<00:04:03.030> second<00:04:09.680> yeah<00:04:10.680> they're<00:04:10.890> great

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
within a second yeah they're great

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.640 
within a second yeah they're great
there's<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.730> snake<00:04:12.140> there's<00:04:13.140> another<00:04:15.650> these

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
there's the snake there's another these

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.050 
there's the snake there's another these
are<00:04:16.710> considered<00:04:17.160> rare<00:04:17.340> in<00:04:17.489> Thailand<00:04:17.850> yeah

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
are considered rare in Thailand yeah

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.539 
are considered rare in Thailand yeah
because<00:04:19.020> the<00:04:19.110> or<00:04:19.230> NASA<00:04:19.470> kind<00:04:19.860> of<00:04:19.950> dominates

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
because the or NASA kind of dominates

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.990 
because the or NASA kind of dominates
the<00:04:20.880> em<00:04:21.650> dominates<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.800> area<00:04:22.830> one<00:04:23.340> well<00:04:23.850> in

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
the em dominates the area one well in

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.910 
the em dominates the area one well in
areas<00:04:24.360> so<00:04:24.630> look<00:04:24.780> at<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:25.050> how<00:04:25.140> black<00:04:25.440> how<00:04:25.890> black

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
areas so look at it how black how black

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.670 
areas so look at it how black how black
it<00:04:26.370> is<00:04:26.490> is<00:04:27.090> this<00:04:27.480> is<00:04:27.630> very<00:04:27.930> dark<00:04:28.200> compared<00:04:28.620> to

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
it is is this is very dark compared to

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.950 
it is is this is very dark compared to
you<00:04:28.970> that's<00:04:29.970> what<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.150> mean<00:04:30.360> it's<00:04:30.540> it's<00:04:30.780> almost

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
you that's what I mean it's it's almost

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.510 
you that's what I mean it's it's almost
like<00:04:31.200> black<00:04:31.350> we<00:04:31.590> should<00:04:31.740> why<00:04:31.920> don't<00:04:32.130> we<00:04:32.340> just

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
like black we should why don't we just

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.960 
like black we should why don't we just
taking<00:04:32.790> all<00:04:32.910> knots<00:04:33.150> around<00:04:33.300> comparison<00:04:34.970> we

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
taking all knots around comparison we

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.210 
taking all knots around comparison we
should<00:04:36.120> shoot<00:04:36.270> out<00:04:36.390> in<00:04:36.450> a<00:04:36.510> different<00:04:36.660> video

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
should shoot out in a different video

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.500 
should shoot out in a different video
let's<00:04:38.220> say<00:04:38.340> we<00:04:38.490> introduce<00:04:39.330> them<00:04:40.190> anyway

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
let's say we introduce them anyway

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.050 
let's say we introduce them anyway
that's<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:42.600> great<00:04:42.780> sign
