00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.000
 of the monument 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.600
 do Christians have such moments 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.450
 the muslims

 more than a century of treasured scriptures 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.500
 accepted by muslims 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.040

 even there is such a thing 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.070
 Abrahamic religion 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.870
 this is an idea that goes back to thieves 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.660
 and in this sense abrahamic 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.150

 recognized not only as told 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:14.569

 and people but muslims 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.039
 so the consumption of soldiers is quite 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.329
 rightly 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.400

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:34.049
 lord jesus christ god 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.899
 they recognize him as a prophet 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:39.239
 and if you will use hansen 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.049

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.159
 religious beliefs 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.989
 and then your prayers will not 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.519
 fit muslim 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.339
 traditions but will correspond 

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:03.339
 Of course Christian traditions 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:05.919

 you feel a presence in your 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.499
 a heart 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:20.769

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.429
