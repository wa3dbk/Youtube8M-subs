00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.999 
well so I make sure that she cuts out
extra<00:01:59.299> space<00:01:59.570> so<00:01:59.840> when<00:02:00.200> when<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.619> hair<00:02:00.799> grows

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.730 
extra space so when when the hair grows
out<00:02:01.159> is<00:02:01.430> not<00:02:01.869> overlapping<00:02:02.869> my<00:02:03.140> ear<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.500> kind

out is not overlapping my ear and kind

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.010 
out is not overlapping my ear and kind
of<00:02:03.829> sticking<00:02:04.250> out<00:02:04.369> like<00:02:05.060> that<00:02:05.119> now<00:02:05.659> for<00:02:05.929> the

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
of sticking out like that now for the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.539

top<00:02:06.200> of<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.380> hair<00:02:06.560> should<00:02:06.950> be<00:02:06.979> pretty<00:02:07.280> simple

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
top of the hair should be pretty simple

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.850 
top of the hair should be pretty simple
because<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:08.060> want<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.539> lot<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.780> length<00:02:08.959> so<00:02:09.259> the

main haircut should be focused on the
sides<00:02:11.870> in<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.110> back<00:02:12.200> that's<00:02:12.920> grabbing<00:02:13.220> have

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
but not too much you don't overdo it

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:06.789 
but not too much you don't overdo it
we're<00:03:05.450> going<00:03:05.569> on<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.930> back<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.620> don't

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
really know how to film this because I

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.780 
really know how to film this because I
can't<00:03:08.389> really<00:03:08.829> show<00:03:09.829> you<00:03:09.859> and<00:03:10.250> talk<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.459> you<00:03:10.670> at

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.940 
can't really show you and talk to you at
the<00:03:10.850> same<00:03:11.000> time<00:03:11.060> but<00:03:11.569> as<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:11.959> can<00:03:12.049> see<00:03:12.260> it's<00:03:12.560> at

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
the same time but as you can see it's at

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.949 
the same time but as you can see it's at
the<00:03:13.280> back<00:03:13.459> it's<00:03:13.670> match<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:14.030> size<00:03:14.239> like<00:03:14.600> I<00:03:14.750> said

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
the back it's match the size like I said

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.099 
the back it's match the size like I said
earlier<00:03:15.290> in<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.650> video<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:16.540> what<00:03:17.540> else<00:03:17.780> I'm

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
earlier in the video and what else I'm

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.229 
earlier in the video and what else I'm
here<00:03:18.170> something<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:18.829> I<00:03:18.859> wanted<00:03:19.549> to<00:03:19.609> do<00:03:19.880> it's

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
here something that I wanted to do it's

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.340 
here something that I wanted to do it's
another<00:03:20.510> comes<00:03:20.870> down<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.170> personal

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
another comes down to personal

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.289 
another comes down to personal
preference<00:03:21.709> again<00:03:22.069> but<00:03:22.250> I<00:03:22.340> have<00:03:22.549> a<00:03:22.790> little<00:03:23.180> bit

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
preference again but I have a little bit

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.979 
preference again but I have a little bit
of<00:03:23.389> hair<00:03:23.600> in<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.989> back<00:03:24.220> overlapping<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:26.810> back

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
of hair in the back overlapping the back

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.330 
of hair in the back overlapping the back
of<00:03:27.139> my<00:03:27.290> head<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.769> reason<00:03:27.859> for<00:03:28.160> this<00:03:28.280> is

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
of my head the reason for this is

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.220 
of my head the reason for this is
because<00:03:28.579> I<00:03:28.819> feel<00:03:29.000> like<00:03:29.180> if<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:29.600> take<00:03:29.780> out<00:03:29.989> all

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
because I feel like if you take out all

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.750 
because I feel like if you take out all
the<00:03:30.440> hair<00:03:30.590> in<00:03:30.769> the<00:03:30.799> back<00:03:30.889> and<00:03:31.459> you're<00:03:31.579> just

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
the hair in the back and you're just

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.020 
the hair in the back and you're just
left<00:03:31.940> with<00:03:32.060> this<00:03:32.480> hair<00:03:32.720> on<00:03:32.870> top<00:03:33.109> and<00:03:33.400> I<00:03:34.400> think

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
left with this hair on top and I think

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.580 
left with this hair on top and I think
that<00:03:35.209> we<00:03:35.389> know<00:03:35.540> a<00:03:35.569> little<00:03:35.690> bit<00:03:35.810> of<00:03:35.959> hair<00:03:36.170> gives

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
that we know a little bit of hair gives

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.410 
that we know a little bit of hair gives
a<00:03:36.709> nice<00:03:36.889> gradual<00:03:37.400> flow<00:03:37.670> from<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.030> length<00:03:38.239> of

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
a nice gradual flow from the length of

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.170 
a nice gradual flow from the length of
the<00:03:38.540> top

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
the top

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.630 
the top
absolutely<00:03:40.110> with<00:03:40.230> shortness<00:03:40.650> on<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.310> back<00:03:41.489> of

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
absolutely with shortness on the back of

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.280 
absolutely with shortness on the back of
your<00:03:41.790> head<00:03:41.939> so<00:03:42.180> that's<00:03:42.629> why<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.780> left<00:03:43.019> a<00:03:43.140> little

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
your head so that's why I left a little

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.710 
your head so that's why I left a little
bit<00:03:43.470> just<00:03:43.709> add<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.129> like<00:03:44.459> little<00:03:45.329> digression

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
bit just add that like little digression

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.470 
bit just add that like little digression
from<00:03:46.200> super<00:03:46.890> long<00:03:47.069> to<00:03:47.310> nothing<00:03:47.819> it'll<00:03:47.970> on<00:03:48.239> the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
from super long to nothing it'll on the

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.000 
from super long to nothing it'll on the
sides<00:03:48.689> it<00:03:48.870> doesn't<00:03:48.930> matter<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.560> think<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:49.860> looks

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
sides it doesn't matter I think it looks

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.979 
sides it doesn't matter I think it looks
a<00:03:50.159> bit<00:03:50.340> nicer<00:03:50.519> for<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.120> back<00:03:51.299> one<00:03:51.629> thing<00:03:51.840> that

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
a bit nicer for the back one thing that

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.330 
a bit nicer for the back one thing that
I<00:03:52.019> wish<00:03:52.200> was<00:03:52.409> done<00:03:52.590> differently<00:03:52.980> from<00:03:53.220> my

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
I wish was done differently from my

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.280 
I wish was done differently from my
haircut<00:03:53.610> is<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.450> neckline<00:03:54.780> right<00:03:55.049> here

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
haircut is the neckline right here

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.830 
haircut is the neckline right here

here<00:04:34.169> so<00:04:34.320> instead<00:04:34.560> of<00:04:34.710> just<00:04:34.919> a<00:04:35.010> straight<00:04:35.220> cut

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
here so instead of just a straight cut

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.159 
here so instead of just a straight cut
off<00:04:35.639> like<00:04:35.789> what<00:04:35.940> I've<00:04:36.060> got<00:04:36.210> right<00:04:36.419> now<00:04:36.449> I<00:04:36.870> wish

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.510 
off like what I've got right now I wish
that<00:04:37.320> there<00:04:37.470> was<00:04:37.560> a<00:04:37.620> gradual<00:04:38.099> fade<00:04:38.789> up<00:04:40.370> to<00:04:41.370> make

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
that there was a gradual fade up to make

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.100 
that there was a gradual fade up to make
it<00:04:41.639> look<00:04:41.729> a<00:04:41.759> bit<00:04:41.849> more<00:04:41.970> natural<00:04:42.300> rather<00:04:42.810> than

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
it look a bit more natural rather than

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.570
