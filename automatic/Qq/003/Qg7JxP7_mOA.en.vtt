00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.570
 in this video I'll show you a bit of 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:19.320
 graphology that from the letter to people 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.570
 can analyze the personality 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.769
 the personality traits of any 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.369
 person 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.369
 grah hulu day 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:37.610
 for example if a person has the letter 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.610
 too small 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.930
 this means that a person 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.930
 concentrated 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.400
 and has modesty 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.500
 now that letter is big 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:22.830
 demonstrates that it is to have a leader now 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.640
 this person write with force have said 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.640
 who writes like this 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:43.440
 When a person writes strong means 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:57.740
 determination good thing when you write 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:57.740
 very weak means shyness shyness 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:13.790
 now the slope of the letter when it is 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:13.790
 inclined so that the loss is so 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:21.170
 means that the person is probably 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.170
