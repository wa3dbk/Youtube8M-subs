00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.800
 but only recently has it also been equipped with a start-stop automatic 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:12.369

 outwardly, there were no changes 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.179
 the Freelander 2 still presents itself in the modern sube 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:43.400
 which clearly likes to show off-road 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.999
 the similarity to its predecessor is great 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:49.569
 The peace in the 2 can be only on the second or third view of the

 as soon as the traffic light turns green and the clutch to engage the first gear 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.730

 the engine starts and the drive can continue 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.320
 In addition, the driver in eco-mode is the important point for upshifting
