00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.360
 Well the other thing last night I was flipping around my TV 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.609
 I came across the show called the preachers 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.139
 L This exhibition is outrageous 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.910
 I sucked perfectly, and I'm gonna be watching more episodes is 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:13.730
 unbelievable 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.390
 They show up where they track about six different 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.710
 I'm preachers in Los Angeles 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.130
 Most of them have a ton of money that drive the flashy cars there is this kind of 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.230
 Almost preacher type preachers check out a little preview of the show 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.779
 Here 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.370
 The populist embassy is a reasonable task 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.680
 Send a commission in the name of Jesus and the presence of Shin can be broken 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.719
 You have to be broken Go the shot you've got got enough We went 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.899
 Ask we believe to heal your wounds 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.390
 The power and grace of the body touches the making of holes using the Lord Jesus 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.070
 Morning forgive me for my sins forgive anything I believe. 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.860
 I believe that in Jesus Christ his brethren died for my sins 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.560
 In Jesus I tell you that He said 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.530
 I am a believer 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.330
 Guangxi only me 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.360
 She also 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.420
 Lost: 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.830
 -t 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.990
 When he is worshiped by the Bishop of Ron Gibson 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.120
 On the zip for Macomb 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.920
 The prime minister is television hacks 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.979
 And when my name is Jay, my name is fog 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.610
 My name is Nolan Career 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.820
 This 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.840
 As I watched it 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.369
 I was just amazed by the things that were said 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.729
 People talk about how God came to them and told them to do certain things 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.330
 When one of the pastors before he has a child and he advice him says: 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.899
 Listen 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.840
 I think God uses your life really well 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.060
 I am one of the kids who want to be a singer 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.470
 My father asks the pastor if he can be whether he has a chance 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.880
 In being a successful worship singer my father says 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.130
 The opportunity has nothing to do with that whole thing how God wants to use you 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.209
 They wore white jackets and expensive cars 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.870
 There is one scene where I think one of the members has the Lewis Corn Man who 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.870
 Passes a name 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.480
 The head is like a big Christian and he hangs out with one of these priests 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.310
 They talk about 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.950
 Being a tattoo but being a Christian I 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.010
 It's amazing to me it almost seems to be 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.440
 Even in a casual conversation but the most amazing thing about me is Louis 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.079
 That these individuals are clearly very smart 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:55.049
 Excellent speakers I mean speech skills that are really envied 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.750
 Good quantity because they can play weeds with those skills 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.920
 Instead of just getting people to cry and 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.390
 Draw and put their hands up and yell Hula Lewis and give them tons of money 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.160
 by the way 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.660
 The quantity of these good men can be some of the best teachers in the world 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.690
 This is the level that they are in terms of speaking and speaking skills 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.140
 And persuasive skills but instead I mean 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.150
 They make a ton of money and that is probably why they did not do it 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.200
 Do this instead 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.260
 Maybe they think they are now doing a world of good maybe I think 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.780
 I think they really help people and I'm sure there are some people 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.060
 But it helps though I probably these people 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.350
 The tricked result is about how well it can be something strong and I'm confident 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.390
 They help people 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.590
 Watching the trailer this show really made it sound like 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.400
 Your arm was so unbiased that these guys might even try you 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.870
 Introduce you to know the bear lying exposed Wu and show what's going on behind 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.959

 Make it look a bit more humane and 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.800
 And I and she did look pretty interesting after the episode I saw 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.150
 It is not really 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.900
 Issue any kind of cash you have that kind of on your own 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.540
 Decide to cash because it was raw to do in this way is too 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.440
