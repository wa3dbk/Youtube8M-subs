00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.840
 Hmm 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:14.320
 I think that I want to make a mirror ball for a while . 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:19.390
 First of all, this illustrator is yes 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.880
 Little is it this kind of form and say it is the illustrator little whether've done what 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:26.120
 I made an infinite number of circles 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:30.950
 A great number of circles are made, but this is a mirror ball 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:33.170
 Well what the I is circular of texture Yes ne of adobe is this 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:38.770
 and I read the after effects normally 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:42.260
 It will be like this when placed in the timeline It's the next time I'm going to put an effect 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.980
 It's flat, so I usually round it 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.110
 Well I'm going to investigate CC There is a spear and put this a little 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.610
 Are 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:55.410
 Spear Let's Yes Then is I get along Kedomo is Tan was I look for star 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.280
 Now it's just round it's just round it's round 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.820
 Yes This two-hem Bosu 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.989
 That's right, cc glass is legal. 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.240
 By doing this , the texture that was a little flat is kinda 3d 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.110
 Than Well I think that comes into view 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.770
 It approached the mirror ball and became form 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.940
 Now it's next but it's new, isn't it? 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:22.870
 It's from the room with the adjustment layer 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:27.400
 9 Let's use from the generator rate of cc light rate 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:30.880
 This is just a bright path, in this form of light 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.760
 It is an effect that places and enhances Maten Plateau 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:39.330
 This is also included as a standard 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:44.430
 Yes we will continue to cough it is this cc light ray Well to various city 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:49.110
 For example, it's pretty bright to add 4 places that were in the lower right 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.830
 Now for this, let's add a light using 3d layers 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.210
 I will 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.370
 It's time to add the light just because the ball is not now in a 3d layer 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.320
 At first we do this 3 d layers 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.890
 And a little three spot lights 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.020
 Apply this way This is a normal spot 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.110
 Just this spot 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.740
 Pillar ball is on this cheek 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:18.350
 Yes, it is live of gyro with three various each sections 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:22.100
 So you can be issued a dramatic representation Well that was saying, due to be shed 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.180
 Tteyuu trouble of it is as one more little point effect Kedomo I'm light 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.770
 There is the 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.770
 Haie I This Is 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.870
 It is such a form, but my husband is amazing now, but by adjusting this 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.580
 Well then 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:45.069
 How light is attached to the light You can adjust such things, so a little more 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:48.489
 I think that is something those who want to from violently good day and go with what was said, 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:54.519
 Finally, to rotate this mirror ball 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:56.889
 Yes, it's a rotation here, it's starting from scratch from here, it seems like it's 20 seconds 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.489
 It is about 80 degrees 180 degrees rotation 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:03.770
 I will set in this way Yes by doing so 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:10.910
 It's the old y-axis that 's endured like this 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:12.500
 Because it opens nicely, it is headed. It expresses the reflection of light according to the rotation of light. 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.810
 I can do it again 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.930
 This it is better to be further been made a little three-dimensional reflection 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.010
 And I made those same I position is another one 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:28.800
 It is a composition of Ayuue 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:32.010
 From there, let's make something like this star-shaped thing or something like this 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.100
 Yes I made these things from effects 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.850
 This time is cc diet furnace 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.220
 It is this kind of form that is better adapted here 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.580
 A little 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.700
 Yes 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:52.330
 Make something like a reflection of lighting 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:57.510
 Also And that earlier also things and I three-dimensional reflection I was magic by configuring 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.510
 Please try by all means possible and the in be created
