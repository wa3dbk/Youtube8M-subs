 First I make my hair out of the

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.640

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.989
 the argentinian dark shadow in 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:01:00.070
 my eyes angle with a concealer 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.449
 by riva the loop in color 0 1 das 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.219
 Make up is very much a highlight though 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.000
 I still have a powder with me 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.500
 the prosa subsequently does not become spotty 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.570
 my eyebrows completely on with the 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.310
 brightest color from the eyebrow brother 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.350
 from eating this part of z alina shepherd 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.509
 has always been very edgy defined 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.159
 eyebrows rising very steeply 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.920
 I tried my eyebrows 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.360
 something to adapt to and the sick 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.200
 I still have a little bit 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.200
 is abolished 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.460
 now it's my eyes there I have 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:40.990
 an eyeshadow of avon in the color 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.329
 brown ra 271 with times gone back to 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:02:02.979

00:01:43.329 --> 00:02:05.619

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.360
 from all because the color 437 as 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:29.200
 eyeshadow and sat next to then in the 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:30.790
 Crease around the edge towards the outside 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.319
 I reinforce the eyes looked 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.260
 still with the concert of rival praise 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.120
 lightened 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.340
 I'm going to add a darker one now 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.319
 brown crease to I use the 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.480
 brown essens eyebrow palette and 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.950
 Good luck then used 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:03:01.709
 also a blender brush on the 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:03:03.269
 no color on it is now advertised 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.609
 again the brown color of the 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.680
 eyebrow set and pull lower and 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:30.989
 a line with the upper lash line 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:32.489
 the beveled kindle at the top 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.239
 eyelash wreath I just got a 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.769
 eyeliner 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.440
 I have now liquid eyeliner 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.599
 used by alberta but you 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.129
 You can also use a gel alone or in cache 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:48.750
 but they just used what they were doing right now 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:50.849
 I've now again has the 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.410
 eyeshadow of aaron carries it now 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.299
 but with a slip brush underneath 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.079
 My bank bones up and this strong 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.090
 to emphasize 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.099
 this step I think is the 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.720
 most important step in the makeup of the 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.400
 alena really very pronounced 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.510
 cheekbones has or this 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.510
 very strongly stressed 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.000
 I carry the powder down too 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.680
 as if you were a shadow and the 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.830
 Bank bones still further in the 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.830
 foreground 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.770
 on 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:35.770
 why do I use the mini highlight of the 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:37.599
 I'll use golden knights from al 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.969
 my eyelash curler always two to three 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.400
 times in a august it just once 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:44.979
 closer my eyes then again 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.569
 in the middle of eyelashes about like that 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.789
 you just get the natural swing 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:52.479
 as mascara suddenly the vol 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:54.159
 live wonder mascara of p2 her best 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:05:03.039
 I do not like it that much 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:05:04.840
 Do not buy them anymore because everyone 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:06.909
 this tactically becomes generous 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.439
 on the eyebrows 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.129
 eyebrows look even further 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:11.129
 to pull up 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.979
 in the ears eyes possible but 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:28.599
 This is now a brush because I 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.669
 there with my finger with my long 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.889
 Fingernails do not get on well 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.539
 I was wearing it on my lips 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.300
 Edge them with a make up factory 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.490
 lipliner in the color 2c with the will 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.960
 I also have my lips on there 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.539
 I do not have a matching lipstick and 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.319
 so the color of lipstick better 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.319
 equalizes 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:19.070
 as a boss in the pen 90 Genoa 27 of 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:20.990
 rival and creating the bank yet 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.730
 is to delve once again the 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.620
 I already have it for the eyes 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:42.290
 this falls blues harp and intensifies 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:43.790
 So again the facial contours with it 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.200
 the lips would have looked even fuller 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.100
 I still in the middle of the lips 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.100
 a lip gloss 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.650
