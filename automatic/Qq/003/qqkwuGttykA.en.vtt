00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.629
 hello very good from google of lanzarote 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.719
 xxi again we are here and this time 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:12.679
 good to do a review of the htc one 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.480
 it is good a mobile that looks very good 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.359
 true touch 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.880
 and it weighs very little is very fine we see here 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:23.060
 how fine it is I have nothing to 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.090
 buy it with but I can assure you that 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.560
 It is very fine and has a port here 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.850
 load it is the same as the blackberry 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.050
 let's see it in the background 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:38.020
 to do it there it looks good there it looks 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:42.490
 which is the same as the blackberry 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:46.030
 and good the one htc symbol here 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:50.020
 above this is to detect when 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.100
 We are talking on the phone here 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.460
 it detects when we are talking and 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.210
 he also tells you here is this because this 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.340
 it has nothing 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.379
 and here is the speaker for when 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.340
 we are talking on the phone the camera 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.720
 in front here we have it 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.360
 if they are not the ones at the top 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:11.420
 we have headphones the microphone and button 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.330
 on and off 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.900
 here the best thing is the cameras the htc 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:22.040
 one is an 8 megapixel camera that 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.130
 Can be recorded in 1080 flash 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.220
 that has flash the simulated htc and other 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.009
 of the great virtues of the htc one is 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.920
 which is that it has motherboard speakers 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.689
 mine are very good they hear us as much as 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.030
 you could if someone else on the ipad 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.799
 because done comparison and I am the most in 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.690
 the ipad but I can assure you that it 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:48.460
 hey very very well and finally because the 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.460
 volume button we have it here 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.670
 and one routine plus the other microphone 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.700
 because I told you that here is a 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.909
 microphone 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.369
 and good 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.740
 and a single part inside not the software 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.660
 well here has these three buttons this 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.039
 is to give it back this is for the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.010
 start button and this is for the 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.510
 windows that you have open 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.909
 is unlocked like almost all 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.910
 androids you have to be connected 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.830
 to wifi 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.050
 this means that I have the alarm 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.790
 setting and this is the battery time and the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.769
 connectivity 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.969
 I drag the ring vodafone Thursday 18 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.829
 I have here these four can 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.840
 modify as you want if I want to speak 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:39.010
 if I want to open for example the music is 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.799
 open so now they are given work or I 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.980
 if I want something else than others but good 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.870
 let's open the normal to sybase 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.350
 everyone has their password 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.120
 Y 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.520
 if we give the start button we 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.530
 open all the screens that we have 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.959
 for example this is the calendar 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.330
 let's start again and we have 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.160
 here we have the menu with all the 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.800
 can not be changed and that with all 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.860
 this we all these applications and you 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:13.210
 you can load many more than these 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.480
 where I was in here on the playstation 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:21.129
 store this 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.690
 and we have all of these and this is 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.220
 Screensaver is very good because this 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.239
 background of partisanship not because where you 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:31.420
 It's quite entertaining that you give him 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.980
 a more googled background and google search 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.690
 this is a ram you can add the 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.950
 that you want we have the window of 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.750
 notifications right now I do not have 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.460
 no notification but if I had more 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.770
 they would not go out and 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.770
 and well, let's focus 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.830
 Y 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.750
 in adjustments for example we go to the 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.970
 settings 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.550
 and 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.570
 the plane of the mobiles using others 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.840
 mobile 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:03.760
 moria development options let's see 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.760
 what can we change screen and gestures 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.810
 the bright 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.260
 but I do not have a position like that 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.099
 opened automatic brightness to pay every 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.099
 how much size 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:25.289
