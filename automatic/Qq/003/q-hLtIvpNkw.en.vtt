00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:08.360
 good let's work criteria of 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.879
 divisibility when a number is 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.370
 division between 11 careful because from 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:15.589
 my point of view this criterion is one 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.800
 of the most difficult in principle of 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:21.679
 understand ok we're going to work here and 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.509
 you will see how it is simpler than what 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:28.730
 it seems but be careful with this criterion of 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.980
 divisibility is worth careful because if I 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.579
 if your teacher would put it in the 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.920
 exam 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.109
 when a number is divisible by 11 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.920
 a division number between 11 and when 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:47.690
 the position of the figure in general the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:52.730
 position of the figures is odd 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:56.570
 - the sum is valid for the position of 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.659
 even numbers gives 0 or a multiple number 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.149
 of 11 can repeat we have a figure the 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.030
 position odd numbers the sum 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:08.000
 on the one hand odd numbers 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:12.200
 - on the other hand the sum of the figures 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.180
 pairs gives all zero a multiple of 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.180
 11 ok let's see an example 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.240
 2,224 voucher 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.820
 we realize 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.270
 the first position is a position 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.140
 odd 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.509
 It is worth the second position for 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.569
 the 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:54.360
 and the fourth for well then position 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:56.100
 odd and even position 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.420
 what are the figures that I have in the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.909
 odd position 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.570
 the 4 on the one hand 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.760
 and the 2 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:12.370
 all while in position 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:14.680
 odd the sum between them and gives me 4 26 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.180
 now let's take the figures from the 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.980
 position for 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:26.760
 we have 2 and I add to 46 that easy 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.900
 and now when I have the sum of the 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.040
 figures the odd position 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.160
 and the sum of the position figures 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.360
 pair 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.360
 and it remains between them 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.599
 16 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:51.719
 as it gives me zero the number is divisible 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:56.010
 between 11 you see how easy it is to remember 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:57.340
 has to give 0 or a multiple number of 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.900
 11 for example 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:04.870
 if when he describes the number he gives 11 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.660
 121 well these numbers are multiples of 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.030
 11 and it would also be a valid result 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.860
 OK 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.300
 I'm going to invent a number, let's see 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.620
 if it comes out or not 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.620
 but another example 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.440
 we agreed that if any explanation of mine 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.390
 it is not clear 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.050
 please in observations write 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.050
 OK 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.470
 I do not mind repeating things or 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.879
 explain things differently 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.879
 seriously write if you do not stay 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:54.880
 27,913 ok we start 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:55.510
 to catch the figures a couple or odd pair and 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.750
 pair 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:03.500
 we started on the one hand position figures 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:06.020
 Odd and figures position for 2 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.540
 The 9 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:14.490
 in 3 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:16.389
 14 you see position for 7 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:23.139
 and in 1 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:26.969
 8 29 and 37 position I only have 7 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.969
 and the 1st 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:34.430
 difference we subtract between them and not 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:38.479
 you know that is equal to 66 is not multiple 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:42.530
 of 11 and also not finished in 0 by 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:45.440
 consequently this figure is not divisible 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.960
 between 11 if you liked the video please

 click on I like and subscribe to 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.819
 my channel that I will put many more videos of 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.240
 math greetings to everyone 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.240
 see you later
