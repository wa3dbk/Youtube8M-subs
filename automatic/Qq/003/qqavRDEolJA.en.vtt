 number 8 on my list is u and cooper of the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.430
 series land or is this another series that 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.040
 it's a forbidden love because it's a 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.780
 love story between a teacher and his 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.660
 student that is not much difference 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.200
 of age just in case they're worried about that 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.090
 but if it is forbidden and cooper too 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.300
 another person who is super sweet super 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.990
 cute and I love the way he is 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.280
 that is funny and the alders the jokes 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.660
 probably have not heard this 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.560
 books because an independent book 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.880
 or started doing the book 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.590
 independent now many people 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.780
 they have read it 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.430
 unfortunately this does not have the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.230
 translation in Spanish but I hope that 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.520
 soon bring it and if I find out about that 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.810
 I would put them in some my videos 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.580
 to pick it out because it really 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.060
 it's a lovely love story 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.819
 number 7 on my list is to keep from being 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.150
 mine in Spanish the skin of July 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.829
 good warner is the one I tell him how 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.430
 a villain lie that is one of those 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:44.829
 villains that are bad but like that 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.409
 they have that side so vulnerable that you 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.930
 you want to change you want to crush 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:52.329
 the and so to be happy 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.980
 werner my favorite villain among 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.200
 quotes because really who does not 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.629
 get a villain on that side that I 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.269
 I always see when he's with juliette 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:05.950
 it's beautiful so it's definitely 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:08.079
 one of my favorite boyfriends and I know not 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.930

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:14.019
 miss is james city returned and 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.049
 the entire james series was one of 1,093 the 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.280
 main and at the beginning because 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.139
 this was some books that I started to 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.019
 read when I started reading really seriously 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.699
 and already extends everything that I like 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.230
 in quality as well as arrogant but not 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.040
 you dislike but that arrogant that you 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.489
 it makes you feel like 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.959
 so then and then we say energy willy 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.810

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.420
 have a comeback I do not know how it will continue in 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.700
 Spanish but they have some fights so 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.629
 funny when he speaks with clark and is 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.760
 so so sweet so I do not always know 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.260
 not always but I liked it a lot 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.810
 stage to do there was never any 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.700
 competition for me by Simon I 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.670
 I was always team 6 wow 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.280
 the friendship number 5 is that I give him the 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.859
 book by month is another book that is 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.480
 an independent book but a lot much 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.879
 a lot more people are realizing 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.280
 the green the great the books 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:10.189
 independents who read only I love 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.989

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.500
 otherwise it can be perfect has 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.849
 many imperfections have flaws has 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.049
 things that a lot of people can not 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:20.630
 like but I love those 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.660
 same reasons because it's not perfect 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.210
 is someone with whom in real life I 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.600
 could be I do not know or that's the way 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:33.650
 the one that he spoke as libya is so 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.710
 So beautiful and the ways in which the hair 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.550
 for she is 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.550

 He is an artist, he is a singer 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:54.130
 that is aspiring to do something better 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:56.470
 he is so as well as different because no no 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.780
 no not for different as well as in the 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.940
 Charly style of sales is 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.160
 invisible and it's so nice to see how well 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.530
 fight for me to your love interest in the 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.510
 book and it's really a relationship 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.160
 too pretty how many times have I said 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:13.000
 pretty in this video is another book 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.650
 independent who does not learn this list 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.120
 the independent books are the best 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:22.090
 ok the number 3 on my list is big or 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.310
 of the mechanical angel 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.410
 forever I know that many people 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.920
 love time and me too 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.540
 like a lot but there is , I love me 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.740
 love reading about characters that are 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.390
 as well as arrogant as those who 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.490
 I said of chase games always all my 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:40.340
 heart from the beginning that's why 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.710
 princess or mechanic got me this 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.330
 he also imported favorite of the works 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.280
 about the origins not only because 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.849
 it was fine but because I feel that up 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.410
 the pose as more historical and more 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:53.599
 interesting that the others only my 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.690
 opinion number two on my list is that 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:58.699
 gillette de capture inductor another book 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.250
 which is an independent book so it's 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.410
 I doubt there is a publication in Spanish 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.780
 but anyone who reads in English by 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.910
 please I know it 's that book is a book 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.599
 pretty strong has pretty themes 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:15.259
 dark but I feel that all this 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:17.720
 cumulus explained keller kidnapped Olivia 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:19.909
 his love interest to sell it to how 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.740
 a sex slave was already heard all the 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:23.449
 ugly proton causes the whole story of the 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.180
 point of view bolivia and olivia is not 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:28.759
 with nobody else besides killer and it's like 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.550
 that of tasks with Stockholm syndrome 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:33.349
 with why that is heard all this 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.330
 me but I wanted the killer and I olived 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:37.280
 stay together at the end that you can 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.380

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.980
 I love the idea of ​​him but I do not like it 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.100
 to be with him 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:45.760
 real is a crazy and the number one of 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.760
 friendships 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.590
 and think about the key of a kiss in Paris 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.590

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.150

 but stuck the earth with the but with 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.610
 nothing on the ground 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.260
 stocks that you only see in the
