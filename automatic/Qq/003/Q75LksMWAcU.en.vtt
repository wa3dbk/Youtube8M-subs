to tell his father the truth I think it

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.620 
to tell his father the truth I think it
would<00:01:51.990> provide<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.860> huge<00:01:53.130> amount<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.819> freedom

from<00:01:55.080> them<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.649> think<00:01:55.679> if<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.009> tell<00:01:56.250> him<00:01:56.429> that

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
from them and I think if I tell him that

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.680 
from them and I think if I tell him that
I<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:56.789> transsexuals<00:01:57.420> we'll<00:01:57.539> have<00:01:57.630> a
