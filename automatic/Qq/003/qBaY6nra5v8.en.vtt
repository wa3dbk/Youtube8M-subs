 Europe 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.650
 What time 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:58.210
 because the tesserae doing this is 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:07:03.070
 when we say that the glue dries 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:07.180
 passion that that but where are we now 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:13.450

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:39.300
 remains more than art the canon then 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:43.210

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:45.040
 deodorants in that cannes it is 

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.890
 now to the broken banks you 

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:51.490
 close quickly then you stir 

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:53.830
 weighed here to create the spark 

00:07:51.490 --> 00:08:00.360
 winter explosion
