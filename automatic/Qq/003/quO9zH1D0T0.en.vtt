was trying to say earlier rivers and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.889 
was trying to say earlier rivers and
water<00:00:47.309> for<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.640> matter<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.450> very<00:00:48.809> good

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
water for that matter is a very good

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.440 
water for that matter is a very good
heat<00:00:49.290> soaring<00:00:49.739> source<00:00:50.040> it<00:00:50.850> might<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.180> summer

heat soaring source it might be summer

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.720 
heat soaring source it might be summer
right<00:00:51.690> now<00:00:51.840> let's<00:00:52.469> wait<00:00:52.680> four<00:00:53.040> to<00:00:53.250> six<00:00:53.520> months

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
right now let's wait four to six months

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.580 
right now let's wait four to six months
and<00:00:54.090> see<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> water<00:00:54.780> looks<00:00:55.079> like<00:00:55.320> then

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
and see what the water looks like then

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.090 
and see what the water looks like then
six<00:00:56.430> months<00:00:56.730> later<00:00:57.210> than<00:00:58.200> currently<00:00:58.680> minus

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
six months later than currently minus

six months later than currently minus
five<00:00:59.340> degrees<00:00:59.370> Celsius<00:01:00.300> all<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:01.290> water

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
five degrees Celsius all this water

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.310 
five degrees Celsius all this water
isn't<00:01:01.710> frozen<00:01:02.149> wiseness<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.170> because

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
isn't frozen wiseness this is because

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.209 
isn't frozen wiseness this is because
water<00:01:04.769> has<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.129> high<00:01:05.280> heat<00:01:05.700> capacity<00:01:06.799> it<00:01:07.799> stores

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219 
water has a high heat capacity it stores

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.039 
water has a high heat capacity it stores
energy<00:01:08.430> from<00:01:08.880> longer<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.539> what<00:01:09.719> it<00:01:09.810> tries<00:01:09.990> to

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
energy from longer and what it tries to

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.050 
energy from longer and what it tries to
freeze<00:01:10.440> that<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.100> use<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.400> heat<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.909> has

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
freeze that we use the heat that it has

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.740 
freeze that we use the heat that it has
stored<00:01:13.760> but<00:01:14.760> how<00:01:14.909> long<00:01:15.119> will<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.390> take<00:01:15.510> this

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
stored but how long will it take this

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.289 
stored but how long will it take this
water<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.170> freeze<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.650> may<00:01:16.799> ask<00:01:17.090> let's<00:01:18.090> say

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
water to freeze you may ask let's say

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.730 
water to freeze you may ask let's say
that<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.600> water<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.960> at<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> temperature<00:01:19.409> of

eight<00:01:26.880> six<00:01:27.150> jewels<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:28.290> would<00:01:28.439> simply

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
eight six jewels we would simply

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.170 
eight six jewels we would simply
multiply<00:01:29.220> those<00:01:29.400> two<00:01:29.670> numbers<00:01:29.880> together

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180

giving<00:01:31.080> us<00:01:32.240> 8370<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.390> now<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.110> do<00:01:34.260> is

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
giving us 8370 to now we have to do is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.080 
giving us 8370 to now we have to do is
multiply<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.979> number<00:01:35.040> by<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.549> change<00:01:35.939> in

colors<00:02:12.480> are<00:02:12.750> red<00:02:13.110> orange<00:02:14.069> yellow<00:02:14.340> green<00:02:15.029> blue

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
colors are red orange yellow green blue

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.809 
colors are red orange yellow green blue
and<00:02:16.439> violet

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
and violet

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.239 
and violet
the<00:02:18.540> reason<00:02:18.870> why<00:02:18.989> darker<00:02:19.379> colors<00:02:19.709> like<00:02:20.010> black

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:20.249 
the reason why darker colors like black

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:22.280 
the reason why darker colors like black
and<00:02:20.310> violet<00:02:20.879> heat<00:02:21.329> up<00:02:21.450> faster<00:02:21.840> than<00:02:21.870> colors

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
and violet heat up faster than colors

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.259 
and violet heat up faster than colors
like<00:02:22.469> red<00:02:22.709> is<00:02:22.920> because<00:02:23.370> black<00:02:23.639> absorbs<00:02:23.969> all

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
like red is because black absorbs all

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.270 
like red is because black absorbs all
colors<00:02:24.659> and<00:02:24.840> lighter<00:02:25.409> colors<00:02:25.829> do<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> better

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
colors and lighter colors do a better

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.629 
colors and lighter colors do a better
job<00:02:26.370> at<00:02:26.700> reflecting<00:02:27.209> colors<00:02:28.310> let's<00:02:29.310> say<00:02:29.489> I'm

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:29.639 
job at reflecting colors let's say I'm

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.789 
job at reflecting colors let's say I'm
wearing<00:02:29.909> a<00:02:29.999> red<00:02:30.150> shirt<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:31.260> fit<00:02:31.499> it<00:02:31.620> under

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
wearing a red shirt to fit it under

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.039 
wearing a red shirt to fit it under
there<00:02:32.159> we<00:02:32.430> go<00:02:32.639> this<00:02:33.090> red<00:02:33.329> shirt<00:02:33.599> will<00:02:33.780> absorb

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
there we go this red shirt will absorb

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.170 
there we go this red shirt will absorb
all<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.469> colors<00:02:34.769> of<00:02:34.799> light<00:02:35.069> except<00:02:35.819> for<00:02:36.030> red

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
all the colors of light except for red

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.360 
all the colors of light except for red
red<00:02:36.870> will<00:02:37.109> reflect<00:02:37.379> off<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.709> my<00:02:38.010> shirt<00:02:38.040> and

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
red will reflect off of my shirt and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.940 
red will reflect off of my shirt and
will<00:02:38.639> be<00:02:38.760> visible<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.209> our<00:02:39.329> eyes<00:02:39.680> this<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.829> why

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
will be visible to our eyes this is why

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.379 
will be visible to our eyes this is why
white<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.430> better<00:02:41.639> color<00:02:41.909> to<00:02:42.090> wear<00:02:42.209> at<00:02:42.329> the

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.389 
white is a better color to wear at the

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.259 
white is a better color to wear at the
beach<00:02:42.629> it<00:02:43.139> reflects<00:02:43.530> all<00:02:43.769> colors<00:02:44.189> look<00:02:45.060> at<00:02:45.180> the

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
beach it reflects all colors look at the

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.909 
beach it reflects all colors look at the
time<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.750> only<00:02:46.109> have<00:02:46.290> time<00:02:46.469> to<00:02:46.590> cheat<00:02:46.799> you

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:46.919 
time I only have time to cheat you

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.140 
time I only have time to cheat you
people<00:02:47.219> will<00:02:47.430> conduction<00:02:47.969> and<00:02:48.060> convection

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
people will conduction and convection

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.750 
people will conduction and convection
then<00:02:48.810> after<00:02:49.109> leave<00:02:49.290> as<00:02:49.859> you<00:02:49.919> can<00:02:50.280> see<00:02:50.489> this

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
then after leave as you can see this

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.940 
then after leave as you can see this
coffee<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.269> very<00:02:51.540> warm

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.670 

as<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.910> was<00:02:55.030> saying<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.629> coffee<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:56.080> very<00:02:56.410> worn

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
as I was saying this coffee is very worn

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.770 
as I was saying this coffee is very worn
because<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.550> coffee<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:57.970> warm<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:58.420> will<00:02:58.599> heat

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
because the coffee is warm it will heat

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.630 
because the coffee is warm it will heat
up<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:59.050> surrounding<00:02:59.500> air<00:02:59.650> spread<00:03:00.519> the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
up the surrounding air spread the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.640 
up the surrounding air spread the
particles<00:03:01.090> apart<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:01.989> air<00:03:02.140> will<00:03:02.349> become

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
particles apart and the air will become

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.800 
particles apart and the air will become
less<00:03:02.830> dense<00:03:03.129> because<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.239> air<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:04.480> less<00:03:04.750> dense

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
less dense because the air is less dense

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.250 
less dense because the air is less dense
the<00:03:05.530> hot<00:03:05.769> air<00:03:06.010> will<00:03:06.040> rise<00:03:06.519> this<00:03:07.360> rising<00:03:07.810> air<00:03:08.019> is

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
the hot air will rise this rising air is

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.430 
the hot air will rise this rising air is
also<00:03:08.709> known<00:03:08.890> as<00:03:09.099> convection<00:03:09.550> currents
