this<00:00:03.929> is<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.140> as<00:00:04.770> you<00:00:04.920> are<00:00:05.069> mentioning<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.580> most

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
this is a as you are mentioning the most

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.309 
this is a as you are mentioning the most
important<00:00:06.120> ability<00:00:06.299> that<00:00:06.600> we<00:00:06.750> are<00:00:06.839> presenting

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
important ability that we are presenting

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.259 
important ability that we are presenting
in<00:00:07.500> Hong<00:00:07.680> Kong<00:00:07.710> so<00:00:08.069> this<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.910> third<00:00:09.059> film

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
in Hong Kong so this is the third film

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.039 
in Hong Kong so this is the third film
in<00:00:09.360> Econ<00:00:09.570> top<00:00:09.690> one<00:00:09.929> minute<00:00:10.200> repeater<00:00:10.440> so<00:00:12.049> we

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
in Econ top one minute repeater so we

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.450 
in Econ top one minute repeater so we
are<00:00:13.200> doing<00:00:13.380> at<00:00:13.590> version<00:00:13.860> photo<00:00:14.009> time<00:00:14.190> minute

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
are doing at version photo time minute

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.460 
are doing at version photo time minute
repeating<00:00:14.880> watches<00:00:15.210> since<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.719> 19th<00:00:16.139> century

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
repeating watches since the 19th century

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.029 
repeating watches since the 19th century
or<00:00:16.859> striking<00:00:17.609> watches<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.480> early<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:19.560> 19th

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
or striking watches in the early of 19th

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:20.599 
or striking watches in the early of 19th
century

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
century

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.670 
century
so<00:00:20.730> such<00:00:21.630> watches<00:00:21.930> are<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.170> more<00:00:22.320> complex

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
so such watches are the more complex

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.939 
so such watches are the more complex
designs<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.609> high<00:00:23.789> watch<00:00:23.970> making<00:00:24.240> and

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
designs in the high watch making and

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.679 
designs in the high watch making and
it's<00:00:25.949> not<00:00:26.099> only<00:00:26.220> complicated<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:27.510> also

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
it's not only complicated but it's also

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.740 
it's not only complicated but it's also
very<00:00:27.990> thin<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.680> we<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.279> thinnest<00:00:30.240> minute

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
very thin so we have the thinnest minute

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.120 
very thin so we have the thinnest minute

develop this new minute repeater
movement<00:01:03.420> ultra-thin<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:04.500> are

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
movement ultra-thin and we are

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.070 
movement ultra-thin and we are
especially<00:01:04.769> proud<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.970> present<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.780> new

especially proud to present this new

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.630 
especially proud to present this new
high<00:01:07.439> complication<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.340> patrimony

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
high complication in the patrimony

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.270 
high complication in the patrimony
Cordoba<00:01:09.150> red<00:01:09.299> line<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.350> combination<00:01:10.740> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
Cordoba red line so this combination of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.300 
Cordoba red line so this combination of
on<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.330> side<00:01:12.570> very<00:01:13.170> pure<00:01:13.530> very<00:01:13.560> strict

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
on one side very pure very strict

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.310 
on one side very pure very strict
aesthetics<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> other<00:01:15.509> side<00:01:15.810> very<00:01:16.140> high

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
aesthetics on the other side very high

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.020 
aesthetics on the other side very high
complication<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.310> something<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.820> we

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
complication is really something that we

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.749 
complication is really something that we
really<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.439> play<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:20.009> -<00:01:20.159> horizontal

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
really like to play with a - horizontal

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.090 
really like to play with a - horizontal
it's<00:01:21.180> much<00:01:21.750> more<00:01:21.960> complicated<00:01:22.320> than<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.770> Tobin

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
it's much more complicated than a Tobin

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.850 
it's much more complicated than a Tobin
for<00:01:23.369> example<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.000> only<00:01:24.240> very<00:01:24.600> few<00:01:24.720> brands<00:01:25.650> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
for example so only very few brands and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.179 
for example so only very few brands and
very<00:01:26.009> few<00:01:26.250> watchmaker<00:01:26.670> are<00:01:26.970> able<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.390> master

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
very few watchmaker are able to master

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.770 
very few watchmaker are able to master
min<00:01:29.189> tribute<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.610> mini<00:01:29.909> tributing<00:01:30.390> watches

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
min tribute to mini tributing watches

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.100 
min tribute to mini tributing watches
and<00:01:31.759> for<00:01:32.759> example<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.210> Barcelona<00:01:33.329> we<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and for example in Barcelona we have a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.679 
and for example in Barcelona we have a
dedicated<00:01:34.320> team<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:35.119> watchmakers<00:01:36.119> or<00:01:36.299> experts

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
dedicated team of watchmakers or experts

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.899 
dedicated team of watchmakers or experts
who<00:01:36.869> are<00:01:36.930> working<00:01:37.140> on<00:01:37.350> such<00:01:37.560> designs<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.130> we

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
who are working on such designs and we

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.249 
who are working on such designs and we
have<00:01:39.000> very<00:01:39.180> few<00:01:39.479> watchmakers<00:01:40.020> who<00:01:40.049> are

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
have very few watchmakers who are

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.620 
have very few watchmakers who are
working<00:01:40.439> at<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.799> moment<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.490> we<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.790> around

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
working at the moment so we have around

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.690 
working at the moment so we have around
five<00:01:42.930> people<00:01:43.259> who<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.470> working<00:01:43.710> for<00:01:44.490> such

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
five people who are working for such

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.340 
five people who are working for such
watches<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.270> that's<00:01:45.479> really<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> optics<00:01:46.170> of

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
watches so that's really the optics of

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.590 
watches so that's really the optics of
high<00:01:46.500> complications<00:01:47.159> historically<00:01:47.939> minute

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
high complications historically minute

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.300 
high complications historically minute
repeating<00:01:48.990> watches<00:01:49.380> they<00:01:49.530> were<00:01:49.590> housed<00:01:50.070> in

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
repeating watches they were housed in

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.130 
repeating watches they were housed in
pocket<00:01:50.729> watches<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.329> have<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.780> know<00:01:51.960> this

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
pocket watches so you have to know this

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.780 
pocket watches so you have to know this
resonance<00:01:52.680> using<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:55.040> watch<00:01:56.040> case<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
resonance using the watch case as a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.709 
resonance using the watch case as a
resonator

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
resonator

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.859 
resonator
in<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.469> case<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.640> thinner<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.570> thinnest

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
in that case the thinner the thinnest

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.719 
in that case the thinner the thinnest
you<00:02:01.020> are<00:02:01.200> or<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.350> signal<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.700> are

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
you are or the signal you you you are

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.060 
you are or the signal you you you are
you<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.270> need<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.689> find

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
you you need to find

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.400 
you you need to find
ways<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.890> get<00:02:08.130> a<00:02:08.940> good<00:02:09.479> resonance<00:02:09.990> and

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
ways to to to get a good resonance and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.140 
ways to to to get a good resonance and
of<00:02:11.009> course<00:02:11.310> we<00:02:11.490> have<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> long<00:02:11.850> experience

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
of course we have a long experience

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.350 
of course we have a long experience
talking<00:02:13.140> about<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.500> minute<00:02:13.890> repeaters<00:02:14.340> we<00:02:15.270> are

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
talking about a minute repeaters we are

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.840 
talking about a minute repeaters we are
doing<00:02:15.630> risk<00:02:16.110> minute<00:02:16.530> repeating<00:02:16.950> Rhys<00:02:17.520> watches

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
doing risk minute repeating Rhys watches

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.290 
doing risk minute repeating Rhys watches
in<00:02:18.060> decades<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:19.680> we<00:02:19.830> have<00:02:19.950> some<00:02:20.180> kind<00:02:21.180> of

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
in decades and we have some kind of

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.400 
in decades and we have some kind of
secrets<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:23.390> this<00:02:24.390> new<00:02:24.690> minute<00:02:24.930> repeater<00:02:25.110> is

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
secrets and this new minute repeater is

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.060 
secrets and this new minute repeater is
as<00:02:25.709> wonderful<00:02:26.280> as<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.459> very<00:02:27.080> loud<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.380> musical

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
as wonderful as a very loud and musical

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.650 
as wonderful as a very loud and musical
sound<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.550> we<00:02:29.730> are<00:02:29.880> really<00:02:30.030> happy<00:02:30.120> with<00:02:30.570> the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
sound so we are really happy with the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.810 
sound so we are really happy with the
result<00:02:30.990> we<00:02:31.200> have<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.620> little<00:02:32.220> bit<00:02:32.310> less<00:02:32.580> than

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
result we have a little bit less than

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.650 
result we have a little bit less than
300<00:02:33.360> components<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.320> moment
