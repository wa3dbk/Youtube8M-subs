00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.870
 so hey people welcome back to still 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.050
 a gta video of me today I go 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.929
 about stocks so the stock market and 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.160
 how to really ash on the floor 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.250
 market can earn 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.850
 this I will take out of five 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.220
 mission 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.990
 those are the strikes mission so it is 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.310
 I do not know how those in 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.680
 German because I'm playing the game 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.420
 in english but it is definitely 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.130
 Leicester's mission is the first 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.130
 I have a mission at the top of the screen 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.040
 I'm just getting 5 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.010
 and these are the mission you get to 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.800
 I get these phone boxes 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.059
 Mission detained until the end of 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.620
 so that I have the more money 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.870
 but of course you can too 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.030
 to play through games I would 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.520
 to rat the last ones so that 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.390
 fifth mission to date so far 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:01.070
 finally gets paid the end and 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.719
 so ash can make properly 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.159
 Leicester on the phone will explain to you 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.950
 what we always do for a stop 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.060
 must and then he will tell you too 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.490
 a share 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.960
 but because you're at the mission 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.150
 then you can this act they even 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.409
 with franklin buy so what me 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.990
 I have always done 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.850
 after I bet the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.640
 got information and then have 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.560
 the shares characterize all three 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.350
 bought and then the mission over 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.659
 played but so you do not do it 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.759
 So you always have to exotics so mission 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.939
 Start and then turn off again 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.700
 I will tell you below in the description 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.799
 give the mission from 1 to 5 and also 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.780
 through the share price so the share 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.490
 buy directly is then you can 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.649
 Just do it before you start the mission 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.049
 starts on the share 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.810
 and then you will be ten minutes 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.570
 approximately after the stopper is executed 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.790
 then you sell the stock on all 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.520
 three characters so please look and 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.880
 in the description of the video for like it 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.070
 works which share 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.170
 actually buy is that is so far 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.170
 the best way I've found around 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.459
 to make ashamed right after I believe 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.010
 me after the 5th 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:18.099
 with trevor in the over the hundreds of 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.450
 million so I'm exactly on the 120th 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.519
 End of video I'll give you a few 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.879
 sections of stock sales 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.140
 but definitely show 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.440
 I also had a little more money 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.050
 spend on other characters so 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.590
 I do not have that much coal on it 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.480
 other character but you do if 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.370
 you keep all the money from the endgame and 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:45.610
 then you could do that mission 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:47.890
 about up to 150 million dollars 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.299
 So could 150 million per character 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.170
 you create them 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.640
 if you stop this mission I 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.060
 let the gameplay look like that 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.329
 otherwise you can easily become fifth 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.200
 minute so six minutes tilted 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:07.000
 and then you can see how much 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.130
 I have money in the stocks I have 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.930
 several excerpts so there will be more 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.360
 we will be shown one after the other from 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.450
 various missions only the excerpts 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.549
 from the sales but otherwise leave 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.530
 I am using you now with the gameplay and 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.950
 Then the youth either finished 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.480
 watch 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.290
 this is a relatively simple one 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.359
 mission but I'm doing it a bit 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.639
 different at the end of the game and do not follow 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:35.859
 the path or the way it is on the 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.090
 minimap is shown there so until the 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.980
 next time I hope you have it 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.190
 helped check the description below 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.889
 for the shares pro which mission and yes 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.040
 make a lot of money guys to the next 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.040
 times 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.710
 d 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.670
 OK 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.810
 elevated 

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:45.080
 feature
