if I had to guess I would say I've

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.010 
if I had to guess I would say I've
probably<00:01:25.400> got<00:01:25.760> about<00:01:25.850> a<00:01:25.970> hundred<00:01:26.180> prob<00:01:26.990> about

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
probably got about a hundred prob about

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.410 
probably got about a hundred prob about
