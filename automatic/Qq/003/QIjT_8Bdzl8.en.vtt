00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.470 

yeah<00:00:04.170> well<00:00:04.920> I<00:00:04.950> I<00:00:05.400> wish<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:05.879> could<00:00:06.029> say<00:00:06.180> that<00:00:06.210> that

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
yeah well I I wish I could say that that

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.110 
yeah well I I wish I could say that that
was<00:00:06.600> true<00:00:06.810> but<00:00:06.990> no<00:00:07.560> you<00:00:07.620> do<00:00:07.830> have<00:00:08.069> bad<00:00:08.670> sectors

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
was true but no you do have bad sectors

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.060 
was true but no you do have bad sectors
it's<00:00:09.360> usually<00:00:09.960> they<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:10.320> get<00:00:10.679> completely

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
it's usually they just get completely

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.280 
it's usually they just get completely
obliterated<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.509> don't<00:00:12.630> get<00:00:12.809> control<00:00:13.259> of

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
obliterated and you don't get control of

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.410 
obliterated and you don't get control of
them<00:00:13.500> at<00:00:13.620> all<00:00:13.740> so<00:00:14.580> that's<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.210> biggest

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
them at all so that's the biggest

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.370 
them at all so that's the biggest
problem<00:00:16.400> it<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.609> worse<00:00:17.940> yeah<00:00:18.359> it's<00:00:18.900> worse<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
problem it is worse yeah it's worse on a

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.349 
problem it is worse yeah it's worse on a
data<00:00:19.740> recovery<00:00:19.949> into<00:00:22.340> yes<00:00:23.340> we<00:00:23.910> have<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.060> problem

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
data recovery into yes we have a problem

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.509 
data recovery into yes we have a problem
right<00:00:24.600> now<00:00:24.660> if<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> MBR<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.710> messed<00:00:26.010> up<00:00:26.189> it

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
right now if the MBR is messed up it

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.580 
right now if the MBR is messed up it
does<00:00:26.820> not<00:00:26.939> currently<00:00:27.269> look<00:00:27.810> for<00:00:28.109> partition

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
does not currently look for partition

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.349 
does not currently look for partition
structures<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.310> MBR<00:00:29.670> doesn't<00:00:29.970> know<00:00:30.119> so

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
structures that the MBR doesn't know so

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.910 
structures that the MBR doesn't know so
you<00:00:30.420> could<00:00:30.689> hand<00:00:31.080> build<00:00:31.349> one<00:00:31.500> if<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.679> wanted

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
you could hand build one if you wanted

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.920 
you could hand build one if you wanted
to<00:00:32.009> they<00:00:32.460> are<00:00:32.669> writing<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.270> partition<00:00:33.719> search

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
to they are writing a partition search

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.389 
to they are writing a partition search
feature<00:00:34.350> keep<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.800> mind<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.070> all<00:00:35.190> beta

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
feature keep in mind this is all beta

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.450 
feature keep in mind this is all beta
right<00:00:35.640> now<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.390> they're<00:00:36.540> writing<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.460> partition

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
right now so they're writing a partition

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.220 
right now so they're writing a partition
search<00:00:38.700> feature<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:39.329> those<00:00:39.450> same<00:00:39.690> partitions

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
search feature for those same partitions

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.910 
search feature for those same partitions
so<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:42.020> that<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.200> currently<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.559> problem

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
so that is a that is currently a problem

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.190 
so that is a that is currently a problem
though<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.309> will<00:00:44.489> try<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.850> do<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.270> ECC<00:00:45.750> recovery

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
though it will try to do in ECC recovery

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.170 
though it will try to do in ECC recovery
on<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.379> MBR<00:00:46.800> though<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.700> instance<00:00:47.730> even

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
on the MBR though so for instance even

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.400 
on the MBR though so for instance even
if<00:00:48.270> there's<00:00:48.420> one<00:00:48.570> bite<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.960> still<00:00:49.170> an<00:00:49.289> error

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
if there's one bite to still an error

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.119 
if there's one bite to still an error
it'll<00:00:49.770> try<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.950> recover<00:00:50.219> from<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.620> but<00:00:52.620> this

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
it'll try to recover from it so but this

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.220 
it'll try to recover from it so but this
tool<00:00:53.370> does<00:00:53.399> some<00:00:53.850> other<00:00:54.000> things<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:55.079> is

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
tool does some other things and this is

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.410 
tool does some other things and this is
not<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.440> part<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> demo<00:00:56.460> I've<00:00:56.640> prepared<00:00:57.090> so

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
not a part of the demo I've prepared so

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.220 
not a part of the demo I've prepared so
if<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.079> blows<00:00:58.379> up<00:00:59.030> if<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.570> actually<00:01:00.750> wanted

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
if it blows up if if I actually wanted

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.560 
if it blows up if if I actually wanted
to<00:01:01.410> do<00:01:01.559> something<00:01:01.920> with<00:01:02.039> heads<00:01:02.579> there's

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
to do something with heads there's

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.240 
to do something with heads there's
actually<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> function<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.409> actually<00:01:05.010> looks

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
actually a function that actually looks

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.100 
actually a function that actually looks
at<00:01:05.430> heads<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.180> turn<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.689> off<00:01:06.780> bad

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
at heads and you can turn on and off bad

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.050 
at heads and you can turn on and off bad
heads<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.760> individually<00:01:11.060> it'll

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
heads and so you can individually it'll

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.340 
heads and so you can individually it'll
individually<00:01:12.630> search<00:01:12.840> through<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> zone

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
individually search through the zone

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.109 
individually search through the zone
tables<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.189> will<00:01:14.280> build<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> zone<00:01:14.790> table

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
tables and it will build the zone table

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.820 
tables and it will build the zone table
listing<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.659> anybody<00:01:15.869> who<00:01:16.110> knows<00:01:16.259> what<00:01:16.470> Zeke<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
listing so anybody who knows what Zeke a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.990 
listing so anybody who knows what Zeke a
vis<00:01:17.130> will<00:01:17.400> know<00:01:17.490> what<00:01:17.610> I'm<00:01:17.670> talking<00:01:17.939> about

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
vis will know what I'm talking about

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.990 
vis will know what I'm talking about
Bonnie<00:01:18.750> plus<00:01:19.020> plus<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.920> building<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.610> using

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
Bonnie plus plus it's building is using

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.670 
Bonnie plus plus it's building is using
zone<00:01:21.210> tables<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:21.960> using<00:01:22.170> zone<00:01:22.350> tables

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
zone tables and it's using zone tables

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.530 
zone tables and it's using zone tables
to<00:01:22.770> identify<00:01:23.189> all<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.369> heads<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.850> so

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
to identify all the heads and so

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.240 
to identify all the heads and so
depending<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.320> how<00:01:25.439> long<00:01:25.619> sometimes<00:01:25.950> just

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
depending on how long sometimes just

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.760 
depending on how long sometimes just
take<00:01:26.430> an<00:01:26.549> hour<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.790> actually<00:01:27.150> run<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.780> it'll

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
take an hour to actually run but it'll

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.859 
take an hour to actually run but it'll
build<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.100> list<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.729> all<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.210> heads<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.689> you

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
build a list of all of the heads and you

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.270 
build a list of all of the heads and you
can<00:01:30.990> individually<00:01:31.500> turn<00:01:31.650> off<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> head<00:01:32.070> so

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
can individually turn off a head so

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.039 
can individually turn off a head so
those<00:01:32.700> drives<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> clunking<00:01:33.780> error

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
those drives to have a clunking error

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.469 
those drives to have a clunking error
but<00:01:34.470> they<00:01:34.590> still<00:01:34.799> come<00:01:35.040> ready<00:01:35.340> if<00:01:36.270> anybody

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
but they still come ready if anybody

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.730 
but they still come ready if anybody
knows<00:01:36.900> on<00:01:37.049> talking<00:01:37.320> about<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.590> three

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
knows on talking about like three

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.020 
knows on talking about like three
minutes<00:01:37.979> after<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.400> start<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.640> drive<00:01:38.820> and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
minutes after you start to drive and

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.640 
minutes after you start to drive and
it's<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.240> clunk<00:01:39.540> clunk<00:01:39.780> clunk<00:01:40.049> clunk<00:01:40.320> clunk

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
it's going clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.560 
it's going clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk
and<00:01:40.920> then<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.490> comes<00:01:41.640> ready<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.479> looks

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
and then it comes ready and it looks

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.789 
and then it comes ready and it looks
like<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:42.930> copy<00:01:43.110> files<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:43.710> it

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
like you can copy files but then it

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.410 
like you can copy files but then it
starts<00:01:44.009> airing<00:01:44.159> out<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.700> stuff<00:01:44.850> sometimes

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
starts airing out and stuff sometimes

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.090 
starts airing out and stuff sometimes
that's<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.720> bad<00:01:45.869> head<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.829> can<00:01:46.979> actually

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
that's a bad head and you can actually

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.149 
that's a bad head and you can actually
turn<00:01:47.909> off<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.479> bad<00:01:48.659> head<00:01:48.899> image<00:01:49.680> all<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> good

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
turn off the bad head image all the good

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.460 
turn off the bad head image all the good
stuff<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.640> then<00:01:51.329> go<00:01:51.750> back<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.140> try<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> deal

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
stuff and then go back and try to deal

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.410 
stuff and then go back and try to deal
with<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> bad<00:01:52.829> head<00:01:53.100> or<00:01:53.399> make<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> new<00:01:53.970> head<00:01:54.180> or

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
with the bad head or make a new head or

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.340 
with the bad head or make a new head or
do<00:01:54.600> something<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.049> from<00:01:55.290> that

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
do something like that from that

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.830 
do something like that from that
standpoint<00:01:55.590> replaced<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.250> head<00:01:56.450> but<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
standpoint replaced the head but so in a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.120 
standpoint replaced the head but so in a
minute<00:01:57.960> what<00:01:58.200> will<00:01:58.290> happen<00:01:58.590> was<00:01:58.770> when<00:01:58.920> it's

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
minute what will happen was when it's

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.100 
minute what will happen was when it's
done<00:01:59.219> with<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.490> zone<00:01:59.700> table<00:02:00.060> it'll<00:02:00.750> give<00:02:00.960> me

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
done with the zone table it'll give me

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.899 
done with the zone table it'll give me
an<00:02:01.229> option<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.680> turn<00:02:01.890> off<00:02:01.920> individual<00:02:02.549> head<00:02:02.700> so

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
an option to turn off individual head so

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.130 
an option to turn off individual head so
I<00:02:02.939> think<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.240> one's<00:02:03.420> only<00:02:03.509> got<00:02:03.689> three<00:02:03.960> heads

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
I think this one's only got three heads

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.670 
I think this one's only got three heads
or<00:02:04.469> four<00:02:04.680> heads<00:02:05.270> I've<00:02:06.270> only<00:02:06.420> seen<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.899> see<00:02:07.229> for

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
or four heads I've only seen I see for

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.110 
or four heads I've only seen I see for
go<00:02:07.710> by<00:02:08.420> so

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.479 

yeah<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:14.380> don't<00:02:14.560> care<00:02:14.739> about<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:15.130> other<00:02:15.280> head

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
yeah you don't care about the other head

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.979 
yeah you don't care about the other head
so<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:15.670> can<00:02:15.760> turn<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.150> off<00:02:16.360> at<00:02:16.630> it'll<00:02:16.870> actually

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
so you can turn it off at it'll actually

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.630 
so you can turn it off at it'll actually
fill<00:02:17.319> in<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.560> holes<00:02:17.770> that'll<00:02:18.250> fill<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:18.550> the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
fill in the holes that'll fill in the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.880 
fill in the holes that'll fill in the
gaps<00:02:18.819> so<00:02:19.060> now<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.660> it's<00:02:19.750> done<00:02:19.989> if<00:02:20.349> I<00:02:20.739> actually

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
gaps so now that it's done if I actually

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.559 
gaps so now that it's done if I actually
went<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.520> list<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.060> actually<00:02:22.180> looked

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
went to the list and I actually looked

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.080 
went to the list and I actually looked
at<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.900> process<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.620> actually<00:02:24.370> now<00:02:24.640> have<00:02:24.670> four

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
at the process I actually now have four

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.699 
at the process I actually now have four
heads<00:02:25.270> I<00:02:25.510> can<00:02:25.750> actually<00:02:25.900> go<00:02:26.140> down<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.560> turn

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
heads I can actually go down and turn

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.620 
heads I can actually go down and turn
off<00:02:26.890> an<00:02:27.040> individual<00:02:27.520> head<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.510> only

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
off an individual head this is the only

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.180 
off an individual head this is the only
tool<00:02:28.959> in<00:02:29.200> this<00:02:29.319> price<00:02:29.530> range<00:02:29.680> which<00:02:30.010> actually

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
tool in this price range which actually

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.280 
tool in this price range which actually
does<00:02:30.520> that<00:02:33.120> yes<00:02:34.120> it<00:02:34.390> does<00:02:34.450> it'll<00:02:35.140> read

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
does that yes it does it'll read

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.809 
does that yes it does it'll read
whatever<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.800> head<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.010> assigned<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.519> it

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
whatever that head is assigned to it

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.880 
whatever that head is assigned to it
will<00:02:36.940> skip<00:02:37.209> all<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.630> data<00:02:37.750> but<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.709> does

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
will skip all of that data but that does

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.680 
will skip all of that data but that does
not<00:02:38.920> mean<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.580> don't<00:02:39.760> have<00:02:39.910> like<00:02:40.180> like

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
not mean that you don't have like like

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.630 
not mean that you don't have like like
zones<00:02:41.230> are<00:02:41.470> actually<00:02:41.739> divided<00:02:42.099> up<00:02:42.220> according

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
zones are actually divided up according

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.550 
zones are actually divided up according
to<00:02:42.760> numbers<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.480> LBA<00:02:43.989> blocks<00:02:44.319> that<00:02:44.500> are

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
to numbers of LBA blocks that are

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.309 
to numbers of LBA blocks that are
consecutive<00:02:45.160> so<00:02:45.850> zones<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.600> may<00:02:46.720> still<00:02:46.930> be<00:02:46.989> two

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
consecutive so zones it may still be two

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.420 
consecutive so zones it may still be two
Meg's<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:47.709> may<00:02:47.800> still<00:02:47.920> have<00:02:48.069> a<00:02:48.130> good<00:02:48.280> word

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
Meg's you may still have a good word

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.070 
Meg's you may still have a good word
document<00:02:48.940> even<00:02:49.180> though<00:02:49.299> one<00:02:49.630> head<00:02:49.810> might<00:02:49.959> be

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
document even though one head might be

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.150 
document even though one head might be
missing<00:02:50.489> so<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:55.810> is<00:02:56.200> not<00:02:56.380> meant<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.769> do<00:02:56.890> secure

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
missing so it is not meant to do secure

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.350 
missing so it is not meant to do secure
a<00:02:57.220> snow<00:02:57.580> but<00:02:58.120> you<00:02:58.180> can<00:02:58.299> do<00:02:58.360> that<00:02:58.420> with<00:02:58.540> floppy

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
a snow but you can do that with floppy

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
a snow but you can do that with floppy
yeah<00:03:06.000> yeah<00:03:07.000> it'll<00:03:07.239> wipe<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.660> drive<00:03:07.870> it'll<00:03:08.260> do<00:03:08.350> a

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
yeah yeah it'll wipe a drive it'll do a

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.900 
yeah yeah it'll wipe a drive it'll do a
wipe<00:03:08.709> drive<00:03:09.010> but<00:03:09.160> it's<00:03:09.310> not<00:03:09.430> doing<00:03:09.640> secure

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
wipe drive but it's not doing secure

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.280 
wipe drive but it's not doing secure
race<00:03:10.090> so<00:03:10.390> it's<00:03:10.540> not<00:03:10.600> doing<00:03:10.810> anything<00:03:11.019> with

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
race so it's not doing anything with

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.890 
race so it's not doing anything with
with<00:03:12.100> bad<00:03:12.340> bad<00:03:12.910> sectors<00:03:13.330> bad<00:03:13.510> blocks<00:03:13.750> from

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
with bad bad sectors bad blocks from

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.620 
with bad bad sectors bad blocks from
that<00:03:14.080> standpoint<00:03:14.260> for<00:03:14.650> wiping<00:03:15.070> them<00:03:15.250> but<00:03:15.940> any

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
that standpoint for wiping them but any

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.009 
that standpoint for wiping them but any
other<00:03:16.810> questions<00:03:18.269> so<00:03:19.269> anyway<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.720> think<00:03:19.810> this

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
other questions so anyway I think this

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.090 
other questions so anyway I think this
is<00:03:20.170> really<00:03:20.320> cool<00:03:20.560> I<00:03:20.620> think<00:03:20.739> this<00:03:20.950> is<00:03:21.010> the

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
is really cool I think this is the

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.800 
is really cool I think this is the
direction<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.609> everything's<00:03:22.150> going<00:03:22.510> with

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
direction that everything's going with

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.840 
direction that everything's going with
data<00:03:23.109> recovery<00:03:23.530> tools<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:23.890> so<00:03:24.579> we're<00:03:24.760> now

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
data recovery tools and so we're now

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.190 
data recovery tools and so we're now
actually<00:03:25.030> kind<00:03:25.420> of<00:03:25.480> getting<00:03:25.630> this<00:03:25.810> merger

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
actually kind of getting this merger

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.810 
actually kind of getting this merger
that<00:03:26.320> we<00:03:26.410> didn't<00:03:26.650> have<00:03:26.680> before<00:03:26.769> we<00:03:27.459> used<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.730> be

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
you have to do the drive and then you

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.449 
you have to do the drive and then you
have<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.650> go<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:29.829> do<00:03:29.920> something<00:03:29.980> like<00:03:30.160> run<00:03:30.340> our

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
studios or some other data recovery

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.569 
studios or some other data recovery
software<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.680> read<00:03:32.859> what<00:03:33.100> you've<00:03:33.250> recovered

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
blocks were which files like if I had 25

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.870
