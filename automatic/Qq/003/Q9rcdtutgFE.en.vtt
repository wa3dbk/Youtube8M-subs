disappointed thing is that they were so

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.220 
disappointed thing is that they were so
good<00:00:23.689> because<00:00:25.730> you<00:00:26.730> know<00:00:26.880> as<00:00:27.150> much<00:00:27.750> as<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.050> saw

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
him talk with it the table in Spain I

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.580 
him talk with it the table in Spain I
still<00:00:30.779> thought<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.199> know<00:00:31.349> Madrid<00:00:32.149> ambassador

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
still thought you know Madrid ambassador

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.950 
still thought you know Madrid ambassador
you<00:00:34.590> know<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:35.070> thought<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.180> first<00:00:36.450> tap<00:00:36.690> they

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
you know I thought the first tap they

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.869 
you know I thought the first tap they
didn't<00:00:37.320> look<00:00:37.440> great<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.430> thought<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.850> be

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
didn't look great and I thought it to be

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.160 
didn't look great and I thought it to be
honest<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.360> was<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.750> be<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.989> game

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
honest that was going to be the game

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.330 
honest that was going to be the game
where<00:00:40.350> they<00:00:40.440> would<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.680> their<00:00:40.860> best<00:00:41.040> that

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
where they would be their best that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.459 
where they would be their best that
they're<00:00:41.640> at<00:00:41.760> home<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:43.110> obviously<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:45.469> think

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
they're at home so obviously I I think

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.860 
they're at home so obviously I I think
in<00:00:46.739> my<00:00:46.920> head<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.489> thought<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.780> be

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
in my head I thought this is going to be

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.939 
in my head I thought this is going to be
a<00:00:48.899> lot<00:00:49.110> closer<00:00:49.410> than<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.860> ended<00:00:50.219> up<00:00:50.309> being

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
a lot closer than it ended up being

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.520 
a lot closer than it ended up being
because<00:00:52.949> second<00:00:53.460> half<00:00:53.750> they<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:55.050> turned<00:00:55.320> on

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
because second half they just turned on

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.209 
because second half they just turned on
the<00:00:55.680> style<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.309> they<00:00:56.550> were<00:00:57.140> incredible<00:00:58.219> first

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the style and they were incredible first

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.819 
the style and they were incredible first
happy<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.910> couldn't<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.899> started<00:01:01.350> any

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
happy it couldn't have started any

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.189 
happy it couldn't have started any
better<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.670> think<00:01:02.879> about<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.690> terms<00:01:03.750> of

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
better if you think about it in terms of

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.469 
better if you think about it in terms of
the<00:01:04.290> Torres<00:01:04.710> gold<00:01:05.070> although<00:01:05.880> even<00:01:06.119> before

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
the Torres gold although even before

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.100 
the Torres gold although even before
that<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.590> defense<00:01:07.979> didn't<00:01:08.580> seem<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.240> solid<00:01:09.930> as

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that the defense didn't seem as solid as

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.560 
that the defense didn't seem as solid as
the<00:01:10.409> gate<00:01:10.590> at<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.890> game<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.220> Liverpool<00:01:11.580> Gary

perspective this season we really really

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.870 
perspective this season we really really
do<00:03:48.570> we<00:03:49.570> are<00:03:49.930> in<00:03:50.320> that<00:03:50.769> we<00:03:50.860> got<00:03:51.010> two<00:03:51.130> semi-finals

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
do we are in that we got two semi-finals

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.590 
do we are in that we got two semi-finals
of<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.180> Champions<00:03:52.720> League<00:03:54.060> now<00:03:55.060> when<00:03:55.269> we<00:03:55.299> lost

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
of the Champions League now when we lost

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.060 
of the Champions League now when we lost
our<00:03:55.810> first<00:03:56.080> game<00:03:56.170> in<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.500> season<00:03:56.860> in<00:03:57.010> the

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
our first game in the season in the

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.850 
our first game in the season in the
Champions<00:03:57.459> League<00:03:57.489> against<00:03:58.209> Basel<00:03:58.600> I<00:03:59.110> think

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
Champions League against Basel I think

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.560 
Champions League against Basel I think
all<00:04:00.010> of<00:04:00.190> us<00:04:00.340> here<00:04:00.549> would<00:04:00.610> have<00:04:00.850> taken<00:04:01.060> against

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
all of us here would have taken against

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.050 
all of us here would have taken against
the<00:04:01.750> semi-finals<00:04:02.410> not<00:04:03.220> only<00:04:03.430> guessing<00:04:03.820> father

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
the semi-finals not only guessing father

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.610 
the semi-finals not only guessing father
had<00:04:04.420> a<00:04:04.450> really<00:04:04.780> good<00:04:05.110> chance<00:04:05.290> of<00:04:05.500> going

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
had a really good chance of going

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.380 
had a really good chance of going
through<00:04:06.040> because<00:04:06.459> it<00:04:06.670> when<00:04:06.820> that<00:04:06.940> first<00:04:07.090> go

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
through because it when that first go

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.550 
through because it when that first go
went<00:04:07.630> in<00:04:08.220> obviously<00:04:09.220> that<00:04:09.580> was<00:04:10.170> no<00:04:11.170> scored

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
went in obviously that was no scored

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.860 
went in obviously that was no scored

to do that there I think there will be
some<00:05:23.600> shakeups<00:05:24.169> in<00:05:24.289> the<00:05:24.380> summer<00:05:24.590> as<00:05:24.740> well<00:05:24.770> I

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
some shakeups in the summer as well I

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.610 
some shakeups in the summer as well I
expect<00:05:26.330> some<00:05:26.510> players<00:05:26.750> that<00:05:26.990> we<00:05:27.080> don't<00:05:27.350> expect

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
expect some players that we don't expect

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.670 
expect some players that we don't expect
to<00:05:27.800> leave<00:05:27.979> leave<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.430> club<00:05:28.640> and<00:05:29.380> I<00:05:30.380> think

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
to leave leave the club and I think

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.830 
to leave leave the club and I think
we're<00:05:30.800> going<00:05:30.919> to<00:05:31.039> see<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:32.090> foundation<00:05:32.810> of

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
we're going to see the foundation of

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.570 
we're going to see the foundation of
this<00:05:33.020> Caesar<00:05:33.350> makes<00:05:33.950> with<00:05:34.070> the<00:05:34.160> new<00:05:34.310> players

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
this Caesar makes with the new players

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.890 
this Caesar makes with the new players
and<00:05:34.880> I<00:05:35.030> think<00:05:35.060> it's<00:05:35.270> going<00:05:35.300> to<00:05:35.419> be<00:05:35.510> very<00:05:35.539> great

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
and I think it's going to be very great

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.270 
and I think it's going to be very great
so<00:05:35.930> again<00:05:36.289> you've<00:05:36.440> got<00:05:36.560> to<00:05:36.680> semi-final<00:05:37.190> with

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
so again you've got to semi-final with

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.890 
so again you've got to semi-final with
this<00:05:37.400> squad<00:05:37.669> this<00:05:37.970> is<00:05:38.090> what<00:05:38.180> we<00:05:38.300> do<00:05:38.450> with<00:05:38.870> a

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
this squad this is what we do with a

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.120 
this squad this is what we do with a
good<00:05:39.110> you<00:05:39.260> can<00:05:39.380> sort<00:05:39.560> of<00:05:39.650> squad<00:05:39.860> and<00:05:40.070> I'm

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130

but I think yourself a little bit
socially<00:06:22.039> doing<00:06:22.400> that<00:06:22.520> so<00:06:22.759> it<00:06:23.060> probably<00:06:23.330> will

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:23.569 
socially doing that so it probably will

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:25.739 
socially doing that so it probably will
be<00:06:23.629> trophy<00:06:24.080> that's<00:06:24.169> this<00:06:24.349> season<00:06:24.770> but
