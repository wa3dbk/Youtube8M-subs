00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
not give anything back and they're just

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.340 
not give anything back and they're just
looking<00:00:33.120> for<00:00:33.359> a<00:00:33.539> really<00:00:33.750> good<00:00:33.899> children's

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
looking for a really good children's

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.939 
looking for a really good children's
program<00:00:34.800> you're<00:00:35.460> gonna<00:00:35.609> find<00:00:35.909> that<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.949> it

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
program you're gonna find that that it

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.759 
program you're gonna find that that it
just<00:00:38.190> basically<00:00:38.399> turns<00:00:39.059> into<00:00:39.479> a<00:00:40.019> really

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
just basically turns into a really

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:42.559 
just basically turns into a really
difficult<00:00:41.100> environment<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:41.999> start<00:00:42.239> small

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:42.569 
difficult environment to start small

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:44.509 
difficult environment to start small
groups<00:00:42.870> because<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.620> see<00:00:43.829> small<00:00:44.039> groups<00:00:44.339> are

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
groups because you see small groups are

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.029 
groups because you see small groups are
for<00:00:44.699> producers<00:00:45.300> they're<00:00:46.019> not<00:00:46.199> for<00:00:46.409> consumers

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
for producers they're not for consumers

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.399 
for producers they're not for consumers
and<00:00:47.280> if<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.789> really<00:00:47.999> want<00:00:48.269> your<00:00:48.510> church<00:00:49.019> to

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
and if you really want your church to

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.509 
and if you really want your church to

that mission has to be very compelling
to<00:01:21.600> them<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.110> then<00:01:22.740> when<00:01:23.010> you<00:01:23.130> give<00:01:23.400> them<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.660 
to them and then when you give them a
small<00:01:24.030> group<00:01:24.420> they'll<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.900> compelled<00:01:25.440> to<00:01:25.860> be

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
small group they'll be compelled to be

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
time and in a chapter one you know they

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.850 
time and in a chapter one you know they
died<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.240> worked<00:01:33.480> very<00:01:33.630> hard<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> book<00:01:34.470> not

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
died I worked very hard in the book not

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.520 
died I worked very hard in the book not
to<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.400> diagnose<00:01:35.910> the<00:01:36.120> problem<00:01:36.660> and<00:01:36.840> point

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
to just diagnose the problem and point

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.470 
to just diagnose the problem and point
fingers<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:38.070> people<00:01:38.100> as<00:01:38.550> to<00:01:38.700> why<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:38.910> to<00:01:39.270> offer

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
fingers at people as to why but to offer

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.420 
fingers at people as to why but to offer
solution<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.560> Chapter<00:01:40.920> one<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.100> talked

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
solution so in Chapter one I talked

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
nutshell if you can get your people

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.100 
nutshell if you can get your people
praying<00:01:46.250> with<00:01:47.250> one<00:01:47.520> another<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.390> their<00:01:48.810> homes

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
praying with one another in their homes

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.250 
praying with one another in their homes
for<00:01:49.530> five<00:01:50.280> or<00:01:50.460> six<00:01:50.730> weeks<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.659> will<00:01:51.780> find<00:01:52.080> that

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
for five or six weeks you will find that

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.930 
for five or six weeks you will find that
many<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.950> them<00:01:53.159> will<00:01:53.250> find<00:01:53.490> personal

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
many of them will find personal

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.880 
many of them will find personal
transformation<00:01:54.270> because<00:01:54.990> they're<00:01:55.170> finally

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
transformation because they're finally

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.790 
transformation because they're finally
