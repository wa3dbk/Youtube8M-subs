I'm in the philosophy department looking

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.070 
I'm in the philosophy department looking
at<00:00:12.300> philosophy<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:13.139> time<00:00:13.370> my<00:00:14.370> PhD<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.179> in<00:00:15.240> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
at philosophy of time my PhD is in the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.720 
at philosophy of time my PhD is in the
relationship<00:00:16.650> between<00:00:16.800> time<00:00:17.279> travel

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
relationship between time travel

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.359 
relationship between time travel
causation<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.690> direction<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.199> time<00:00:19.470> time

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
causation in the direction of time time

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.179 
causation in the direction of time time
travel<00:00:20.760> being<00:00:20.939> understood<00:00:21.570> as<00:00:22.189> localized

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
travel being understood as localized

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.310 
travel being understood as localized
regions<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.910> space-time<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.750> which<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
regions of space-time in which the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.890 
regions of space-time in which the
direction<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.859> time<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.430> perhaps<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:27.000> opposite

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
direction of time is perhaps of opposite

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.720 
direction of time is perhaps of opposite
to<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.349> other<00:00:28.769> regions<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.460> space-time

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
to that of other regions of space-time

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.089 
to that of other regions of space-time
and<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.660> I'm<00:00:30.810> interested<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.439> how<00:00:31.679> those

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
and so I'm interested in how those

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.090 
and so I'm interested in how those
localized<00:00:32.669> regions<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.390> space-time<00:00:34.260> what's

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
localized regions of space-time what's

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.860 
localized regions of space-time what's
going<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.700> those<00:00:35.790> regions<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.570> watch

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
going on in those regions and watch

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.290 
going on in those regions and watch
what's<00:00:37.620> happening<00:00:37.920> with<00:00:38.040> causation<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:39.059> those

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
what's happening with causation in those

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.500 
what's happening with causation in those
regions<00:00:40.550> I've<00:00:41.550> been<00:00:41.820> interested<00:00:42.210> in

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
regions I've been interested in

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.979 
regions I've been interested in
philosophy<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.559> time<00:00:44.239> since<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.450> started<00:00:45.719> doing

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
philosophy of time since I started doing

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.600 
philosophy of time since I started doing
philosophy<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.129> I've<00:00:47.219> kind<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.550> been

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
philosophy and I've kind of been

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.160 
philosophy and I've kind of been
interested<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.329> issues<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.289> do<00:00:49.410> with<00:00:49.559> time<00:00:49.950> I

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
interested in issues to do with time I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.310 
interested in issues to do with time I
guess<00:00:52.170> since<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.530> was<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> kid<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:54.110> the<00:00:55.110> great

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
guess since I was a kid and so the great

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.080 
guess since I was a kid and so the great
thing<00:00:55.500> about<00:00:55.620> doing<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.070> PhD<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.969> can

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
thing about doing a PhD is that you can

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.010 
thing about doing a PhD is that you can
kind<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.420> design<00:00:57.629> your<00:00:58.020> own<00:00:58.140> PhD<00:00:58.649> topic<00:00:59.309> and

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
kind of design your own PhD topic and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.420 
kind of design your own PhD topic and
research<00:01:01.020> into<00:01:01.379> something<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.770> interests

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430

when<00:02:05.070> you're<00:02:05.219> an<00:02:05.310> undergraduate<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:06.060> kind<00:02:06.450> of

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.300 
when you're an undergraduate you kind of
know<00:02:06.719> how<00:02:06.990> you're<00:02:07.170> doing<00:02:07.530> because<00:02:07.680> everybody

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
know how you're doing because everybody

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.880 
know how you're doing because everybody
has<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> same<00:02:08.819> essay<00:02:09.209> question<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.899> so

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
has the same essay question and so

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.980 
has the same essay question and so
you<00:02:11.220> can<00:02:11.430> compare<00:02:11.850> your<00:02:12.060> own<00:02:12.240> progress<00:02:12.569> to

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
you can compare your own progress to

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.830 
you can compare your own progress to
other<00:02:13.110> people<00:02:13.590> but<00:02:14.160> when<00:02:14.340> you're<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.840> PhD

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
other people but when you're a PhD

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.290 
other people but when you're a PhD
student<00:02:15.900> or<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.350> research<00:02:16.709> student<00:02:17.069> just<00:02:17.760> this

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
student or a research student just this

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.180 
student or a research student just this
can<00:02:18.510> be<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.660> lot<00:02:18.810> harder<00:02:19.050> because<00:02:19.350> it's<00:02:19.650> really

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
can be a lot harder because it's really

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.949 
can be a lot harder because it's really
hard<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.580> compare<00:02:20.760> how<00:02:21.240> you're<00:02:21.480> doing<00:02:21.810> with

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
and stuff but it's still really helpful

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.750 
and stuff but it's still really helpful
just<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.140> meet<00:02:28.350> with<00:02:28.380> your<00:02:28.830> supervisors<00:02:29.580> and
