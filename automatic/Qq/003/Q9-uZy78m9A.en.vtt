but<00:02:34.370> yep<00:02:36.530> next<00:02:37.530> step<00:02:37.800> would<00:02:37.950> be<00:02:38.010> tires<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:39.300> I

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
but yep next step would be tires and I

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.220 
but yep next step would be tires and I
got<00:02:39.990> to<00:02:40.080> get<00:02:40.170> an<00:02:40.260> alignment<00:02:40.530> on<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.920> front<00:02:42.230> the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
got to get an alignment on the front the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.430 
got to get an alignment on the front the
alignment<00:02:43.650> horrible<00:02:47.210> but<00:02:48.210> I<00:02:48.540> painted<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.260> cab

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
alignment horrible but I painted the cab

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.160 
alignment horrible but I painted the cab
lights<00:02:50.150> bright<00:02:51.150> red<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:53.959> think<00:02:54.959> it'll<00:02:55.110> look

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
lights bright red I think it'll look

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.010 
lights bright red I think it'll look
pretty<00:02:55.410> good<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.709> think<00:02:55.890> it'll<00:02:56.130> add<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.580> the

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
pretty good I think it'll add to the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.150 
pretty good I think it'll add to the
little<00:02:58.020> bit<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.230> red<00:02:58.380> here<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.800> know<00:02:58.920> just

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
little bit of red here you know just

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.890 
little bit of red here you know just
like<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.670> painted<00:03:00.000> dump<00:03:00.209> truck<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.450> see<00:03:00.810> my

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
like a painted dump truck and see my

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.470 
like a painted dump truck and see my
little<00:03:01.140> holder<00:03:01.470> for<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.709> screws<00:03:02.040> just

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
little holder for the screws just

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.990 
little holder for the screws just
screwed<00:03:03.480> him<00:03:03.570> into<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.810> coffee<00:03:04.380> cup<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:05.490> now

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
screwed him into a coffee cup and now

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.210 
screwed him into a coffee cup and now
yeah<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.450> mirrors<00:03:06.890> painted<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:07.950> mirrors

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
yeah the mirrors painted the mirrors

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.140 
yeah the mirrors painted the mirrors
flat<00:03:08.520> black

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
flat black

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.949 
flat black
I<00:03:10.220> think<00:03:11.220> that'll<00:03:11.520> add<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.880> little<00:03:12.090> contrast<00:03:12.720> to

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
I think that'll add a little contrast to

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.980 
I think that'll add a little contrast to
the<00:03:13.080> gloss<00:03:13.530> black<00:03:14.360> you<00:03:15.360> see<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:15.690> got<00:03:15.840> the

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
the gloss black you see you got the

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.170 
the gloss black you see you got the
grill<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.590> lights<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.670> everything<00:03:17.880> that's

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
grill and lights and everything that's

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.470 
grill and lights and everything that's
all<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.540> trim<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:19.080> goes<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.560> tailgate

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
all the trim that goes to the tailgate

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.640 
all the trim that goes to the tailgate
it's<00:03:21.480> kind<00:03:21.660> of<00:03:21.750> going<00:03:21.959> for<00:03:22.110> a<00:03:22.200> look<00:03:22.350> kind<00:03:22.620> of

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
it's kind of going for a look kind of

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.830 
it's kind of going for a look kind of
like<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:22.950> dump<00:03:23.160> truck<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:24.030> my<00:03:24.330> brother's<00:03:24.660> new
