square feet some people are really

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.790 
square feet some people are really
radical<00:00:53.900> to<00:00:54.019> say<00:00:54.110> it's<00:00:54.230> under<00:00:54.500> a<00:00:54.530> hundred

even<00:00:58.820> a<00:00:59.030> small<00:00:59.360> house<00:00:59.540> I<00:01:01.059> think<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.390> thing

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
even a small house I think the thing

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.240 
even a small house I think the thing
that<00:01:02.720> appeals<00:01:03.409> to<00:01:03.890> folks<00:01:04.159> is<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:05.540> idea<00:01:06.020> of<00:01:06.380> not

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
that appeals to folks is the idea of not

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.820 
that appeals to folks is the idea of not
having<00:01:07.280> to<00:01:07.729> have<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:08.240> lot<00:01:08.570> of<00:01:08.600> stuff<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.380> a<00:01:09.590> lot

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
having to have a lot of stuff and a lot

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.550 
having to have a lot of stuff and a lot
of<00:01:09.860> space<00:01:10.400> for<00:01:10.790> stuff<00:01:11.180> it<00:01:11.780> starts<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.380> feel

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
of space for stuff it starts to feel

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.250 
of space for stuff it starts to feel
like<00:01:12.770> your<00:01:12.950> stuff<00:01:13.250> owns<00:01:13.549> you<00:01:13.940> so<00:01:14.630> I<00:01:14.869> did<00:01:15.229> a

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
like your stuff owns you so I did a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.380 
like your stuff owns you so I did a
rough<00:01:15.560> sketch<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:16.369> I<00:01:16.490> brought<00:01:16.729> it<00:01:16.850> over<00:01:16.940> to<00:01:17.240> my

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
rough sketch and I brought it over to my

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.420 
rough sketch and I brought it over to my
neighbor<00:01:17.659> who<00:01:18.110> knows<00:01:18.710> how<00:01:18.890> to<00:01:19.010> do<00:01:19.130> everything

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.800 

well<00:01:25.190> believe<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:25.520> or<00:01:25.700> not<00:01:25.850> as<00:01:26.119> a<00:01:26.150> tiny<00:01:26.510> house

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
thing that really changed is being

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.900 
thing that really changed is being
really<00:02:45.870> conscious<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.380> water<00:02:46.710> use<00:02:47.010> because

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
really conscious of water use because

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.720 
really conscious of water use because
I'm<00:02:48.540> hauling<00:02:49.320> all<00:02:49.440> of<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.800> and<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.550> it's

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
I'm hauling all of it and it and it's

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.550 
I'm hauling all of it and it and it's
not<00:02:51.120> difficult<00:02:51.690> once<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.960> have<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.110> system

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
not difficult once you have a system

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.290 
not difficult once you have a system
figured<00:02:52.890> out<00:02:53.040> but<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.250> start<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.730> realize<00:02:54.120> how

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
figured out but you start to realize how

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.120 
figured out but you start to realize how
much<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.690> started<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.320> realize<00:02:55.560> how<00:02:55.770> much<00:02:55.890> water

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
much I started to realize how much water

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.240 
much I started to realize how much water
I<00:02:56.220> wasted<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:59.720> would<00:03:00.720> say<00:03:00.990> you<00:03:01.860> know<00:03:01.950> there's<00:03:02.190> a

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
I wasted I would say you know there's a

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.400 
I wasted I would say you know there's a
whole<00:03:02.670> mixture<00:03:03.180> of<00:03:03.390> people<00:03:03.720> from<00:03:03.960> folks<00:03:04.200> who

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
whole mixture of people from folks who

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.340 
whole mixture of people from folks who
are<00:03:04.680> interested<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:06.270> it<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.900> folks<00:03:07.140> who<00:03:07.320> are

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
are interested in it to folks who are

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.180 
are interested in it to folks who are
building<00:03:08.040> one<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:09.830> everybody<00:03:10.830> kind<00:03:11.070> of<00:03:11.130> comes

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
building one and everybody kind of comes

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.700 
building one and everybody kind of comes
at<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.850> slightly<00:03:12.450> differently<00:03:13.080> but<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.440> would

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
at it slightly differently but I would

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.280 
at it slightly differently but I would
say<00:03:14.040> there's<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:14.910> real<00:03:15.180> appeal<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.990> kind<00:03:16.200> of

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
say there's a real appeal to kind of

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.290 
say there's a real appeal to kind of
minimalism<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:20.220> know<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.370> live<00:03:20.790> with<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.090> rule

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
minimalism you know I live with the rule

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.090 
minimalism you know I live with the rule
if<00:03:22.140> something<00:03:22.410> comes<00:03:22.590> in<00:03:22.740> the<00:03:22.800> front<00:03:22.950> door

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
if something comes in the front door

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.830 
if something comes in the front door
something<00:03:23.940> else<00:03:24.120> has<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.360> go<00:03:24.570> out<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.690> back

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
something else has to go out the back

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.260 
something else has to go out the back
because<00:03:25.380> there's<00:03:25.710> no<00:03:25.890> room<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.340> add<00:03:26.490> stuff<00:03:27.030> I

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
because there's no room to add stuff I

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.540 
because there's no room to add stuff I
don't<00:03:27.390> want<00:03:27.710> to<00:03:28.710> you<00:03:29.040> know<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.160> have<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.340> small

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
don't want to you know I have a small

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.760 
don't want to you know I have a small
cluttered<00:03:30.180> space<00:03:30.570> either<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:30.990> want<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.530> feel

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
cluttered space either I want it to feel

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.010 
cluttered space either I want it to feel
really<00:03:32.250> good<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.670> open<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.330> then<00:03:33.690> there's

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
really good and open and then there's

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.840 
really good and open and then there's
all<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.530> discussion<00:03:35.040> about<00:03:35.130> put<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.760> on

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
all the discussion about put it on

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.450 
all the discussion about put it on
wheels<00:03:36.060> not<00:03:36.450> on<00:03:36.630> wheels<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:37.740> have<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.890> loft<00:03:38.190> to

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
wheels not on wheels to have a loft to

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.370 
wheels not on wheels to have a loft to
have<00:03:38.550> built-ins<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.240> have<00:03:39.330> modular<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:40.290> know

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
have built-ins to have modular you know

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.830 
have built-ins to have modular you know
all<00:03:40.830> of<00:03:41.040> those<00:03:41.160> things<00:03:41.520> are<00:03:41.840> lively

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
all of those things are lively

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.470 
all of those things are lively
discussions<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:44.250> kind<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.730> behooves<00:03:45.090> people

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
discussions it kind of behooves people

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.980 
discussions it kind of behooves people
they're<00:03:45.630> really<00:03:45.660> read<00:03:46.620> your<00:03:46.650> zoning<00:03:47.100> you<00:03:47.670> know

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
they're really read your zoning you know

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.810 
they're really read your zoning you know
before<00:03:48.990> you<00:03:49.230> start<00:03:49.740> working<00:03:50.070> on<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.550> project

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
before you start working on a project

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.270 
before you start working on a project
and<00:03:51.390> don't<00:03:51.750> make<00:03:51.840> any<00:03:51.900> assumptions<00:03:52.530> I<00:03:53.040> went

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
and don't make any assumptions I went

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.680 
and don't make any assumptions I went
through<00:03:53.520> planning<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:53.940> zoning<00:03:54.030> and

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
through planning and zoning and

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.110 
through planning and zoning and
everything<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:56.070> I<00:03:56.100> needed<00:03:56.490> to<00:03:56.610> do<00:03:56.760> so<00:03:57.000> it's

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
everything that I needed to do so it's

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.050 
everything that I needed to do so it's
all<00:03:57.330> on<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.660> up<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:57.990> up<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.640> it<00:03:59.640> was

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
all on the up and up and it was

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.810 
all on the up and up and it was
initially<00:04:00.330> on<00:04:00.480> wheels<00:04:00.810> it's<00:04:01.170> set<00:04:01.470> down<00:04:01.710> I<00:04:02.520> had

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
initially on wheels it's set down I had

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.750 
initially on wheels it's set down I had
to<00:04:02.850> get<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.090> variance<00:04:03.570> for<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:03.990> property<00:04:04.760> but

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
to get a variance for the property but

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.170 
to get a variance for the property but
the<00:04:05.910> size<00:04:06.270> was<00:04:07.050> not<00:04:07.080> an<00:04:07.410> issue<00:04:07.590> at<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.250> time<00:04:08.580> I

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
the size was not an issue at the time I

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.030 
the size was not an issue at the time I
believe<00:04:09.660> since<00:04:09.990> then<00:04:10.230> there<00:04:10.440> is<00:04:10.530> now<00:04:10.740> a

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
believe since then there is now a

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.890 
believe since then there is now a
minimum<00:04:11.550> square<00:04:11.880> footage<00:04:12.270> so<00:04:12.300> that<00:04:12.540> would<00:04:12.780> be

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
minimum square footage so that would be

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.110 
minimum square footage so that would be
something<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.290> check<00:04:13.710> and<00:04:14.430> sometimes<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.000> way

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
something to check and sometimes the way

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.150 
something to check and sometimes the way
around<00:04:15.390> that<00:04:15.570> is<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:15.750> keep<00:04:16.590> your<00:04:16.739> house<00:04:16.920> on

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
around that is to keep your house on

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.150 
around that is to keep your house on
wheels<00:04:20.270> you<00:04:21.270> know<00:04:21.390> if<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.870> tiny<00:04:22.410> house<00:04:22.680> can<00:04:22.980> be
