over<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.680> nostrils<00:02:01.160> I'll<00:02:01.460> draw<00:02:02.000> a<00:02:02.030> little

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
over the nostrils I'll draw a little

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.800 
over the nostrils I'll draw a little
curve<00:02:02.830> then<00:02:03.830> it's<00:02:04.130> time<00:02:04.400> for<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.730> big<00:02:05.030> hippo

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
curve then it's time for the big hippo

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.850 
curve then it's time for the big hippo
teeth<00:02:06.080> and<00:02:06.610> when<00:02:07.610> they<00:02:07.910> are<00:02:08.090> in<00:02:08.210> place<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.869> think

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
teeth and when they are in place I think

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.190 
teeth and when they are in place I think
you<00:02:10.040> can<00:02:10.220> see<00:02:10.490> that<00:02:10.729> it<00:02:10.850> looks<00:02:10.880> like<00:02:11.300> a<00:02:11.330> hippo

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.370 

then<00:02:15.200> it's<00:02:15.410> time<00:02:15.710> for<00:02:15.740> arms<00:02:16.280> legs<00:02:17.080> first<00:02:18.080> your
