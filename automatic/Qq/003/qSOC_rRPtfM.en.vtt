come<00:05:36.700> out<00:05:36.820> they're<00:05:36.940> not<00:05:37.000> gonna<00:05:37.150> do<00:05:37.300> that

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
come out they're not gonna do that

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.670 
come out they're not gonna do that
they're<00:05:37.630> looking<00:05:37.750> at<00:05:37.960> the<00:05:38.110> ground<00:05:38.290> all<00:05:38.620> the

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
they're looking at the ground all the

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.100 
they're looking at the ground all the
time<00:05:38.950> but<00:05:39.640> just<00:05:39.670> in<00:05:39.880> case<00:05:39.910> be<00:05:40.420> safe<00:05:40.630> but<00:05:40.990> it

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
time but just in case be safe but it

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.360 
time but just in case be safe but it
isn't<00:05:41.410> really<00:05:41.500> the<00:05:41.590> kind<00:05:41.740> of<00:05:41.890> laser<00:05:42.040> that<00:05:42.310> can

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
isn't really the kind of laser that can

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.640 
isn't really the kind of laser that can
really<00:05:43.030> I<00:05:43.180> don't<00:05:43.240> think<00:05:43.390> can<00:05:43.720> blind<00:05:44.050> an<00:05:44.260> animal

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
really I don't think can blind an animal

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.190 
really I don't think can blind an animal
but<00:05:44.890> just<00:05:45.100> for<00:05:45.370> precautions<00:05:45.970> don't<00:05:46.600> get<00:05:47.020> it<00:05:47.110> in

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
but just for precautions don't get it in

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.430 
but just for precautions don't get it in
their<00:05:47.290> eyes

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
their eyes

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.860 
their eyes
take<00:05:47.800> it<00:05:47.980> hit<00:05:48.550> the<00:05:48.670> button<00:05:49.120> point<00:05:49.660> out<00:05:49.780> the

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
take it hit the button point out the

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.800 
take it hit the button point out the
ground<00:05:50.080> and<00:05:50.380> let<00:05:50.860> your<00:05:51.100> dog<00:05:51.280> go<00:05:51.640> insane<00:05:52.120> and<00:05:52.630> he

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
ground and let your dog go insane and he

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:58.500 
ground and let your dog go insane and he
will<00:05:53.050> or<00:05:53.590> cat<00:05:55.560> it's<00:05:56.560> very<00:05:56.860> fun<00:05:57.280> and<00:05:58.060> it<00:05:58.240> is<00:05:58.270> a

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
will or cat it's very fun and it is a

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.010 
will or cat it's very fun and it is a
shortcut<00:05:59.140> I<00:05:59.470> think<00:05:59.950> all<00:06:00.250> animals<00:06:00.730> should<00:06:01.330> get

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
shortcut I think all animals should get

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.920 
shortcut I think all animals should get
proper<00:06:02.530> exercise<00:06:03.190> every<00:06:03.580> single<00:06:03.610> day<00:06:03.940> just
