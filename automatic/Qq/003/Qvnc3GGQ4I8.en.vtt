00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.190 

lot<00:00:05.790> of<00:00:05.850> positives<00:00:06.299> from<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.600> game<00:00:06.779> you<00:00:07.109> know

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
lot of positives from the game you know

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.110 
lot of positives from the game you know
I<00:00:07.230> thought<00:00:07.710> tactically<00:00:08.309> we<00:00:08.490> did<00:00:08.639> exactly<00:00:08.820> what

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
I thought tactically we did exactly what

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.540 
I thought tactically we did exactly what
we<00:00:09.269> try<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:09.960> do<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:11.040> think<00:00:11.070> particularly

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
we try to do and I think particularly

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.509 
we try to do and I think particularly
well<00:00:12.059> both<00:00:12.450> half<00:00:12.660> 3<00:00:12.960> for<00:00:12.990> much<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.219> game<00:00:14.340> we

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
well both half 3 for much of the game we

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.640 
well both half 3 for much of the game we
pinned<00:00:14.790> Holland<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.900> little<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.470> half

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
pinned Holland in the little in half

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.210 
pinned Holland in the little in half
which<00:00:16.920> we<00:00:17.160> was<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> rim<00:00:18.359> we<00:00:19.020> created<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:20.070> know<00:00:20.189> a

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
which we was a rim we created you know a

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.759 
which we was a rim we created you know a
considerable<00:00:20.699> number<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:21.060> chances<00:00:21.769> probably

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
considerable number of chances probably

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
considerable number of chances probably
I<00:00:22.800> should<00:00:23.010> have<00:00:23.039> made<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.279> score<00:00:23.550> line<00:00:23.760> a

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
I should have made the score line a

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.480 
I should have made the score line a
little<00:00:24.000> bit<00:00:24.150> more<00:00:24.359> decisive<00:00:25.050> but<00:00:25.740> there<00:00:26.400> was

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
little bit more decisive but there was

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.490 
little bit more decisive but there was
some<00:00:26.640> really<00:00:26.970> spirited<00:00:27.750> defending<00:00:28.260> from

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
some really spirited defending from

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.529 
some really spirited defending from
Holland<00:00:28.830> as<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.160> expect<00:00:29.519> from<00:00:30.029> these<00:00:30.210> teams

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
Holland as we expect from these teams

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.510 
Holland as we expect from these teams
but<00:00:31.230> when<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.500> consider<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:32.279> know<00:00:32.309> we've

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
but when you consider you know we've

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.030 
but when you consider you know we've
actually<00:00:32.700> made<00:00:33.000> ten<00:00:33.570> ten<00:00:34.230> changes<00:00:34.710> from<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
actually made ten ten changes from the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.130 
actually made ten ten changes from the
team<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.430> played<00:00:35.640> against<00:00:36.000> Germany<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.570> was

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
team that played against Germany I was

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.660 
team that played against Germany I was
very<00:00:37.320> pleased<00:00:37.649> with<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.950> performance<00:00:38.100> I

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
very pleased with the performance I

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.930 
very pleased with the performance I
think<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.149> was<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.390> overall<00:00:40.350> good<00:00:40.590> match<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:41.370> us

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
think it was a overall good match for us

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.790 
think it was a overall good match for us
I<00:00:42.540> think<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.809> saw<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> different<00:00:43.170> side<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
I think we saw a different side in the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.920 
I think we saw a different side in the
Netherlands<00:00:44.370> wanting<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.329> possess<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.780> ball

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
Netherlands wanting to possess the ball

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.590 
Netherlands wanting to possess the ball
knock<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.950> around<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.280> bit<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:48.090> think<00:00:48.510> we

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
knock it around a bit I think we

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.299 
knock it around a bit I think we
adjusted<00:00:49.170> our<00:00:50.160> style<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:51.600> get<00:00:52.500> some<00:00:52.710> goals<00:00:52.920> it

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
adjusted our style to get some goals it

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.740 
adjusted our style to get some goals it
took<00:00:53.820> us<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.030> little<00:00:54.120> while<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.390> get<00:00:54.480> into<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
took us a little while to get into the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.139 
took us a little while to get into the
rhythm<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.469> thought<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.860> overall<00:00:56.100> team<00:00:57.000> did

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
rhythm but I thought it overall team did

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.639 
rhythm but I thought it overall team did
pretty<00:00:57.270> well<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.809> was<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> really<00:00:58.170> physical

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
pretty well it was a really physical

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.590 
pretty well it was a really physical
match<00:00:58.829> they<00:00:59.399> were<00:00:59.460> you<00:01:00.030> know<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.149> our<00:01:00.420> backs

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
match they were you know on our backs

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.779 
match they were you know on our backs
the<00:01:00.809> whole<00:01:00.960> game<00:01:01.199> um<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.160> we<00:01:02.640> were<00:01:02.730> just

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
the whole game um and we were just

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.910 
the whole game um and we were just
trying<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.210> hold<00:01:03.359> him<00:01:03.510> off<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.260> put<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
trying to hold him off and we put on the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.050 
trying to hold him off and we put on the
other<00:01:05.129> side<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:05.430> put<00:01:05.549> him<00:01:05.670> under<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.850> lot<00:01:06.030> of

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
other side we put him under a lot of

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.880 
other side we put him under a lot of
pressure<00:01:06.330> when<00:01:06.659> they<00:01:06.900> had<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> ball<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.860> i

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
pressure when they had the ball so i

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.830 
pressure when they had the ball so i
think<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.460> both<00:01:08.729> ways<00:01:08.760> well<00:01:09.600> we

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
think it was going both ways well we

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.210 
think it was going both ways well we
kind<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.140> knew<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.530> they<00:01:10.619> were<00:01:10.740> gonna<00:01:10.920> try

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
kind of knew that they were gonna try

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.010 
kind of knew that they were gonna try
and<00:01:11.430> build<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.700> out<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.880> there<00:01:12.330> outside<00:01:12.600> back

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
and build it out of there outside back

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.109 
and build it out of there outside back
so<00:01:13.380> they<00:01:13.560> out<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.369> goal<00:01:14.549> kick<00:01:14.790> they<00:01:14.970> would

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
so they out of the goal kick they would

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.700 
so they out of the goal kick they would
peel<00:01:15.570> there<00:01:15.780> outside<00:01:15.900> back<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.500> line

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
peel there outside back to the line

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.289 
peel there outside back to the line
almost<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.430> then<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.729> would<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:17.970> stretched

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
almost and then we would be stretched

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
almost and then we would be stretched
and<00:01:18.570> sometimes<00:01:18.960> they<00:01:19.110> found<00:01:19.350> us<00:01:19.530> or<00:01:19.979> they

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
and sometimes they found us or they

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.130 
and sometimes they found us or they
found<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> seams<00:01:20.759> but<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.689> most<00:01:21.840> part<00:01:21.930> we

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
found the seams but for the most part we

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.020 
found the seams but for the most part we
did<00:01:22.259> pretty<00:01:22.380> well<00:01:22.500> from<00:01:23.070> my<00:01:23.250> perspective<00:01:23.430> it's

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
this team and no matter who's on the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.740 
this team and no matter who's on the
field<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.189> worked<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.610> hard<00:02:05.640> we<00:02:06.360> try<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.570> make

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
field we worked so hard we try to make

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.510

each<00:02:06.780> other<00:02:06.930> look<00:02:07.140> good

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.979 
each other look good
and<00:02:07.609> I<00:02:07.850> think<00:02:07.909> that<00:02:08.300> in<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.599> end<00:02:08.629> of<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:08.869> day

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
and I think that in the end of the day

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.050 
and I think that in the end of the day
that's<00:02:09.170> why<00:02:09.410> we<00:02:09.590> can<00:02:09.769> come<00:02:10.310> out<00:02:10.429> with<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.580> fully

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
that's why we can come out with a fully

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.750 
that's why we can come out with a fully
new<00:02:11.239> roster<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:12.560> still<00:02:13.099> put<00:02:13.400> up<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.610> good

to go to the World Cup and I think just

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.680 
to go to the World Cup and I think just
fixing<00:02:46.040> these<00:02:46.130> quality<00:02:46.610> quality<00:02:47.090> European

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
fixing these quality quality European

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.130 
fixing these quality quality European
teams<00:02:48.230> will<00:02:48.890> only<00:02:49.010> help<00:02:49.190> us<00:02:49.459> only<00:02:49.870> allow<00:02:50.870> us<00:02:51.019> to

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140

grow<00:02:51.319> as<00:02:51.440> a<00:02:51.470> team<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:52.040> allow<00:02:52.250> us<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.489> identify

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
grow as a team and allow us to identify

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.150 
grow as a team and allow us to identify
type<00:02:53.690> of<00:02:53.840> players<00:02:54.049> that<00:02:54.200> really<00:02:54.769> can<00:02:54.920> emerge

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
type of players that really can emerge

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.550

in<00:02:55.370> these<00:02:55.519> types<00:02:55.730> of<00:02:55.849> matches<00:02:56.349> so<00:02:57.349> I<00:02:57.380> think

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
in these types of matches so I think

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.319 
in these types of matches so I think
there's<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:57.950> ways<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.400> go<00:02:58.579> but<00:02:58.910> it's<00:02:58.970> always

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
there's a ways to go but it's always

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.630 
there's a ways to go but it's always
good<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.540> get<00:02:59.750> in<00:03:00.019> a<00:03:00.590> quality<00:03:00.950> side<00:03:01.160> a<00:03:01.190> quality
