00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello to all channels as they are gervais 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.040
 commenting and well today I bring you a 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.420
 small analysis of the game mode of 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.790
 agent hunter who are in racing and 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.010
 vol 6 so that those who do not know this 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.780
 joló mode you can unlock once 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.380
 you finish any game campaign 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:26.140
 either with lyon with gray or with jake 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.320
 will be available this mode left which 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.360
 It is quite entertaining and has its pros 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.319
 as it also has its cons there is 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.269
 say it has some flaws but good 

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:40.200
 it is served by commenting on the course 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:42.810
 of the video and first of all 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.150
 the goal or what you have to what 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.010
 try this game mode is that you go to 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.200
 to be able to play like any creature 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.820
 any enemy can become a 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.100
 zombie you can become a flame 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.360
 You can become a dog 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.850
 enough monsters that appear 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.400
 when you go when the campaign and you go to 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:09.070
 be able to play or enter the game of 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:12.350
 anyone who has activated the 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.540
 agent hunter mode this is about 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.110
 be able to join your game and you will be able to 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.200
 try to end his with his life of 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.940
 try to defeat him at that moment what 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.990
 which is a pretty start idea 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.970
 chida pretty impressive I 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.369
 true when I heard they were going to put 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.229
 a game mode so I got excited said 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:38.180
 wow something like that was needed in these in 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.009
 These games enable roles that had the 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.110
 could you be could do the 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.520
 antagonist and that you could try to 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.670
 chiner to those who are playing online 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.570
 and then yes as I comment basically 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.920
 the idea is pretty chiva but now the 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.410
 problem lies is that even if you get 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.100
 to zero can be any enemy the 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:04.070
 movement of your enemies is very but 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.600
 very clumsy for example when you play with 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.409
 the zombies when you play being a 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.599
 zombie 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.599
 you are awkward slow 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:17.060
 it's really incredibly difficult 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.430
 handle an enemy which many 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.140
 You can say that it's okay they say 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.390
 obviously it has to be difficult to 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.980
 handle an enemy if you will not kill 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.800
 very easy to santana los 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.260
 protagonists 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.530
 and then if they are quite right in part 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.210
 obviously they had to do the one 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.690
 move is very clumsy so you can not 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:43.340
 kill the agents so easily but 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:47.390
 in truth this is an exaggeration is 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.580
 very exaggerated you are very slow the camera 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.650
 time 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:57.580
 clumsy but at extreme levels if by 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.160
 if playing normal the campaign with the 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.410
 protagonists like lyon cris or jay it 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.930
 feels the camera difficult to manipulate 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.569
 difficult to move being an enemy is 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.430
 a lot more 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.239
 annoying and laborious 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.239
 and so 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.110
 it kills you very fast, it has to be said this 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.580
 the other players the protagonists 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.890
 the agents can kill themselves 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.470
 fast only accounts with little life 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.330
 and that depending on the monster or the 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.599
 creature that you carry for example the 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:35.170
 zombies have a lot more life than 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:38.380
 I call but they are a little slower 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:43.090
 yabos are very fast but in their attack 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:45.580
 They are also very slow and have enough 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.600
 little lives are quickly killed by 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.930
 dogs get you down 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:55.700
 more blood than the other creatures but 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.830
 they also have very little life and so on 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.690
 so have their pros and cons the 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.280
 enemies and for example something that beats me 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.100
 to have the kids that I think 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.570
 they are the least clumsy creatures in the game 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.060
 that although they are slow and they go down little 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.490
 blood are very fast it 's easier to 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.560
 manipulate apart from this can be 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.060
 turn into any monster not in 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.400
 any showed up to that until that 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.980
 like this that has touched me that 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.600
 convert to me take me is in the ones of 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.460
 those 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.070
 in a guy that happens like dinosaurs of 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.390
 jurassic park that throw the thorns and 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.630
 it's pretty chiva because once 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.430
 you become in those dinosaurs 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.680
 You can do a lot of damage to the 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.910
 protagonists and practically kill them and 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.790
 corrals them if they manage to put them in a 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.590
 good corner and well, as I say 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.860
 has its pros and cons also a 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.190
 against is that if the other the other way the 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.630
 pussy which is playing the campaign not 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.090
 it has easy way it's going to cost you a 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.280
 trinche madr to the one of madrazos to be able it 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.080
 killing is something that can be found in 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.050
 the world of options you can put in 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.600
 veteran more and well, you have to 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.140
 say the game is pretty chingón 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:14.160
 once you manage to kill people 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.990
 and the truth that that is priceless and 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.390
 Well, I hope you liked the 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.270

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.770
