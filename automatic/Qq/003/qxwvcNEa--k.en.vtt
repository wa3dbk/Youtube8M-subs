next<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.070> most<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.609> my<00:00:26.730> videos<00:00:26.760> if<00:00:27.300> there's<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
next to most of my videos if there's a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.279 
next to most of my videos if there's a
copyright<00:00:28.529> then<00:00:29.099> there<00:00:29.340> isn't<00:00:29.640> one<00:00:29.840> my<00:00:30.840> first

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
copyright then there isn't one my first

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.299 
copyright then there isn't one my first
one<00:00:31.560> which<00:00:32.009> has<00:00:32.520> seventy<00:00:32.969> two<00:00:33.210> thousand<00:00:33.809> views

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
one which has seventy two thousand views

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.600 
one which has seventy two thousand views
so<00:00:35.309> if<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:35.640> go<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.210> press<00:00:36.420> edit<00:00:37.340> open<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.460> up

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
so if we go and press edit open that up

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.229 
so if we go and press edit open that up
and<00:00:38.640> then<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.540> just<00:00:39.809> go<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.989> monetization<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
and then you just go to monetization and

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.630 
and then you just go to monetization and
then<00:00:42.239> i<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.629> all<00:00:42.899> three<00:00:43.170> checked<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.800> that's

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
then i have all three checked and that's

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.000 
then i have all three checked and that's
basically<00:00:45.030> what<00:00:45.450> allows<00:00:45.989> ads<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.649> be<00:00:46.739> played

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
basically what allows ads to be played

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.580 
basically what allows ads to be played
on<00:00:47.250> your<00:00:47.460> video<00:00:47.930> therefore<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.079> get<00:00:49.379> money

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
on your video therefore you get money

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.389 
on your video therefore you get money
this<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.489> analytics<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:52.160> let<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.370> load<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
this is analytics and let that load and

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.970 
this is analytics and let that load and
so<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.850> showing<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.329> last<00:00:57.480> 28<00:00:58.199> days<00:00:58.230> I've

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.139 
so this is showing the last 28 days I've
made<00:00:59.460> fourteen<00:01:00.030> dollars<00:01:00.289> now<00:01:01.289> if<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.710> go<00:01:01.739> back

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149

only<00:01:21.360> show<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:21.810> bit<00:01:22.020> that's<00:01:22.710> because<00:01:23.100> I

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
only show a little bit that's because I

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.999 
only show a little bit that's because I
didn't<00:01:23.700> monetize<00:01:24.090> my<00:01:24.330> videos<00:01:24.720> till<00:01:25.259> January
