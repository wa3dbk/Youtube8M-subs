outside of the line that you marked
so<00:02:23.980> anything<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.519> overlaps<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.510> it's

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
so anything that overlaps and it's

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.709 
so anything that overlaps and it's
outside<00:02:26.409> of<00:02:26.859> that<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.340> you're<00:02:28.120> going<00:02:28.329> to<00:02:28.389> just

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:28.719 
outside of that and you're going to just

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:33.240 
outside of that and you're going to just
trace<00:02:29.049> that<00:02:29.409> much<00:02:30.450> there<00:02:31.769> I'm<00:02:32.769> going<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:32.980> place

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
trace that much there I'm going to place

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.800 
trace that much there I'm going to place
that<00:02:33.579> back<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:35.040> do<00:02:36.689> trace<00:02:37.689> on<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.170> other<00:02:38.409> side

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
that back and do trace on the other side

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:50.220 
that back and do trace on the other side
everything<00:02:40.810> on<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.319> outside<00:02:41.669> of<00:02:42.669> the<00:02:43.239> line<00:02:49.230> so

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
everything on the outside of the line so

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.730 
everything on the outside of the line so
you<00:02:50.290> have<00:02:50.530> something<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.159> looks<00:02:51.370> like<00:02:51.549> that
