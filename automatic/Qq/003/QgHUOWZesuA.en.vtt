00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.660 
remember sitting with Toby Hatfield he
was<00:00:55.079> looking<00:00:55.440> at<00:00:55.559> my<00:00:55.710> running<00:00:56.100> leg<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.550> he's

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
was looking at my running leg and he's

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.729
