with the idea for this thing and why he

knows but my guy says it might have

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.389 
knows but my guy says it might have
something<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.260> with<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> fact<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.859> there

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
something to do with the fact that there

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.240 
something to do with the fact that there
are<00:01:02.550> large<00:01:02.910> animal<00:01:03.510> sculptures<00:01:03.809> all<00:01:04.260> over

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
and even this one I mean it's just

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.770 
and even this one I mean it's just
something<00:01:11.189> people<00:01:11.310> do<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.939> North<00:01:12.270> Dakota<00:01:12.659> I

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780

mean who knows maybe they're jealous of
South<00:01:14.790> Dakota<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.540> mean<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:15.840> they<00:01:16.229> got

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
South Dakota and I mean with they got

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.960 
South Dakota and I mean with they got
some<00:01:16.560> big<00:01:16.710> sculptures<00:01:17.189> down<00:01:17.369> there<00:01:17.549> too

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
some big sculptures down there too

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.179 
some big sculptures down there too
but<00:01:18.299> for<00:01:18.509> some<00:01:18.689> reason<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.619> people<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.009> North

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
but for some reason the people in North

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.670 
but for some reason the people in North
Dakota<00:01:20.670> are<00:01:21.119> much<00:01:21.390> more<00:01:21.659> into<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.140> animal

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
Dakota are much more into the animal

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.429 
Dakota are much more into the animal
thing<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.460> don't<00:01:24.299> read<00:01:24.479> anything<00:01:24.750> into<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.259> I

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
thing so I don't read anything into it I

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.249 
thing so I don't read anything into it I
think<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.220> know<00:01:26.280> art<00:01:26.810> first<00:01:27.810> amendment

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
think it's you know art first amendment

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.190 
think it's you know art first amendment
you<00:01:28.740> know<00:01:28.860> I'm<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.130> tune<00:01:29.340> with<00:01:29.369> all<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.880> it

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
you know I'm in tune with all of it

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.649 
you know I'm in tune with all of it
the<00:01:31.200> other<00:01:31.350> thing<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.340> there's<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.299> mountain

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
the other thing is is there's a mountain

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.080 
the other thing is is there's a mountain
range<00:01:33.930> called<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.530> turtle<00:01:34.920> mountains<00:01:35.369> that

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
range called the turtle mountains that

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.080 
range called the turtle mountains that
are<00:01:36.329> very<00:01:36.630> close<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.860> town<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.970> is

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
are very close to this town and this is

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.460 
are very close to this town and this is
kind<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.450> gateway<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.930> those<00:01:40.290> mountains

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
kind of the gateway to those mountains

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.830 
kind of the gateway to those mountains
so<00:01:40.829> makes<00:01:41.310> sense<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:42.150> would<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> turtle

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
so makes sense that it would be a turtle

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.069 
so makes sense that it would be a turtle
right<00:01:43.799> now<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> actual<00:01:45.299> construction<00:01:45.659> was

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
right now the actual construction was

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.889 
right now the actual construction was
left<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.530> very<00:01:46.710> capable<00:01:47.100> hands<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.360> mr.

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
left in the very capable hands of a mr.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.249 
left in the very capable hands of a mr.
