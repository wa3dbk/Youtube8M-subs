we're<00:00:02.520> going<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.700> show<00:00:02.939> you<00:00:03.170> how<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.230> install<00:00:04.529> a

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
we're going to show you how to install a

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.810 
we're going to show you how to install a
220<00:00:05.310> volt<00:00:05.339> line<00:00:06.620> for<00:00:07.620> your<00:00:07.890> rework<00:00:08.309> machine

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
220 volt line for your rework machine

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.640 
220 volt line for your rework machine
you<00:00:09.570> have<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.870> option<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.290> using<00:00:10.349> a

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
you have the option of using a

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.240 
you have the option of using a
transformer<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.929> convert<00:00:12.929> it<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.110> 110<00:00:13.889> volts

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
transformer to convert it to 110 volts

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.029 
transformer to convert it to 110 volts
to<00:00:14.340> 220<00:00:14.880> are<00:00:15.480> just<00:00:15.960> have<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> direct<00:00:16.470> 220<00:00:16.859> volt

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
to 220 are just have a direct 220 volt

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.880 
to 220 are just have a direct 220 volt
line<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.990> personally<00:00:18.990> feel<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.500> direct

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
line I personally feel that a direct

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.099 
line I personally feel that a direct
line<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.279> better<00:00:20.720> that<00:00:21.720> way<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:21.900> don't<00:00:21.990> to

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
line is better that way you don't to

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.349 
line is better that way you don't to
worry<00:00:22.260> about<00:00:22.380> an<00:00:22.800> expensive<00:00:23.670> transformer<00:00:24.180> or

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
worry about an expensive transformer or

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.290 
worry about an expensive transformer or
the<00:00:24.779> transformer<00:00:25.380> failing<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.119> not<00:00:27.119> to

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
the transformer failing on you not to

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.929 
the transformer failing on you not to
mention<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.689> better<00:00:27.900> for<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.519> wiring<00:00:29.519> as<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
mention is better for the wiring as the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.650 
mention is better for the wiring as the
wah<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.900> wires<00:00:31.080> don't<00:00:31.230> get<00:00:31.380> as<00:00:31.500> hot<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:33.570> you

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
wah the wires don't get as hot so you

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.560 
wah the wires don't get as hot so you
want<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.870> make<00:00:33.989> sure<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.290> have<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:35.570> breakers

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
want to make sure you have the breakers

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.670 
want to make sure you have the breakers
off<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.930> general<00:00:37.260> area<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.530> you're

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
off in the general area that you're

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:49.040 
off in the general area that you're
working<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:39.200> you<00:00:42.469> want<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.649> get<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:46.700> 10<00:00:47.700> by<00:00:48.050> 2

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
working on and you want to get a 10 by 2

working on and you want to get a 10 by 2
wire<00:00:49.399> which<00:00:50.399> would<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:51.739> two<00:00:52.739> colors<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
wire which would have two colors in the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.799 
wire which would have two colors in the
ground<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.390> actually<00:00:54.780> 10<00:00:54.989> by<00:00:55.140> 3<00:00:56.600> but<00:00:57.600> will

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
ground this is actually 10 by 3 but will

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.979 
ground this is actually 10 by 3 but will
just<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:58.020> an<00:00:58.109> extra<00:00:58.320> wire<00:00:58.559> pretty<00:00:58.859> much<00:00:59.989> you

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
just have an extra wire pretty much you

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:14.410 
just have an extra wire pretty much you
want<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.320> strip<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:04.220> wire

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:24.700 

and<00:01:17.140> this<00:01:18.140> is<00:01:18.260> going<00:01:18.470> to<00:01:18.560> be<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:20.750> ground

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.480 

and

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.639 

these<00:01:28.090> two<00:01:28.570> will<00:01:29.229> be<00:01:29.320> two<00:01:29.470> live<00:01:29.680> wires<00:01:31.020> 110<00:01:32.020> 110

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
these two will be two live wires 110 110

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:41.520 
these two will be two live wires 110 110
and<00:01:32.979> ground<00:01:38.369> I'm<00:01:39.369> going<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.610> strip<00:01:39.939> this<00:01:40.530> at

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
and ground I'm going to strip this at

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:49.050 
and ground I'm going to strip this at
the<00:01:41.830> 10<00:01:42.220> setting<00:01:47.429> these<00:01:48.429> wires<00:01:48.700> are<00:01:48.850> much

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
the 10 setting these wires are much

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.310 
the 10 setting these wires are much
thicker<00:01:49.360> then<00:01:51.390> wires<00:01:52.390> are<00:01:52.630> used<00:01:52.659> to<00:01:52.899> soldering

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
thicker then wires are used to soldering

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:02.190 
thicker then wires are used to soldering
with<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:53.979> they're<00:01:54.600> harder<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.630> deal<00:01:55.869> with<00:02:01.200> we

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
with so they're harder to deal with we

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.630 
with so they're harder to deal with we
have<00:02:02.470> a<00:02:02.740> 30<00:02:03.310> amp<00:02:03.580> breaker<00:02:04.679> 20<00:02:05.679> amp<00:02:05.860> is<00:02:06.159> more

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
have a 30 amp breaker 20 amp is more

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.359 
have a 30 amp breaker 20 amp is more
than<00:02:06.759> enough<00:02:06.850> depending<00:02:07.330> on<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.890> wattage<00:02:09.250> of

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
than enough depending on the wattage of

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.440 
than enough depending on the wattage of
your<00:02:09.519> machine<00:02:09.880> so<00:02:11.130> 10<00:02:12.130> gauge<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:13.000> 20<00:02:13.330> amp

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
your machine so 10 gauge and a 20 amp

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.270 
your machine so 10 gauge and a 20 amp
breaker<00:02:13.630> we<00:02:14.440> have<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.560> 30<00:02:14.769> lying<00:02:14.980> around<00:02:15.069> so

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
breaker we have a 30 lying around so

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.170 
breaker we have a 30 lying around so
we're<00:02:15.370> going<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.549> use<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.730> best<00:02:18.910> thing

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
we're going to use that the best thing

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:34.650 
we're going to use that the best thing
to<00:02:19.209> do<00:02:19.540> is<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:21.519> unscrew

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.570 

with<00:02:35.660> those<00:02:35.840> I'm<00:02:36.020> screwed<00:02:36.349> you<00:02:36.590> would<00:02:36.739> stick

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
with those I'm screwed you would stick

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.860 
with those I'm screwed you would stick
the<00:02:37.880> two<00:02:38.390> lives<00:02:39.050> in<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:40.630> then<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.750> would

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
the two lives in and then you would

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.290 
the two lives in and then you would
screw<00:02:42.140> those<00:02:42.319> in<00:02:42.620> tightly<00:02:43.150> tighter<00:02:44.150> the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
screw those in tightly tighter the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.760 
screw those in tightly tighter the
better<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.599> lose<00:02:44.959> connections<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:45.650> don't

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
better you lose connections you don't

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.140 
better you lose connections you don't
want<00:02:45.890> anything<00:02:46.130> frying<00:02:46.610> your<00:02:46.790> circuit

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
want anything frying your circuit

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.490 
want anything frying your circuit
breaker<00:02:49.660> so<00:02:50.660> let's<00:02:50.840> pretend<00:02:50.959> that<00:02:51.260> we<00:02:51.470> have

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
breaker so let's pretend that we have

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.830 
breaker so let's pretend that we have
those<00:02:51.860> in<00:02:52.069> there<00:02:52.360> we<00:02:53.360> would<00:02:53.690> then<00:02:55.599> place<00:02:56.599> the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
those in there we would then place the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:06.690 
those in there we would then place the
breaker<00:03:03.790> while<00:03:04.790> still<00:03:05.090> keeping<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.480> off<00:03:05.660> and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
breaker while still keeping it off and

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.030 
breaker while still keeping it off and
you<00:03:07.700> know<00:03:07.790> we<00:03:08.030> have<00:03:08.870> this<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.230> live<00:03:09.440> there

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
you know we have this to live there

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.309 
you know we have this to live there
and<00:03:10.130> this<00:03:11.030> is<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.239> ground<00:03:11.540> bar<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:12.170> would

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
and this is the ground bar you would

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.630 
and this is the ground bar you would
connect<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.560> ground<00:03:12.860> wire<00:03:12.950> there<00:03:13.370> and<00:03:15.640> then

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
connect the ground wire there and then

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.009 
connect the ground wire there and then
you<00:03:16.790> would<00:03:16.880> turn<00:03:17.120> on<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.480> breaker<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:20.420> test<00:03:20.690> if

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
you would turn on the breaker to test if

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.830 
you would turn on the breaker to test if
you<00:03:21.170> have<00:03:21.319> the<00:03:21.470> other<00:03:21.620> end<00:03:22.010> of<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.519> wire

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
you have the other end of the wire

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.460 
you have the other end of the wire
connected<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:23.959> an<00:03:24.049> outlet<00:03:24.819> and<00:03:26.290> then<00:03:27.290> the

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470

in<00:03:47.690> a<00:03:48.380> moment<00:03:49.209> this<00:03:50.209> is<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.660> rework<00:03:50.989> machine

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
in a moment this is the rework machine

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.780 
in a moment this is the rework machine
that<00:03:52.760> has<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.150> 220<00:03:54.140> volt<00:03:54.519> plug<00:03:55.959> we<00:03:56.959> are<00:03:57.790> going

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
that has the 220 volt plug we are going

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.610 
that has the 220 volt plug we are going
to<00:03:59.000> rewire<00:03:59.359> the<00:03:59.540> plug<00:03:59.750> this<00:04:00.019> is<00:04:00.140> a<00:04:00.170> plug<00:04:00.470> that

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
to rewire the plug this is a plug that

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.110 
to rewire the plug this is a plug that
it<00:04:00.739> comes<00:04:00.920> with<00:04:02.889> Asian<00:04:03.889> or<00:04:03.980> Udo<00:04:04.250> style<00:04:04.579> it<00:04:04.910> all

it comes with Asian or Udo style it all

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.470 
it comes with Asian or Udo style it all
depends<00:04:05.569> on<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.780> manufacturer<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.350> machine

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
depends on the manufacturer the machine

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:15.060 
depends on the manufacturer the machine
typically<00:04:09.190> this<00:04:10.190> wire<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:13.430> dual<00:04:13.609> colors<00:04:14.060> is

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
typically this wire the dual colors is

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.449 
typically this wire the dual colors is
connected<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.269> this<00:04:17.269> point<00:04:17.600> ground<00:04:18.260> and<00:04:18.560> these

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
connected to this point ground and these

two<00:04:19.700> are<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.030> lives<00:04:20.530> so<00:04:21.530> it's<00:04:21.650> used<00:04:21.799> to<00:04:21.859> like

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
two are the lives so it's used to like

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.970 
two are the lives so it's used to like
that

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
that

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.690 
that
with<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.260> obviously<00:04:26.260> the<00:04:26.350> cover<00:04:26.620> on<00:04:26.740> top<00:04:26.980> and

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
with the obviously the cover on top and

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.120 
with the obviously the cover on top and
a<00:04:27.820> conflict<00:04:28.270> that<00:04:28.650> we<00:04:29.650> take<00:04:30.220> this<00:04:30.400> off<00:04:32.130> noting

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
a conflict that we take this off noting

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.530 
a conflict that we take this off noting
where<00:04:33.250> each<00:04:33.370> position<00:04:33.670> is<00:04:34.030> of<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:36.720> plug

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
where each position is of the plug

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.620 
where each position is of the plug
this<00:04:40.080> is<00:04:40.230> a<00:04:40.260> strand<00:04:40.620> of<00:04:40.770> water<00:04:40.980> plug<00:04:41.340> not<00:04:42.180> solid

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
this is a strand of water plug not solid

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.120 
this is a strand of water plug not solid
course<00:04:42.900> it's<00:04:43.110> easier<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:43.500> work<00:04:43.650> with<00:04:45.890> the<00:04:46.890> plug

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
course it's easier to work with the plug

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.220 
course it's easier to work with the plug
I<00:04:47.220> got<00:04:47.370> from<00:04:47.490> Home<00:04:47.640> Depot<00:04:47.670> about<00:04:48.240> a<00:04:48.390> couple

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
I got from Home Depot about a couple

00:04:49.230 --> 00:05:03.980 
I got from Home Depot about a couple
bucks<00:04:57.200> slide<00:04:58.200> that<00:04:58.410> in<00:04:58.590> there<00:05:00.590> then<00:05:01.590> we<00:05:02.990> take

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
bucks slide that in there then we take

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.220 
bucks slide that in there then we take
this<00:05:04.200> wire<00:05:04.530> for<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:04.950> ground<00:05:05.630> this<00:05:06.630> is<00:05:06.990> the

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
this wire for the ground this is the

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.880 
this wire for the ground this is the
ground<00:05:07.710> as<00:05:08.700> you<00:05:08.820> can<00:05:08.850> tell<00:05:09.180> and<00:05:09.620> two<00:05:10.620> lives

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
ground as you can tell and two lives

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:17.780 
ground as you can tell and two lives
over<00:05:11.670> there<00:05:12.170> so<00:05:13.170> we<00:05:13.290> put<00:05:13.530> this<00:05:13.770> in<00:05:15.290> the<00:05:16.790> ground

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
over there so we put this in the ground

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:25.780 
over there so we put this in the ground
for<00:05:18.390> it<00:05:20.420> make<00:05:21.420> sure<00:05:21.450> it's<00:05:21.750> tightly<00:05:22.140> in<00:05:22.260> there

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.330 

make<00:05:26.790> sure<00:05:27.000> it's<00:05:27.120> tight<00:05:27.650> and<00:05:28.650> we<00:05:28.770> do<00:05:28.920> that<00:05:29.130> for

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
make sure it's tight and we do that for

00:05:29.340 --> 00:06:25.510 
make sure it's tight and we do that for
the<00:05:29.370> rest

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.900 

probably<00:06:26.520> the<00:06:26.580> hardest<00:06:26.670> part<00:06:27.150> of<00:06:27.510> the<00:06:27.660> job<00:06:28.910> get

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
probably the hardest part of the job get

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:42.620 
probably the hardest part of the job get
him<00:06:30.030> plug<00:06:30.540> in<00:06:30.780> the<00:06:31.140> proper<00:06:31.650> place

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:07:03.450 

screws

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:10.830 

there<00:07:04.460> we<00:07:04.580> go

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:21.210 

go<00:07:11.840> make<00:07:12.530> that<00:07:12.680> tight<00:07:15.580> and<00:07:16.580> this<00:07:16.700> is<00:07:16.940> to<00:07:18.580> also

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:21.220 
go make that tight and this is to also

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.250 
go make that tight and this is to also
hold<00:07:21.730> the<00:07:21.940> wire<00:07:22.350> tightly<00:07:23.350> in<00:07:25.080> you<00:07:26.080> don't<00:07:26.170> want

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:26.260 
hold the wire tightly in you don't want

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.940 
hold the wire tightly in you don't want
to<00:07:26.440> loose<00:07:26.620> wire<00:07:28.320> it<00:07:29.320> could<00:07:29.470> cause<00:07:29.650> a<00:07:29.680> lot<00:07:29.830> of

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:29.950 
to loose wire it could cause a lot of

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:55.919 
to loose wire it could cause a lot of
harm

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:55.929 

00:07:55.929 --> 00:08:00.999 

and<00:07:56.929> there's<00:07:57.860> your<00:07:57.979> plug<00:07:59.619> ready<00:08:00.619> to<00:08:00.860> be

00:08:00.999 --> 00:08:01.009 
and there's your plug ready to be

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:06.969 
and there's your plug ready to be
inserted<00:08:01.519> into<00:08:02.709> the<00:08:03.819> 220<00:08:04.819> volt<00:08:05.499> outlets<00:08:06.499> that
