so<00:01:48.910> let's<00:01:49.480> see<00:01:49.780> let<00:01:50.230> me<00:01:50.260> take<00:01:50.560> you<00:01:50.680> through

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
so let's see let me take you through

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.880 
so let's see let me take you through
some<00:01:51.100> functionality<00:01:52.060> here<00:01:52.410> as<00:01:53.410> you<00:01:53.590> can<00:01:53.740> see

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
some functionality here as you can see

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.650 
some functionality here as you can see
there<00:01:54.040> we<00:01:54.160> can<00:01:54.280> monitor<00:01:54.730> temperature<00:01:55.330> and

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
there we can monitor temperature and

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.350 
there we can monitor temperature and
position<00:01:56.580> currently<00:01:57.580> don't<00:01:57.970> have<00:01:58.119> their

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
position currently don't have their

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.990 
position currently don't have their
monsters<00:01:58.720> that<00:01:59.080> are<00:01:59.229> connected<00:01:59.800> so<00:02:00.010> sorry

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
monsters that are connected so sorry

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.730 
monsters that are connected so sorry
about<00:02:01.090> that

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
about that

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.980 
about that
so<00:02:02.740> let's<00:02:02.950> take<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:03.160> through<00:02:03.430> its<00:02:03.550> paces<00:02:03.990> you

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
so let's take it through its paces you

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.560 
so let's take it through its paces you
can<00:02:05.440> see<00:02:05.590> all<00:02:05.740> of<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:06.100> quick<00:02:06.760> sighting<00:02:07.060> menus

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
can see all of the quick sighting menus

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:20.270 
can see all of the quick sighting menus
home<00:02:08.020> all<00:02:13.170> home<00:02:14.170> stages

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.580 

and<00:02:20.760> there<00:02:21.000> are<00:02:21.060> some<00:02:21.240> heart<00:02:21.900> presets<00:02:22.440> that

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
and there are some heart presets that

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.320 
and there are some heart presets that
are<00:02:22.770> configurable<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.610> firmware<00:02:23.850> at<00:02:24.150> least

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330
