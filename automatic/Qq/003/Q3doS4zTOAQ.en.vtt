we had two main objectives first we had
to<00:01:08.320> create<00:01:08.590> a<00:01:08.650> special<00:01:08.920> ambience<00:01:09.490> so<00:01:09.700> the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
to create a special ambience so the

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.160 
to create a special ambience so the

in<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.620> game<00:01:11.940> and<00:01:12.940> secondly<00:01:13.450> we<00:01:13.960> had<00:01:14.140> to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
in the game and secondly we had to

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.990 
in the game and secondly we had to
rework<00:01:14.560> certain<00:01:14.950> elements<00:01:15.370> from<00:01:15.460> Gras<00:01:15.700> one

artistically it means that the US side

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.120 
artistically it means that the US side
will<00:03:41.230> look<00:03:41.350> pretty<00:03:41.590> clean<00:03:41.800> and<00:03:42.040> untouched

will look pretty clean and untouched
while<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.090> Mexican<00:03:43.600> side<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:43.960> show<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.200> lot<00:03:44.440> of

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
while the Mexican side I show a lot of

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.040 
while the Mexican side I show a lot of

burning in a street and a helicopter

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.150 
burning in a street and a helicopter
landing<00:03:57.820> between<00:03:58.150> them<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:59.620> columns<00:04:00.010> of

landing between them the columns of

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.680 
landing between them the columns of
smoke<00:04:00.280> will<00:04:00.700> move<00:04:00.850> away<00:04:00.970> from<00:04:01.240> the<00:04:01.510> helicopter

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
smoke will move away from the helicopter

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.840 
smoke will move away from the helicopter
and<00:04:02.320> disperse

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.880 

we've<00:04:08.510> also<00:04:08.660> added<00:04:08.960> in<00:04:09.230> a<00:04:09.320> new<00:04:09.500> feature<00:04:09.740> called

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
we've also added in a new feature called

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.580 
we've also added in a new feature called
depth<00:04:10.430> spraggan<00:04:11.080> which<00:04:12.080> makes<00:04:12.320> sure<00:04:12.560> that

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
depth spraggan which makes sure that

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.350 
depth spraggan which makes sure that
this<00:04:12.920> smoke<00:04:13.190> doesn't<00:04:13.430> cut<00:04:13.730> through<00:04:13.940> objects

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
this smoke doesn't cut through objects

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.390 
this smoke doesn't cut through objects
like<00:04:14.570> buildings<00:04:14.990> hence<00:04:15.710> the<00:04:15.830> smoke<00:04:16.130> seems

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
like buildings hence the smoke seems

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.830 
like buildings hence the smoke seems
much<00:04:16.610> more<00:04:16.670> natural<00:04:17.330> and<00:04:17.420> we<00:04:17.510> no<00:04:17.810> longer

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
much more natural and we no longer

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.720 
much more natural and we no longer
notice<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.590> artificial<00:04:19.250> side<00:04:19.430> that<00:04:19.610> was

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
notice the artificial side that was

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.150 
notice the artificial side that was
present<00:04:19.970> in<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.300> previous<00:04:20.570> games<00:04:21.160> actually

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
present in the previous games actually

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.320 
present in the previous games actually
this<00:04:22.280> is<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.520> kind<00:04:22.730> of<00:04:22.850> feature<00:04:23.030> that<00:04:23.240> you

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
this is the kind of feature that you

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.180 
this is the kind of feature that you
won't<00:04:23.510> notice<00:04:23.870> after<00:04:23.990> you<00:04:24.230> used<00:04:24.470> to<00:04:24.620> it<00:04:24.740> but

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
won't notice after you used to it but

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.470 
won't notice after you used to it but
you<00:04:25.250> will<00:04:25.370> always<00:04:25.520> notice<00:04:25.970> when<00:04:26.120> it's<00:04:26.270> not

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
you will always notice when it's not

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.550 
you will always notice when it's not
there<00:04:26.750> and<00:04:26.900> other<00:04:27.020> games<00:04:27.260> that<00:04:27.470> don't<00:04:27.590> have<00:04:27.800> it

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.230 

this<00:04:32.560> means<00:04:32.860> that<00:04:32.950> we<00:04:33.190> can<00:04:33.370> now<00:04:33.520> have<00:04:33.790> missions

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
this means that we can now have missions

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.160 
this means that we can now have missions
that<00:04:34.450> take<00:04:34.750> place<00:04:34.930> in<00:04:35.200> the<00:04:35.230> middle<00:04:35.530> of<00:04:35.590> a<00:04:35.680> storm

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
that take place in the middle of a storm

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.450 
that take place in the middle of a storm
