00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.150
 hello to almost everyone though you want to 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.070
 to tell 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.660
 remember i roberto cavalli thing that is 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.240
 comparison of two perfumes that I 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.039
 wrote on the site and perfumes and on the site 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.920
 Douglas and remember there was such a story 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.109
 unpleasant say perfumery that's all there 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.750
 reeling rocked in general and not liquid 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.269
 the other was and the writing on the light were 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.700
 Letters not red and black very remember 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.309
 yes and that was running out differently so now 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.969
 I decided to clean this one 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.280
 here is the file 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.809
 I know that many people advise him to me 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.230
 now girls i want to show it again 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.879
 who didn't believe me until these companies 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.329
 they offer perfume cheaper then 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.280
 as much as 20 to 30 euros can be 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.530
 even more than well that is this time I 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.680
 I also test 2 again right now 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.030
 show with Douglas where i'm sure 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:06.360
 just a hundred percent so in writing 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.350
 the spirit of 60 milliliters in my opinion it is with us 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.570
 goes it 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.850
 and don't even want to learn to pronounce 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.860
 honestly I have no respect for 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.970
 these sites do not have it means that this is me 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.460
 described Douglas 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.729
 and here this one was in such 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:27.330
 a stand of this ct 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:30.720
 other site both versions such that their 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.670
 can be refilled that is they again 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.030
 filling or whatever it is right 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.770
 say both and where did you know 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.680
 this paul calls what to see what it is 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.549
 how now I will compare the fierce already 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.630
 at first sight 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.240
 let's give you happiness and to the left 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.700
 I will always have you here on our left 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.159
 Douglas on the right here is another one which I 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.380
 not that I do not trust a simple family 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.750
 door but compare bottles look 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.000
 This is strong, that is, it can be seen from it 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.159
 she is a little bit like that was 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.579
 smeared inside worse so I just 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.459
 wiped your face look see 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.679
 you may not be heard by the blue and not 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.030
 it can be seen but it is real 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.980
 swing it wanna say nikolai 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.310
 because you are 10 that is here 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.440
 we push vybryzgivaetsya here in and I when 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.240
 I have already unpacked the uzhend and the first thing 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.560

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.370
 on those roberto cavalli 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.020
 so left out of Douglas everything is fine 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.569
 there's simply how cool how 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.480

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.550

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.080
 colors liquid as i start on the left 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.640
 right is iz cosmetics here look 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.550
 see the liquid on the left as if white 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.890
 like the summer in a bottle it and to the right 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.070
 look see as if she is yellow 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.860
 purple until you see another color then 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.360
 there is a liquid of a different color Marilla 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.640
 maniacs of you tell me 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.130
 please how do you explain it on 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.450
 because I'm so just an amateur but you 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.400
 know maybe super evil now 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.550
 will say become attached personal by this you 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.440
 only smells like girls know 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:20.079
 I'm just such a person, I wo n't cry 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.630
 for the goods, yes, I want for this money 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:25.600
 get the bottom of the swinging lid 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.459
 normal color and now I know for sure that 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.690
 Douglas they give one hundred percent guarantee 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:34.989
 on perfume it is generally not even in 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.930
 how to say that is well you understand yes 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:42.430
 as for this i'm this very very 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.989
 choose different colors chips unfortunately 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.320
 on the camera is not even as clear as 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.660
 in reality you can see how different colors 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.049
 Of course you choose there, I just 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.030
 I wanted to show you this time 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.120
 roberto cavalli showed you and 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.310
 for me it was still to prove what I 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.579
 that my thoughts are all that i think is 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:09.120
 all right so durable all we do 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:09.120
 him for this here you hear the Jew 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:17.850
 consecrated as the water goes out for a long time but 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:20.229
 the same movements make the nipples strong 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.090
 someone can have my card will stand and 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.159
 still it is not still there than 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.620
 get on taganka angry at the same 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:28.380
 a different color liquid 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.750
 I don't know something inside but this is different 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.979
 than the nickname itself is original 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.660
 which douglas girls someone can 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.850
 each is also just another original 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.010
 the country spilled I do not agree it is not 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.199
 perhaps it is the original of the other 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:48.510
 the country are broken at me he is not happy 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.660
 that 's what just wanted you like that 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.919
 thats just thats 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.130
 tell that is not only to this 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:05:00.630
 no lights but also in cosmetics, too, Izzy 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:03.300
 here are the same too same 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.960
 errors in her roberto cavalli eau 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.389
 pour homme 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.080
 so here I am still trying to find some 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.229
 the differences 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.880
 But for this side, everything is absolutely 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:15.389
 identical the same thing all worth everything 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.970
 also glued on this only on izi 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:20.760
 Cosmetics here little corner is not a loop is not 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.699
 maybe not important here numbers on 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.539
 on iz cosmetics 4 on the barrel of the Finnish 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:31.169
 I hope girls video 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:34.710
 it was probably useful to someone reading 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.750
 guesses I have already confirmed someone else 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.389
 I am sure with equal it will be from there 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.030
 write out and of course do not have full 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.310
 that's right, I just decided that you 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.680
 show again because still all 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.080
 still some benefit should bring 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.370
 right so say goodbye to you and on 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.370
 next video bye
