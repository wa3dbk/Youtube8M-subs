00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello everyone we meet today 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.830
 to discover together how to achieve 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.730
 the coasters with drinks 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.349
 ice cream it's gone at the hardware level 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.670
 we are going to need a stick of the 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.259
 semoy I used 8 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.389
 we need two pieces of 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.940
 cotton and in 30 to 40 cm in length 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.590
 each a pair of scissors scotch and 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.640
 a little bolloc'h and some glue if 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.560
 you never want to give a 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.100
 little bit more fantasy to your 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.100
 under glass 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.670
 to start so I take the stick 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.690
 that I pose next to each other 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.690
 correctly like this 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.610
 I then take a piece of Scotch 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.780
 that I lay on my sticks so as to 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.780
 let all together 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.890
 when it's done I pick up and I'll 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.159
 to be able to place the tape on the other side 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.159
 tomorrow morning 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.910
 2 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.290
 I take my cotton thread and I'm going 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.979
 come the past on my first stick that 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.979
 is on my left 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.090
 I'm going to do it because the whole thing 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.090
 be well now 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:30.140
 I now pass some threads underneath 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.140
 above like this 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.819
 m 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.280
 when I finish I do it so 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.820
 that everything is sealed 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.820
 correctly 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.310
 I then come back to do the same thing 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:14.300
 on the other side so the opposite of my 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.300
 sticks like this 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.990
 I cut the pieces of string that 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:19.990
 are in too much 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.130
 with my scissors I'm going now 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.330
 cut my piece of tape because one of the 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.180
 stick are now it's tied together 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:50.560
 to others with my cotton thread we're going 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.750
 replace the sticks correctly and we 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.430
 will do the same thing with the sons of 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.700
 cotton so that everything is 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.700
 prettier 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.790
 once it's done that's it 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.790
 given 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.510
 if we ever want accessorized 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.490
 understand the little charms or 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.530
 it's because you're going to have under the 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.970
 hand 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:29.710
 we are going to put a dot of glue and it's going 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.710
 hold very very well 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.250
 so here is our coaster is 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:54.810
 now finished I hope this 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.229
 video you liked it you was 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.300
 useful 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:58.740

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.389
