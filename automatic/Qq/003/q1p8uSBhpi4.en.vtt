00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello youtube friends how are you 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.359
 jorge de mate mobile and today 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.630
 let's review how to multiply and how 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.370
 dividing complex numbers is pretty 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.740
 simple let's do it very slowly 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.570
 so you do not have any problems ok 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.230
 nothing better than doing it as an exercise 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.800
 as we were already used to problem 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.880
 number one 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.570
 since z 1 equals three plus two and 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.439
 that z 2 is equal to 2 - and they ask me yesterday 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:37.110
 then the value of separated az-1 by z 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:39.149
 2 section bz 1 divided by z 2 ok 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.780
 we started in the first section they ask me 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.239
 the multiplication z 1 and z 2 so 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.890
 let's copy the values ​​once ok 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.329
 z 1 equals three plus two times and with 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.829
 the unit imagine 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:59.890
 while z 2 equals 2 - and the 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.079
 imaginary unit square root of minus 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.629
 one that is what we are going to do now 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.720
 to multiply these two numbers 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.580
 complexes we are going to apply the property 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.120
 very simple distributive we multiply 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.190
 3 for 2 and then 3 for less 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:22.370
 On the other hand we also have to 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.900
 multiply 2 by 2 and 12 by less ok from 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.060
 very neat way 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.730
 let's do it to avoid mistakes 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.700
 little by little we are going to do it more 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.310
 fast because you're going to get more 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.400
 experience then we start with the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.080
 red arrows 3 by 2 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.760
 6 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.340
 now 3 x less and less 3 and there's no 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:51.220
 to lose sight of the signs very 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:54.880
 important plus 2 and by 2 45 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:58.330
 and finally two and for less and less two 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.390
 times and squared the imaginary life 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.930
 squared which is what we do now 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.920
 let's group the real numbers and the 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.630
 complex numbers ok part real part 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.130
 imaginary 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.140
 we started with this 6 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.320
 let's leave it for the real part and 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.880
 also the least or if you block look what is 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.210
 what we are going to do with this minus 2 and 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.730
 squares we're going to place at least 2 and 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.790
 square we already know that it is less 1 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.960
 since and the imaginary unit is 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:37.250
 equal to the square root of minus 1 per 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:41.060
 another side we will have more 4 and less 3 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.600
 and ok we have grouped the reals and 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.900
 the imaginaries this is going to be the same 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.900
 so 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:58.469
 6 - 2 x minus 1 we would have more 2 ok 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:03:01.510
 - x - + + 4 and minus 3 and we would have more and 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:06.069
 the final answer to our problem 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.870
 would then be 6 28 and this is going to be the 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.689
 real part while in the part 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.250
 imaginary we have so it's here 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:16.569
 alone and that's the answer to the paragraph 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.850
 ok real part 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:23.800
 do not forget the 8 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:26.590
 imaginary part the most and now yes we are going 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.450
 with section b here they ask us 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:34.600
 divide z 1 between z 2 as we do 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.640
 let's start by copying z 1 and z 2 into 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.450
 our division ok 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:45.940
 z 13 + 2 times 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:48.819
 iceta 2 is equal to 2 - and ok now 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.879
 we have a little problem and that is 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:55.360
 we have a and that is square root of 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:57.160
 minus 1 in the denominator 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.500
 so we have a root in the 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.290
 denominator and we need to eliminate it 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.940
 how are we going to do it with 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.400
 rationalization and how we rationalize 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.910
 here in this division of numbers 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.790
 complexes we're always going to multiply 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.410
 by the conjugate of the denominator ok 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.709
 both in the numerator and manual 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:22.030
 called look if we have 2 here - and 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:25.479
 let's multiply then by 2 more and 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.240
 which is our conjugate of the so-called 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:32.860
 the same number but the imaginary part 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:37.020
 we have changed the sign ok 2 more and in 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:40.379
 the numerator 2 more and in the denominator 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.629
 and this is going to be the same then now 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:45.960
 we saw in the previous exercise how 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:47.940
 multiply in the numerator that is where 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.810
 let's have the multiplication and 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:55.460
 we apply the distributive property 3 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.430
 for 2 6 more 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.450
 it's three if 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:06.140
 we have here a two by two plus four 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.400
 times the imaginary unit plus two and at 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.120
 square 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.910
 ok while in the denominator that is 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.160
 what we have we have a sum for 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.740
 difference and that makes us remember a 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.570
 remarkable product very important sum for 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.900
 difference equal to a difference of 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.840
 rooms that will be the same as the first 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.500
 element squared minus the second 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.360
 element squared we continue with 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.760
 our division around here and we have 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.030
 now 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:40.030
 although it is six times and squared and at 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.560
 square we already know that it is equal to less 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.610
 one ok 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:49.530
 so in the denominator we're going to have 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:53.500
 minus two because this two for minus 16 - 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:58.310
 24 more 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:01.160
 3 and 4 and we would have 7 times 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.570
 and in the denominator we have 2 to 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.550
 square 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:10.040
 4 - and squared and how much is and to the 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.639
 square we already know it true and at 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:17.199
 square is equal to minus 1 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.199
 and we are going to notice it for him 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:24.380
 in the numerator we would have 4 + 7 times 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:28.169
 the imaginary unit and in the denominator 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:30.949
 we would have 4 less minus one would be 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.600
 four plus one and that's going to be equal to 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:34.949
 five ok 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.490
 finally we are going to separate this fraction 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:41.729
 partly real and part imagine how 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.740
 so we make very simple four between 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:50.229
 five and four fifths 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:53.259
 + 7 and over 5 and in this way we have 

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:56.349
 separated the real part of the part 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:59.790
 imaginary on the one hand we have this 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:03.000
 four fifths that is the real part 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:06.360
 and on the other hand 7 and on 5 that is the 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.200
 imaginary part and that's the answer 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.860
 to paragraph b good I hope you have 

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.810
