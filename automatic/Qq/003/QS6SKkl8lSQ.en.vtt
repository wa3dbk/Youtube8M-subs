00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:04.060
 On the other hand, 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.540
 Something happened while we were staring. 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.769
 The military authorities and LASEK are 22 minutes. 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.919
 Six minutes of play, the allegations of land are growing. 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.509
 It is Kim Se-jin chan. 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:18.500
 1 billion won without another 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.500
 At the Fleet Command that monitors the state of the Cheonan in real time 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.570
 The first report of the situation to the Navy Operations Command 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.179
 It is done 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.140
 What happened at the time of the 1 o'clock security bond today? 

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:31.460
 Not listed 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.920
 However, the seaplane was reported to have died without water 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.350
 It is known as 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.710
 I did not try. 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.710
 Yes 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.970
 galca 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.330
 At night 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.210
 Missing comments on cell phone texting and phone disconnection 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.579
 Time 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.030
 That's exactly why 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.890
 At the Baekryong-do military base, 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.230
 I can hear the bell sound 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.510
 I was in the 15th minute without a deposit, 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.560
 There is a possibility that there is a structural problem. 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.160
 It is the big tree, dragon, and 20 minutes and 1.8km of coastal scenery 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.830
 I heard another bang 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.890
 I have detected a nearby recording device in a minute. 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.700
 And 21 times, in three minutes, 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.220
 I will fall down. 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.860
 After all, according to the documents, the Cheonan on the first impact would be 6 to 7 minutes later 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.400
 There was a second shock, and the second shock 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.740
 It's supposed to have completely subsided in three minutes. 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.040
 But it still does not make sense. 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.409
 If something urgent happened during the six minutes of the problem 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.410
 A misunderstanding is that one reads the Captain's poem, 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.410
 There is a situation where there is enough room for the scene. 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.290
 The military authorities are in the emergency room, 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.990
 After five people were gathered, 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.990
 I was doing exercise for the soldiers at home 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.540
 I estimated it. 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.140
