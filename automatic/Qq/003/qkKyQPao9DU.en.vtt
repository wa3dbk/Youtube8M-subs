of<00:04:21.840> it<00:04:21.930> but<00:04:22.079> my<00:04:22.590> first<00:04:22.830> impression<00:04:23.310> when<00:04:23.370> I

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
of it but my first impression when I

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.270 
of it but my first impression when I
Drive<00:04:23.639> it<00:04:24.139> really<00:04:25.139> properly<00:04:25.740> I<00:04:25.830> suppose<00:04:26.130> you'd

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
Drive it really properly I suppose you'd

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.490 
Drive it really properly I suppose you'd
say<00:04:26.460> Turin<00:04:26.760> Park<00:04:27.000> was<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.810> fact<00:04:28.020> that<00:04:28.080> between

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
say Turin Park was the fact that between

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.010 
say Turin Park was the fact that between
slow<00:04:28.800> corners<00:04:29.310> between<00:04:29.550> two<00:04:30.360> corners<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:30.900> is

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
slow corners between two corners that is

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.800 
slow corners between two corners that is
exceptionally<00:04:31.860> fast<00:04:32.150> incredibly<00:04:33.150> so<00:04:33.600> that

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
exceptionally fast incredibly so that

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.210 
exceptionally fast incredibly so that
you've<00:04:34.230> hardly<00:04:34.470> got<00:04:34.590> a<00:04:34.710> little<00:04:34.980> bit<00:04:35.070> of<00:04:35.130> rev

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
you've hardly got a little bit of rev

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.379 
you've hardly got a little bit of rev
counter<00:04:35.400> you've<00:04:35.669> just<00:04:35.850> puts<00:04:36.180> from<00:04:36.330> the

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
counter you've just puts from the

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:37.820 
counter you've just puts from the
accelerator<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:36.870> accelerate<00:04:37.290> so<00:04:37.470> fast<00:04:37.710> you

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
accelerator and accelerate so fast you

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.800 
accelerator and accelerate so fast you
just<00:04:37.860> change<00:04:38.190> gear<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:39.090> go<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.450> next<00:04:39.660> gear

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
just change gear and go to the next gear

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.050 
just change gear and go to the next gear
it's<00:04:40.220> incredibly<00:04:41.220> fast<00:04:41.490> that's<00:04:41.730> that's<00:04:41.910> the

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
it's incredibly fast that's that's the

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.470 
it's incredibly fast that's that's the
first<00:04:42.090> impression<00:04:42.750> that<00:04:42.780> I<00:04:42.900> had<00:04:43.020> of<00:04:43.140> it<00:04:44.480> there

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
first impression that I had of it there

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.380 
first impression that I had of it there
is<00:04:45.660> one<00:04:46.020> floor<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:47.130> car<00:04:47.370> is<00:04:47.550> heavy<00:04:47.820> and<00:04:48.090> that

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
is one floor the car is heavy and that

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.720 
is one floor the car is heavy and that
has<00:04:48.600> an<00:04:48.690> effect<00:04:48.960> on<00:04:49.140> brakes<00:04:49.470> and<00:04:49.740> tires<00:04:49.919> this

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
has an effect on brakes and tires this

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.700 
has an effect on brakes and tires this
weekend<00:04:51.240> is<00:04:51.390> the<00:04:51.419> big<00:04:51.690> test<00:04:51.930> will<00:04:52.560> the

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
weekend is the big test will the

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.190 
weekend is the big test will the
technology<00:04:52.950> be<00:04:53.550> a<00:04:53.580> help<00:04:53.970> or<00:04:54.150> a<00:04:54.240> handicap<00:04:55.020> when

technology be a help or a handicap when
it<00:04:55.320> comes<00:04:55.560> to<00:04:55.770> attempting<00:04:56.340> a<00:04:56.520> win<00:04:56.880> in
