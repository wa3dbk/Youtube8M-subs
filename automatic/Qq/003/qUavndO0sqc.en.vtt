00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.670
 yann and ciao pretty jean-sÃ©bastien balance in this video I 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.110
 will you talk about 3m euros and accessories for one of his and we will 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.150
 start so as was said was treated will identify on Monday 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.469
 detonators but also tracker 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.380
 so those letters that are with a quine who does have his rights 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.720
 who are at the advantage and then light of being very strong 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.659
 french fries 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.849
 they are available a lot of width let's say it's stuff a 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.829
 little to do everything then so in all three cases the geometry is reversed 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.929
 we can not start so word randall you have to know that it's 

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:35.769
 the inventor of special effects but crossed so that the tickets 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.539
 more worried are tricks that are specially designed for the long board 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:38.899
 of 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.329
 it must also be used for the flight for example this way a little more 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.289
 up you have to go up France compared to the ground but against them they have 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.420
 the advantage of turning and being more stable than negotiations in 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.300
 three cases even geometry so we have that the state was going to yield the charger one 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.200
 so it's stuff so they're pretty recent bets are a very very 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.250
 good finish they are really successful available in several 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.040
 colors also in addition to their size of course they are also very turning a 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.730
 kitty chargers are dead too very very well finish also available in 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.240
 vain several sizes for several use we can also finish 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.030
 with her the precarious ones a little special 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.150
 as it's last sabine it's a trick with a double bed ticket you 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.940
 can see it 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.140
 so the four men sign that this thing turns out a lot more than all 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.090
 others and one so that can be quite interesting for beginners who 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.740
 want a board that is very reactive these traits that can 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.100
 receive different orthez different gums are sold 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.520
 usually with two men not all closed% sometimes a little hard% and 6 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.930
 % and never or give them to change girl from your board I you 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.970
 really recommend trying to change the eras it's cheap 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.270
 we have very good erasers that can really completely changed the 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.380
 floor behavior really know the look of it in these terms that 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.250
 speak of course d contact capital indispensable evening legrand so 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.250
 here we have big auditing sectors in asia 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.490
 so the big ones she did it just trick surrender ie 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.590
 put your hand on the ground with the plates durand plexiglass so the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.900
 time to spend the rap and the palm of the hand simply to know too 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.049
 avoid getting hurt simply for example the reinforcements 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.230
 on the top of the hand for the guide so it's really the accessory 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:16.989
 indispensable with the helmet 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.080
 for protection when you make world fief even wear gloves then 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.609
 then to finish this video I told you about the rolls of carpet 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.189
 so be warned that beyrouth to be defined primarily by battle 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.020
 hardness and shape so a soft cover the hung more than a hard wheel 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.590
 then let a smaller wheel speed up more with a road 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.379
 bigger 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.890
 on the other hand a bigger one will have a better top speed for example 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.049
 here the line 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.079
 or the italy of the years we want retro 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.139
 this is the type of road to do everything 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.139
 which also makes it possible to make the notebook of the descent of the slalom it is really 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.909
 a good reference whereas here also celtics same for the same type of 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.279
 road very good erasers 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:00.969
 for a month yoann a little more to big platinum for more details at 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.869
 the bastille where the sternum several hardness are available do not hesitate 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:07.709
 that's also the right reference 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.289
 of course even the names of Roma who follow the leader model in 82 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:14.589
 rare so it's roads that are very very good for the descent 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:17.569
 we really appreciated derailleur course especially on the competitions 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.389
 jonas for example also trailers so those who go there well so much 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:25.969
 better defeat so it's the little holes in 86 of hardness that are 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:30.079
 very resistant wheels that would be very very good and German who have 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.990
 to put the company will launch the 30th 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.340
 to make profit is to her to send troops in all directions 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.080
 alas for example launched for the city the wheel to really choose 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.190
 to finish knaub signeau a sherpa romandie seeing that you have to know that 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.940
 these types of schepper with them and said to them allows a very very slips 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.919
 healthy cornering and skidding 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.619
 without much noise to the inverted eg wheels 

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:57.089
 with a sea a little harder you have to know that crystals is when 

00:03:57.089 --> 00:04:00.249
 even a good reference so here we went around the wheels available 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:04.219
 inquiry do not hesitate to come to the shock about them to call ahead 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:09.109
 on the website awa sarr dot com he advised me against who will be a 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:10.639
 pleasure to help you and 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:11.689
 8% then here we go 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:12.909
 we have to say soon
