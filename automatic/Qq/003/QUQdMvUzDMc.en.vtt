00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.520
 report with some sports nutrition tips 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.810
 if we go socialized with the term we will let you know 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:25.969
 the news of the game is a specialized branch of human nutrition 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.619
 applies to people who practice intense sports 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.320
 those that require prolonged efforts over time what is 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.080
 called endurance sports 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.200
 Nutrition is not the factors that mark the practice of sports 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.120
 we are the particular genetic factors of the athlete and the type of 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.150
 training done 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.540
 the foods of a sports diet serve to provide energy 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.090
 provides the material for strengthening and repairing the 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.360
 tissues maintains the metabolism on an equal footing 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.230
 there is no general guide for athletes 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.010
 each party has a specific endowment 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.200
 the most positive news 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.440
 poor all sports cycles 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.440

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.820

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.189
 that is invoked those people who are already within physical activity 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.850
 if there are not four or five times a week 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.470
 and then not only 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.470
 Not only did it work for me, but also the Spanish language 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.920
 it's the town 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.860
 we are going to be able to change the eating habits they tell that it was vital 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.480
 in general it is quite difficult to read it 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.290
 the first thing will be this Tuesday the ministerial declaration but this time 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.440
 those who currently have people 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.180
 both inside and outside the gym wild the different legs p 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.540

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.360
 ficta 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.340
 removing little by little what we consider that these floors of 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.939
 high level perfect 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.450

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:38.209
 break 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.370
 then it is extremely important to recover it 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.190
 for people who acted attached abilities 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.379
