Voyager Class jetfire and of course this
was<00:00:12.450> back<00:00:12.840> when<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.259> whole<00:00:13.440> powerlinx<00:00:14.340> thing

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
was back when the whole powerlinx thing

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.510 
was back when the whole powerlinx thing
was<00:00:14.880> all<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.269> craze<00:00:16.130> actually<00:00:17.130> kind<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.340> liked

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
was all the craze actually kind of liked

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.680 
was all the craze actually kind of liked
it<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.940> fact<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.240> probably<00:00:18.359> should<00:00:18.630> have

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
it the fact I probably should have

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.179 
it the fact I probably should have
started<00:00:18.810> smaller<00:00:19.289> but<00:00:19.560> I'm<00:00:19.740> going<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.980> start

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
started smaller but I'm going to start

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.800 
started smaller but I'm going to start
with<00:00:20.340> him<00:00:21.199> Jetfire<00:00:22.199> just<00:00:22.890> because<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:24.420> here<00:00:24.630> he

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
with him Jetfire just because so here he

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.710 
with him Jetfire just because so here he
is<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.019> don't<00:00:25.230> think<00:00:25.769> he's<00:00:26.699> missing<00:00:27.240> any<00:00:27.420> pieces

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
is I don't think he's missing any pieces

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.919 
is I don't think he's missing any pieces
but<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.830> could<00:00:29.099> be<00:00:29.130> wrong<00:00:29.420> he's<00:00:30.420> got<00:00:30.599> some<00:00:30.779> mini

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
but I could be wrong he's got some mini

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.650 
but I could be wrong he's got some mini
conchords<00:00:31.500> even<00:00:31.769> though<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.250> don't<00:00:32.880> think<00:00:33.510> many

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
conchords even though I don't think many

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.780 
conchords even though I don't think many
cons<00:00:33.960> are<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> primary<00:00:34.710> focus<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:37.100> energy<00:00:38.100> on

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
cons are the primary focus and energy on

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.470 
cons are the primary focus and energy on
it<00:00:39.210> was<00:00:39.360> all<00:00:39.510> about<00:00:39.920> Energon<00:00:40.920> but<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.120> you

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
it was all about Energon but you can you

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.830 
it was all about Energon but you can you
know<00:00:42.629> if<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.500> wanted<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.950> have<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.550> race<00:00:45.539> car

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
know if you wanted to have a race car

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.450 
know if you wanted to have a race car
attached<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.440> your<00:00:46.559> spaceship<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.160> could<00:00:47.340> do

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
attached to your spaceship you could do

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.110 
attached to your spaceship you could do
that<00:00:47.670> for<00:00:47.940> whatever<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.230> hell<00:00:49.410> reason<00:00:50.120> makes

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
that for whatever the hell reason makes

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.569 
that for whatever the hell reason makes
it<00:00:51.300> faster<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.500> he<00:00:52.680> did<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> missile<00:00:53.460> that

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
it faster so he did have a missile that

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.950 
it faster so he did have a missile that
would<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.030> here<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.420> could<00:00:54.570> push<00:00:54.780> this

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
would go in here and you could push this

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.569 
would go in here and you could push this
button<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:55.379> here<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.860> would<00:00:56.010> trigger<00:00:56.190> thing

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
button up here that would trigger thing

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.779 
button up here that would trigger thing
down<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.149> make<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.360> go<00:00:57.449> pick<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:58.699> but<00:00:59.699> we

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
down here and make it go pick you but we

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.299 
down here and make it go pick you but we
don't<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.059> missiles<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.190> there's<00:01:02.190> this

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
don't like missiles that there's this

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:10.609 
don't like missiles that there's this
little<00:01:02.489> missile<00:01:02.879> launcher<00:01:04.489> so<00:01:05.489> yes<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:09.530> kind<00:01:10.530> of

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
little missile launcher so yes I kind of

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.730 
little missile launcher so yes I kind of
a<00:01:10.710> lame<00:01:11.010> vehicle<00:01:11.640> mode<00:01:11.790> but<00:01:12.450> he<00:01:12.540> does<00:01:12.689> roll<00:01:13.020> it

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
a lame vehicle mode but he does roll it

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.749 
a lame vehicle mode but he does roll it
was<00:01:13.920> really<00:01:14.310> nice<00:01:16.100> there's<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.220> little<00:01:17.430> I

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
can't remember what it's called Energon

kind<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.439> downside<00:01:25.890> or<00:01:26.040> might<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:26.670> I

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
kind of downside or might because I

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.770 
kind of downside or might because I
think<00:01:26.820> depending<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.180> how<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.420> look<00:01:27.509> at<00:01:27.720> it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
think depending on how you look at it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.520 
think depending on how you look at it
this<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.500> come<00:01:28.680> off<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.780> could<00:01:30.900> maybe<00:01:31.350> you

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
this can come off so you could maybe you

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.530 
this can come off so you could maybe you
could<00:01:31.650> pretend<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:32.130> like<00:01:32.280> stalking<00:01:32.939> or

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
could pretend it's like stalking or

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.179 
could pretend it's like stalking or
something<00:01:34.110> or<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
something or it's like this is the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.249 
something or it's like this is the
carrier<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> shuttle<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.570> don't

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
carrier and this is a shuttle I don't

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.210 
carrier and this is a shuttle I don't
know<00:01:37.939> but<00:01:38.939> there<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:40.790> so<00:01:41.790> yes<00:01:42.030> he<00:01:42.540> obviously

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
know but there it is so yes he obviously

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.179 
know but there it is so yes he obviously
powerlinx<00:01:44.220> with<00:01:46.040> Ironhide<00:01:48.140> but<00:01:49.140> we're<00:01:50.009> not

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
powerlinx with Ironhide but we're not

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.740 
powerlinx with Ironhide but we're not
going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.520> worry<00:01:51.000> about<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.329> right<00:01:51.509> this

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
going to worry about that right this

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.340 
going to worry about that right this
moment<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.850> let's<00:01:53.880> start<00:01:54.540> getting<00:01:54.930> him<00:01:55.140> in

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
moment so let's start getting him in

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.810 
moment so let's start getting him in
robot<00:01:55.860> mode<00:01:56.420> to<00:01:58.100> watch<00:01:59.100> out<00:01:59.280> for<00:01:59.430> these<00:01:59.520> these

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
robot mode to watch out for these these

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.230 
robot mode to watch out for these these
pop<00:02:00.149> off<00:02:00.329> really<00:02:00.990> really<00:02:01.649> easily<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.610> was

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
can sort of do stuff so is he worth it

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.240 
can sort of do stuff so is he worth it
not<00:05:00.340> by<00:05:00.580> himself<00:05:01.440> but<00:05:02.440> I<00:05:02.680> think<00:05:03.250> excuse<00:05:03.669> me

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.020 
sorry had a tickle in my throat I think
with<00:05:09.360> Ironhide<00:05:10.530> he<00:05:11.530> is<00:05:11.710> because<00:05:12.220> the<00:05:12.730> gimmick

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
with Ironhide he is because the gimmick

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.250 
with Ironhide he is because the gimmick
of<00:05:13.120> combination<00:05:13.900> is<00:05:14.080> always<00:05:14.470> great<00:05:16.080> but<00:05:17.080> by

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
of combination is always great but by

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.090 
of combination is always great but by
himself<00:05:17.650> I<00:05:17.860> don't<00:05:18.100> know<00:05:18.370> I<00:05:18.960> really<00:05:20.100> personally

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
himself I don't know I really personally

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.700 
himself I don't know I really personally
I<00:05:21.130> don't<00:05:21.370> like<00:05:21.790> this<00:05:22.180> design<00:05:22.630> and<00:05:23.020> there's<00:05:23.530> not

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
I don't like this design and there's not

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.080 
I don't like this design and there's not
a<00:05:23.740> lot<00:05:23.889> you<00:05:23.919> can<00:05:24.160> do<00:05:24.370> with<00:05:24.400> it<00:05:24.580> because<00:05:24.910> this

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
a lot you can do with it because this

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.740 
a lot you can do with it because this
articulation<00:05:25.660> isn't<00:05:26.050> great<00:05:26.320> I<00:05:27.630> don't<00:05:28.630> like

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
articulation isn't great I don't like

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.780 
articulation isn't great I don't like
his<00:05:29.169> fist<00:05:29.470> look<00:05:29.770> kind<00:05:29.979> of<00:05:30.040> weird<00:05:30.100> I<00:05:30.990> don't<00:05:31.990> I

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
his fist look kind of weird I don't I

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.130 
his fist look kind of weird I don't I
his<00:05:33.790> alternate<00:05:34.419> mode<00:05:34.540> looks<00:05:34.780> kind<00:05:35.020> of<00:05:35.080> weird

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
his alternate mode looks kind of weird

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:46.740 
his alternate mode looks kind of weird
too<00:05:38.910> yeah<00:05:39.910> I<00:05:39.940> don't<00:05:40.240> like<00:05:40.419> it<00:05:42.870> so<00:05:45.479> anyway<00:05:46.479> he

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
too yeah I don't like it so anyway he

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.870 
too yeah I don't like it so anyway he
does<00:05:46.930> have<00:05:47.169> a<00:05:47.200> third<00:05:47.500> mode<00:05:47.740> obviously<00:05:48.550> because

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
does have a third mode obviously because

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.600 
does have a third mode obviously because
he's<00:05:49.060> a<00:05:49.090> combiner<00:05:49.720> so<00:05:50.650> let's<00:05:50.890> get<00:05:51.160> him<00:05:51.430> into

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
he's a combiner so let's get him into

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.440 
he's a combiner so let's get him into
that<00:05:51.850> third<00:05:52.120> mode<00:05:52.390> while<00:05:52.750> we<00:05:52.990> still<00:05:53.320> have<00:05:53.530> time

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
that third mode while we still have time

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.300 
that third mode while we still have time
he's<00:05:55.450> actually<00:05:55.600> got<00:05:55.870> four<00:05:56.320> modes<00:05:56.590> technically

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
he's actually got four modes technically

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.960 
he's actually got four modes technically
and<00:05:57.720> I'll<00:05:58.720> tell<00:05:58.930> you<00:05:59.020> what<00:05:59.169> the<00:05:59.289> other<00:05:59.700> mode<00:06:00.700> is

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
and I'll tell you what the other mode is

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:07.040 
and I'll tell you what the other mode is
a<00:06:01.000> moment<00:06:01.539> to<00:06:02.350> plug<00:06:02.680> them<00:06:02.800> back<00:06:02.979> back<00:06:03.310> in<00:06:03.520> there

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.060 

plug<00:06:08.050> that<00:06:08.080> back<00:06:08.650> in<00:06:09.039> there<00:06:10.830> disconnect<00:06:11.830> those

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
plug that back in there disconnect those

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:21.459 
plug that back in there disconnect those
ports<00:06:13.590> put<00:06:14.590> this<00:06:14.800> back<00:06:16.770> swing<00:06:17.770> that<00:06:18.010> around

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:17.069 
to have to suffer through all three of

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:20.029 
to have to suffer through all three of
the<00:07:17.279> videos<00:07:17.669> you<00:07:18.479> want<00:07:18.629> to<00:07:18.689> see<00:07:18.779> the<00:07:19.229> final

the videos you want to see the final

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:25.540 
the videos you want to see the final
outcome<00:07:20.399> but<00:07:21.860> his<00:07:22.860> other<00:07:23.159> mode<00:07:23.430> is<00:07:23.729> actually

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:25.550 
outcome but his other mode is actually

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.149 
outcome but his other mode is actually
test<00:07:26.550> mode<00:07:26.819> so<00:07:27.449> he's<00:07:27.689> got<00:07:27.870> both<00:07:28.110> bottom<00:07:28.979> and

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:29.159 
test mode so he's got both bottom and

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:33.139 
test mode so he's got both bottom and
top<00:07:29.459> half<00:07:29.729> of<00:07:29.759> the<00:07:29.969> come<00:07:30.300> combo<00:07:31.490> thing<00:07:32.490> going

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:38.389 
to win the power links mode and like I
said<00:07:35.339> he<00:07:35.909> powerlinx<00:07:36.569> with<00:07:37.199> Ironhide<00:07:37.830> here<00:07:38.189> and

00:07:38.389 --> 00:07:38.399 
said he powerlinx with Ironhide here and
