00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.000 
almost want to get better on them I
think<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.550> fat<00:03:23.760> we<00:03:23.940> haven't<00:03:24.650> kept<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.770> clean

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
think the fat we haven't kept a clean

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.340 
think the fat we haven't kept a clean
sheet<00:03:26.040> like<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.580> boise<00:03:27.060> lastly<00:03:27.720> tree<00:03:28.110> games

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
sheet like the boise lastly tree games

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.520 
sheet like the boise lastly tree games
maybe<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.300> so<00:03:30.300> I<00:03:30.360> think<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.810> be<00:03:30.930> frustrated

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
maybe and so I think to be frustrated

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.490 
maybe and so I think to be frustrated
for<00:03:31.680> us<00:03:31.800> because<00:03:31.950> we're<00:03:32.220> listenin<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:33.290> g2g<00:03:34.290> to

for us because we're listenin to g2g to

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.840 
for us because we're listenin to g2g to
keep<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:34.830> clean<00:03:35.040> sheet<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.459> we've<00:03:35.610> got<00:03:35.820> I

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
keep that clean sheet and we've got I

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.660 
keep that clean sheet and we've got I
like<00:03:36.060> them<00:03:36.300> so<00:03:37.050> some<00:03:37.350> some<00:03:37.830> great<00:03:38.070> defender<00:03:38.520> we

eager<00:03:50.940> eager<00:03:51.200> job<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.800> get<00:03:53.250> back<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.610> the

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
eager eager job to get back to the

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.820 
eager eager job to get back to the
