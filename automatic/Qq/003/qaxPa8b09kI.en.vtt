00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.790
 [Music] 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.500
 This car also has one of course 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.070
 usb connection and like you from us 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.770

 graphics and in this he sounds meriva 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.080
 much better 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.189
 breweries 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.189
 [Music] 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.759
 prefer the new open and free three hours 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.080
 and that is very similar and 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.560
 recognizable 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.069
 from among others the astra and the insignia 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.019
 it is a nice concept in addition is in 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.459
 denotes high so you have a good 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.220
 overview of course 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.140
 he is very spacious we are now driving in one 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.260
 cosmo version 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.700
 and with that you say in one 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.190
 bucket seats 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.330
 you can even wear half the seat 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.860
 extend for people who are a little longer 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.030
 to be 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.540
 in other words it's all free 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.579
 finished and again she is overview 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.380
 particularly pleasant 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:49.069
 You also notice that is very smart about it 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.840
 thought often and you were in trouble in the 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.819
 stomach eyes loves a blind spot 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.760
 but you are rid of that by saying 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.489
 but the design of the windows 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.799
 a lot of thought has been given to it in addition 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.769
 of course everything is on board navigation 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.360
 cruise control him all kinds of audio 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.519
 possibilities 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.040
 i have shown the usb its correct and 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.819
 had open naturally and with the previous 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.170
 The miniver would all be a large audience 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.810
 because of the functionality of the car 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.049
 which gives you a lot of space 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.989
 look even people you are 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.459
 lots of space and you have a thousand alone 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.769
 storage options 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.760
 is very handy 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.910
 center console 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.800
 Here you can adjust and say 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.590
 of course just 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.430
 very simple and very well thought out 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.930
 beside 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.760
 have several options to the 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.770
 boot expelled 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.200
 you can push the rear seat forward 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.470
 your child fold down the back seat 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.010
 off and there are countless options that these 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.010
 car is sitting 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.989
 the seagulls smooth engine 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.360
 whole security taste change 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.630
 it becomes rowing and steering is thick in it 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.780
 order 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.480
 but like I just said 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.000
 there is something special about this car 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.710
 and those are the doors 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.800
 look this is pretty normal that you say well 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.310
 we have plenty the animal can do 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.360
 really completely open so you really have one 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:46.380
 very good one 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:50.169
 boarding and this is of course finished 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.300
 it is not entirely new a year or more 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.650
 ten years ago that already existed 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.320
 but 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.790
 Opel has brought it back and if 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.770
 you then look at what are its then 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:03.240
 then the benefits 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.240
 look at the says it in and out 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.810
 very easy 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:16.790
 to be allowed to go a step enormously easy 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:19.940
 in and out can see I would think so 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.320
 that must be because it is normal 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.290
 very resourceful 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.210
 it's not completely original because it 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.130
 existed before but it is handy 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.600
 and so easy certainly if you have the mare 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.600
 used as your senses 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.839
 [Applause] 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.770
 so on 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:56.210
 driven particularly well with the new one too 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.580
 for letters 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.050
 we have driven the 120 hp version 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.050
 is a fourteen hundred turbo engine
