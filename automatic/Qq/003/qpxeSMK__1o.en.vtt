00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.539 
possibly black and that's because the
main<00:01:46.049> biocide<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.770> was<00:01:46.890> being<00:01:47.070> used<00:01:47.340> is

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
main biocide that was being used is

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.910 
main biocide that was being used is
cuprous<00:01:47.909> oxide<00:01:48.320> Cooper's<00:01:49.320> oxide<00:01:49.710> actually

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
cuprous oxide Cooper's oxide actually

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.679 
cuprous oxide Cooper's oxide actually
works<00:01:50.310> pretty<00:01:50.430> well<00:01:50.759> as<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.939> biocide<00:01:51.390> but

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
works pretty well as a biocide but

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.780 
works pretty well as a biocide but
because<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.140> has<00:01:52.320> an<00:01:52.470> inherent<00:01:52.950> color<00:01:53.189> you

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
because it has an inherent color you

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.929 
because it has an inherent color you
don't<00:01:53.970> get<00:01:54.149> bright<00:01:54.450> colors<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.610> now<00:01:56.610> we're

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
don't get bright colors so now we're

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.270 
don't get bright colors so now we're
using<00:01:56.970> different<00:01:57.810> biocides<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.920> actually

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
using different biocides that actually

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.370 
using different biocides that actually
don't<00:01:59.579> have<00:01:59.850> an<00:02:00.149> inherent<00:02:00.630> color<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.320> you

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
don't have an inherent color and so you

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.649 
don't have an inherent color and so you
can<00:02:01.590> make<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> paint<00:02:02.460> any<00:02:02.670> color<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.149> want<00:02:03.390> so

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
can make the paint any color you want so

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.709 
can make the paint any color you want so
if<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.350> want<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.619> pure<00:02:04.950> white<00:02:05.250> or<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.909> yellow<00:02:06.390> or

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.869 
a bright red or of any variety of colors
you<00:02:09.899> can<00:02:10.530> choose<00:02:10.709> paints<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.310> don't<00:02:11.670> use

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
you can choose paints that don't use

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.059 
you can choose paints that don't use
cuprous<00:02:12.300> oxide<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:13.050> that'll<00:02:13.530> have<00:02:13.680> some<00:02:13.920> real

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
cuprous oxide and that'll have some real

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.400 
cuprous oxide and that'll have some real
pop<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:15.120> incidentally<00:02:15.750> if<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:15.959> paint<00:02:16.319> your

pop and incidentally if you paint your

pop and incidentally if you paint your
bottom<00:02:16.770> white<00:02:17.370> it's<00:02:17.879> really<00:02:18.150> easy<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.480> see<00:02:18.750> the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.540 
bottom white it's really easy to see the
growth<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.620> if<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:19.830> want<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.069> make<00:02:20.220> sure<00:02:20.400> that

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
growth so if you want to make sure that

in that case a copolymer ablative paint
is<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.650> really<00:03:50.069> good<00:03:50.250> choice<00:03:50.489> because<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.360> won't

paint for two reasons
one<00:04:06.900> is<00:04:07.049> that<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.319> may<00:04:07.470> encourage<00:04:07.890> harder

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
one is that it may encourage harder

growth to adhere and to live in that

growth to adhere and to live in that
environment<00:04:11.250> under<00:04:12.000> your<00:04:12.180> boat<00:04:12.360> and<00:04:12.659> the

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
environment under your boat and the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.559 
environment under your boat and the
second<00:04:13.439> thing<00:04:13.530> is<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.860> remove<00:04:14.189> the<00:04:14.459> slime<00:04:14.790> you

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
second thing is to remove the slime you

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.930 
second thing is to remove the slime you
or<00:04:15.810> a<00:04:15.840> diver<00:04:16.169> might<00:04:16.470> go<00:04:16.620> down<00:04:16.769> below<00:04:16.979> and<00:04:17.130> rub

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
or a diver might go down below and rub

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.550 
or a diver might go down below and rub
it<00:04:18.120> off<00:04:18.299> into<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.780> process<00:04:19.169> you<00:04:19.320> end<00:04:19.350> up

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
it off into the process you end up

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.189 
it off into the process you end up
rubbing<00:04:19.829> off<00:04:20.130> perfectly<00:04:20.669> good<00:04:20.850> paint<00:04:21.209> in<00:04:21.959> that

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
rubbing off perfectly good paint in that

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.530 
rubbing off perfectly good paint in that
case<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:22.620> should<00:04:22.650> consider<00:04:23.160> a<00:04:23.280> dual<00:04:23.759> biocide

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
case you should consider a dual biocide

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.540 
case you should consider a dual biocide
paint<00:04:24.960> now<00:04:25.560> these<00:04:25.740> are<00:04:25.919> paints<00:04:26.190> that<00:04:26.340> have<00:04:26.520> a

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
paint now these are paints that have a

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.340 
paint now these are paints that have a
basic<00:04:27.060> bio<00:04:27.300> side<00:04:27.630> that<00:04:27.870> takes<00:04:28.080> care<00:04:28.320> of

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
basic bio side that takes care of

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.180 
basic bio side that takes care of
hardware

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
hardware

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.370 
hardware
but<00:04:29.580> they<00:04:29.700> also<00:04:29.850> have<00:04:30.210> an<00:04:30.390> additive<00:04:30.870> that's

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
but they also have an additive that's

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.610 
but they also have an additive that's
called<00:04:31.710> bio<00:04:32.130> Luxor<00:04:32.850> burger<00:04:33.720> all<00:04:33.900> that<00:04:34.440> it

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
called bio Luxor burger all that it

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.830 
called bio Luxor burger all that it
specifically<00:04:35.400> addresses<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.240> slime<00:04:36.540> issue

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
specifically addresses the slime issue

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.470 
specifically addresses the slime issue
so<00:04:37.650> if<00:04:37.980> you're<00:04:38.280> in<00:04:38.370> an<00:04:38.490> area<00:04:38.760> that<00:04:38.940> slimey

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
so if you're in an area that slimey

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.860 
so if you're in an area that slimey
consider<00:04:40.200> a<00:04:40.290> dual<00:04:40.740> biocide<00:04:41.310> paint<00:04:41.700> now<00:04:42.630> let's

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
consider a dual biocide paint now let's

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.930 
consider a dual biocide paint now let's
look<00:04:43.020> at<00:04:43.170> some<00:04:43.350> other<00:04:43.530> compatibility<00:04:44.520> issues

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
look at some other compatibility issues

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.640 
look at some other compatibility issues
there<00:04:45.450> are<00:04:45.570> three<00:04:45.780> more<00:04:45.960> rules<00:04:46.290> you<00:04:46.500> ought<00:04:46.620> to

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
there are three more rules you ought to

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.790 
there are three more rules you ought to
be<00:04:46.830> aware<00:04:47.070> of<00:04:47.130> one<00:04:47.910> is<00:04:48.120> if<00:04:48.450> the<00:04:48.540> paint<00:04:49.380> on<00:04:49.620> your

be aware of one is if the paint on your

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.130 
be aware of one is if the paint on your

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
boat is not adhering very well don't

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.080 
boat is not adhering very well don't
apply<00:04:52.410> more<00:04:52.680> good<00:04:52.950> paint<00:04:53.190> over<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:53.610> bad<00:04:53.760> paint

apply more good paint over the bad paint

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.240 
apply more good paint over the bad paint
strip<00:04:54.930> it<00:04:55.050> down<00:04:55.260> so<00:04:55.650> that<00:04:55.800> you<00:04:55.860> have<00:04:55.980> a<00:04:56.010> good

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
strip it down so that you have a good

strip it down so that you have a good
solid<00:04:56.610> base<00:04:57.080> the<00:04:58.080> second<00:04:58.470> thing<00:04:58.620> is<00:04:58.770> that<00:04:58.800> some

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
adhesion and the third issue is we used

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.250 
adhesion and the third issue is we used
to<00:05:08.610> sell<00:05:08.790> a<00:05:08.820> lot<00:05:08.940> of<00:05:09.240> paints<00:05:09.480> that<00:05:09.540> were<00:05:09.660> vinyl

a high copper loading because that's

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.090 
a high copper loading because that's
more<00:06:21.120> effective<00:06:21.420> for<00:06:21.840> sedentary<00:06:22.140> boats<00:06:22.620> that

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100
