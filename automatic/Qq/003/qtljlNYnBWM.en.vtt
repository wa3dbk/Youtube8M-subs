00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
bit longer when you're cutting them this

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.050 
bit longer when you're cutting them this

way you have a little room to work with

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.330 
way you have a little room to work with
and<00:01:27.899> again<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> mannequin<00:01:29.310> head

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
and again this is on a mannequin head

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.090 
and again this is on a mannequin head
it's<00:01:29.670> not<00:01:29.729> human<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.509> obviously<00:01:31.100> everything

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
it's not human so obviously everything

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.289 
it's not human so obviously everything
might<00:01:32.340> be<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.490> little<00:01:32.640> bit<00:01:32.729> different<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.210> how

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
might be a little bit different and how

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.880 
might be a little bit different and how
it<00:01:33.450> lays<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.229> we're<00:01:34.380> going<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.560> keep<00:01:34.680> them<00:01:34.829> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
it lays so we're going to keep them a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.800 
it lays so we're going to keep them a
little<00:01:34.920> bit<00:01:35.159> longer<00:01:35.399> in<00:01:35.700> through<00:01:36.360> here<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
little bit longer in through here and

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.810 
little bit longer in through here and
we're<00:01:37.649> going<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.799> do<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.070> lock<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
we're going to do is lock it in with the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.170

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.580 
like her already very see so now we've
got<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.480> done<00:02:12.690> her<00:02:12.900> bangs<00:02:13.200> were<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> little

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
got that done her bangs were a little

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.870 
got that done her bangs were a little
kind<00:02:13.859> of<00:02:13.920> shattered<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.609> they<00:02:14.670> were<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.790> little

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
kind of shattered and they were a little

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.390 
kind of shattered and they were a little
bit<00:02:15.060> layered<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:16.440> what<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.620> want<00:02:16.859> to<00:02:16.950> do<00:02:17.130> is

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
bit layered so what I want to do is

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.479 
bit layered so what I want to do is
create<00:02:18.390> some<00:02:18.690> texture<00:02:19.079> in<00:02:19.410> her<00:02:19.890> layers<00:02:20.160> and

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
create some texture in her layers and

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.449 
create some texture in her layers and
the<00:02:21.120> best<00:02:21.390> way<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.500> go<00:02:22.709> about<00:02:22.920> doing<00:02:22.980> that

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
the best way that I go about doing that

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.300 
the best way that I go about doing that
is<00:02:23.989> by<00:02:25.790> actually<00:02:27.530> raising<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.620> hair<00:02:28.829> up<00:02:29.040> and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
is by actually raising the hair up and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.010 
is by actually raising the hair up and
creating<00:02:29.760> some<00:02:30.359> layers

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
creating some layers

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.630 
creating some layers
and<00:02:32.520> how<00:02:33.520> we're<00:02:33.640> going<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.790> do<00:02:33.910> that<00:02:34.180> is<00:02:35.640> lifted

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
and how we're going to do that is lifted

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.440 
and how we're going to do that is lifted
straight<00:02:36.820> up<00:02:37.300> from<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.630> head<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:39.210> all<00:02:40.210> this

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
straight up from the head and all this

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.760 
straight up from the head and all this
is<00:02:40.600> going<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.810> fall<00:02:41.050> out<00:02:41.080> this<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.560> weight

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
is going to fall out this is the weight

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.410 
is going to fall out this is the weight
here<00:02:42.070> and<00:02:42.250> then<00:02:42.820> we're<00:02:42.910> going<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.120> actually

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
here and then we're going to actually

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.030 
here and then we're going to actually
just<00:02:43.480> cut<00:02:43.810> this<00:02:43.930> straight<00:02:44.260> across<00:02:44.440> on<00:02:44.800> top

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
just cut this straight across on top

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.370 
just cut this straight across on top
here<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.550> that's<00:02:46.180> just<00:02:46.420> going<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.600> soften<00:02:46.930> up

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
here and that's just going to soften up

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.700 
here and that's just going to soften up
the<00:02:48.310> whole<00:02:48.520> fringe<00:02:48.970> area<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:49.930> it's<00:02:50.080> not<00:02:50.230> so<00:02:50.500> so

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
the whole fringe area so it's not so so

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.680 
the whole fringe area so it's not so so
heavy<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.640> you're<00:02:52.000> going<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.180> see<00:02:52.330> some<00:02:52.510> hair

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
heavy so you're going to see some hair

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.140 
heavy so you're going to see some hair
fall<00:02:52.930> out<00:02:53.110> which<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:53.710> going<00:02:53.800> to<00:02:53.860> be<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.910> length

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
fall out which is going to be the length

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.430 
fall out which is going to be the length
here<00:02:55.390> in<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.540> front<00:02:55.810> which<00:02:55.990> we<00:02:56.080> don't<00:02:56.200> want<00:02:56.290> to

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
here in the front which we don't want to

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.160 
here in the front which we don't want to
cut<00:02:56.910> we<00:02:57.910> just<00:02:58.060> want<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.240> remove<00:02:58.480> some<00:02:58.750> excess

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
cut we just want to remove some excess

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.320 
cut we just want to remove some excess
weight<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.740> you<00:03:00.310> want<00:03:00.460> to<00:03:00.550> bring<00:03:00.730> everything

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
weight and you want to bring everything

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.780 
weight and you want to bring everything
kind<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:01.960> towards<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.350> center<00:03:02.830> just<00:03:03.490> over

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
kind of towards the center just over

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.700 
kind of towards the center just over
direct<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.270> little<00:03:04.510> bit<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:07.350> that<00:03:08.350> is<00:03:08.530> going

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
direct it a little bit and that is going

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.030 
direct it a little bit and that is going
to<00:03:08.800> be<00:03:08.950> your<00:03:09.070> best<00:03:09.280> solution<00:03:09.850> for<00:03:11.040> creating

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
to be your best solution for creating

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.950 
to be your best solution for creating
some<00:03:12.490> softness<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.270> some<00:03:13.600> movement

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
some softness and some movement

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.440 
some softness and some movement
throughout<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.320> bangs<00:03:14.590> here<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.130> now<00:03:16.000> when

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
throughout the bangs here and now when

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.450 
throughout the bangs here and now when
we<00:03:16.510> go<00:03:16.690> on<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.870> other<00:03:16.990> side<00:03:17.380> what<00:03:18.100> I'm<00:03:18.190> doing

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
we go on the other side what I'm doing

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.640 
we go on the other side what I'm doing
is<00:03:18.580> I'm<00:03:18.730> simply<00:03:19.030> just<00:03:19.090> pushing<00:03:19.630> this<00:03:19.750> now

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
is I'm simply just pushing this now

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.790 
is I'm simply just pushing this now
towards<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.190> center<00:03:21.670> I'm<00:03:22.450> pushing<00:03:23.050> when

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
towards the center I'm pushing when

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.750 
towards the center I'm pushing when
you're<00:03:23.920> on<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:24.160> side<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.400> want<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:24.580> pull

you're on this side you want to pull
towards<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.450> this<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.660> why<00:03:25.750> what<00:03:25.990> you

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
towards you and this is why what you

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.300 
towards you and this is why what you
want<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.290> push<00:03:26.470> away<00:03:26.650> from<00:03:26.800> you

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
want to push away from you

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.940 
want to push away from you
and<00:03:27.670> so<00:03:27.790> you're<00:03:27.940> not<00:03:28.120> cutting<00:03:29.020> too<00:03:29.380> much<00:03:29.410> hair

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
and so you're not cutting too much hair

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
and then the last piece in the corner

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.680 
and then the last piece in the corner
here<00:03:32.700> just<00:03:33.700> going<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:33.910> over<00:03:34.120> drag<00:03:34.330> this<00:03:34.480> right

here just going to over drag this right

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.550 
here just going to over drag this right
to<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.840> center<00:03:35.760> straight<00:03:36.760> up<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.560> again

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
to the center straight up and again

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.710 
to the center straight up and again
remove<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.610> weight<00:03:39.790> not<00:03:39.970> too<00:03:40.240> much<00:03:40.420> hair<00:03:40.630> is

remove the weight not too much hair is
going<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.900> come<00:03:41.050> off<00:03:41.200> but<00:03:42.190> what<00:03:42.910> that's<00:03:43.060> going

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
to do is it's going to just create a

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.960 
to do is it's going to just create a
softer<00:03:46.680> wispier<00:03:47.680> bang<00:03:47.980> here<00:03:48.310> as<00:03:48.459> you<00:03:48.820> can<00:03:48.850> see

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
softer wispier bang here as you can see

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.449 
softer wispier bang here as you can see
believe<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.020> or<00:03:50.110> not<00:03:50.200> it<00:03:50.860> looks<00:03:51.040> like<00:03:51.190> this<00:03:51.310> is

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
believe it or not it looks like this is

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.170 
believe it or not it looks like this is
almost<00:03:51.730> done<00:03:52.380> okay<00:03:53.380> but<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.580> want<00:03:55.000> to<00:03:55.090> add<00:03:55.150> a

wispy side all right and the best way to
do<00:05:05.530> that<00:05:05.650> is<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:06.130> use<00:05:06.310> of<00:05:06.490> thinning<00:05:06.759> shear

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000

like this okay it just removes a little
bit<00:05:09.849> of<00:05:09.940> weight

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
bit of weight

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
right towards the edge that's the safest

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.309 
right towards the edge that's the safest
way<00:05:33.669> all<00:05:34.509> right<00:05:34.539> and<00:05:34.780> that's<00:05:34.900> going<00:05:35.080> to<00:05:35.139> give

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
you that that PC fringe here where you

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.640 
you that that PC fringe here where you
can<00:05:39.639> just<00:05:39.759> kind<00:05:39.940> of<00:05:40.199> soften<00:05:41.199> it<00:05:41.289> up<00:05:41.380> a<00:05:41.500> little

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
can just kind of soften it up a little

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.980 
can just kind of soften it up a little
bit<00:05:41.830> and<00:05:41.979> brush<00:05:42.520> it<00:05:42.669> over<00:05:42.789> now<00:05:43.569> I<00:05:43.599> think<00:05:43.900> it

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
bit and brush it over now I think it

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.089
