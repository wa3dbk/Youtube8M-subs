00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
which you are seeing on the screen right

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.290 
which you are seeing on the screen right
now<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:38.160> looks<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:38.730> cool<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.270> my

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
now and it looks really cool in my

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.330 
now and it looks really cool in my
opinion<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.290> cell<00:00:40.530> shaded<00:00:40.920> effect

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
opinion I like the cell shaded effect

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.630 
opinion I like the cell shaded effect
also<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.660> game<00:00:42.960> looks<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.649> based<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.160> g1

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
also the game looks to be based on g1

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.240 
also the game looks to be based on g1
which<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> huge<00:00:46.050> booyah<00:00:46.500> because<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.129> is

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
which is a huge booyah because that is

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.119 
which is a huge booyah because that is
my<00:00:47.340> favorite<00:00:47.610> series<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.239> all<00:00:48.539> time<00:00:48.739> also<00:00:49.739> it

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.279 
my favorite series of all time also it
does<00:00:50.370> say<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.850> article<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:52.110> will

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
does say in the article that it will

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.799 
does say in the article that it will
probably<00:00:52.530> be<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.770> brawler<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:54.210> maybe<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.690> will

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
probably be a brawler so maybe it will

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.380 
probably be a brawler so maybe it will
be<00:00:54.840> similar<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.739> Godzilla<00:00:56.520> games<00:00:56.850> back<00:00:57.360> in
