00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
saradomin is losing but that's the way

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.380 
saradomin is losing but that's the way
it<00:05:43.650> goes<00:05:43.800> and<00:05:43.980> it's<00:05:44.310> a<00:05:44.370> bit<00:05:44.520> it's<00:05:44.970> a<00:05:45.030> bit<00:05:45.150> weird

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
even notice but anyway I'm really

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.290 
even notice but anyway I'm really
looking<00:05:50.400> forward<00:05:50.430> to<00:05:50.700> a<00:05:50.730> result<00:05:51.060> of<00:05:51.150> this

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
looking forward to a result of this

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.900 
looking forward to a result of this
actually<00:05:51.570> because<00:05:52.010> it<00:05:53.010> could<00:05:53.310> go<00:05:53.520> either<00:05:53.550> way

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
actually because it could go either way

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.990 
actually because it could go either way
if<00:05:54.360> she<00:05:54.930> does<00:05:55.170> crash<00:05:55.500> into<00:05:55.860> our<00:05:56.160> planet<00:05:56.640> into
