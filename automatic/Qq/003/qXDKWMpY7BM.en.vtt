banana<00:00:15.370> as<00:00:15.610> you<00:00:16.150> probably<00:00:17.020> remember<00:00:17.290> it<00:00:17.560> I<00:00:18.450> dug

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
banana as you probably remember it I dug

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.110 
banana as you probably remember it I dug
this<00:00:19.570> out<00:00:19.750> of<00:00:19.840> my<00:00:19.990> container<00:00:20.860> outside<00:00:21.820> on<00:00:22.030> the

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.120 
this out of my container outside on the

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.050 
this out of my container outside on the
patio<00:00:22.300> and<00:00:22.860> I<00:00:23.860> really<00:00:24.340> massacred<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:24.910> root

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
patio and I really massacred the root

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.590 
patio and I really massacred the root
system<00:00:25.450> I<00:00:25.540> just<00:00:25.570> basically<00:00:25.900> took<00:00:26.380> a<00:00:26.500> knife<00:00:26.710> and

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
system I just basically took a knife and

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.570 
system I just basically took a knife and
and<00:00:28.600> cut<00:00:28.990> it<00:00:29.110> out<00:00:29.260> I<00:00:29.500> didn't<00:00:30.040> I<00:00:30.189> didn't<00:00:30.400> even

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
and cut it out I didn't I didn't even

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.159 
and cut it out I didn't I didn't even
worry<00:00:30.790> about<00:00:30.880> finding<00:00:31.330> any<00:00:31.570> roots<00:00:31.810> and<00:00:32.020> then<00:00:32.140> I

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
worry about finding any roots and then I

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.130 
worry about finding any roots and then I
ripped<00:00:32.529> it<00:00:32.680> out<00:00:32.830> and<00:00:33.690> plotted<00:00:34.690> it<00:00:34.809> up<00:00:34.930> in<00:00:35.050> this

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
ripped it out and plotted it up in this

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.479 
ripped it out and plotted it up in this
small<00:00:35.379> planter<00:00:36.100> this<00:00:36.910> planter<00:00:37.360> is<00:00:37.480> about<00:00:38.489> it's

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
small planter this planter is about it's

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.960 
small planter this planter is about it's
about<00:00:39.550> ten<00:00:39.910> inches<00:00:40.239> across<00:00:41.170> so<00:00:41.680> it's<00:00:42.280> a<00:00:42.460> it's<00:00:42.879> a

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
about ten inches across so it's a it's a

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.610 
about ten inches across so it's a it's a
rather<00:00:43.150> small<00:00:43.510> one<00:00:43.750> for<00:00:43.960> a<00:00:44.020> banana<00:00:44.170> of<00:00:44.500> this

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
rather small one for a banana of this

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.869 
rather small one for a banana of this
size<00:00:44.860> but<00:00:45.480> as<00:00:46.480> you<00:00:46.720> know<00:00:46.870> I'm<00:00:47.080> just<00:00:47.879> basically

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
size but as you know I'm just basically

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.670 
size but as you know I'm just basically
just<00:00:49.000> having<00:00:49.390> this<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:49.839> store<00:00:50.170> it<00:00:50.260> in<00:00:50.379> over<00:00:50.620> the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
just having this to store it in over the

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.829 
just having this to store it in over the
winter<00:00:51.010> and<00:00:51.699> then<00:00:52.269> I'm<00:00:52.390> going<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.629> place<00:00:52.809> it

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
winter and then I'm going to place it

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.079 
winter and then I'm going to place it
back<00:00:53.110> outside<00:00:53.379> where<00:00:54.070> it's<00:00:54.220> going<00:00:54.850> to<00:00:54.879> be<00:00:55.000> in

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
back outside where it's going to be in

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.689 
back outside where it's going to be in
its<00:00:55.239> bigger<00:00:55.449> home<00:00:55.720> so<00:00:56.680> I'm<00:00:57.070> not<00:00:57.220> sure<00:00:57.280> what

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
its bigger home so I'm not sure what

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.490 
its bigger home so I'm not sure what
variety<00:00:58.120> of<00:00:58.150> banana<00:00:58.510> this<00:00:58.690> is<00:00:58.750> I<00:00:58.960> think<00:00:59.170> it's<00:00:59.290> I

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
variety of banana this is I think it's I

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.549 
variety of banana this is I think it's I
think<00:00:59.589> it's<00:00:59.769> a<00:00:59.860> type<00:01:00.070> of<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.430> dwarf<00:01:01.000> banana<00:01:01.559> I

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
think it's a type of a dwarf banana I

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.469 
think it's a type of a dwarf banana I
just<00:01:03.040> bought<00:01:03.220> it<00:01:03.250> at<00:01:03.489> my<00:01:03.670> garden<00:01:03.879> center<00:01:04.269> I

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
just bought it at my garden center I

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.960 
just bought it at my garden center I
think<00:01:04.600> you<00:01:04.870> guys<00:01:05.019> saw<00:01:06.010> when<00:01:06.310> I<00:01:06.340> planted<00:01:06.790> the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
think you guys saw when I planted the

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.110 
think you guys saw when I planted the
the<00:01:07.930> containers<00:01:08.409> in<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.620> spring<00:01:08.979> I<00:01:09.250> think<00:01:09.880> was

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
the containers in the spring I think was

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.870 
the containers in the spring I think was
probably<00:01:10.299> about<00:01:11.159> six<00:01:12.159> or<00:01:12.250> eight<00:01:12.310> inches<00:01:12.640> tall

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
probably about six or eight inches tall

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.530 
probably about six or eight inches tall
and<00:01:13.979> oh<00:01:14.979> good<00:01:15.310> lord<00:01:15.490> I've<00:01:15.850> got<00:01:16.180> a<00:01:16.210> monkey

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
and oh good lord I've got a monkey

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.179 
and oh good lord I've got a monkey
growing<00:01:16.930> on<00:01:17.049> my<00:01:17.170> tree<00:01:17.490> heck<00:01:18.490> I<00:01:19.200> guess<00:01:20.200> I<00:01:20.799> guess

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
growing on my tree heck I guess I guess

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.100 
growing on my tree heck I guess I guess
more<00:01:21.579> than<00:01:21.640> one<00:01:21.969> people<00:01:22.270> like<00:01:22.420> a<00:01:22.450> banana<00:01:22.780> and<00:01:23.049> I

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
more than one people like a banana and I

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.560 
more than one people like a banana and I
didn't<00:01:23.350> know<00:01:23.469> that<00:01:23.649> monkeys<00:01:24.100> Grune<00:01:24.789> Canada<00:01:25.240> or

bring<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.509> inside<00:01:28.630> if<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.530> grow<00:01:29.740> it<00:01:29.770> they<00:01:30.070> will

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
bring it inside if you grow it they will

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:30.770 
bring it inside if you grow it they will

it looks very healthy I'll bring you in
and<00:02:08.860> I'll<00:02:08.950> show<00:02:09.789> you<00:02:10.179> down<00:02:10.479> in<00:02:10.929> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
and I'll show you down in the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.430 
and I'll show you down in the
the<00:02:11.550> center<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.000> banana<00:02:12.330> but<00:02:13.170> there's<00:02:13.319> not

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
the center of the banana but there's not

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.170 
the center of the banana but there's not
too<00:02:13.709> much<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.920> say<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:16.129> guess<00:02:17.129> if<00:02:17.340> you're<00:02:17.730> if

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
too much to say I guess if you're if

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.790 
too much to say I guess if you're if
you're<00:02:18.330> just<00:02:18.480> starting<00:02:18.629> off<00:02:18.930> with<00:02:19.110> bananas<00:02:19.560> I

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
you're just starting off with bananas I

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.490 
you're just starting off with bananas I
would<00:02:20.489> recommend<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.480> bigger<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.989> size<00:02:22.170> of

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
would recommend the bigger the size of

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.920 
would recommend the bigger the size of
the<00:02:22.560> pot<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:23.010> better<00:02:25.550> yeah<00:02:26.550> if<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.660> have<00:02:27.840> it

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
the pot the better yeah if you have it

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.740 
the pot the better yeah if you have it
in<00:02:27.989> a<00:02:28.080> small<00:02:28.319> pot<00:02:28.349> it<00:02:28.860> will<00:02:29.069> tend<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.940> not<00:02:30.480> grow

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
in a small pot it will tend to not grow

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.830 
in a small pot it will tend to not grow
as<00:02:30.900> big<00:02:31.370> kind<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.489> stunted<00:02:32.910> but<00:02:33.360> then<00:02:33.540> if<00:02:33.690> you

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
as big kind of stunted but then if you

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.600 
as big kind of stunted but then if you
are<00:02:34.349> to<00:02:34.500> transplant<00:02:35.069> it<00:02:35.129> into<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.430> much<00:02:35.580> larger

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
are to transplant it into a much larger

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.880 
are to transplant it into a much larger
pot<00:02:36.180> you'll<00:02:36.780> notice<00:02:37.049> that<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.319> will<00:02:37.470> put<00:02:37.769> on<00:02:37.860> a

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
pot you'll notice that it will put on a

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.369 
pot you'll notice that it will put on a
lot<00:02:38.129> of<00:02:38.160> growth<00:02:38.459> really<00:02:39.150> quickly

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
lot of growth really quickly

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.729 
lot of growth really quickly
generally<00:02:41.269> bananas<00:02:42.269> will<00:02:42.510> in<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.470> heat<00:02:43.620> of

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
generally bananas will in the heat of

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.020 
generally bananas will in the heat of
the<00:02:43.829> summer<00:02:44.040> because<00:02:44.250> they<00:02:44.459> do<00:02:44.519> like<00:02:44.760> heat

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
the summer because they do like heat

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.210 
the summer because they do like heat
they'll<00:02:45.660> put<00:02:45.840> out<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.989> bit<00:02:46.319> probably<00:02:46.680> about<00:02:47.160> a

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
they'll put out a bit probably about a

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.449 
they'll put out a bit probably about a
leaf<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.640> week<00:02:48.140> which<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.290> fairly<00:02:49.560> fairly<00:02:50.069> quick

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
leaf a week which is fairly fairly quick

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.180 
leaf a week which is fairly fairly quick
and<00:02:51.049> this<00:02:52.049> one<00:02:52.260> will<00:02:52.470> probably<00:02:52.829> put<00:02:53.010> out<00:02:53.160> a

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
and this one will probably put out a

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.970 
and this one will probably put out a
leaf<00:02:53.430> every<00:02:53.690> every<00:02:54.690> month<00:02:54.959> now<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.620> doesn't

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
leaf every every month now that doesn't

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.940 
leaf every every month now that doesn't
have<00:02:56.129> much<00:02:56.750> much<00:02:57.750> Sun<00:02:58.079> and<00:02:58.319> it<00:02:58.440> doesn't<00:02:58.739> have

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
have much much Sun and it doesn't have

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.580 
have much much Sun and it doesn't have
as<00:02:59.280> much<00:02:59.640> heat<00:03:00.030> as<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.629> would<00:03:00.989> outside<00:03:01.379> in<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
as much heat as it would outside in the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.130 
as much heat as it would outside in the
summer<00:03:01.970> so<00:03:02.970> yeah<00:03:03.269> let<00:03:03.569> me<00:03:03.599> bring<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.930> little

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
summer so yeah let me bring you a little

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.110 
summer so yeah let me bring you a little
bit<00:03:04.230> closer<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.650> we'll<00:03:04.739> give<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:05.010> look<00:03:05.190> at<00:03:05.370> at

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
bit closer and we'll give a look at at

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.490 
bit closer and we'll give a look at at
the<00:03:06.299> top<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:06.629> plant<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.019> see<00:03:07.260> what<00:03:07.440> it

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
the top of the plant and see what it

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.449 
the top of the plant and see what it
looks<00:03:07.560> like<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:08.069> looks<00:03:08.220> really<00:03:08.430> really

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
looks like it looks really really

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.670 
looks like it looks really really
healthy<00:03:08.790> doesn't<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.349> it's<00:03:10.349> got<00:03:10.500> beautiful

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
healthy doesn't it it's got beautiful

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.349 
healthy doesn't it it's got beautiful
green<00:03:11.190> leaves<00:03:12.349> it<00:03:13.349> did<00:03:14.120> generally<00:03:15.120> when<00:03:15.269> you

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
green leaves it did generally when you

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.059 
green leaves it did generally when you
have<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.569> inside<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.500> doesn't<00:03:16.739> have<00:03:16.920> the

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
have it inside and it doesn't have the

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.110 
have it inside and it doesn't have the
right<00:03:17.280> humidity<00:03:17.579> you'll<00:03:18.000> get<00:03:19.910> drawing<00:03:20.910> and

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
right humidity you'll get drawing and

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.330 
right humidity you'll get drawing and
yellowing<00:03:21.450> of<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.569> leaves<00:03:22.010> but<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.069> don't

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
yellowing of the leaves but I don't

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.590 
yellowing of the leaves but I don't
really<00:03:23.489> seem<00:03:23.730> to<00:03:23.790> be<00:03:23.880> getting<00:03:24.000> much<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.299> that

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
really seem to be getting much of that

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.990 
really seem to be getting much of that
this<00:03:25.530> was<00:03:25.799> probably<00:03:26.040> from<00:03:26.370> when<00:03:26.549> I<00:03:26.579> when<00:03:26.970> I

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
this was probably from when I when I

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.780 
this was probably from when I when I
brought<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.420> inside<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.950> initial<00:03:29.310> stress<00:03:29.609> is

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
brought it inside the initial stress is

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.699 
brought it inside the initial stress is
because<00:03:30.480> there's<00:03:30.660> some<00:03:30.840> over<00:03:31.079> here<00:03:31.109> on<00:03:31.440> on

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
because there's some over here on on

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.620 
because there's some over here on on
this<00:03:31.920> older<00:03:32.250> leaf<00:03:33.290> but<00:03:35.150> for<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.209> most<00:03:36.389> part

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
this older leaf but for the most part

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.830 
this older leaf but for the most part
this<00:03:36.750> plant<00:03:37.049> is<00:03:37.230> doing<00:03:37.349> phenomenal<00:03:38.630> and<00:03:39.630> let's

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
this plant is doing phenomenal and let's

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.569 
this plant is doing phenomenal and let's
give<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.019> look<00:03:40.169> in<00:03:40.319> here<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.799> don't<00:03:41.400> know<00:03:41.459> whether

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
give a look in here I don't know whether

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:42.920 
give a look in here I don't know whether
you<00:03:41.669> can<00:03:41.760> see<00:03:41.910> that<00:03:42.090> but<00:03:42.299> there's<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.540> new<00:03:42.720> leaf

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
you can see that but there's a new leaf

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.409 
you can see that but there's a new leaf
growing<00:03:43.319> right<00:03:43.530> here<00:03:43.730> touching<00:03:44.730> my<00:03:44.940> finger<00:03:45.269> is

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
growing right here touching my finger is

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:49.099 
growing right here touching my finger is
the<00:03:45.569> new<00:03:45.720> spiral<00:03:46.079> of<00:03:46.349> a<00:03:46.410> new<00:03:46.560> leaf<00:03:48.109> it's

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
the new spiral of a new leaf it's

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.780 
the new spiral of a new leaf it's
fantastic<00:03:49.709> so<00:03:49.859> I<00:03:49.889> recommend<00:03:50.340> growing<00:03:50.459> bananas

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
fantastic so I recommend growing bananas

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.750 
fantastic so I recommend growing bananas
to<00:03:51.180> everybody<00:03:51.799> you<00:03:52.799> can<00:03:53.069> grow<00:03:53.250> them<00:03:53.370> inside

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
to everybody you can grow them inside

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.509 
to everybody you can grow them inside
there<00:03:54.090> they're<00:03:55.079> quite<00:03:55.290> easy<00:03:55.319> to<00:03:55.650> grow<00:03:55.889> they

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
there they're quite easy to grow they

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.190 
there they're quite easy to grow they
like<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.000> lot<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.269> light<00:03:57.510> they<00:03:57.750> like<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:57.959> lot<00:03:58.139> of

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
like a lot of light they like a lot of

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.680 
like a lot of light they like a lot of
humidity<00:03:58.680> they<00:03:59.040> like<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.250> lot<00:03:59.459> of<00:04:00.019> moisture<00:04:01.019> and

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
humidity they like a lot of moisture and

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.780 
humidity they like a lot of moisture and
yeah<00:04:03.690> light<00:04:04.109> humidity<00:04:06.260> water<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.790> fertilizer
