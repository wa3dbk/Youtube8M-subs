00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
video and in this video I will go

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.260 
video and in this video I will go
straight<00:00:57.880> into<00:00:58.240> the<00:00:58.960> movement<00:00:59.739> of<00:00:59.890> your<00:01:00.270> hand

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
straight into the movement of your hand

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.720 
straight into the movement of your hand
and<00:01:01.540> fingers<00:01:02.170> we've<00:01:02.590> got<00:01:02.860> two<00:01:03.280> kinds<00:01:03.520> of

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
and fingers we've got two kinds of

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.910 
and fingers we've got two kinds of
movements<00:01:04.299> and<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:04.869> reason<00:01:05.319> you<00:01:05.469> make<00:01:05.679> these

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
movements and the reason you make these

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.029 
movements and the reason you make these
movements<00:01:06.700> to<00:01:07.600> bow<00:01:07.780> straight<00:01:08.140> is<00:01:08.380> that<00:01:08.649> if

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
movements to bow straight is that if

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.910 
movements to bow straight is that if
your<00:01:09.249> arm<00:01:09.520> does<00:01:09.880> this<00:01:10.179> so<00:01:10.899> not<00:01:11.109> this<00:01:11.439> because

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
your arm does this so not this because

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.709 
your arm does this so not this because
then<00:01:12.069> it<00:01:12.159> goes<00:01:12.369> all<00:01:12.759> wrong<00:01:13.060> your<00:01:13.240> nefra<00:01:13.539> can

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
then it goes all wrong your nefra can

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:15.809 
then it goes all wrong your nefra can
bow<00:01:13.869> straight<00:01:14.140> but<00:01:14.829> if<00:01:14.950> you're<00:01:15.100> moving<00:01:15.369> with

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:15.819 
bow straight but if you're moving with

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:18.840 
bow straight but if you're moving with
mainly<00:01:16.329> your<00:01:16.569> lower<00:01:16.780> arm<00:01:17.249> you<00:01:18.249> will<00:01:18.399> notice

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
mainly your lower arm you will notice

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.359 
mainly your lower arm you will notice
that<00:01:18.999> if<00:01:19.179> I<00:01:19.329> hold<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.719> bend<00:01:19.990> for<00:01:20.259> example<00:01:20.799> and<00:01:21.039> I

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
that if I hold a bend for example and I

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.200 
that if I hold a bend for example and I
will<00:01:21.429> draw<00:01:21.759> a<00:01:21.789> line<00:01:22.119> this<00:01:22.899> would<00:01:23.170> be<00:01:23.469> a<00:01:24.310> circle

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
will draw a line this would be a circle

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.120 
will draw a line this would be a circle
so<00:01:26.170> if<00:01:26.409> I<00:01:26.590> would<00:01:26.829> throw<00:01:27.340> something<00:01:28.350> away<00:01:29.350> it's

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
so if I would throw something away it's

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.249 
so if I would throw something away it's
just<00:01:30.189> to<00:01:30.429> get<00:01:30.609> something<00:01:31.119> a<00:01:31.630> ball<00:01:32.079> or

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
just to get something a ball or

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.709 
just to get something a ball or
something<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:33.069> I<00:01:33.639> want<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:33.969> throw<00:01:34.179> it<00:01:34.270> away<00:01:34.389> in

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
something and I want to throw it away in

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.410 
something and I want to throw it away in
a<00:01:34.780> straight<00:01:35.049> line<00:01:35.469> I<00:01:36.310> have<00:01:36.999> to<00:01:37.179> move<00:01:37.359> my

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
a straight line I have to move my

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.059 
a straight line I have to move my
fingers<00:01:38.049> and<00:01:38.200> wrists<00:01:38.469> I<00:01:38.649> have<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:38.950> do

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
fingers and wrists I have to do

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.980 
fingers and wrists I have to do
something<00:01:39.789> something<00:01:40.630> like<00:01:40.899> death<00:01:41.619> you<00:01:42.459> might

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
something something like death you might

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.510 
something something like death you might
throw<00:01:43.990> away<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:44.380> ball<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:44.979> really<00:01:45.249> analyze

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
your movement because that's exactly

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.539 
your movement because that's exactly
what<00:01:47.560> you<00:01:47.679> do<00:01:47.829> while<00:01:48.130> bowing<00:01:49.950> if<00:01:50.950> you<00:01:51.189> don't

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
what you do while bowing if you don't

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.730

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
just throw the way the ball will end up

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.319 
just throw the way the ball will end up
behind<00:01:56.439> you<00:01:56.679> because<00:01:56.889> it<00:01:57.249> will<00:01:57.399> go<00:01:57.609> in<00:01:57.849> a

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
behind you because it will go in a

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.660 
behind you because it will go in a
circle<00:01:58.840> towards<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.889> back<00:02:00.069> of<00:02:00.219> you<00:02:00.399> and

circle towards the back of you and

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.529 
circle towards the back of you and
that's<00:02:01.299> not<00:02:01.479> what<00:02:01.719> we<00:02:01.869> want<00:02:02.079> to<00:02:02.880> do<00:02:03.880> when<00:02:04.359> we

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.989 
that's not what we want to do when we
are<00:02:04.569> bowing<00:02:05.170> because<00:02:05.770> then<00:02:06.009> we<00:02:06.159> will<00:02:06.249> bow<00:02:06.670> like

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:06.999 
are bowing because then we will bow like

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.479 
are bowing because then we will bow like
this

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.220 

and<00:02:10.489> then<00:02:10.910> it<00:02:11.060> will<00:02:11.209> never<00:02:11.360> sound<00:02:11.629> good<00:02:11.930> and

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
and then it will never sound good and

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.360 
and then it will never sound good and
your<00:02:12.379> bow<00:02:12.530> goes<00:02:12.800> all<00:02:12.950> over<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.220> place<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:15.370> we

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
your bow goes all over the place so we

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.330 
your bow goes all over the place so we
have<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.940> movement<00:02:17.569> of<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.590> hands<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:19.280> the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
have a movement of the hands and the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.790 
have a movement of the hands and the
wrists<00:02:20.300> so<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.840> wrists<00:02:21.080> hands<00:02:21.530> or<00:02:21.650> fingers

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
wrists so the wrists hands or fingers

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.660 
wrists so the wrists hands or fingers
that<00:02:22.640> will<00:02:22.879> compensate<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.650> circle<00:02:25.190> movement

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
that will compensate the circle movement

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.509 
that will compensate the circle movement
into<00:02:26.569> a<00:02:26.599> straight<00:02:27.230> line<00:02:27.260> because<00:02:27.950> we<00:02:28.280> wants

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
into a straight line because we wants

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.940 
into a straight line because we wants
the<00:02:28.970> boat<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.450> go<00:02:29.599> over<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.019> string<00:02:30.290> in<00:02:30.560> a

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
the boat to go over the string in a

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.910 
the boat to go over the string in a
straight<00:02:31.280> line<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:32.360> what<00:02:32.540> we<00:02:32.750> do<00:02:32.989> is<00:02:33.260> that<00:02:33.319> at

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
straight line so what we do is that at

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.490 
straight line so what we do is that at
the<00:02:34.340> Frog<00:02:34.700> we<00:02:35.120> bends<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.810> fingers<00:02:36.140> we<00:02:36.319> make

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
the Frog we bends the fingers we make

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.300 
the Frog we bends the fingers we make
them<00:02:36.650> round<00:02:36.920> like<00:02:37.400> claw<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.000> go<00:02:38.780> into<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.890> tip

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
them round like claw and go into the tip

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.520 
them round like claw and go into the tip
so<00:02:41.030> your<00:02:41.299> question<00:02:41.690> was<00:02:41.720> mainly<00:02:42.019> about<00:02:42.260> did

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
so your question was mainly about did

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.470 
so your question was mainly about did
you<00:02:42.860> stretch<00:02:43.310> your<00:02:43.610> fingers<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.180> in<00:02:44.299> some

you stretch your fingers and in some

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.930 
you stretch your fingers and in some
cases<00:02:44.750> if<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.590> have<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:45.739> little<00:02:46.160> bit<00:02:46.340> short<00:02:46.670> arm

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
cases if you have a little bit short arm

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.089 
cases if you have a little bit short arm
or<00:02:47.180> maybe<00:02:47.329> short<00:02:47.599> fingers<00:02:47.959> your<00:02:48.440> pinkie<00:02:48.890> will

movement is this and at the same time
you<00:04:36.630> this<00:04:37.350> pronation<00:04:37.980> we<00:04:38.669> call<00:04:38.910> that<00:04:39.150> and

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
you this pronation we call that and

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.880 
you this pronation we call that and
further<00:04:41.490> you<00:04:41.729> go<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:41.970> tip<00:04:42.479> the<00:04:43.020> more<00:04:43.290> your

it<00:04:48.090> looks<00:04:48.390> very<00:04:48.960> different<00:04:49.320> with<00:04:49.740> different

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
it looks very different with different

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.860 
it looks very different with different
violence<00:04:50.490> because<00:04:50.940> we<00:04:51.090> all<00:04:51.240> have<00:04:51.450> different

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
violence because we all have different

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.670 
violence because we all have different
hands<00:04:52.710> and<00:04:52.950> arms<00:04:53.490> but<00:04:54.140> movement<00:04:55.140> is<00:04:55.290> that<00:04:55.560> you

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
hands and arms but movement is that you

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.340 
hands and arms but movement is that you
go<00:04:55.830> from<00:04:56.100> here<00:04:56.550> I<00:04:56.729> try<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.360> exaggerate<00:04:58.050> it<00:04:58.229> so

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
go from here I try to exaggerate it so

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.570 
go from here I try to exaggerate it so
you<00:04:58.470> can<00:04:58.620> see<00:04:58.830> it

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
you can see it

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.840 
you can see it
so<00:05:00.000> you<00:05:00.060> can<00:05:00.270> see<00:05:00.450> it<00:05:00.540> well<00:05:01.280> it's<00:05:02.280> said<00:05:02.460> here<00:05:02.669> we

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
so you can see it well it's said here we

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.530 
so you can see it well it's said here we
lean<00:05:03.410> almost<00:05:04.410> on<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.800> pinky<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.520> with<00:05:06.240> all

lean almost on the pinky and with all
the<00:05:06.690> fingers<00:05:07.110> round<00:05:07.710> and<00:05:08.130> when<00:05:08.790> you<00:05:08.940> move<00:05:09.210> to

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
the fingers round and when you move to

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.500 
the fingers round and when you move to
the<00:05:10.680> tip<00:05:10.919> then<00:05:11.430> your<00:05:11.580> finger<00:05:11.940> straight<00:05:12.000> in<00:05:12.450> a

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
the tip then your finger straight in a

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.900 
the tip then your finger straight in a
bit<00:05:12.690> and<00:05:12.930> you<00:05:13.350> will<00:05:13.500> feel<00:05:13.740> more<00:05:13.800> weight<00:05:14.580> on

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
bit and you will feel more weight on

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.390 
bit and you will feel more weight on
your<00:05:15.630> index<00:05:16.080> finger<00:05:16.560> so<00:05:16.740> that's<00:05:16.979> the<00:05:17.160> movement

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
your index finger so that's the movement

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.850 
your index finger so that's the movement
that<00:05:18.300> you<00:05:18.570> make<00:05:18.600> so<00:05:18.990> try<00:05:19.169> to<00:05:19.229> practice<00:05:19.710> this

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
that you make so try to practice this

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.100 
that you make so try to practice this
very<00:05:20.250> slowly<00:05:20.729> and<00:05:20.990> with<00:05:23.690> your<00:05:24.690> with<00:05:24.840> with

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
very slowly and with your with with

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.030 
very slowly and with your with with
whole<00:05:25.380> bow<00:05:25.680> so<00:05:26.250> if<00:05:26.669> there's<00:05:27.060> no<00:05:27.270> point<00:05:27.570> in

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
whole bow so if there's no point in

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.550 
whole bow so if there's no point in
practicing<00:05:29.040> it<00:05:29.419> like<00:05:30.419> that<00:05:30.600> because<00:05:30.840> then<00:05:31.380> you

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
practicing it like that because then you

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.590 
practicing it like that because then you
have<00:05:31.800> the<00:05:31.979> movement<00:05:32.190> but<00:05:32.520> it's<00:05:32.700> so<00:05:32.820> small<00:05:33.120> make

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
have the movement but it's so small make

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.510 
have the movement but it's so small make
movement<00:05:34.110> very<00:05:34.290> large<00:05:34.560> I<00:05:34.800> think<00:05:34.830> you<00:05:35.310> can

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
movement very large I think you can

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.060 
movement very large I think you can
practice<00:05:35.910> it<00:05:36.090> do<00:05:36.660> it<00:05:36.780> very<00:05:37.050> slow<00:05:37.350> before<00:05:37.740> your

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
practice it do it very slow before your

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.440 
practice it do it very slow before your
neck<00:05:38.310> so<00:05:38.490> you<00:05:38.520> can<00:05:38.729> really<00:05:39.090> focus<00:05:39.330> and<00:05:40.430> really

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
neck so you can really focus and really
