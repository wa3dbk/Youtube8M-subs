00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.870
 Kovalenko 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.179
 however any 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.800
 he 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.800
 for a dollar 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.789
 Igor Akinfeev Nababkin in 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.640
 seems to be true 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.640
 eg 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.940
 I'll try 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.990
 3 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.990
 if you make your time 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.300
 substantial part of clients 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.300
 rather 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.990
 good evening 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.420
 difficult situation 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.420
 but by chance 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.990
 jsc tnk 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.990
 his heroes 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.180
 recall that all the same did not help him 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.160
 guaranteed 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.850
 this is a test 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.990
 team 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.480
 that's just an idea 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.960
 85 cop now 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.380
 by the way 5 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.380
 victory 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.670
 last weekend there will be many 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.670
 three is a mistake 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.340
 P 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.340
 it all started 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.100
 1 3 more 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.689
 about that at 13 4 percent 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.190
 someone says 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.780
 as seen
