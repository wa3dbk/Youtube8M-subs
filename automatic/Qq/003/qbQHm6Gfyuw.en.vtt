yeah there could be you're right look at

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:34.160 
yeah there could be you're right look at
that<00:01:14.710> wall<00:01:14.920> cloud

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.200 

it<00:01:34.590> always<00:01:34.770> seems<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> be<00:01:35.190> kind<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.730> pull<00:01:35.970> when

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
it always seems to be kind of pull when

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:47.399 
it always seems to be kind of pull when
I<00:01:36.300> snapped<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.720> shutter

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:48.989 

you<00:01:47.710> can<00:01:47.829> find<00:01:48.039> a<00:01:48.130> place<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.490> left<00:01:48.670> side<00:01:48.880> of

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
you can find a place the left side of

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.940 
you can find a place the left side of
the<00:01:49.090> road

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.950 

second<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.729> read<00:01:52.820> on<00:01:52.939> the<00:01:53.060> left<00:01:53.240> yeah<00:01:54.439> oh<00:01:54.469> man

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.730 

two<00:01:57.110> tornadoes

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.710 

yeah<00:02:00.190> keep<00:02:00.430> going<00:02:00.850> it's<00:02:01.120> good<00:02:01.240> personal<00:02:01.600> too

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
yeah keep going it's good personal too

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:16.610 
yeah keep going it's good personal too
close<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:02.080> it<00:02:02.909> second<00:02:03.909> tornado

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.150 

to<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.129> number<00:02:17.489> three<00:02:17.760> for<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.030> day<00:02:18.239> yep

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
to this number three for the day yep

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.770 
to this number three for the day yep
and<00:02:20.340> you're<00:02:20.760> right<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.000> think<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.570> list

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
and you're right I think to the list

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.010 
and you're right I think to the list
could<00:02:21.930> be<00:02:21.990> one<00:02:22.290> pretty<00:02:22.710> soon

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:03:09.090 

he'll<00:02:29.459> yeah<00:02:31.440> come<00:02:32.440> on<00:02:32.500> focus

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:16.900 

you

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:31.589 

you

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.040 

they're<00:03:32.170> dancing<00:03:32.769> around<00:03:32.859> each<00:03:33.280> other

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.710 

they're<00:03:37.620> rotating<00:03:37.830> around<00:03:38.310> each<00:03:38.760> other

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.960 

that's<00:03:42.720> incredible

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:04:05.140 

two<00:03:49.600> funnels<00:03:50.080> rotating<00:03:50.680> around<00:03:50.800> each<00:03:51.160> other

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:12.750 

you

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:23.800 

you

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.920 

all<00:04:24.440> right<00:04:24.680> on<00:04:24.890> a<00:04:24.920> storm<00:04:25.310> just<00:04:26.090> west<00:04:26.750> of

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
all right on a storm just west of

all right on a storm just west of
Tribune<00:04:27.440> Kansas<00:04:28.040> that's<00:04:28.460> produced<00:04:29.030> five

Tribune Kansas that's produced five

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.260 
Tribune Kansas that's produced five
different<00:04:29.960> tornadic<00:04:30.350> circulations<00:04:31.270> looks

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
different tornadic circulations looks

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.850 
different tornadic circulations looks
promising<00:04:32.540> to<00:04:32.900> produce<00:04:33.080> another<00:04:33.470> one<00:04:33.620> it's<00:04:33.740> on

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
promising to produce another one it's on

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.450 
promising to produce another one it's on
its<00:04:34.010> own

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
its own

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.730 
its own
great<00:04:35.330> inflow<00:04:36.490> nothing<00:04:37.490> really<00:04:37.730> to<00:04:37.940> it<00:04:38.030> South

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
great inflow nothing really to it South

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:47.800 
great inflow nothing really to it South
very<00:04:39.740> low<00:04:40.070> LCL<00:04:40.640> is<00:04:40.670> right<00:04:40.880> now<00:04:46.330> that<00:04:47.330> vertical

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
very low LCL is right now that vertical

00:04:47.810 --> 00:05:06.570 
very low LCL is right now that vertical
motion

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:21.490 

you

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.730 

there's<00:05:22.500> gonna<00:05:22.590> be<00:05:22.680> hard<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:22.950> get<00:05:24.500> but<00:05:25.500> there

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
there's gonna be hard to get but there

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:33.410 
there's gonna be hard to get but there
is<00:05:25.890> an<00:05:26.010> anticyclonic<00:05:26.940> tornado<00:05:32.180> edit<00:05:33.180> that<00:05:33.270> in

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
is an anticyclonic tornado edit that in

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.150 
is an anticyclonic tornado edit that in
later<00:05:33.570> there's<00:05:33.780> an<00:05:33.840> anticyclonic<00:05:34.590> rotation

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
later there's an anticyclonic rotation

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:43.160 
later there's an anticyclonic rotation
right<00:05:35.310> here<00:05:41.750> that's<00:05:42.750> an<00:05:42.870> anti-psychotic

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
right here that's an anti-psychotic

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:51.530 
right here that's an anti-psychotic
tornado<00:05:46.640> on<00:05:47.640> the<00:05:47.700> flanking<00:05:48.660> line<00:05:50.540> absolutely

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
tornado on the flanking line absolutely

00:05:51.540 --> 00:06:10.610 
tornado on the flanking line absolutely
incredible

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.900 

it's<00:06:11.620> tail<00:06:12.010> clouds<00:06:12.310> has<00:06:12.520> been<00:06:12.700> on<00:06:12.880> the<00:06:13.090> ground

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
it's tail clouds has been on the ground

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.750 
it's tail clouds has been on the ground
rising<00:06:17.190> the<00:06:18.190> backside

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:36.520 

see<00:06:21.760> you<00:06:21.850> there<00:06:29.310> tremendous<00:06:30.310> vertical<00:06:30.760> motion

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.230 

so<00:06:37.100> it<00:06:37.280> looks<00:06:37.460> like<00:06:37.670> it's<00:06:37.880> getting<00:06:37.940> a<00:06:38.060> lot<00:06:38.120> of

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
so it looks like it's getting a lot of

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.630 
so it looks like it's getting a lot of
cold<00:06:38.480> air
