00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hi to all and welcome to this 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.069
 new video I'm happy to 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.440
 find for a video you have 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.719
 many ask and my routine care of 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.670
 nails and how do I do my manicure in 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.200
 general so to know that I do not 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.150
 nothing special but that you know 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.970
 that I was pleased to see this 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.680
 video I wanted to do so in general I 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.080
 do not really really big 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.390
 thing but we already start word of 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.130
 vernon we had previous days 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.740
 so I use only the street the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.449
 moving but this emptiness fast enough when 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.189
 even then in general I will wash myself 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.719
 hands and once a week I 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.600
 make a bath of olive oil so I 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.250
 dives home for about August 20 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.520
 and here I never have to have his 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.829
 room to fortify a little bit later 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.000
 maniac of the cleanliness that I am I 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.910
 cleans my nails 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.280
 again the antibacterials 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.289
 I hydrate my hands and my nails and 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.010
 cuticles with a little moisturizer 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.129
 whatever 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.020
 here and I make little ones 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.629
 circular movements I see I have 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.129
 really well I take my time to 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.930
 that the cream penetrates at the level of 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.360
 cuticles of small pots etc 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.530
 and it feels really good finally 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.530
 moment that I appreciate enormously 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.720
 then with the a8 from caudalie him 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.790
 divine I come by is actually it does 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.770
 As hydration small 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.090
 circular motions also in fact 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.009
 you will realize that with the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.650
 cream it's like a kind of mini 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.060
 scrub but nails and blow 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.950
 all the little impurities that can there 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.140
 to have on vote on the surface that goes to 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.880
 completely be removed with a cotton 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.320
 and a little water I just eliminate 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.720
 the excess fat to leave a 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.310
 smooth surface for the varnish 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.439
 actually just hold 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.720
 then I use mali missed a home 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.399
 sephora very very well and I read 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.040
 in a sense here I do not do 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.659
 back and forth too fast because 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.520
 otherwise it's going to double your nails and that 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.890
 will the guys is this really go there 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.939
 gently take your time one is 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.439
 not there to go like drunkards 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.909
 after with a little polisher like that to 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.920
 four faces this one I believe it 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.150
 comes from sephora home actually these are the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.420
 the four phases 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.149
 nir polish high school and shine the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.920
 surface of your molds and once at a 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.510
 Once again I take my time there 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.890
 I accelerated for the video but that's it 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.470
 the general I do this very slowly 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.530
 nails by nails and I do little 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.930
 movements of the back and forth for 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.720
 polish and smooth the nail so that 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.180
 then the varnish hangs better and that 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.010
 it does not make any trace then I take 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.780
 the basis of dior is apricots 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.280
 so I know it's a super 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.320
 investments times a lot of 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.300
 passers the euro but it's still 23 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.280
 euros I think but this base was going 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.959
 really great frozen since months 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.590
 of October you see she's even 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.740
 not half 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.870
 she smooths long she fortifies the nail 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.209
 she bleaches nails which it's really 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.260
 really really a big favorite 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.600
 then I take a polish from home and 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.459
 if it is a purplish volodko species 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.370
 as could be seen on the video 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.620
 and because I did well in fact 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.110
 it is to put the drop of sweat more on 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.370
 the nail and then he went all 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.709
 gently again I take my 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.480
 time I always ask for thin layers 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.519
 of material otherwise it makes bubbles and 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.440
 it's really not pretty and then to finish 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.160
 I apply my top coat from bourjois 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.080
 to fortify the nail and that manicure 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.430
 hold on longer 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.290
 then I take 1.16 fast this one 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.150
 this pulpit is violent revlon by abou 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.519
 it's a kind of oil actually that goes 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.250
 dry your polish more 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.540
 quickly and that's the result fans of 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.060
 houses as I told you nothing 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.010
 exceptional but I hope that you 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.630
 will have pleased anyway and I also wanted 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.010
 tell you about this product there is a 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.690
 deal or varnish so that is to say that 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.030
 when you varnish are dry 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.440
 you can use it for me 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.420
 become more liquid instead 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.370
 to use solvent because that 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.870
 it is very very very disadvised 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.280
 so here is waiting for the 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.120
 next video but the eu read I'm getting 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.769
 full of big kisses 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.820
 take care of yourself and then we get 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.820
 quickly found big kisses
