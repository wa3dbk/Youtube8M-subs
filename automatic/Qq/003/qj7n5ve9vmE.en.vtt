00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
important to remember especially when it

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.849 
important to remember especially when it
comes<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.119> overhead<00:01:18.750> dumbbell<00:01:19.200> extensions

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:19.859 
comes to overhead dumbbell extensions

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:21.319 
comes to overhead dumbbell extensions
and<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.250> believe<00:01:20.609> personally<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.060> this

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
and I and I believe personally that this

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.959 
and I and I believe personally that this
is<00:01:21.450> probably<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.840> most<00:01:22.100> potent<00:01:23.100> tricep

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
is probably the most potent tricep

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.639 
is probably the most potent tricep
Builder<00:01:24.299> awry<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.960> think<00:01:25.289> it's<00:01:25.380> even<00:01:25.469> better

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
Builder awry I think it's even better

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.770 
Builder awry I think it's even better
believe<00:01:26.579> it<00:01:26.729> or<00:01:26.789> not<00:01:26.880> then<00:01:27.119> they<00:01:27.329> closed<00:01:27.539> bench

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
believe it or not then they closed bench

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.690 
believe it or not then they closed bench
pressing<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.530> not<00:01:29.039> because<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.369> can't<00:01:29.579> use

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
pressing and not because you can't use

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.429 
pressing and not because you can't use
as<00:01:29.819> much<00:01:29.969> weight<00:01:30.179> obviously<00:01:30.390> but<00:01:31.049> because<00:01:31.289> it

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
as much weight obviously but because it

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.469 
as much weight obviously but because it
puts<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.039> tricep<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.729> tremendous<00:01:33.179> stretch

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
puts the tricep in a tremendous stretch

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.910 
puts the tricep in a tremendous stretch
and<00:01:33.869> when<00:01:33.959> you<00:01:34.020> get<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.229> stretch<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:34.799> like

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
and when you get that stretch it's like

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.199 
and when you get that stretch it's like
it's<00:01:35.069> bringing<00:01:35.340> all<00:01:35.490> three<00:01:35.789> heads<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:36.209 
it's bringing all three heads of the

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:39.469 
it's bringing all three heads of the
tricep<00:01:36.600> into<00:01:37.380> play<00:01:37.560> here<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.119> form<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.270> good

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
tricep into play here and form is good

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.580 
tricep into play here and form is good
and<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.719> important<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.170> come<00:01:40.319> all<00:01:40.469> the<00:01:40.530> way

I'll<00:01:51.630> switch<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.989> up<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.170> little<00:01:52.200> bit<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.619> would

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
I'll switch it up a little bit I would

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.979 
I'll switch it up a little bit I would
take<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> slightly<00:01:53.369> um<00:01:53.700> then<00:01:54.509> maybe<00:01:54.659> take<00:01:54.810> like

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:54.989 
take a slightly um then maybe take like

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:57.859 
take a slightly um then maybe take like
a<00:01:55.020> high<00:01:55.170> cable<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:56.130> pull<00:01:56.369> with<00:01:56.489> a<00:01:56.520> rope<00:01:56.869> but

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
a high cable and pull with a rope but

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.679 
a high cable and pull with a rope but
usually<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.140> tend<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.619> use<00:01:59.069> more<00:01:59.369> with<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> use

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
usually I tend to use more with the use

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.910 
usually I tend to use more with the use
of<00:02:00.720> like<00:02:00.989> like<00:02:01.229> free<00:02:01.439> weight<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> little<00:02:01.829> bit

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
of like like free weight a little bit

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.100 
of like like free weight a little bit
more<00:02:02.069> than<00:02:02.220> machines<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.700> cables<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.209> used<00:02:04.020> to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
more than machines and cables I used to

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.209 
more than machines and cables I used to
like<00:02:04.229> free<00:02:04.380> weights<00:02:04.530> super<00:02:04.770> my<00:02:04.860> shoulders

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
like free weights super my shoulders

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.740 
like free weights super my shoulders
hurt<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.459> much<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.819> use<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.209> cables<00:02:06.569> but

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
hurt so much that I use the cables but

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.139 
hurt so much that I use the cables but
yeah<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.229> do<00:02:07.619> believe<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.340> very<00:02:08.729> potent

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
yeah I do believe this is a very potent

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.539 
yeah I do believe this is a very potent
exercise<00:02:09.630> for<00:02:09.989> tricep<00:02:10.649> development<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.280> I

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
exercise for tricep development and I

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.100 
exercise for tricep development and I
think<00:02:11.760> more<00:02:11.940> people<00:02:12.209> don't<00:02:12.540> do<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.810> because<00:02:13.019> it

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
think more people don't do it because it

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.229 
think more people don't do it because it
hurts<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:13.680> know<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:13.950> feel<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.910> know<00:02:14.970> no<00:02:15.120> one

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
hurts you know and feel you know no one

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.850 
hurts you know and feel you know no one
likes<00:02:15.269> to<00:02:15.510> squat<00:02:15.750> no<00:02:16.079> one<00:02:16.230> likes<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.530> do<00:02:16.650> bent

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
likes to squat no one likes to do bent

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.349 
likes to squat no one likes to do bent
over<00:02:17.040> rows<00:02:17.310> no<00:02:17.579> one<00:02:17.670> likes<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:17.910> do<00:02:18.030> overhead

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
over rows no one likes to do overhead

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:19.729 
over rows no one likes to do overhead
tricep<00:02:18.750> extensions<00:02:19.170> because<00:02:19.440> it's<00:02:19.650> a

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
tricep extensions because it's a

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.740 
tricep extensions because it's a
complicated<00:02:20.220> movement<00:02:20.639> to<00:02:20.700> do<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.389> they<00:02:21.510> tend

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
complicated movement to do so they tend

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.140 
complicated movement to do so they tend
to<00:02:21.780> take<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.079> easy<00:02:22.200> way<00:02:22.440> out

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150

that you're really gonna bring the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.780 
that you're really gonna bring the
tricep<00:02:50.270> into<00:02:50.480> play<00:02:50.660> here

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
tricep into play here

tricep into play here
what's<00:02:52.790> what<00:02:53.000> are<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.150> thinking<00:02:53.420> about<00:02:53.599> most

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
what's what are you thinking about most

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.630 
what's what are you thinking about most
the<00:02:53.900> top<00:02:54.170> contraction<00:02:54.770> port<00:02:55.010> or<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.400> or<00:02:55.610> the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
the top contraction port or the or the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.890 
the top contraction port or the or the
down<00:02:55.940> part<00:02:56.209> where<00:02:56.390> you<00:02:56.450> getting<00:02:56.599> the<00:02:56.720> full

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
down part where you getting the full

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.430 
down part where you getting the full
stretch

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
stretch

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.839 
stretch
no<00:02:57.830> definitely<00:02:58.099> the<00:02:58.340> down<00:02:58.489> bar<00:02:58.700> oh<00:02:58.760> I'm

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
no definitely the down bar oh I'm

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.600 
no definitely the down bar oh I'm
getting<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.120> four<00:02:59.270> stretch<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.370> reason

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
getting the four stretch and the reason

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.010 
getting the four stretch and the reason
I<00:03:01.670> ask<00:03:01.850> you<00:03:01.970> that<00:03:02.120> is<00:03:02.300> because<00:03:02.330> there's<00:03:02.930> a

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
I ask you that is because there's a

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.600 
I ask you that is because there's a
reason<00:03:03.170> most<00:03:03.709> people<00:03:03.830> don't<00:03:04.069> realize<00:03:04.280> it's

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
reason most people don't realize it's

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.550 
reason most people don't realize it's
the<00:03:04.970> way<00:03:05.390> up<00:03:05.540> of<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.780> positive<00:03:06.230> portion<00:03:06.440> of

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
the way up of the positive portion of

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.170 
the way up of the positive portion of
the<00:03:06.620> movement<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:06.980> really<00:03:07.220> just<00:03:07.400> a<00:03:07.610> strength

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
the movement is really just a strength

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.150 
the movement is really just a strength
generator<00:03:08.660> it<00:03:09.140> doesn't<00:03:09.500> build<00:03:09.590> muscle<00:03:10.010> it's

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
generator it doesn't build muscle it's

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.979 
generator it doesn't build muscle it's
the<00:03:10.310> it's<00:03:10.519> the<00:03:10.610> essential<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.630> negative

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
the it's the essential and the negative

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.270 
the it's the essential and the negative
portion<00:03:12.170> of<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.470> movement<00:03:12.800> with<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:12.980> stretch

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
portion of the movement with the stretch

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.250 
portion of the movement with the stretch
it's<00:03:13.940> actually<00:03:14.269> tearing<00:03:14.750> down<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.989> muscle

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
it's actually tearing down the muscle

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.809 
it's actually tearing down the muscle
fibers<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:15.680> is<00:03:16.010> gonna<00:03:16.160> make<00:03:16.310> this<00:03:16.459> muscle

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
fibers and is gonna make this muscle

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.490 
fibers and is gonna make this muscle
grow<00:03:16.970> bigger<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.330> it's<00:03:17.569> an<00:03:17.690> important<00:03:18.350> point

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
grow bigger and it's an important point

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.660 
grow bigger and it's an important point
to<00:03:18.620> make<00:03:18.680> it<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:18.950> think<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.160> lot<00:03:19.310> of<00:03:19.400> people

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
to make it I think a lot of people

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.130 
to make it I think a lot of people
usually<00:03:20.090> just<00:03:20.390> let<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.600> weight<00:03:20.720> come<00:03:20.959> down

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
usually just let the weight come down

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.780 
usually just let the weight come down
like<00:03:21.470> gravity<00:03:21.890> bring<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.130> down<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:22.459> noticed

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
like gravity bring it down and I noticed

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.009 
like gravity bring it down and I noticed
you<00:03:22.850> were<00:03:22.970> really<00:03:23.120> lowering<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.900> weight

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
you were really lowering the weight

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.100 
you were really lowering the weight
deliberately<00:03:24.500> you<00:03:24.799> know<00:03:24.890> with<00:03:25.010> good<00:03:25.190> control

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
deliberately you know with good control

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.030 
deliberately you know with good control
the<00:03:27.110> reason<00:03:27.350> why<00:03:27.440> I<00:03:27.500> was<00:03:27.590> lowering<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:27.890> weight

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
the reason why I was lowering the weight

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.130 
the reason why I was lowering the weight
it's<00:03:28.670> because<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.060> get<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.299> bottom<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:30.019> high

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
it's because you get the bottom the high

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.390 
it's because you get the bottom the high
point<00:03:30.440> of<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.709> tricep<00:03:32.680> my<00:03:33.680> point<00:03:33.980> is<00:03:34.130> that<00:03:34.160> you

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
point of the tricep my point is that you

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.860 
point of the tricep my point is that you
know<00:03:34.610> it<00:03:34.940> was<00:03:35.060> good<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:35.390> way<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:35.540> were<00:03:35.660> doing

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
know it was good the way you were doing

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:36.910 
know it was good the way you were doing
because<00:03:35.959> you're<00:03:36.260> getting<00:03:36.410> a<00:03:36.590> nice<00:03:36.769> stretch

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
because you're getting a nice stretch

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.539 
because you're getting a nice stretch
and<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:39.230> muscles<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.100> muscles<00:03:40.280> really

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
and the muscles and the muscles really

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.460 
and the muscles and the muscles really
gonna<00:03:40.760> grow<00:03:40.970> better<00:03:41.180> and<00:03:41.330> the<00:03:41.930> reason<00:03:42.170> we're

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
gonna grow better and the reason we're

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.020 
gonna grow better and the reason we're
bringing<00:03:42.709> this<00:03:42.830> point<00:03:43.069> out<00:03:43.220> is<00:03:43.340> because<00:03:43.610> there

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
bringing this point out is because there

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.580 
bringing this point out is because there
are<00:03:44.180> a<00:03:44.209> lot<00:03:44.299> of<00:03:44.420> beginners<00:03:44.840> you<00:03:45.080> know<00:03:45.200> watching

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
know you guys see them in the gym all

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.380 
know you guys see them in the gym all
the<00:03:48.290> time<00:03:48.549> they<00:03:49.549> just<00:03:49.760> let<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.000> weight<00:03:50.120> kind

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
the time they just let the weight kind

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.690 
the time they just let the weight kind
of<00:03:50.480> come<00:03:50.630> down<00:03:50.840> under<00:03:51.230> gravity<00:03:51.859> and<00:03:52.130> then<00:03:52.430> and

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
of come down under gravity and then and

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.009 
of come down under gravity and then and
then<00:03:52.820> they<00:03:52.940> push<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.329> way<00:03:53.420> it<00:03:53.540> up<00:03:53.630> properly

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
then they push the way it up properly

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.330 
then they push the way it up properly
but<00:03:54.230> but<00:03:54.410> they<00:03:54.500> don't<00:03:54.680> control<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.070> way<00:03:55.160> down

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
but but they don't control the way down

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.099 
but but they don't control the way down
in<00:03:55.459> it<00:03:55.609> and<00:03:55.640> just<00:03:55.880> watching<00:03:56.090> you<00:03:56.390> guys<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.989> can

the<00:04:09.470> good<00:04:09.620> thing<00:04:09.799> with<00:04:09.890> using<00:04:10.130> a<00:04:10.190> one-time

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
the good thing with using a one-time

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.860 
the good thing with using a one-time
move<00:04:10.609> and<00:04:10.820> you<00:04:10.880> got<00:04:11.060> your<00:04:11.239> other<00:04:11.299> hand<00:04:11.570> to<00:04:11.690> kind

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
move and you got your other hand to kind

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.410 
move and you got your other hand to kind
of<00:04:11.930> self<00:04:12.170> spot<00:04:12.410> you<00:04:12.590> so<00:04:13.310> you<00:04:13.970> know<00:04:14.060> even<00:04:14.180> though

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
of self spot you so you know even though

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.150 
of self spot you so you know even though
you're<00:04:14.750> still<00:04:14.959> getting<00:04:15.200> you<00:04:15.920> still

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
you're still getting you still

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.250 
you're still getting you still
maximizing<00:04:16.850> the<00:04:16.940> whole<00:04:17.090> movement<00:04:18.049> because

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
maximizing the whole movement because

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.779 
maximizing the whole movement because
you<00:04:18.859> know<00:04:18.919> you're<00:04:19.070> given<00:04:19.280> you're<00:04:19.579> giving
