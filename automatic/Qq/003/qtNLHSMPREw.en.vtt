00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello today we will be in 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.420
 so 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.830
 section in our game like built 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.679
 start building the very top you immediately 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.289
 we see metal rudium mine left 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.600
 tomorrow deuterium is three such 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.380
 important buildings and give us basic 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.869
 our crystal metal resources are now 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.779
 using the adjustment criteria also still 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.939
 used to fly the form of fuel on 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.160
 these resources are also arbitrary 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:39.090
 all your studies will be better to build 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.660
 one level you can build at least the 70s 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.360
 level 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:48.120
 build how much will fit the larger mine 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.510
 more resources each mine itself from 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.370
 a certain amount of energy energy 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.340
 the important is filled in by the solar 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.670
 power plant or by fusion 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.730
 power plants this case us now 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.710
 closed there are many buildings who 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.189
 currently closed to open 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.780
 here on the right is signed what is missing 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:14.580
 in this case for thermonuclear 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.500
 power plant lacks sugar 2 series 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.340
 Level 5 that is, can quickly 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.340
 adjust 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.390
 Valya you open all the principle so everything 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.490
 the buildings open lack some 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.380
 studies then we just go to the section 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.479
 study and conduct and further we have 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.610
 technopolis which is quite good 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.200
 speed up learning by 16 percent as much 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.869
 wino himself expensive in the future 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.750
 will be but when you get to him someone 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.399
 will be the soul 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.899
 There is a robot factory in which it accelerates 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.850
 building construction 10 percent on 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.009
 study they affect there is a factory 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.009
 monoliths which accelerates all buildings 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.050
 twice in the photo defense up also 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.350
 affects 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.269
 of thing someone as 10 percent faster 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.239
 construction 

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:14.000
 Navy and defense have wonderful 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:17.090
 the repository will also prompt to have a resource 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.280
 she course things do not stint build 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.840
 worse, then 15 can be sculpted without any problems 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.510
 can't go wrong 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.010
 even your planet was big when 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.790
 will put the colonies put them 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.019
 from about 300 places shop you have everything there 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.730
 climbed not then tormented 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.760
 explore the collaborator from each 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.810
 level by ten percent 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.910
 accelerates research the more 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.579
 labs then the faster you go 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.560
 research has research 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.100
 intergalactic network it allows 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.870
 combine several of your lab and 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:01.780
 I do so to say all that you still sound 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:05.860
 soon there terraformer so he and 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:10.030
 allows you to expand the planet 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.890
 he adds this field free back 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.290
 to the level that is let's say build and 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.980
 here the terraformer of a name is 70 places still 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.590
 is added 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.510
 very useful to build an alliance warehouse 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.070
 allows your friends to come to you on 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.950
 protection let's say someone flies at you 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.820
 attack you write to a friend of type 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:34.090
 so and so I say such there although the key 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.340
 on the inhabitants we insert protection suddenly with 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.200
 air force is enough 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:45.300
 red fleet appendage protection rises and 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:49.360
 together burst the enemy here rocket mine 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.000
 quite a good thing lets shoot 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.440
 missiles and defense tips 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.390
 enemy or missiles 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.540
 interceptors above are also not missiles 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.420
 who fly you well and actually 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.550
 three very important buildings for me alone 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:11.040
 of the most useful in the game this is easy 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:15.010
 the conveyor here it is the middle conveyor and 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.130
 heavy conveyor they all accelerate 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.930
 building a fleet and defense all in its own way and 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.510
 influence you are perfect ships class 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.669
 easy conveyor violin easy class and 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:29.530
 for each level it accelerates by 10 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.870
 you sit down the conveyor to say only the middle 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.650
 class and speeds up at 5 out per second 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.050
 the buildings 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.250
 heavy carly russian only heavy 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.680
 class and on one ship per second then 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.320
 there is so tune let's say 1 flying 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.140
 death but with their heavy conveyor 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.120
 built 2 already have put it a pity 2 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.890
 Level 10 will also get off 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:56.400
 can also be built 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.990
 dark matter if I tell you and and much 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.700
 I have 102 thousand here, that is, I can 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.650
 buy 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.300
 quickly ru dicky well beginner level 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.229
 shackles easier to build 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.840
 for resources for what is better matter 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:15.669
 spend on fleet up in balance or on 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.360
 defense and buy what is built for a long time 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.569
 that is our goal 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.569
 47 fields and already occupied buildings 250 of them 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:25.669
 total freedom 203 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:28.310
 about the description of each building you can 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:32.830
 read by clicking on the question here about 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.830
 energy production everything will be painted 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:38.210
 here are all the buildings all these buildings will be 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:39.550
 available on other planets go from stock 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.219
 on logic will 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:47.569
 mines lens but accordingly 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:51.039
 stations there and what for and so here in 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.039
 principle all bye
