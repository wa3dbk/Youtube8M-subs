00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 the pregnant woman who drinks 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.680
 can suffer several 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.240
 several problems can be 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.280
 triggered by the ingestion of beverages 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.049
 alcohol during pregnancy 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.660
 the risks are both for future 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.029
 how much for the babies that are 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.510
 information the gynecologist and obstetrician 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.970
 luiz marques emphasizes that there is no 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.820
 a safe amount for alcohol when the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.710
 subject is pregnancy is there is not a dose 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:35.460
 the first trimester, the baby is 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.120
 forming his entire nervous system 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.969
 the first 28 days of pregnancy, ie 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.980
 the woman does not even know she's pregnant yet 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.770
 occurs every closure of what the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:52.219
 People call neural tube that will form 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:55.620
 brain is the marrow and alcohol can 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:58.949
 interact in this process of training the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.109
 nervous system and malformation 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.080
 in this closure where it may occur 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.479
 mingus helix that ball that from here 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.750
 full of or sometimes even gets by 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.479
 inside the liquor or that spine that 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.299
 the child is open and this may cause 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.810
 paralysis can cause all the difficulty 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.240
 the mobility of the child then 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.979
 legs on your legs 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.490
 And you see we're talking about 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.430
 initial formation of the nervous system 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.979
 then the commitment of the system 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.140
 nervous system can be very 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.590
 Do you know if a woman who uses alcohol 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.770
 in the first quarter is a large 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.990
 number of abortion losses due to the use of 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.659
 alcohol in early pregnancy 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.210
 the singer luiz complements in last 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.450
 trimester of pregnancy will form the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.530
 rest of the brain is a very 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.649
 accelerated 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.430
 before the baby is born from that brain 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.310
 which is the pasta to top 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.649
 then the use of alcohol at this time of the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.049
 third quarter is also 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.970
 related to changes that will 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.390
 to diminish the intellectual capacity of this 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.870
 child who can give symptoms of 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.050
 hyperactivity 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.450
 disorders is cognitive that child 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.170
 who goes wrong at school who can not 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.660
 then this is usually what 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.510
 may occur in this interference 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.000
 with the nervous system but may occur 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.560
 heart problems malformations 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.580
 cardiac 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.470
 the child who has alcoholic syndrome 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.350
 fetal 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:48.050
 that mother who drinks alcohol ingere generates 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:56.360
 can have changes even makes is a 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:58.250
 child born with small headache 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.430
 too thin 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.410
 without that this region and that is what the 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.989
 People here have the little cheese 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.080
 alterations of the ear or is the 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.860
 dental arches with difficulty of 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.570
 and the palate is not that what the 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.140
 People have inside the mouth the sky of oki 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.420
 called sky of the mouth then something inter age 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.049
 in the body as a whole in the 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.060
 baby 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.489
 the specialist clarifies about the 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.769
 fetal alcohol syndrome 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.570
 not that every mother will have the baby with 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.980
 fetal alcohol syndrome 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.000
 sometimes it can only have an absurdity of 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.769
 know of knowledge and 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.170
 hyperactivity but some no more 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.600
 can trigger this syndrome 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.790
 that has one including the whole face 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.730
 different here in brazil but it takes 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.030
 black beer of the law tinÃ© woman who 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.320
 breastfeed and should not drink alcohol 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.510
 the alcohol passes membranes very easy 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.989
 are quiet molecules to pass 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.480
 any placental barrier reminder 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:08.180
 the alcohol accumulates in the liquid that gives 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.810
 baby's handbag then helm stays that 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.620
 some days and days the alcohol goes to the 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.450
 baby 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.970
 the doctor emphasizes that the risk exists 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.030
 both for the future mother and the 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.030
 drink
