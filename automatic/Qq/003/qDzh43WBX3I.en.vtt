 7 Greece was on a nice view in 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.060
 the commentary leading hero was 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.250
 phantom assassin 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.519
 well , omniknight was also often mentioned 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.490
 these heroes are really very interesting on 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.590
 the facts on them are really little well 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.779
 bear think these comments appeared 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.020
 because of the people who wrote 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.750
 have seen these pictures in which omnicnight 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.519
 and phantom is great friends but 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.470
 here's a baguette when and in the history of heroes 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.679
 thread a single hint of this relationship 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.260
 which means I'm unfortunately ready to upset 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.540
 most of my viewers are these pictures 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.000
 very popular English-speaking forums and 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.239
 sites and from there they went 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.579
 content but so far there is nothing and now 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.039
 let's talk about the characters separately phantom 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.140
 assassin has the name martin what can 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.270
 considered a reference to legends and myths about 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.460
 to king arthur my mind was known 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.120

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.370
 fought with him for alcohol on colic pockets 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.309
 Arthur killed mort et although he himself was 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.080
 mortally wounded by this and end 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.030
