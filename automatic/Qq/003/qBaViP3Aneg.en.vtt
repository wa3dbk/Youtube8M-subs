find one you like I happen to like this

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.990 
find one you like I happen to like this
but<00:01:25.470> some<00:01:25.680> people<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.220> smoother<00:01:26.640> quality

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000

and when you have that in the morning
that<00:01:28.920> protein<00:01:29.520> helps<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.360> nice<00:01:30.689> steady

yogurt right Greek yogurt has a really

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.499 
yogurt right Greek yogurt has a really
high<00:01:38.040> protein<00:01:38.340> content<00:01:38.909> because<00:01:39.360> it's

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
high protein content because it's

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.999 
high protein content because it's
strained<00:01:39.960> which<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.259> what<00:01:40.380> makes<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.740> sick

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009

strained which is what makes it so sick
correct<00:01:41.340> what<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.610> want<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.210> dense

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899

correct what you want is that dense
protein<00:01:43.619> because<00:01:43.890> what<00:01:44.070> that's<00:01:44.250> going<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.460> do

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
protein because what that's going to do

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.550 
protein because what that's going to do
is<00:01:44.790> keep<00:01:45.090> your<00:01:45.299> blood<00:01:45.570> sugar<00:01:45.840> from<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.320> too

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
is keep your blood sugar from going too

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.090 
is keep your blood sugar from going too
high<00:01:46.799> if<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> sugary<00:01:48.890> cereal<00:01:49.890> for

fat okay so let's not do that let's have
this<00:02:00.000> high<00:02:00.210> protein<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.930> keep<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.409> blood

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
this high protein and keep the blood

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.590

but<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.750> know<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.899> lot<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.079> people<00:02:04.380> eat<00:02:04.500> yogurt

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
but I know a lot of people eat yogurt

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.810 
but I know a lot of people eat yogurt
through<00:02:04.920> want<00:02:05.070> I'm<00:02:05.219> sure<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.520> they're<00:02:05.670> doing

the yogurt that's gonna benefit them

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.749 
the yogurt that's gonna benefit them
most<00:02:07.170> if<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.409> have<00:02:07.619> sort<00:02:07.799> of<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.979> sugary<00:02:08.280> yogurt

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
most if you have sort of a sugary yogurt

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.609 
most if you have sort of a sugary yogurt

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
say add berries I tell my kids this is

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.480 
say add berries I tell my kids this is
nature's<00:02:14.660> candy<00:02:14.990> you<00:02:15.590> can<00:02:15.770> have<00:02:15.950> as<00:02:16.160> much

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
nature's candy you can have as much

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.370 
nature's candy you can have as much
blueberry<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.300> strawberries<00:02:17.810> as<00:02:17.959> you<00:02:18.140> like

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
blueberry and strawberries as you like

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.870 
blueberry and strawberries as you like
just<00:02:18.680> brush<00:02:18.860> your<00:02:19.010> teeth<00:02:19.190> afterwards<00:02:19.550> so<00:02:19.850> that

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
just brush your teeth afterwards so that

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.970 
just brush your teeth afterwards so that
they<00:02:20.120> stay<00:02:20.330> white<00:02:20.540> exactly<00:02:21.319> exactly

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
they stay white exactly exactly

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.350 
they stay white exactly exactly
but<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.250> good<00:02:22.400> thing<00:02:22.430> about<00:02:22.640> this<00:02:22.970> is<00:02:23.180> it's

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
but the good thing about this is it's

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.330 
but the good thing about this is it's
full<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.780> antioxidants<00:02:24.050> so<00:02:24.650> when<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.890> do<00:02:25.100> go

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
full of antioxidants so when you do go

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.610 
full of antioxidants so when you do go
and<00:02:25.580> exercise<00:02:26.209> or<00:02:26.510> walk<00:02:26.780> this<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.260> going<00:02:27.560> to

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
and exercise or walk this is going to

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.890 
and exercise or walk this is going to
make<00:02:27.860> all<00:02:28.010> that<00:02:28.280> oxygen<00:02:28.490> go<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.420> muscles

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
make all that oxygen go to the muscles

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.600 
make all that oxygen go to the muscles
so<00:02:30.140> much<00:02:30.320> easier<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:30.890> you're<00:02:31.340> going<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.490> have

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
so much easier that you're going to have

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.430 
so much easier that you're going to have
a<00:02:31.670> great<00:02:32.030> workout<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.600> your<00:02:32.990> blood<00:02:33.170> sugar

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
a great workout and your blood sugar

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.630 
a great workout and your blood sugar
stays<00:02:33.650> nice<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.250> steady

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
stays nice and steady

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.949 
stays nice and steady
she's<00:02:34.850> even<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.420> little<00:02:35.630> bit<00:02:35.720> more<00:02:35.870> energy

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
she's even and a little bit more energy

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.860 
she's even and a little bit more energy
yes<00:02:36.740> it's<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.280> nature's<00:02:37.970> blood<00:02:38.330> sugar<00:02:38.630> that's

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
yes it's the nature's blood sugar that's

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.900 
yes it's the nature's blood sugar that's
a<00:02:39.140> major<00:02:39.500> sugar<00:02:39.800> is<00:02:40.040> gonna<00:02:40.220> keep<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.550> steady

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
a major sugar is gonna keep it steady

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.199 
a major sugar is gonna keep it steady
okay<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.360> little<00:02:41.630> perhaps<00:02:42.250> sugar<00:02:43.250> though<00:02:43.489> isn't

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
okay a little perhaps sugar though isn't

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.430 
okay a little perhaps sugar though isn't
so<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.480> you're<00:02:44.810> saying<00:02:45.080> we<00:02:45.200> can<00:02:45.320> have
