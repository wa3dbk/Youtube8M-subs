00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.419
 I have to replace the committee for no because how it works 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.759
 we want to say our regard 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.739
 it is an agreement that 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:13.119
 it is a shame to ask us about torricelli dtt ke they are very much for us 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.730
 fundamental and then also a control 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.539
 transparency on this. the worker's climate is now more than anything else 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.119
 of awareness 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.119
 of what 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.210
 already, even as unique 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.040
 but because it takes 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.680
 if you want to work 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.850
 it is like that or I am also leaving the last statement you made yesterday 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.120
 marchionne suggests this 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.300
 if a little passes, 51% are gone 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.650
 they even ask him where his heart is 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.890
 if fiat has if in turin and he answers you have 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.920
 and the fiat and all over brazil america 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.309
 so it means that I'm thinking of something else 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.670
 however in the meantime he wants 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.320
 take away all of us from telling you that they are fundamental with regards to 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.560
 laws are right to choose strikes 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.440

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.970

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.390

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.300
 we are tired of making layoff we are tired we are 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.030

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.729

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.640

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.740
 naples, put the best part to see the real car problems if you continue like this 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.090
 the fiom makes a re-foundation line that is no longer represented in parliament 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.939
 that is not good 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.159

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.309
 alice sebold first of confusion because there is a union always divided 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:25.069
