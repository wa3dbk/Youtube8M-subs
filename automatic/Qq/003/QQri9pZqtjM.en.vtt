00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
the on the wheels here one of the things

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.850 
the on the wheels here one of the things
about<00:02:39.120> reflectors<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.930> if<00:02:40.050> you<00:02:40.500> put<00:02:40.800> them

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
about reflectors is it if you put them

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.320 
about reflectors is it if you put them
in<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.070> moving<00:02:41.430> place<00:02:41.670> on<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.910> blank<00:02:42.120> like

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
in a moving place on the blank like

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.240 
in a moving place on the blank like
pedals<00:02:42.720> or<00:02:42.870> wheels<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:44.400> research<00:02:44.910> shows<00:02:45.360> that

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
pedals or wheels the research shows that

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.500 
pedals or wheels the research shows that
motorists<00:02:47.250> are<00:02:47.370> tend<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.880> be<00:02:47.970> more<00:02:48.120> aware<00:02:48.480> and

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
more cautious of something that's moving

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.100 
more cautious of something that's moving
around<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.000> if<00:02:51.060> they<00:02:51.180> see<00:02:51.240> a<00:02:51.360> reflector<00:02:51.900> like

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
around so if they see a reflector like

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.400 
around so if they see a reflector like
on<00:02:52.290> pedals<00:02:52.680> moving<00:02:53.430> around<00:02:53.670> they<00:02:54.390> see<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:55.020> it

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
on pedals moving around they see you it

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.850 
on pedals moving around they see you it
cues<00:02:56.100> in<00:02:56.280> on<00:02:56.460> their<00:02:56.900> on<00:02:57.900> their<00:02:58.230> brain<00:02:58.500> there's

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
cues in on their on their brain there's

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.590 
cues in on their on their brain there's
something<00:02:59.160> about<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.550> cognitive<00:03:00.030> effect<00:03:00.420> of

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
something about the cognitive effect of

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.810 
something about the cognitive effect of
that<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.990> makes<00:03:01.170> people<00:03:01.500> less<00:03:02.250> likely<00:03:02.280> to

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
that that makes people less likely to

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.820 
that that makes people less likely to
run<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.150> over<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.510> make<00:03:03.630> you<00:03:03.780> flat<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.680> don't

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
run you over and make you flat you don't
