00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.430
 the current situation remains strongly 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.530
 depressed world commodity prices 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.870
 dairy products are maintained at 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.200
 very low levels and this trend 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.880
 bearishness is reflected in Europe by 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.130
 shipments of skimmed milk powder to 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.489
 the intervention which was no longer 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.780
 arrived since the year 2009 the 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.850
 price deterioration on the markets 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.880
 international is related to the combination 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.950
 of several factors on the one hand the 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.040
 large stocks of dairy products 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.310
 formed in 2014 have not been cleared 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.450
 and continues to weigh on the market 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.010
 on the other hand the international demand 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.410
 for dairy is a little 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.900
 less sustained than the previous year in 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.540
 because of the Russian embargo and a 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.110
 decrease in Chinese imports 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.840
 who find their level of 2013 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.640
 finally milk production increases 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.340
 again in the main basins 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.560
 exporters the collection of the union 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.780
 European market has been on the rise since 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.229
 April after a braking 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.960
 marked on the first quarter 2015 of 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.360
 some Member States to limit 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.850
 quota exceeded the penalties 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.399
 overall collection of the european union has 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.209
 again increased by 0.8 per cent 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.709
 April and 2 2% in May on 

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:40.910
 the entire first five months of 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:43.340
 the year 2015 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.860
 the collection of the whole union 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.050
 European economy is globally stable 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.069
 compared to the equivalent period of 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.860
 the previous year 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:54.200
 in France milk collection has declined 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.340
 2% over the first four months of 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.190
 the year 2015 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.819
 she then followed on the months of may 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.940
 and June 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.460
 the profile of the previous year before 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.200
 retreat 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.180
 again on the first two weeks 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.670
 of July because of a 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.230
 episode of strong heat according to the 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.780
 monthly dairy survey of 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.990
 franceagrim the price of cow's milk 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.090
 standard was 303 euros of the 1000 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.569
 liters in the month of May 2015 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.850
 it's been down sharply since the beginning 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.700
 fourth quarter of 2014 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:32.170
 after a moderate decline over the entire 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.459
 the year 2014 of the order of 3% monday they 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.590
 do not hang from the breeding institute 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.140
 which tracks the evolution of the costs of 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.930
 farm production show 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.870
 a slight uptrend since the 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.760
 beginning of the year 2015 for all 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.160
 dairy farm expenses 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.880
 which are represented in blue on the 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.880
 graphic 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.940
 this progression is particularly related to 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.900
 a turnaround on the job 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.120
 energy after a very sharp decline on 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.209
 the end of 2014 this post is from 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.160
 again rising very significantly 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.829
 since the beginning of 2015 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.079
 the situation is also difficult in 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.390
 downstream of the industry in the 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:16.230
 French detail as shown by the 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.140
 data from the INSEE prices 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.849
 in store have tended to 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.129
 decrease in the last few months 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.530
 especially for milk and milk cream 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.959
 cheese or ultra fresh products 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.180
 only butter has had a slight 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.000
 turnaround in June 2015 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.319
 after a period of regular 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.110
 drop for over a year 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.819
 by way of conclusion the situation is 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.049
 particularly complicated for 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.590
 dairy farmers in terms of 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.989
 Treasury 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.120
 they are both faced with a 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.610
 significant drop in the price of milk since 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.750
 several months and an increase in 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.900
 parallel of their charges 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.900
 operating
