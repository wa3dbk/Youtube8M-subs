using<00:01:38.780> 3000<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.409> gives<00:01:40.560> us<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> really<00:01:41.009> good

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
using 3000 is it gives us a really good

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.850 
using 3000 is it gives us a really good
look<00:01:41.579> right<00:01:42.030> between<00:01:42.270> 2000<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:42.990> 4000<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
look right between 2000 and 4000 and

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.130 
look right between 2000 and 4000 and
keeps<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.340> continuous<00:01:44.820> motion<00:01:45.060> for<00:01:45.450> us<00:01:45.600> so

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
keeps the continuous motion for us so

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.359 
keeps the continuous motion for us so
then<00:01:46.290> let<00:01:46.380> me<00:01:46.439> ask<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.710> question<00:01:46.740> Jason<00:01:47.130> if

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
then let me ask you a question Jason if

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.580 
then let me ask you a question Jason if
I'm<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> bowler<00:01:47.820> with<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> lower<00:01:48.659> rate<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.380> can

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
I'm a bowler with a lower rate I can

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.200 
I'm a bowler with a lower rate I can
adjust<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> surface<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.880> be<00:01:51.000> more

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
adjust the surface but to be more

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.910 
adjust the surface but to be more
aggressive<00:01:51.360> right<00:01:52.200> if<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.439> need<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.770> ball

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
aggressive right if you need that ball

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.170 
aggressive right if you need that ball
to<00:01:53.100> hook<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.340> little<00:01:53.460> bit<00:01:53.670> earlier<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.000> can<00:01:54.119> go

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
to hook a little bit earlier you can go

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.780 
to hook a little bit earlier you can go
to<00:01:54.270> 2,000<00:01:54.930> if<00:01:55.079> 3000<00:01:55.890> s<00:01:55.950> too<00:01:56.100> early<00:01:56.130> for<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.640> can

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
to 2,000 if 3000 s too early for you can

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.609 
to 2,000 if 3000 s too early for you can
always<00:01:57.000> go<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.149> 4000<00:01:57.960> well<00:01:58.290> that's<00:01:58.439> another

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
always go to 4000 well that's another

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.260 
always go to 4000 well that's another
good<00:01:58.829> feature<00:01:58.950> Ron<00:01:59.670> what<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.969> tell<00:02:00.149> us<00:02:00.240> about

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
good feature Ron what you tell us about

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.030 
good feature Ron what you tell us about
the<00:02:00.479> core<00:02:00.719> at<00:02:01.049> how<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.560> keeps<00:02:01.829> that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the core at how that keeps that

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.010 
the core at how that keeps that
continuous<00:02:02.579> wall<00:02:02.759> motion<00:02:02.939> absolutely<00:02:03.899> we

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
continuous wall motion absolutely we

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.139 
continuous wall motion absolutely we
actually<00:02:04.469> have<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.649> brand<00:02:05.340> new<00:02:05.490> core<00:02:05.790> shape

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
actually have a brand new core shape

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.300 
actually have a brand new core shape
called<00:02:06.930> edge<00:02:07.140> core<00:02:07.530> what's<00:02:08.190> interesting

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
called edge core what's interesting

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.800 
called edge core what's interesting
about<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.879> core<00:02:09.060> shape<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.479> started<00:02:09.780> out

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
about the core shape is it started out

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.420 
about the core shape is it started out
as<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.020> very<00:02:10.289> symmetrical<00:02:10.920> shape<00:02:11.190> when<00:02:11.400> I

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
as a very symmetrical shape when I

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.530 
as a very symmetrical shape when I
designed<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.910> and

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
designed it and

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.929 
designed it and
we<00:02:12.599> actually<00:02:12.959> cut<00:02:13.170> edges<00:02:13.739> off<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.579> to

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
we actually cut edges off of it to

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:16.280 
we actually cut edges off of it to
increase<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.420> mass<00:02:15.569> by<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.049> level<00:02:16.260> that

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
increase the mass by to the level that

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.440 
increase the mass by to the level that
we<00:02:16.409> were<00:02:16.439> looking<00:02:16.799> for<00:02:16.859> what<00:02:17.849> this<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.090> want<00:02:18.209> us

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
we were looking for what this I want us

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.740 
we were looking for what this I want us
to<00:02:18.569> do<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.930> get<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.200> RG<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.650> 2.53<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:21.480> mass

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
to do is get the RG to 2.53 the mass

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.410 
to do is get the RG to 2.53 the mass
bias<00:02:22.109> is<00:02:22.409> actually<00:02:23.280> 19<00:02:23.519> in<00:02:23.939> this<00:02:24.000> ball<00:02:24.239> which

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
bias is actually 19 in this ball which

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.119 
bias is actually 19 in this ball which
is<00:02:24.599> a<00:02:24.629> little<00:02:24.900> bit<00:02:25.230> higher<00:02:25.439> than<00:02:25.469> some<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.040> them

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
is a little bit higher than some of them

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.199 
is a little bit higher than some of them
but<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.310> little<00:02:26.489> bit<00:02:26.579> lower<00:02:26.700> than<00:02:26.819> other<00:02:26.909> ones

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
but a little bit lower than other ones

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.080 
but a little bit lower than other ones
and<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.900> differential<00:02:28.379> is<00:02:28.500> 0<00:02:28.709> 49<00:02:29.220> what<00:02:29.970> you're

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
and the differential is 0 49 what you're

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.000 
and the differential is 0 49 what you're
going<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.269> find<00:02:30.329> out<00:02:30.689> is<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.109> that<00:02:31.319> those

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
going to find out is is that those

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.890 
going to find out is is that those
combinations<00:02:32.459> with<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:33.209> new<00:02:33.390> cover<00:02:33.629> stock

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
combinations with this new cover stock

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.690 
combinations with this new cover stock
gave<00:02:34.200> us<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.409> ball<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.859> big<00:02:35.069> was<00:02:35.189> looking<00:02:35.459> for

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
gave us a ball that big was looking for

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.339 
gave us a ball that big was looking for
something<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.269> very<00:02:36.299> continuous<00:02:37.170> all

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
something that is very continuous all

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.410 
something that is very continuous all
the<00:02:37.590> way<00:02:37.680> through<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.010> pens<00:02:38.250> in<00:02:38.939> our<00:02:39.090> testing

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
the way through the pens in our testing

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.330 
the way through the pens in our testing
process<00:02:39.900> we<00:02:40.049> actually<00:02:40.379> went<00:02:40.500> through<00:02:40.650> 48

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
process we actually went through 48

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.009 
process we actually went through 48
different<00:02:41.700> combinations<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.629> come<00:02:42.750> up<00:02:42.870> with

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
different combinations to come up with

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.750 
different combinations to come up with
this<00:02:43.109> wall<00:02:43.349> that's<00:02:43.560> not<00:02:43.980> normal<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.430> know

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
this wall that's not normal is it know

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.129 
this wall that's not normal is it know
about<00:02:45.000> I'll<00:02:45.150> normally<00:02:45.480> we<00:02:45.569> do<00:02:45.659> about<00:02:45.840> between

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
about I'll normally we do about between

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.649 
about I'll normally we do about between
six<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.560> eight<00:02:46.680> combinations<00:02:47.450> very<00:02:48.450> good

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659
