and<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:51.000> texting<00:01:52.280> so<00:01:53.280> that's<00:01:53.490> that's<00:01:53.850> not<00:01:54.450> so

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
and and texting so that's that's not so

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.080 
and and texting so that's that's not so
good<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:56.390> but<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:57.979> generally<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.189> when<00:01:59.969> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
good and but but generally that when you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.819 
good and but but generally that when you
when<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.869> music<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.259> we<00:02:01.380> play<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.710> what

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
when I the music that we play and what

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.880 
when I the music that we play and what
we<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.340> doesn't<00:02:02.930> doesn't<00:02:03.930> use<00:02:04.079> technology

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
we do it doesn't doesn't use technology

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.560 
we do it doesn't doesn't use technology
so<00:02:05.040> much<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.369> think<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:05.700> that's<00:02:05.969> well<00:02:06.240> it

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
so much I think it's that's well it

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.760 
so much I think it's that's well it
should<00:02:06.750> be<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> place<00:02:07.079> where<00:02:07.110> people<00:02:07.320> can<00:02:07.590> put

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
should be a place where people can put

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.150 
should be a place where people can put
that<00:02:07.890> away

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
that away

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.880 
that away

I'm still too afraid of it crashing in
the<00:02:34.660> middle<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:35.080> concert<00:02:35.739> but<00:02:35.860> the

technology that I'm would like to see in
the<00:02:38.950> future<00:02:39.160> which<00:02:39.310> is<00:02:39.430> not<00:02:39.579> here<00:02:39.879> really<00:02:40.360> yet

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
the future which is not here really yet

on and that I could see the music in

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.890 
on and that I could see the music in
front<00:02:47.829> of<00:02:47.920> me<00:02:48.040> at<00:02:48.370> a<00:02:48.430> in<00:02:48.879> a<00:02:49.000> very<00:02:49.239> clear<00:02:49.660> and

front of me at a in a very clear and

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.150 
front of me at a in a very clear and
perfect<00:02:50.379> way<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.709> audience<00:02:50.799> wouldn't

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
perfect way that the audience wouldn't

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.670 
perfect way that the audience wouldn't
even<00:02:51.280> know<00:02:51.489> I'm<00:02:51.609> using<00:02:51.819> music<00:02:52.269> and<00:02:52.500> for<00:02:53.500> very

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
very complex modern scores that I

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.650 
very complex modern scores that I
wouldn't<00:02:56.799> dare<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.190> memorize<00:02:57.609> I<00:02:57.879> could<00:02:58.510> wear

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
wouldn't dare to memorize I could wear

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.750 
wouldn't dare to memorize I could wear
these<00:02:58.780> glasses<00:02:59.019> and<00:02:59.319> see<00:02:59.859> see<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.280> music<00:03:00.579> and

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
these glasses and see see the music and

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.150 
these glasses and see see the music and
change<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.420> don't<00:03:02.140> know<00:03:02.200> how<00:03:02.319> the<00:03:02.379> petals<00:03:02.980> or

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
change I don't know how the petals or

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.530 
change I don't know how the petals or
this<00:03:03.549> got<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:03.819> to<00:03:03.879> be<00:03:04.000> some<00:03:04.180> good<00:03:04.359> way<00:03:04.480> to

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
this got it to be some good way to

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.509 
this got it to be some good way to
change<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:05.109> turn<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.440> pages<00:03:05.650> but<00:03:06.370> that

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
change to turn the pages but that

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.710 
change to turn the pages but that
technology<00:03:06.910> is<00:03:06.970> I'm<00:03:07.180> sure<00:03:07.390> it's<00:03:07.510> going<00:03:07.629> to

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
technology is I'm sure it's going to

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.130 
technology is I'm sure it's going to
come<00:03:07.870> some<00:03:08.109> time<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:09.690> can't<00:03:10.690> wait<00:03:10.780> for<00:03:10.870> that

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
come some time and I can't wait for that

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.319 
come some time and I can't wait for that
to<00:03:11.290> happen
