00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.480
 And then, youtube, beauty, I know. 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.400
 crack on its itec technology channel and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.150
 Let's talk about photography today. 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.770
 little boy 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.480
 some people asked to bring this 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.820
 here by the channel I already had on 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.410
 truth interest in bringing the subject 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.390
 I really like photography. 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.939
 I'm not a photographer but have a machine 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.830
 Professional a good machine from Nikon 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.800
 that the 55 is an inlet line 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.300
 of the meeting but it is already a dslr and I know 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.680
 What are you thinking of getting started? 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.809
 take photo with what you just bought 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.090
 a machine has a new machine and is 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.680
 much doubt many things that arise 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.840
 in relation to photography so I want 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.250
 help you in this first step 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.600
 The first thing you have to take in 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.600
 mind if you are looking for a 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.430
 equipment is that the equipment can be 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.270
 good but not the equipment that goes 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.800
 take the picture 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.960
 a lot of people buy a bitch from a 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.180
 A good face, man with a face. 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.949
 good night and in no time for that 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.690
 exists because they had some photos 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.980
 and see that the focus is not coming out as 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.220
 Figured out 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.290
 she sees one is a photo in the magazine is a 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.790
 photo on TV talks will take our photo 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.900
 of her with the good machine is not so 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.760
 the farm works 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.549
 the photo it depends a lot on the knowledge 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.070
 that you have of obvious photography that the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.470
 equipment helps but she defends yes 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.000
 donko is very knowledgeable and 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.950
 creativity so the more 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.900
 knowledge you acquire how much more 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.729
 Do you study about photography more? 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.890
 control you will have on the machine 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.079
 the more you'll be able to hone your 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.659
 forms is a basic machine ie 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.829
 a good matter in relation to equipment 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.710
 that I should buy a machine 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.759
 semi professional 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.380
 first a professional recording 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.360
 be a machine like this here 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.790
 has several models which is a machine that 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.500
 it is not basic we already have a bigger one already 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.780
 has a slightly better sensor, ie 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.810
 She will take better pictures but she will not 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.250
 has all the power all the controls 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.130
 of a professional machine that is a 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.380
 dslr a machine of sr already a machine 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.020
 that the entry lines cost in the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.880
 range from 1,500 to 2,000 reais 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.890
 but these machines will offer you 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.479
 much better features 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.369
 the much greater control over the machine 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.410
 for you to take photos and evolve 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.300
 obviously according to their 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.940
 knowledge are growing then 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.980
 you want 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.570
 if you really want to invest in 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.940
 photography start taking photos 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.710
 better start studying photography 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.260
 I recommend that you buy a dslr from 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.090
 input may be a way of 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.310
 that end of sony has several brands 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.080
 so you can do it because you do not 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.240
 treats a lot when you have a machine 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.310
 which is more basic is from a certain 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.170
 moment she will not have more because she 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.430
 will leave much to be desired for a 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.500
 sr machine 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.420
 she has interchangeable lenses you 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.370
 she will be able to change the lens and she has everything 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.440
 manual control over the brand is not 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.930
 you will be able to control all 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.640
 her functions and then start to understand 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.230
 about the concepts of photography 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.420
 another question that also arises 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.300
 lens issue is how you can 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.520
 change the lenses of the dslr machines 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.950
 I already buy a lens in the beginning 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.990
 nano and disable my opinion is that 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.870
 you should buy machine already comes with a 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:08.050
 lens kit is usually a lens 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:11.710
 1855 tomato 1855 would be the scope of 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.440
 digan zoom lens and then you use the 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.000
 kit plus thats why not because 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.070
 you will learn the basics and 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.140
 will start to understand and believe so 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.970
 onwards 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.770
 explore this for you a lot 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.300
 see what type of lens you need 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.760
 Why do not you start sometimes? 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.380
 that we have such a lens but it is not 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.670
 well those people when you start to 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.130
 take photo 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.720
 you start to miss because it creates 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.360
 a lens to go further creates a 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.400
 lighter lens and such, and there you are 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.239
 then develop more and start 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.680
 understand better 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.600
 after a while you can set 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.800
 What kind of lens will you need? 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.959
 you hanging around 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.220
 your range of options I do not start 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.769
 I thought I wanted a lens 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.630
 computer a big zum-zum-zum 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.040
 I believe because I discovered I 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.140
 needed a clear lens in addition to 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.360
 fixed would be what is a law that does not 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.100
 you have zoom one night that opens 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.870
 it has a good opening that allows 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.090
 a lot of light to enter because because 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.450
 film because I need a lens that 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.519
 have a good light a good light input 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.530
 And while the number was for partying, I 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.450
 I like to take the camera to take a photo 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.680
 of the staff plus photos that depict shooting 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.600
 far far away photo 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.090
 so as you evolve you 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.400
 will see how changes right with your concept 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.960
 in the photo changes but you think certain 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.030
 one thing does not need another is 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.870
 cool, you wait a little bit then 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.820
 when you go 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.560
 our concept you without deciding which 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.570
 type of people will be better for you 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.940
 beginning when you start taking your 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.380
 photos of you will see that they will not 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.970
 leave as you probably expect 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.669
 because you're learning 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.100
 because it is a process of evolution 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.410
 photography is a concept in fact is 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.060
 a matter that is formed of several 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.320
 concepts you are going to have to obviously 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.760
 to hold these concepts 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.820
 there are several videos on youtube 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.310
 there are several articles for you to read and 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.530
 You're not going to learn from an hour ago. 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.830
 another this happened to me I read about 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.449
 a matter to him and in default of ii 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.880
 I was saying crap but with this doubt here 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:06.400
 So whoever wants to make you have to come 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.530
 from different sources is to learn by 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.510
 example what the opening what is it see 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.449
 a video on the internet an article from 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.650
 capital and uses on your machine is that of 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.060
 of digital machines 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.010
 This is what you can draw from 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.620
 photos and then it will be paid neither problem 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.229
 It's not a movie, then it goes there. 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.240
 in manual mode read the article see 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.949
 a video and use what you just 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.630
 bring you to really understand the 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.160
 concept for you what is that 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.200
 giving of difference in the machine 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.580
 This is the best way to learn and you 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.870
 will have to hit several and several times 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.240
 the information because from the moment 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.639
 with you begin to decorate and really 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.860
 understand what is happening in 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:44.349
 machine when you change the speed 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.360
 for example a trip that assembles the 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:48.580
 calories years decreases light increases 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.610
 when the sensitivity of the sector 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.260
 the impact of this state 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.030
 the best thing is practice with 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.250
 knowledge you're going to have to study 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:01.900
 no way is not a boring thing is 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:03.370
 a hot thing because you are you reads 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.960
 the concept and then you see the result 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.680
 right after that when you go out to 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.479
 practice 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.160
 It's no use waiting for me to give you a 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:10.030
 magic formula for taking pictures 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.099
 perfect 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.199
 then I want a setting so it looks 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:15.760
 Wow this photo is perfect is not it? 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:18.190
 This photo is perfect 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.130
 each light condition each condition of 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.610
 which requires a configuration then 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.660
 you 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.160
 from the moment you have the 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.530
 control over the machine you go 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.050
 To regulate this I say that things 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.210
 the wrong way of medical inspection and few 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.150
 This is going to be very difficult, it 's difficult. 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:37.300
 People are photography is practical and it is very 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.169
 tasty but not understand the practice 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.960
 basic concepts if you do not understand 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.979
 is what every function of the machine makes you 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.930
 unfortunately you will not be able to take 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:47.270
 very good photos and and has a machine 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.009
 professional to take a picture 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.740
 only in the automatic mode that the machine 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:54.680
 Regulates everything does not make sense Is not you 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:57.680
 will use 20% that the machine can offer 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.210
 I was basically married today. 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.580
 I'll make some videos later, talking. 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.469
 about photography concept take some 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.840
 photos shown the differences for you 

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:09.379
 understand how iso works better 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:12.889
 how to operate an opening what these
