angeles lakers now with kobe hurt they
could<00:04:56.340> have<00:04:56.370> embezzled<00:04:56.910> it<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.060> small

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
could have embezzled it the small

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.760 
could have embezzled it the small
forward<00:04:57.600> which<00:04:57.750> we<00:04:57.930> found<00:04:58.169> was<00:04:58.290> a<00:04:58.320> little<00:04:58.620> odd

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
forward which we found was a little odd

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.469 
forward which we found was a little odd
he's<00:04:59.040> really<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.280> two<00:04:59.520> in<00:04:59.640> our<00:04:59.760> mind<00:04:59.970> but

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
he's really a two in our mind but

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.750 
he's really a two in our mind but
regardless<00:05:00.630> until<00:05:01.530> kobe<00:05:01.860> comes<00:05:02.040> back<00:05:02.310> he's

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
regardless until kobe comes back he's

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.159 
regardless until kobe comes back he's
going<00:05:02.790> to<00:05:03.000> play<00:05:03.150> ton<00:05:03.510> of<00:05:03.600> minutes<00:05:03.870> nick<00:05:04.140> Young

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
going to play ton of minutes nick Young

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.230 
going to play ton of minutes nick Young
is<00:05:04.530> not<00:05:04.740> bashful<00:05:05.190> about<00:05:05.430> shooting<00:05:06.030> the<00:05:06.090> ball

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
is not bashful about shooting the ball

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.380 
is not bashful about shooting the ball
so<00:05:06.810> it<00:05:06.840> should<00:05:07.110> be<00:05:07.140> 0<00:05:07.530> at<00:05:07.979> all<00:05:08.250> so<00:05:08.880> he<00:05:09.150> should<00:05:09.300> be

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
so it should be 0 at all so he should be

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.850 
so it should be 0 at all so he should be
