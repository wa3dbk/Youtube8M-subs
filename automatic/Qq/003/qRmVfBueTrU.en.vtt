00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
touch to view usage and settings so you

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.680 
touch to view usage and settings so you
could<00:02:17.250> previously<00:02:17.580> touch<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.420> view<00:02:18.600> the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
could previously touch it to view the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.990 
could previously touch it to view the
settings<00:02:19.110> but<00:02:19.380> not<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.220> bit<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.520> way<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.730> get

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
settings but not so I bit a way to get

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.120 
settings but not so I bit a way to get
rid<00:02:21.210> of<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.020> bit<00:02:22.230> annoying<00:02:22.350> but<00:02:22.860> now

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
rid of it it is a bit annoying but now

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.620 
rid of it it is a bit annoying but now
they<00:02:23.340> fix<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.270> wipe<00:02:24.450> away

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
they fix that so you can just wipe away

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.650 
they fix that so you can just wipe away
and<00:02:24.900> get<00:02:25.020> rid<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.410> now<00:02:26.070> that's<00:02:26.940> one<00:02:27.420> of

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
and get rid of that now that's one of

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.060 
and get rid of that now that's one of
the<00:02:27.870> new<00:02:28.020> features<00:02:28.050> now<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.740> can<00:02:28.920> also

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
the new features now you can also

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.780 
the new features now you can also
disable<00:02:29.390> background<00:02:30.390> data<00:02:31.100> uncertain<00:02:32.100> Wi-Fi

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
disable background data uncertain Wi-Fi

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.460 
disable background data uncertain Wi-Fi
SS<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:34.010> ID's<00:02:35.010> now<00:02:35.640> SSID<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.810> basically<00:02:37.440> just

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
SS and ID's now SSID is basically just

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.540 
SS and ID's now SSID is basically just
the<00:02:37.980> name<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.760> your<00:02:39.570> Wi-Fi<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:41.040> stands<00:02:41.280> for

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
the name of your Wi-Fi so it stands for

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.750 
the name of your Wi-Fi so it stands for
service<00:02:41.910> set<00:02:42.180> identifier<00:02:42.920> but<00:02:43.920> more<00:02:44.520> commonly

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
service set identifier but more commonly

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.270 
service set identifier but more commonly
it's<00:02:45.270> just<00:02:45.600> known<00:02:45.810> as<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.320> name<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.770> Wi-Fi

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
it's just known as the name of the Wi-Fi

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.930 
it's just known as the name of the Wi-Fi
so<00:02:48.290> basically<00:02:49.290> what<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.590> can<00:02:49.740> do<00:02:49.860> now<00:02:50.070> is<00:02:50.340> you

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
so basically what you can do now is you

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.300 
so basically what you can do now is you
can<00:02:51.240> disable<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.080> background<00:02:52.410> data<00:02:52.590> on<00:02:52.950> any

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
can disable the background data on any

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.180 
can disable the background data on any
Wi-Fi<00:02:54.210> SSID<00:02:54.600> that<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:55.230> are<00:02:55.380> connected<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:55.830> and

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
Wi-Fi SSID that you are connected to and

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
Wi-Fi SSID that you are connected to and
by<00:02:56.850> designating<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.990> as<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.920> mobile<00:02:59.520> hotspot

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
by designating it as a mobile hotspot

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.210 
by designating it as a mobile hotspot
now<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.780> way<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:00.960> do<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.380> is<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:01.590> go<00:03:01.920> into

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
now the way you do this is you go into

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.900 
now the way you do this is you go into
Wi-Fi<00:03:02.880> so<00:03:03.810> you've<00:03:04.110> got<00:03:04.140> all<00:03:04.590> your<00:03:04.760> data<00:03:05.760> that

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
Wi-Fi so you've got all your data that

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.480 
Wi-Fi so you've got all your data that
you<00:03:06.270> used<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.900> that's<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> data<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:08.220> go<00:03:08.370> on

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
you used and that's the data you go on

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.160 
you used and that's the data you go on
to<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.700> menu<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.240> then<00:03:09.750> you're<00:03:09.930> going<00:03:10.080> to

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
to the menu and then you're going to

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.770 
to the menu and then you're going to
mobile<00:03:10.770> hotspots<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.640> then<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:12.360> shows<00:03:12.570> you

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
mobile hotspots and then it shows you

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.980 
mobile hotspots and then it shows you
the<00:03:12.900> list<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.580> Wi-Fi<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.940> networks<00:03:15.750> are

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
the list of Wi-Fi and networks are

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.340 
the list of Wi-Fi and networks are
available<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.770> you<00:03:17.250> can<00:03:17.280> designate<00:03:18.350> anyone

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
available and you can designate anyone

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.260 
available and you can designate anyone
accordingly<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.160> then<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.580> won't<00:03:20.730> run<00:03:21.060> any

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
accordingly and then it won't run any

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.060 
accordingly and then it won't run any
background<00:03:21.480> processes<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:22.620> basically

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
background processes that basically

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.330 
background processes that basically
means<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:24.240> won't<00:03:24.390> be<00:03:24.870> losing<00:03:25.320> out<00:03:25.680> you

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
means that you won't be losing out you

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.560 
means that you won't be losing out you
might<00:03:26.459> be<00:03:26.640> using<00:03:26.820> someone<00:03:27.209> else's<00:03:27.480> data<00:03:27.750> and

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
might be using someone else's data and

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.940 
might be using someone else's data and
to<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.690> point<00:03:30.900> where<00:03:31.110> obviously<00:03:31.230> they've

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
to the point where obviously they've

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.520 
to the point where obviously they've
they've<00:03:32.459> lost<00:03:32.730> out<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.870> other<00:03:33.990> thing<00:03:34.260> that

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
they've lost out the other thing that

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.330 
they've lost out the other thing that
they've<00:03:35.040> updated<00:03:35.310> is<00:03:36.140> now<00:03:37.140> Android<00:03:38.100> can

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
they've updated is now Android can

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.630 
they've updated is now Android can
automatically<00:03:39.060> detect<00:03:39.390> when<00:03:40.020> another<00:03:40.650> jelly

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
automatically detect when another jelly

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.400 
automatically detect when another jelly
bean<00:03:41.910> device<00:03:42.300> now<00:03:42.510> that's<00:03:42.690> very<00:03:42.870> important<00:03:43.350> a

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
bean device now that's very important a

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.530 
bean device now that's very important a
jelly<00:03:43.740> bean<00:03:43.950> device<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:44.580> it<00:03:44.790> doesn't<00:03:45.360> work

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
jelly bean device so it doesn't work

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.670 
jelly bean device so it doesn't work
with<00:03:45.810> any<00:03:45.930> ice<00:03:46.650> cream<00:03:46.920> some<00:03:47.390> devices<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.690> are

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
with any ice cream some devices that are

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.570 
with any ice cream some devices that are
tethered<00:03:50.120> but<00:03:51.200> it<00:03:52.200> works<00:03:52.500> with<00:03:52.800> all<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.220> jelly

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
tethered but it works with all the jelly

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.640 
tethered but it works with all the jelly
bean<00:03:53.820> device<00:03:54.090> now<00:03:54.420> what<00:03:54.630> happens<00:03:55.050> is<00:03:55.230> if<00:03:55.470> they

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
bean device now what happens is if they

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.790 
bean device now what happens is if they
intelligently<00:03:56.630> look<00:03:57.630> at<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.140> other<00:03:58.500> device

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
intelligently look at the other device

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.640 
intelligently look at the other device
and<00:03:59.100> say<00:03:59.280> well<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.330> device<00:04:00.930> itself<00:04:01.350> is

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
and say well this device itself is

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.300 
and say well this device itself is
tethered<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.459> another<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.650> another<00:04:04.650> device

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
tethered to another and another device

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.430 
tethered to another and another device
so<00:04:05.520> what<00:04:05.670> I'm<00:04:05.730> going<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:05.880> do<00:04:06.090> is<00:04:06.420> I'm<00:04:06.840> not<00:04:07.230> going

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
so what I'm going to do is I'm not going

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.170 
so what I'm going to do is I'm not going
to<00:04:07.500> use<00:04:07.709> any<00:04:07.920> background<00:04:08.190> processes<00:04:08.850> so<00:04:09.000> for

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
to use any background processes so for

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.500 
to use any background processes so for
example<00:04:09.270> if<00:04:09.630> I<00:04:09.750> had<00:04:09.900> another<00:04:10.400> ms3<00:04:11.400> here<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:11.970> I

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
example if I had another ms3 here and I

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.990 
example if I had another ms3 here and I
tended<00:04:13.020> this<00:04:13.440> s3<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.220> that<00:04:14.430> ones<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:14.910> you

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
tended this s3 to that ones that you

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.840 
tended this s3 to that ones that you
could<00:04:15.150> use<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.510> one's<00:04:15.750> internet<00:04:16.230> the<00:04:16.980> the

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
could use that one's internet the the

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.849 
could use that one's internet the the
data<00:04:18.060> usage<00:04:18.600> application<00:04:19.200> itself<00:04:19.500> would

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
data usage application itself would

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.870 
data usage application itself would
recognize<00:04:20.520> that<00:04:20.760> this<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.390> device<00:04:22.350> and<00:04:22.880> well

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
recognize that this and device and well

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.620 
recognize that this and device and well
it<00:04:24.840> is<00:04:25.260> tethered<00:04:25.979> to<00:04:26.310> another<00:04:26.669> device

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
it is tethered to another device

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.780 
it is tethered to another device
and<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.470> won't<00:04:28.650> use<00:04:28.920> any<00:04:29.130> of<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.400> background

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
and it won't use any of the background

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.940 
and it won't use any of the background
processes<00:04:30.300> meaning<00:04:30.690> that<00:04:30.840> you'll<00:04:31.320> save<00:04:31.620> this

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
processes meaning that you'll save this

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.730 
processes meaning that you'll save this
person's<00:04:32.430> data<00:04:32.670> you<00:04:33.030> will<00:04:33.180> obviously<00:04:33.510> and<00:04:33.900> use

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
person's data you will obviously and use

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.530 
person's data you will obviously and use
it<00:04:34.950> when<00:04:35.160> you<00:04:35.370> don't<00:04:35.610> want<00:04:35.790> to<00:04:36.030> if<00:04:36.180> this

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
it when you don't want to if this

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.360 
it when you don't want to if this
feature<00:04:36.840> wasn't<00:04:37.260> available<00:04:37.530> than<00:04:38.010> what<00:04:38.250> you

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
feature wasn't available than what you

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.580 
feature wasn't available than what you
would<00:04:38.460> need<00:04:38.700> to<00:04:38.760> do<00:04:39.030> is<00:04:39.600> going<00:04:40.260> to<00:04:40.380> each

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
would need to do is going to each

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.440 
would need to do is going to each
application<00:04:41.070> that<00:04:41.400> runs<00:04:41.640> background<00:04:42.240> data

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
application that runs background data

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.040 
application that runs background data
and<00:04:42.810> then<00:04:43.500> you<00:04:44.100> would<00:04:44.220> need<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:45.050> basically

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
and then you would need to basically

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.610 
and then you would need to basically
turn<00:04:46.470> that<00:04:46.650> off<00:04:46.860> or<00:04:47.160> you<00:04:48.120> could<00:04:48.660> go<00:04:48.990> on<00:04:49.230> to<00:04:49.500> the

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
turn that off or you could go on to the

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.030 
turn that off or you could go on to the
menu<00:04:49.980> and<00:04:50.510> select<00:04:51.510> the<00:04:51.600> restrict<00:04:52.170> background

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
menu and select the restrict background

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.740 
menu and select the restrict background
data<00:04:53.250> but<00:04:53.550> that<00:04:53.670> would<00:04:53.820> mean<00:04:54.000> that<00:04:54.060> with<00:04:54.720> every

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
data but that would mean that with every

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.350 
data but that would mean that with every
device<00:04:55.560> it<00:04:55.890> would<00:04:56.130> restrict<00:04:56.700> it<00:04:56.940> so<00:04:57.120> if<00:04:57.210> you've

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
device it would restrict it so if you've

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.940 
device it would restrict it so if you've
got<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.570> certain<00:04:58.020> device<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.530> you<00:04:58.620> don't<00:04:58.830> want

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
got a certain device that you don't want

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.590 
got a certain device that you don't want
to<00:04:59.010> use<00:04:59.160> it<00:04:59.190> with<00:04:59.460> where<00:04:59.910> the<00:05:00.030> easier<00:05:00.270> own<00:05:00.450> or

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
to use it with where the easier own or

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.480 
to use it with where the easier own or
someone<00:05:00.720> else's<00:05:00.990> then<00:05:01.680> that<00:05:01.890> option<00:05:02.280> is

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
someone else's then that option is

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.260 
someone else's then that option is
available<00:05:02.640> so<00:05:03.240> that<00:05:03.270> is<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:04.440> update<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.370> 4.1

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
available so that is the update to 4.1

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.380 
available so that is the update to 4.1
and<00:05:06.650> data<00:05:07.650> usage<00:05:08.360> on<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.420> galaxy<00:05:10.290> s3<00:05:10.830> so<00:05:11.490> um<00:05:11.790> do

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
and data usage on the galaxy s3 so um do

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.360 
and data usage on the galaxy s3 so um do
you<00:05:12.420> have<00:05:12.510> a<00:05:12.660> look<00:05:12.900> at<00:05:12.990> that<00:05:13.110> and<00:05:13.290> don't<00:05:14.280> forget
