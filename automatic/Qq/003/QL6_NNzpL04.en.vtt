00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.010
 welcome this video concerns the project 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.590
 engine theory 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.960
 channel operation generally means communication with 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.199
 the recent end of the project secrets 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.340
 bavarian legends and i theme naturally 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.310
 developing that is i still have 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.990
 developments on engines but here here 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.420
 what an interesting question sometimes fell to me 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.519
 people write that is and is found in 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.920
 comments that open for example there 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.929
 wallet is a collection of money there to collect 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.329
 some money buy an engine on 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.180
 A review in principle, money is certainly good 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.190
 they will never be superfluous but practice 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.030
 shows that her way at times 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.420
 more efficient and better than just collecting 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.579
 money the thing is i have been past 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.829
 half a year i visited saint petersburg 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.770
 several times I was recently in Minsk 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.059
 I want to say that I have appeared 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.980
 many new friends like 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.730
 St. Petersburg and in Minsk possible 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.070
 I also have to visit Moscow means 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.880
 what I want to say is mine 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.090
 Subscribers here the viewers have different 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.770
 I figuratively connect this engine 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.170
 scrap that is different non-working 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.330
 engines that are at the garage for 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.640
 for some reason, that is, a check was 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.770
 car he changed the engine there 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.610
 the car then sold the old one 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.799
 the engine remained and now there is 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.130
 for example in the city of St. Petersburg Kirill 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.900
 presov my friend lives he already has him 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.770
 here and so took the engine in storage 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.280
 one person engine with nissan 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.390
 rb20det here actually photos it is 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.920
 I have to be when 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.259
 St. Petersburg must necessarily be 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.399
 video on this engine is exactly the same in 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.560
 city in Minsk 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.210
 I'm already waiting for it to be true 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.820
 car engine alfa romeo 8 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.210
 valves two camshafts 18 2 candles on 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.710
 cylinder that is an interesting technique 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.050
 so the essence of the appeal is the mayor 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.470
 is as follows that is 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.520
 There are many people willing to help the project. 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.310
 engine theory 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.740
 which is motor but principle 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.740
 something rushed to me like a breakdown or 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.830
 from Belarus to Kiev principle 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.600
 problematic from abroad that is 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.070
 different customs fees then this is 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.400
 did you get more expensive than just 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.700
 go buy it so i'm applying 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.130
 to all who wish has the opportunity 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.880
 have a desire to help the project in that 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.640
 if you have such an engine to any 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:39.450
 scrap from like everything you need 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.240
 make it forward shipment well 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.800
 for example of course i don't know how to blast or 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.350
 Belarus but we have for example in Ukraine 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.670
 very advanced transportation there is new mail 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.450
 and in-time that is literally today 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.970
 went carried tomorrow got here for example 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.220
 prf there are business lines called that 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.800
 There is all, that need to do this a bit 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.160
 all the care is in 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.540
 tom it to take this engine 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.430
 take for transportation and send 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.700
 let's go to St. Petersburg to my friend 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:12.000
 Cyril plus in or if in Belarus 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.220
 this rule in the city of Minsk that is my 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.900
 they agreed to friends they asked 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.140
 I say this and so that the engine you 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.940
 send when I have to keep 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.100
 I will be next time let Minsk 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.500
 let's make a video of all the guys without problems 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.790
 please, there is a place 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.560
 so please send here 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.140
 the way 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.900
 project assistance and collaboration 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.209
 much better than just collecting 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.670
 some cash if you have 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.280
 there is such an engine you can it 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.650
 write to science 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.560
 email that is, the husband will agree that is 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.020
 where to send if you have 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.760
 there is an engine but no transport 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.370
 means at the moment there is a car 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.440
 not to pull something out translate 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.470
 then do i think all this can be solved 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.360
 I think there are people in the city 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.310
 there are my followers without much 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.709
 modesty say that let's say there is 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.330
 the desire to help there is a car 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.670
 to translate the engine but not the very 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.740
 engine up the way so i appeal to 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.120
 all your viewers subscribers just 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.790
 who watches the channel and 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.829
 who has the desire and opportunity the most 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.660
 The main thing to help some scrap metal 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:23.370
 interesting be this engine assy 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.729
 be it some kind of head in anything in 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.130
 particulars there let's say Japanese 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:31.350
 please email me with 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.600
 dock can be sent to my friends and 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.389
 next time when I have to be either 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.400
 St. Petersburg or in Minsk I will do 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.800
 about this video for example, here's what 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.260
 As for St. Petersburg, here is Cyril 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.169
 Plyasova still have the engine from the bottom 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.810
 bottom valve and from the old Muscovite 401 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.720
 but he wants to not just make out there 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.660
 he compare with the subsequent s-400 seventh 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.669
 Muscovite engine but still in his 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.060
 plans that is possible to do 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:03.560
 him to go all this to put 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:07.229
 on the course also that if it works out so 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.810
 there will be audience activity that is 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.870
 all of you will be big and Kirill will gather 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.210
 I still have five engines there or 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.970
 six some interesting it will be 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.800
 on the contrary, I have an extra incentive to visit 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.690
 St. Petersburg, that is, unplanned if 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.330
 there let's say planned there in the fall 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.940
 let's visit there or winter is me 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.490
 let's say there is if the engine is taken and 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.710
 there will be material to take off i naturally 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.539
 I will visit guerrilla before too 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.490
 the most concerns and the city of Minsk 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.620
 the only difficulty is 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.510
 the game is exactly the whole process 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.510
 transport that is pull it out there 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.160
 with a garage to pack take and so on 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.349
 that is, it's really hard but 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.690
 it's worth it so I ask everyone 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:50.699
 viewers followers don't stay 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.220
 in the country if you have something like this 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:56.310
 you can give it to rock and roll foundation 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.289
 please let me be sure 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.430
 there should be a video on this topic on this 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:01.430
 thank you all for your attention
