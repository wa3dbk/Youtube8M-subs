00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 think at the same time because I and fanni rod 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:06.359
 tonight when he finishes with zero point 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.160
 I find it a shame there is something 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.660
 of truth in what you say is that he 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.250
 was there sometimes it happens to us and me to 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.080
 each each time really really has 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.370
 I blame myself many times I blame myself 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.980
 sometimes I'm too much like yesterday 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.320
 evening with the poor little Parisian who has 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.359
 played the right there yeah finally that 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.840
 today at times I think back 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.310
 still 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.619
 do I say the day before and I'm 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.300
 put too hard what rhymes and they 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.949
 do not deserve him is his age and the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.660
 memory of the effort but no but you have 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.859
 and his first intense set enough 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.730
 interestingly enough that sometimes in the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.920
 March 10th 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.210
 sometimes I'm too mean with his 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.770
 cheeky age tells me the dude the guy he is 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.360
 central defender like every year you 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.950
 again be wicked start what 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.230
 the story but no but no but no 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.030
 but we put him right back his buddies 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.469
 he has nothing to do on the ground he 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.030
 this morning friends in france have made 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.980
 these stuff times and it's like 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.879
 abdallah the poor but me it annoys me 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.360
 to dallas but here he is at the om and 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.039
 ol 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.570
 finally it means something in 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.309
 my football fantasy 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.830
 the guy he's right back of the om 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.750
 it's like morel or mendeala 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.630
 two for it to be 0 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.460
 left-back ccfa there it's this kind of 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.600
 stuff sometimes it's like even and its 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.799
 share however I had already said 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.240
 many times gilbert on it and you 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.680
 hopefully, but 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.030
 many times it's the same way I 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.830
 do not want me to be stern with gignac 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.799
 because finally the critics to his 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.659
 this is due to the investment that has 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.770
 been done on him but the investment 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.090
 who is made about him it's not him who 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.759
 is responsible it's the leaders who 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.110
 are void 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.460
 that's when the poor he knows how to do 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.110
 that the same thing there always from 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.670
 on the current side current running 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.020
 a little bit on the side like a crab 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.490
 tried to do my project outside 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.079
 the crowd always the same thing but he 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.460
 there is nothing for it there is an expectation 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.710
 disproportionate placed in him 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.000
 and after that accentuates our criticisms and 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.170
 month after it's true that sometimes I 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.970
 I do not like it, I'm mad at it, it's true 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.899
 sometimes and it's not me but the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.130
 fans should not blame them 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.570
 to me he will have to blame them for their 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.710
 leaders who handles this no matter how 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.729
 he's actually actually in 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.350
 the exclusivity I have the name of the Nazi it's 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.520
 sir remember whose coca not looking 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.860
 it is there a little goats a little too much 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:15.750
 prepared table 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:16.860
 a little crazy has matured well 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.540
 evaluation for me I was talking about 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.500
 Mandanda diawara and on the other hand the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.050
 roofs tonight or not tonight for me 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.960
 Am I played a lot without pressure 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.040
 pre-match yeah no but otherwise because 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.880
 that we have gained a lot by raising what we 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.980
 the bouley series of dives thinks 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.590
 what me but from there to the plunge he 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.200
 do it's not so much the dive 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.490
 this is what is in this case because of 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.709
 he's touched by the guy but it's 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.560
 the kind of dodo and circus behind 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.880
 so that's like he had like 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.300
 if he took a burst of Kalashnikov 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.310
 in the back to his singles to way but 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.400
 that's ali why else he does that and 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.250
 just before they attack me for phew 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.790
 talk about the match of the om mix behind 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.270
 daniel way in the preparation of these 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.480
 matches with including if you want 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:12.980
 the arrival or the return of jose you have 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.780
 the very example on the payet case of 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.549
 the badly measured aggressiveness tonight 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.980
 the glitter intent is to 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.040
 show precisely who cling he 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.290
 is combative in the mac to and and he is 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.290
 that's bad it's badly dosed and took 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.140
 kidding but even if payet kidding me 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.970
 what I find that it will be necessary to look 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.310
 but quickly recalls in the interest 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.620
 football and is in the interest of our 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.770
 referees who seem to be them 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.800
 also an end of the first part 2 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.820
 of our season a little bit tired in 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.630
 Regarding the lara the speed 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.950
 of expulsion gaouaoui 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.620
 we will have to help them with a 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.430
 temporary eviction for a little bit 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.350
 be an intermediate sanction between the 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.150
 yellow card and red card have 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.780
 not so much tossing tonight I got 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.960
 bored with two goals since the expulsion 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.520
 we kill the match there he respects the 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.570
 settlement give your dough my point of 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.220
 view my point of view on a rolling at 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.630
 time you know I hate talking about 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.110
 arbitration decisions I do not do it 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.280
 after talking about a rule that I find 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.880
 a bit silly especially when she is 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.530
 reformed recently as the story of the 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.790
 double punishment or even if it is 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.130
 justify when you read you say well 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.900
 often neither is it the rules but you 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.020
 see we can actually discuss 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.660
 of a rule well not well this one I 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.310
 agree with you the case the letter 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.110
 and in the koala mind the cardboard that 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.790
 fate for a simulation while they do not 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.110
 still touch a little but payet 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.480
 is still grotesque in doing that 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.580
 yes it's severe but as I discuss 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.920
 not the decision good bah accepts 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.660
 accepting it now there is another 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.550
 element is that we criticize the rule 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.080
 but we must not forget that a player 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.730
 any sportsman in any 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.350
 what sport any individual in 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.690
 a society he is aware of the 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.730
 rule he knows that she exists and as you 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.890
 know it exists and you know that 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.960
 it can fall on your face this 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.120
 settlement a little treacherous and ben you 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.950
 not do that if you're smart you 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.460
 not come back and in addition win the tackle 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.020
 de devil you're doing a dive of 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.540
 Kanangila already I do not agree on 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.060
 the 2nd daniel or so their degree 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.860
 holland now we have them 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.740
 applause to add 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.620
 it is my mother who does not add but the 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.020
 contact with with tagged tackle 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.180
 of this defender of dortmund 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.640
 he is as stupid as the plunge of 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.050
 glitter ya draw on the stuff 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.060
 because he if he is not aware 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.720
 that taclant it did not touch the bowl without 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.970
 touch the ball 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.320
 there may be a penalty it's a 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.880
 debit did he also made this plan was 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.230
 added to all of his work 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.360
 kick in the small angles 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.490
 that a self-poll corner also 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.390
 could have done without 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:56.510
 you see the paintings to give him a 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:58.920
 cardboard violated it's grotesque 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:02.030
 that's what I'm saying to you and in mind 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.030
 narrowed clings
