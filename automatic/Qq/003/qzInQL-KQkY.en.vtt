 battles of battles but by turns and 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.980
 we can go that doing what they are 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.769
 movements or attacks towards our 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.479
 enemies at first we can see the 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.180
 map and all the levels of what 

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.769
 There will be a small story and each 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.010
 Once we are passing some levels 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:56.280
 we can get to parts like this or like 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.339
 this one where they will give us some 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.690
 minerals or materials to create weapons 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:06.509
 new weapons we can create weapons in here 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.580
 We will not go down and we like our to 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.460
 our character settings 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.679
 where we can buy things we can see 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.270
 the ability of our characters and what 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:17.520
 who say that in this case you saw the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.920
 helmet we can change the helmet the sword 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.350
 or any other attachment that you have 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.149
 our character we can go to the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.189
 potions to create new mergers for 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.570
 recover our health to give more 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.330
 experience to the terminal 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.670
 etcetera and we can go to arms for 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.640
 create new weapons with such materials 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.979
 they can be attack or defense and here they are 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.590
 the materials that we can use to 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.350
 to be able to create such weapons the game is very 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.840
 simple very simple let's go to a 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.680
 new adventure here we will be given the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.380
 difficulty of then this level and what 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.720
 we can win after defeating or winning this 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.400
 level that is like a roulette every time 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.200
 that we win if you get three 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.990
 stars we can get three things 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.450
 of roulette if you get two two and 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.180
 so on for example here we go 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.209
 to see that we have a pig or assailant 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.910
 I do not know and we can take turns 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.350
 press the monkey to see the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.030
 skills you have right now with the 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.950
 that says it says energy leaks 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.260
 probability of the plank that are the 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.910
 attacks that our character has the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.800
 culminating speed that are skills 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.780
 maybe helmets or the 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.610
 additions that we are putting and 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.280
 after several attacks 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.080
 there will be loaded this small 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.820
 chile that is down here and will give us 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.840
 as a special power that in this case 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.510
 throw 5 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.450
 of birds chosen at random from our 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.030
 team that in this case then obviously 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.540
 nothing else we have two and here he tells us that 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.269
 his special ability is to cause 190 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.190
 points of damage we can also touch the 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.010
 enemy and see their attacks their 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.750
 specialties and what you can do 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.580
 we can attack or we can do the 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.810
 special ability that in this case if 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.640
 we press can reduce the damage and 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.930
 says now of strength that is like a 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.390
 protective shield and we will activate it 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.930
 simply touching will be activated on him 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.900
 or we can slide touch and slide 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.370
 towards our partner so that he 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.370
 activate the special ability in our 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.120
 partner in the same way here we can 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.120
 perform the attack 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.629
 first it will be our turn and then 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.629
 it will be the turn of the opponent 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.590
 let's use one of the skills 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.780
 specials from our friend that says the 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.900
 target bird immediately attack a 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.760
 random enemy then let's play and 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.740
 if we drag up bat it goes to 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.020
 attack a random bird but as 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.120
 nothing else there is one I say a random pig 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.570
 nothing else is there one here used a 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.490
 special ability to dodge bomb 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:56.870
 mower and well here we can do what 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:59.299
 same and will give shields to both birds 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.549
 We will progress through the game and we will 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.860
 they will improve what weapons are 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.019
 skills here there is little and we can 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.450
 touch them and give them to our 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.060
 fighters to be able to increase their life 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.830
 we just filled our skill 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.480
 special and we can give it one of the 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.120
 two let's make that attack be with 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.829
 190 points and that's how we finished 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.510
 our combat will give us experience 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.550
 and we will be given some coins to 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.770
 to be able to buy some improvements 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.050
 also here I have two stars for 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.430
 nothing else will activate these two and what 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.889
 that falls into roulette will be what I 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.320
 will give of materials to be able to you can 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.960
 make new weapons in this case fell 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.900
 these two can be rotated again giving 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.940
 one of your hearts we can repeat the 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.820
 level or we can give next I will give 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.370
 next so that you can follow 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.440
 watching the game itself 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.409
 here apparently has gotten another 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:56.580
 we will also go to the next level 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:59.879
 but wait here I have something 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.229
 here I can buy good we can go to 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:02.550
 several workshops where we can go 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.229
 buying several things depending on 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.500
 coins here we have the hammer of 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.630
 cobalt and a broom with pen 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.380
 of tdt we are going to buy the broom with 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.240
 pen and also the other to be able 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.540
 equip we have to go again 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.870
 to our lair so to speak and a 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.130
 time in it we will go to what they are 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.240
 creation of weapons here we have both 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.160
 we just bought new 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.660
 we're just going to play on one of 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.340
 they are here the materials that are 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.340
 they occupy and we are going to give it to build 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:35.629
 a die will be thrown and depending on the 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:37.400
 given the skills that are 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:39.590
 provide our new weapon as in 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.539
 this case there are different types of 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.069
 opponents like this pig that has 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:47.029
 special abilities and it's much more 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:48.770
 strong and has more hp or life has a 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:51.169
 rain of fire that took me to load two 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:54.080
 turns but with 66 points of damage to 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.969
 all the opponents and well this is a 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.150
 little pig has nothing but a rod 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:01.610
 to chop you and we are 12 damage 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.720
 just launched our attack and we 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.720
 they just look with a wand 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.189
 and it raised us again life we're going to 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.409
 use in the skill and we're going to 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:13.230
 to secrete again this at random yet 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.420
 it's not random 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.600
 and attacked that we are going to attack again 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:21.470
 that is the most difficult and we already have 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.470
 our skill 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.560
 let's see if we kill this piglet not 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.120
 we kill him let's do this already 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.620
 we kill let's use our 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.719
 special ability in the one that we 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.339
 is left to lose 190 damage 

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:39.979
 245 on this occasion because I just 

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:41.899
 change the weapon then you already 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.879
 You can see how they improve in this 

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:45.259
 type of levels there are several varied 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:47.599
 confrontations before reaching the 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:49.339
 reward and well this has been all 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:51.439
 I hope you liked that if you 

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:53.119
 they liked me leave a like subscribe and I 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:54.919
