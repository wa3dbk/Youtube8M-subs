00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 &lt;i&gt; It was a dark day when I lost my faith &lt;/i&gt; 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.500
 &lt;i&gt; I wasn't the pony I wanted to become &lt;/i&gt; 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.000
 &lt;i&gt; And nobody seemed to understand me &lt;/i&gt; 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 &lt;i&gt; There's nothing left for me to see &lt;/i&gt; 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 &lt;i&gt; So I went to the edge of town &lt;/i&gt; 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.500
 And he thought about leaving it all behind &lt;/i&gt; 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 &lt;i&gt; When I saw a small envelope falling from the sky &lt;/i&gt; 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.000
 &lt;i&gt; A gray grasshopper flying across the sky &lt;/i&gt; 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 &lt;i&gt; I thought I was mad when I saw her waving me &lt;/i&gt; 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.500
 And then she just flew away &lt;/i&gt; 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.500
 &lt;i&gt; I opened the letter and looked inside &lt;/i&gt; 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.000
 &lt;i&gt; And what was written there has made my day brighter ... &lt;/i&gt; 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.500
 &lt;i&gt; There was: Isn't it great to be different? &lt;/i&gt; 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 &lt;i&gt; Isn't it wonderful to be exactly who you really are? &lt;/i&gt; 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.000
 &lt;i&gt; When you learn to accept yourself &lt;/i&gt; 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 &lt;i&gt; You'll become a shining star &lt;/i&gt; 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 &lt;i&gt; This letter is still today &lt;/i&gt; 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.500
 &lt;i&gt; Speckled from the tears I have over him &lt;/i&gt; 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.000
 &lt;i&gt; Because at that moment something broke in me &lt;/i&gt; 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 And I set out on a new clear path &lt;/i&gt; 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 &lt;i&gt; I ran home and took my old guitar &lt;/i&gt; 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.000
 And he sounded those chords &lt;/i&gt; 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.000
 And he sang her words in this song &lt;/i&gt; 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.500
 And he heard someone join him 

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:55.000
 &lt;i&gt; We sang: Isn't it great to be different? &lt;/i&gt; 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.000
 &lt;i&gt; Isn't it wonderful to be exactly who you really are? &lt;/i&gt; 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.500
 &lt;i&gt; When you learn to accept yourself &lt;/i&gt; 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 &lt;i&gt; You'll become a shining star &lt;/i&gt; 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.500
 &lt;i&gt; I turned and saw her at my door &lt;/i&gt; 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.500
 &lt;i&gt; That cute gray grasshopper with a squinting look &lt;/i&gt; 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.500
 &lt;i&gt; She said, "I've heard you sing before. &lt;/i&gt; 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 &lt;i&gt; And your sadness could not bear. "&lt;/i&gt; 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 &lt;i&gt; "I just wanted to tell you the hardest thing for me &lt;/i&gt; 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.000
 &lt;i&gt; It wasn't ridicule or pain &lt;/i&gt; 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.500
 &lt;i&gt; It was to convince myself that I wasn't stupid, weird or sick &lt;/i&gt; 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 And help others to do the same. "&lt;/i&gt; 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 &lt;i&gt; The last few years have passed like a blurry smudge &lt;/i&gt; 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.500
 &lt;i&gt; I'm right where I should be &lt;/i&gt; 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 &lt;i&gt; And I know I owe it all &lt;/i&gt; 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.500
 &lt;i&gt; Beautiful locusts that trusted me &lt;/i&gt; 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.000
 &lt;i&gt; Isn't it great to be different? &lt;/i&gt; 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:21.500
 &lt;i&gt; Isn't it wonderful to be exactly who you really are? &lt;/i&gt; 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.500
 &lt;i&gt; When you learn to accept yourself &lt;/i&gt; 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 &lt;i&gt; You'll become a shining star &lt;/i&gt; 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.000
 &lt;i&gt; Isn't it great to be different? &lt;/i&gt; 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.500
 &lt;i&gt; Isn't it wonderful to be exactly who you really are? &lt;/i&gt; 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.500
 &lt;i&gt; When you learn to accept yourself &lt;/i&gt; 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 &lt;i&gt; Will you become a shining star (Isn't it wonderful?) &lt;/i&gt; 

00:06:00.001 --> 00:06:06.000
 &lt;i&gt; You will become a shining star (Isn't it great?) &lt;/i&gt; 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:19.000
 &lt;i&gt; When you learn to like yourself as you are &lt;/i&gt;
