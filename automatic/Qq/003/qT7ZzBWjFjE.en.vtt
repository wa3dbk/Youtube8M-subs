 Honda was on sale between 1999 and 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.860
 2006 and was a pioneer in the concept of 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.750
 the compact crossover suv the kind of 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.039
 vehicle that currently has more 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.609

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.609
 Look at me 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.440
 now wave presents in Europe a new 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.450
 hrv that retains the denomination and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.250
 philosophy of the original and supposes the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.670
 introduction of a new generation of 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.769
 subcompact for the brand is a product 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.600
 very important and should become 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.589
 the growth engine of your sales in 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.589
 the next years 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.010
 The one who's in charge 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.530
 the crossover vehicles assume a 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.510
 mix of concepts and the hsv combines a 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.640
 Attractive design with a certain character 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.769

 fuel tank is located in 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.270
 central position so that it leaves 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.070
 a lot of free space in the back 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.260

 and belonging to the green series 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.060
 technology 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.379
 gasoline provides a power

 maximum to 6 thousand 600 revolutions per 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.099
 minute and variable distribution 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.190
 allows you to climb laps with 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.989
 ease honda bet on a motor of 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.150
 classic cut that you have to take to a 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.799
 high rate to push with verve 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.900
 when the competition does it for 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.260
 turbo engines that offer more torque 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.030
 push to a much lower regime the 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.379
 diesel engine is equipped with a 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.720
 6-speed manual transmission 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.549
 while the gasoline engine is 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.140
 supplied with a manual transmission 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.910
 6 speeds with a transmission 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.569
 Automatic continuous variation 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.030
 cwt the attraction is forward and is not 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.739
 planned to attract the 4x4 versions that 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.510
 sold in other countries at least 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.250
 moment since the demand is low and 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.329
 uses engines that do not exceed 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.329
 euro 6 regulation 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.250
 The automatic change cwt simulates being 7 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.320
 marches but if we step on the engine thoroughly 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.790
 it is revolutionized looking for the greatest push 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.970
 while the car is winning 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.740
 speed in a gradual way when 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.510
 you are not required to stand out for your 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.850
 Gently but driving so 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.710
 dynamic the engine is very revolutionized 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.060
 what negatively affects comfort 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.060
 sound and consumption 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.360
 with the manual change the gasoline can 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.569
 accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.220
 in 10 2 seconds and reach 192 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.560
 kilometers per hour with a consumption 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.889
 Approved 5.6 liters per 100 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.530
 kilometers with the cvtp change can 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.139
 accelerate in 11.2 seconds and reach 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.690
 about 187 kilometers per hour with a 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.230
 consumption of 5.2 liters per 100 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.230
 kilometer 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.750
 For its part, diesel can accelerate 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.720
 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in 10 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.550
 seconds and reach 192 kilometers 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.790
 per hour with an average consumption of 4 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.280
 liters per 100 kilometers although it is the 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.530
 same motor that mounts the cr-v does not go so 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.570
 well acoustically isolated and sound 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.570
 comes more clearly to the passenger compartment 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.510
 27 percent of the bodywork has been 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.880
 Made with high strength steel 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.730
 and offers high rigidity in the

 Frame joints suspension 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.820

 front and torsion bar in the form of 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.640
 h in the back that provides a 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.410
 good behavior supported on the low 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.160
 center of gravity and the minimized

 rolling body 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.090
 the range of the new hr v has three 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.580
 finish levels called comfort

 the active brake system in the city 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.310
 this system that has been designed to 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.050
 avoid or at least reduce 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.060
 consequences of accidents at low 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.159
 speed uses a technology based 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.900
 in a laser trader that examines the 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.939
 road through which the vehicle advances 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.800
 and automatically activates the brakes on 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:58.889
 if a risk of 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.900
 imminent collision the system works to 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.889
 speeds below 32

 the medium and high versions of the range 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.270
 they equip the set of systems as standard
