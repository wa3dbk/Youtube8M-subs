hold like this and pretty much it just
drops<00:01:44.960> it<00:01:45.560> drops<00:01:45.740> more<00:01:46.160> than<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:46.460> curved<00:01:46.730> but

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
drops it drops more than it curved but

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.200 
drops it drops more than it curved but
the<00:01:47.570> other<00:01:47.690> one<00:01:47.870> curves<00:01:48.290> terribly<00:01:49.250> well<00:01:49.940> here

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.860 
so now it's time for the extra curveball
but<00:02:14.490> another<00:02:14.970> thing<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.390> can<00:02:15.540> do<00:02:15.690> with

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
but another thing you can do with

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.930

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
holding it like this if you throw it

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.920 
holding it like this if you throw it
sidearm<00:02:18.569> with<00:02:19.260> holes<00:02:19.620> down<00:02:20.510> becomes<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.660> riser

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
sidearm with holes down becomes a riser

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.460 
sidearm with holes down becomes a riser
and<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.410> goes<00:02:22.590> up<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.250> left<00:02:23.819> if<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.270> left<00:02:24.569> your

and it goes up and left if you left your
life<00:02:25.680> here<00:02:26.370> goes<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.760> curveball<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.540> looks

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
life here goes the curveball it looks

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.140 
life here goes the curveball it looks
like<00:02:27.750> this
