they okay like okay if I was gonna be
putting<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.960> block<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.590> roadblock<00:01:59.979> I<00:02:00.549> put<00:02:00.820> it

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
putting the block a roadblock I put it

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.380 
putting the block a roadblock I put it
here<00:02:01.360> we're<00:02:01.960> there<00:02:02.320> next<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:03.010> a<00:02:03.040> curve<00:02:03.430> one<00:02:04.240> of

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
here we're there next to a curve one of

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.929 
here we're there next to a curve one of
the<00:02:04.479> other<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:05.380> then<00:02:05.740> you<00:02:05.799> just<00:02:06.159> set<00:02:06.369> up<00:02:06.580> where

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
the other and then you just set up where

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:13.350 
the other and then you just set up where
you<00:02:06.970> can<00:02:07.090> watch<00:02:11.130> this<00:02:12.130> whole<00:02:12.370> thing<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:13.030> then

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
you can watch this whole thing and then

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.210 
you can watch this whole thing and then
I<00:02:13.480> say<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.810> put<00:02:13.989> your<00:02:14.260> roadblock<00:02:14.620> right<00:02:14.890> here

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
I say you put your roadblock right here

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.699 
I say you put your roadblock right here
and<00:02:15.780> then<00:02:16.780> when<00:02:16.900> they<00:02:16.989> come<00:02:17.170> around<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.470> curve

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
and then when they come around the curve

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.670 
and then when they come around the curve
then<00:02:18.040> they<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.910> got<00:02:19.060> them<00:02:19.269> in<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.450> roadblock

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
then they you got them in the roadblock

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.710 
then they you got them in the roadblock
you<00:02:20.980> don't<00:02:21.130> give<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.280> chance<00:02:21.610> to

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
you don't give a chance to

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.110 
you don't give a chance to
reevaluate<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.840> situation<00:02:24.470> okay<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:25.400> you'd

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
reevaluate the situation okay so you'd

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.870 
reevaluate the situation okay so you'd
have<00:02:26.300> it<00:02:26.450> there<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:27.080> at<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.590> same<00:02:27.770> time<00:02:28.100> if

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
have it there and at the same time if

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.240 
have it there and at the same time if
I'm<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.390> one<00:02:29.570> with<00:02:29.960> the<00:02:29.990> roadblock<00:02:30.560> I'd<00:02:31.070> have

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
I'm the one with the roadblock I'd have

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.420 
I'm the one with the roadblock I'd have
the<00:02:31.370> roadblock<00:02:31.790> there<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:33.080> I'd<00:02:33.200> have<00:02:33.440> the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
the roadblock there and I'd have the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.160 
the roadblock there and I'd have the
same<00:02:34.610> thing<00:02:34.880> I'd<00:02:35.120> have<00:02:35.150> someone<00:02:35.540> up<00:02:35.840> here

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170
