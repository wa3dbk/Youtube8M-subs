00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:23.119
 dota2.ru 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:23.119
 say such a clever phrase that if we have to 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.760

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.760

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.910
 so many disputes. well done show him 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.010
 that I live such a Russian language my wife 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.690
 the former she was doing the program on 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.239
 television word for word 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.149
 and in Russian, I specifically 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.730
 asked her to call the philologist pablo 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.579
 club whom and which serves and for which 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.969
 even students learn books and raised 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.520
 this question about the witch yes he 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.729
 said so here as a philologist that in general 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.280
 suffixes and it is very difficult and very many 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.979
 disputes around it goes but the point is 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.770
 that if we say crow we can 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.400
 speak and witch if we don't speak 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.439
 the sorceress 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.909
 it means we do not speak it earlier nirvana 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.490
 Mario about them is not a dud that is, as it were, 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.340
 legal and some kind of dictionary does not 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.590
 gives welded for with explanatory dictionary 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.990
 explanations does not give a piece of neck is very 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.479
 controversial promises and on about this 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.549
 suffix is a lot of controversy but 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.990
 if we already started talking to crow we 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.900
 we can take call was on the line 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.490
 it is quite normal that is, here I am 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.979
 interested as to whether it is right 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.880
 talk about lying basically no one 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.770
 knows the right 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.869
 you need not what they seem like this one 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.990

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.960
 even write you to remember this he 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.740
 teacher and he is a philologist at his base of his 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.060
 programs are made here to find 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.259
 hand i think that russian language 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.110
 more mobilely underestimate both lies and sorcerels i 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.659
 now showed this actor ludo before 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.680
 endings love fell out stick on dough 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:15.250
 there saved the tourists the sulfur is not necessary 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.739
 the director likes to aim at the director 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.230
 to all the more and then when he started like that 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.239
 Well, I do not know the rules of the Russian language 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.970
 I thought you might well rule Russian 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.069
 I have no interest in language 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.989
 there are no Russian rules 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.930
 language about their suffix they are not present 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.540
 Nature no explanatory dictionary gives 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.209
 there are just as certain that's such a 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.350
 the teacher believes to correctly explain a 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.090
 so this is about the witch 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.500
 I told you that he is Russian 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.930
 movable language can you vary 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.420
 this is what Orion highlights as it grew 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.260
 no riot lift at all 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.019
 the barbarian was not struck by me therefore this 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.870
 quite normal it is acceptable and cons 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.280
 it seems and there I did not swear at them and 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.260
 because then we are not fine 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.560

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.109

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.150

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.670
 catch on there speed 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.299
 I look down there to discuss such 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:26.590
 hot talk is not that interesting 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:28.329

 handed down there is no some factor 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.950
 there is no any top here 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:59.460

 about all the sheet said so 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.850
 that means we can and so here already 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.850
 no need to use other words 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.490
 further on the claws yes even once accumulated in 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.490
