00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.140 

Dave<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.950> Katelyn<00:01:29.100> first<00:01:29.549> approached<00:01:29.940> me

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
Dave and Katelyn first approached me

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.789 
Dave and Katelyn first approached me
because<00:01:30.180> they<00:01:30.659> were<00:01:30.720> developing<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.650> new

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
because they were developing a new

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.920 
because they were developing a new
cooking<00:01:32.220> approach<00:01:32.580> and<00:01:32.909> they<00:01:33.540> needed<00:01:33.750> some

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
cooking approach and they needed some

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.749 
cooking approach and they needed some
test<00:01:34.140> subjects<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:34.979> they<00:01:35.159> asked<00:01:35.430> me<00:01:35.549> if<00:01:35.640> I

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
test subjects so they asked me if I

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.660 
test subjects so they asked me if I
wanted<00:01:35.940> to<00:01:36.299> try<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:36.960> out<00:01:37.080> and<00:01:37.290> at<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.369> point<00:01:38.580> I

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
wanted to try it out and at that point I

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.160 
wanted to try it out and at that point I
had<00:01:38.700> nothing<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.240> lose<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.659> said<00:01:39.930> sure<00:01:45.170> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
had nothing to lose so I said sure the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.530 
had nothing to lose so I said sure the
first<00:01:46.409> thing<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.770> noticed<00:01:46.800> about<00:01:47.540> Dave

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
first thing that I noticed about Dave

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.060 
first thing that I noticed about Dave
and<00:01:48.750> Kevin's<00:01:49.049> new<00:01:49.229> recipes<00:01:49.680> were<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.950> they

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
and Kevin's new recipes were that they

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.340 
and Kevin's new recipes were that they
were<00:01:50.100> really<00:01:50.520> good<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:51.270> they<00:01:51.750> tasted<00:01:52.170> great

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
were really good like they tasted great

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.920 
were really good like they tasted great
they<00:01:52.470> didn't<00:01:52.740> taste<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:52.979> diet<00:01:53.369> foods

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
they didn't taste like diet foods

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.749 
they didn't taste like diet foods
they're<00:01:54.930> super<00:01:55.440> easy<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.680> make<00:01:55.799> really<00:01:56.369> time

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
they're super easy to make really time

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.550 
they're super easy to make really time
efficient<00:01:57.299> which<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:57.960> good<00:01:58.140> because<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.530> have
