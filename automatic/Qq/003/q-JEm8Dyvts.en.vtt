 we can really have one here 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.710

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.809
 getting hp is a premium device 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.590
 It does not mean less than 1000 euro 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.990
 costs 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.720
 the selection with classic full hd and 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.089
 HD resolution would of course be the latest 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.409
 Intel processors and the largest 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.060
 trackpad what you 've been up to now 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.649

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.909
 means we can especially here completely 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.679
 just do some gestures like this 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.759
 Example between the last programs 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.409
 should switch back and forth actually 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.600

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.620
 very good in themselves now have easy 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.080
 still gets a production is then called 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.540
 biss can still have a few general errors 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.280
 but we can completely new windows 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.080
 8 over it so go into the surface 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.330
 modern july where you of course with 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.040
 touch can ask her all the wonderful 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.230
 I absolutely had to go through here with the 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.970
 but gestures should be generally 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.380
 actually quite good here exactly 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.460
 function 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.320
 I just have to believe it a bit 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.530
 practice and then we can donate as well 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.580
 quite well adjust windows here 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.980
 really pleasant keyboard of the pressure 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.630
 the good can be expressed by pressing 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.730
 have really real metal case here 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.200
 But it is still easier than a 13 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.440
 inch macbook air though is actually 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.850
 the same shape and size has usb3 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.740
 connection we have once on the side 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.090
 headphones and a sd card reader plus 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.070
 Of course, cam will not sink 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.830
 can be stolen, it is 15 mm thick 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.229
 at the thickest point and on the side 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.460
 still a power connection 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.210
 HDMI output also displayport course 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.250
 also again usb 3.0 usb connection 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.290
 not too much but not too little 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.530
 At the bottom we see a nice one 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.330
 design what he has to go under the farmers 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.890
 you could be here with little ones 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.430
 unscrew the bottom also unscrew 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.410
 But I 'm not thinking about it 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.650
 and from the outside we have the same thing 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.970
 I want light brownish brand design 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.650
 Now say with a huge 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.070
 hp lohner table in the middle advertising 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.720
 for this 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.160
 I am sure that this chic 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.619
 mouse but the team will be such a synonymous 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.750
 A touch mouse is the one with which you can 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.880
 system can also move well 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.870
 exactly feels very good and then 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.720
 we have the lincoln right mouse button 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.910
 accordingly not pressing to the right 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.380
 but I can not gesture here now 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.210
 recognize that we can choose with it 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.910
 but of course, how will that get for him? 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.740
 high price yes still a nice cover 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.200
 to the magnetically here then all this 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.030
 will protect well and here 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.980
 from bremen also pleasant accordingly 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.540
 his biggest yes that was already here 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.850
 for the time being, from here really 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.440
 send hp aspects 13 someone by the way 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.010
 also open wonderfully with one hand 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.530
 So it is not necessarily possible 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.760
 two fingers hands does not need any 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.980
 song motion in here but otherwise 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.780
 actually a very chic device what 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.940

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.820
