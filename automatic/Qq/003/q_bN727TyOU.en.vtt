00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.110 
pants I like a combination of both I
think<00:03:47.739> it<00:03:48.190> gives<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.610> little<00:03:48.730> bit<00:03:48.880> more

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
think it gives a little bit more

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.390 
think it gives a little bit more
stability<00:03:49.780> so<00:03:50.110> when<00:03:50.440> it<00:03:50.530> Wiggles<00:03:50.890> it<00:03:51.130> Wiggles

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
stability so when it Wiggles it Wiggles

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.210 
stability so when it Wiggles it Wiggles
