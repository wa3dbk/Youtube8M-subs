products called exterior trim sealant ok
and<00:04:50.960> unlike<00:04:51.740> a<00:04:51.800> lot<00:04:51.949> of<00:04:52.129> plastic<00:04:52.689> dressings

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:53.689 
and unlike a lot of plastic dressings

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:56.110 
and unlike a lot of plastic dressings
this<00:04:54.229> isn't<00:04:54.560> going<00:04:54.680> to<00:04:54.800> run<00:04:55.310> off<00:04:55.490> if<00:04:55.789> it<00:04:56.000> gets

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
this isn't going to run off if it gets

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.879 
this isn't going to run off if it gets
wet<00:04:56.479> say<00:04:56.780> it<00:04:56.870> gets<00:04:57.080> cut<00:04:57.289> you<00:04:57.379> get<00:04:57.560> caught<00:04:57.770> in

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
wet say it gets cut you get caught in

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.159 
wet say it gets cut you get caught in
the<00:04:57.949> rain<00:04:58.190> you're<00:04:58.879> washing<00:04:59.120> the<00:04:59.360> car<00:04:59.569> a<00:04:59.780> lot<00:05:00.050> of

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
the rain you're washing the car a lot of

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.200 
the rain you're washing the car a lot of
these<00:05:00.259> plastic<00:05:00.949> dressings<00:05:01.460> just<00:05:01.729> run<00:05:02.000> off

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
these plastic dressings just run off

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.300 
these plastic dressings just run off
because<00:05:02.569> plastic<00:05:02.930> doesn't<00:05:03.349> absorb<00:05:03.770> very<00:05:04.129> well

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
because plastic doesn't absorb very well

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.879 
because plastic doesn't absorb very well
what<00:05:04.819> this<00:05:05.030> uses<00:05:05.449> is<00:05:05.629> a<00:05:05.659> synthetic<00:05:05.990> polymer

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
what this uses is a synthetic polymer

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.890 
what this uses is a synthetic polymer
that's<00:05:07.310> going<00:05:07.460> to<00:05:07.550> protect<00:05:07.819> by<00:05:08.300> bonding

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
that's going to protect by bonding

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.629 
that's going to protect by bonding
actually<00:05:09.379> to<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:09.800> plastic<00:05:10.250> and<00:05:10.340> it<00:05:10.400> is<00:05:10.490> going

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
actually to the plastic and it is going

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.249 
actually to the plastic and it is going
to<00:05:10.699> wear<00:05:10.879> off<00:05:11.090> so<00:05:11.419> it's<00:05:11.539> going<00:05:11.629> to<00:05:11.690> last<00:05:11.930> and

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 
to wear off so it's going to last and

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
thing about both the rubber and vinyl

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.610 
thing about both the rubber and vinyl
protectant<00:05:28.849> the<00:05:29.599> leather<00:05:29.840> conditioner<00:05:30.139> and

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
protectant the leather conditioner and

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.830 
protectant the leather conditioner and
the<00:05:30.949> plastic<00:05:31.190> sealant<00:05:31.909> there<00:05:32.120> it<00:05:32.449> leaves<00:05:32.719> a

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
the plastic sealant there it leaves a

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.350 
the plastic sealant there it leaves a
non<00:05:33.080> greasy<00:05:33.469> surface<00:05:33.949> so<00:05:34.789> it's<00:05:34.940> not<00:05:35.090> going<00:05:35.240> to

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
non greasy surface so it's not going to

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.790 
non greasy surface so it's not going to
stay<00:05:35.599> I'll<00:05:35.810> stay<00:05:35.840> on<00:05:36.110> your<00:05:36.199> vehicle<00:05:36.500> not<00:05:36.680> fit

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
stay I'll stay on your vehicle not fit

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.619 
stay I'll stay on your vehicle not fit
on<00:05:36.860> your<00:05:37.009> clothes<00:05:37.250> and<00:05:37.430> it<00:05:37.789> won't<00:05:38.360> attract

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:38.629 
on your clothes and it won't attract

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:41.760 
on your clothes and it won't attract
dust<00:05:38.900> yep<00:05:39.379> so<00:05:39.620> that's<00:05:40.159> another<00:05:40.490> benefit<00:05:40.909> to<00:05:40.969> it

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
dust yep so that's another benefit to it

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.409 
dust yep so that's another benefit to it
like<00:05:42.770> I<00:05:42.919> think<00:05:43.129> this<00:05:43.520> cars<00:05:43.789> ready<00:05:44.000> to<00:05:44.120> go<00:05:44.240> I
