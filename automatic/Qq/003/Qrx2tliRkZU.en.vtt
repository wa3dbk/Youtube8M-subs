the frickin wall we'll see how this runs
in<00:00:44.899> 4k<00:00:46.520> so<00:00:47.520> Windows<00:00:48.480> 10<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:48.930> far<00:00:49.140> has<00:00:49.260> been

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
in 4k so Windows 10 so far has been

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.029 
in 4k so Windows 10 so far has been
pretty<00:00:49.649> interesting<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:52.620> games<00:00:52.860> are

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
pretty interesting it's the games are

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.920 
pretty interesting it's the games are
running<00:00:53.280> pretty<00:00:53.460> well<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.300> haven't<00:00:54.840> had

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
running pretty well on it I haven't had

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.630 
running pretty well on it I haven't had
any<00:00:55.110> issues<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.739> seems<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> performance

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
any issues it seems like the performance

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.689 
any issues it seems like the performance
is<00:00:56.760> even<00:00:57.030> better<00:00:57.239> um<00:00:58.160> seems<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.370> frame

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
is even better um seems like the frame

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.560 
is even better um seems like the frame
rates<00:00:59.940> are<00:01:00.149> solid<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.930> think<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.039> game

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
rates are solid I think this game

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.660 
rates are solid I think this game
probably<00:01:03.570> gonna<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> same<00:01:04.260> oh<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:05.129> should

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
probably gonna have the same oh I should

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.149 
probably gonna have the same oh I should
