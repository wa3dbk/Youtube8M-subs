whole<00:02:46.470> graph<00:02:46.620> for<00:02:46.770> v3<00:02:47.510> changzhou<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:49.560> next<00:02:49.770> we

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
whole graph for v3 changzhou so next we

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.480 
whole graph for v3 changzhou so next we
have<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:51.080> ghost<00:02:52.080> hand<00:02:52.290> for<00:02:52.530> by<00:02:52.650> force<00:02:52.920> and

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
have the ghost hand for by force and

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.750 
have the ghost hand for by force and
this<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:53.940> exactly<00:02:54.240> like<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.840> Fink<00:02:55.170> lv<00:02:55.560> three

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
this is exactly like a Fink lv three

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.950 
this is exactly like a Fink lv three
pieces<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.180> exact<00:02:57.480> for<00:02:57.660> this<00:02:57.750> and

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
pieces of the exact for this and

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.420 
pieces of the exact for this and
stickers<00:02:58.970> shades<00:03:00.890> has<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.010> same<00:03:02.190> amount<00:03:02.400> of

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
stickers shades has the same amount of

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.030 
stickers shades has the same amount of
lockup<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:03.300> everything<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:04.380> i<00:03:04.410> guess<00:03:04.830> i<00:03:04.980> would

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
lockup and everything so i guess i would

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.360 
lockup and everything so i guess i would
recommend<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:06.920> next<00:03:07.920> we<00:03:08.010> have<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.130> shank

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
recommend it next we have the shank

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.570 
recommend it next we have the shank
