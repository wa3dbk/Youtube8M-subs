00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
not designed to go full speed but as I

not designed to go full speed but as I
swing<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.899> can<00:00:37.050> feel<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.440> club<00:00:37.590> swinging

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
swing this I can feel the club swinging

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.340 
swing this I can feel the club swinging
and<00:00:38.370> pulling<00:00:38.969> my<00:00:39.059> body<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.780> both<00:00:40.020> directions

and pulling my body in both directions
now<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.219> terms<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.670> timing<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.210> we

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
now in terms of the timing what we

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.030 
now in terms of the timing what we
describe<00:00:42.660> as<00:00:42.750> timing<00:00:43.079> would<00:00:43.590> be<00:00:43.739> when<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
describe as timing would be when the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.610 
describe as timing would be when the
golf<00:00:44.219> club<00:00:44.430> arrives<00:00:44.730> at<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> ball<00:00:45.379> very<00:00:46.379> hard

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
golf club arrives at the ball very hard

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.680 
golf club arrives at the ball very hard
to<00:00:46.770> feel<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.219> sense<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> average<00:00:48.329> player

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
to feel and sense for the average player

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.270 
to feel and sense for the average player
but<00:00:49.200> what<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.500> always<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.950> do<00:00:50.039> here<00:00:50.219> is

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
but what we always have to do here is

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.560 
but what we always have to do here is
look<00:00:50.430> at<00:00:50.550> our<00:00:50.670> ball<00:00:50.820> flight<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.210> tell<00:00:51.360> us<00:00:51.449> what

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
look at our ball flight to tell us what

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.049 
look at our ball flight to tell us what
our<00:00:51.660> timing<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.079> if<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.670> golf<00:00:53.850> ball

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
our timing is if the if the golf ball

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.319 
our timing is if the if the golf ball
goes<00:00:54.239> dead<00:00:54.480> straight<00:00:55.850> what's<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.000> didn't

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
goes dead straight what's that didn't

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.720 
goes dead straight what's that didn't
hook<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.410> would<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.620> an<00:00:58.680> early<00:00:58.829> timing<00:00:59.280> which

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
hook that would be an early timing which

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.760 
hook that would be an early timing which
is<00:00:59.850> advisable<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:00.719> most<00:01:00.960> amateur<00:01:01.350> golfers<00:01:01.680> in

other words the golf club got to the
ball<00:01:04.339> before<00:01:05.339> my<00:01:05.670> hands<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.240> curve<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> ball

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
ball before my hands and curve the ball

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.649 
ball before my hands and curve the ball
right<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.439> left<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.520> golf<00:01:08.729> ball<00:01:09.000> gets<00:01:09.299> if

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
right to left if the golf ball gets if

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.380 
right to left if the golf ball gets if
the<00:01:09.869> glass<00:01:10.020> Club<00:01:10.350> gets<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.890> ball<00:01:11.390> second

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
the glass Club gets to the ball second

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.570 
the glass Club gets to the ball second
which<00:01:12.570> would<00:01:12.689> be<00:01:12.840> late<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.680> golf<00:01:14.040> terminology

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
which would be late in golf terminology

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.870 
which would be late in golf terminology
then<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> ball<00:01:15.210> will<00:01:15.299> curve<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.750> right

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
then the ball will curve to the right

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.010 
then the ball will curve to the right
you<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:18.000> see<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> slight<00:01:18.360> fade<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.780> shot

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
you can see a slight fade in that shot

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.870 
you can see a slight fade in that shot
when<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.710> slow<00:01:19.950> down<00:01:19.979> with<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.430> club<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.729> can

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
when I slow down with this club I can

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.609 
when I slow down with this club I can
actually<00:01:21.030> sense<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> timing<00:01:21.900> better<00:01:22.049> because

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
actually sense the timing better because

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.770 
actually sense the timing better because
things<00:01:22.860> are<00:01:23.009> just<00:01:23.130> much<00:01:23.759> slower<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.630> can

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
things are just much slower and I can

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.210 
things are just much slower and I can
see<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> bar<00:01:25.200> flight<00:01:25.470> coming<00:01:25.770> off<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> club

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
see the bar flight coming off the club

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.520 
see the bar flight coming off the club
the<00:01:27.000> obviously<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> toughest<00:01:27.810> timing<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.380> get

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the obviously the toughest timing to get

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.249 
the obviously the toughest timing to get
is<00:01:28.650> an<00:01:28.740> on-time<00:01:29.070> hit<00:01:29.310> or<00:01:29.729> square<00:01:30.210> where<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
is an on-time hit or square where the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.830 
is an on-time hit or square where the
golf<00:01:31.409> club<00:01:31.740> arrives<00:01:32.700> at<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> ball<00:01:33.150> at<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
golf club arrives at the ball at the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.580 
golf club arrives at the ball at the
same<00:01:33.869> time<00:01:34.229> as<00:01:34.350> my<00:01:34.470> hands<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.920> grip<00:01:36.439> such<00:01:37.439> as

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
same time as my hands and grip such as

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.069 
same time as my hands and grip such as
that<00:01:37.770> they're<00:01:38.509> imparting<00:01:39.509> no<00:01:39.600> spin<00:01:39.930> either

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
that they're imparting no spin either

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.109 
that they're imparting no spin either
left<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.409> right<00:01:40.650> or<00:01:40.799> right<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.979> left<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.520> time

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
left to right or right to left so time

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.700 
left to right or right to left so time
in<00:01:42.329> your<00:01:42.420> golf<00:01:42.600> shot<00:01:42.840> really<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.380> when<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
in your golf shot really is when the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.410 
in your golf shot really is when the
head<00:01:43.860> arrives<00:01:44.189> if<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.640> head<00:01:44.820> arrives<00:01:45.119> late

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
head arrives if the head arrives late

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.429 
head arrives if the head arrives late
it's<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.869> impart<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.200> left-to-right

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
it's going to impart a left-to-right

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.800 
it's going to impart a left-to-right
spin<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.130> leave<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> ball<00:01:47.790> higher<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.689> more

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
spin and leave the ball higher and more

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.899 
spin and leave the ball higher and more
to<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.049> right<00:01:49.259> producing<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.220> fade<00:01:50.430> or<00:01:50.460> even<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
slice if it's a graduated timing that's

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.440 
slice if it's a graduated timing that's
early<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.549> early<00:01:53.729> side<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> head

front of the ball and that would produce

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.700
