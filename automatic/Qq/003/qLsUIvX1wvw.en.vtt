00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.799 

so<00:00:03.990> I'm<00:00:04.110> working<00:00:04.319> on<00:00:04.529> my<00:00:05.600> ix500

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:16.730 

this<00:00:09.809> bike<00:00:10.110> as<00:00:11.690> gasoline<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.230> oil<00:00:15.680> so<00:00:16.680> I

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
this bike as gasoline and the oil so I

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.390 
this bike as gasoline and the oil so I
took<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.130> carburetors<00:00:17.699> off<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:19.160> by<00:00:20.160> accident

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
took the carburetors off and by accident

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.230 
took the carburetors off and by accident
the<00:00:21.029> pin<00:00:21.300> fell<00:00:21.630> out<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:22.789> this<00:00:23.789> float<00:00:26.029> and<00:00:27.029> I

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
the pin fell out of this float and I

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.860 
the pin fell out of this float and I
never<00:00:27.510> cleaned<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:31.279> float<00:00:32.279> needle<00:00:32.870> area

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
never cleaned the float needle area

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.840 
never cleaned the float needle area
before<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:34.980> sprayed<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.489> out<00:00:36.410> and<00:00:37.790> this<00:00:38.790> is

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
before so I sprayed it out and this is

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.920 
before so I sprayed it out and this is
all<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.329> rust<00:00:39.570> they<00:00:39.780> came<00:00:40.050> out

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.340 

it<00:00:45.930> may<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.230> just<00:00:46.440> cleaned<00:00:46.800> out<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.910> whole

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
it may have just cleaned out the whole

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.580 
it may have just cleaned out the whole
fuel<00:00:49.370> bar<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.360> line<00:00:51.570> all<00:00:52.080> the<00:00:52.230> rust<00:00:54.590> but

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
fuel bar and the line all the rust but

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.470 
fuel bar and the line all the rust but
we'll<00:00:55.830> see<00:00:56.040> how<00:00:56.070> much<00:00:56.510> rust<00:00:57.510> comes<00:00:57.810> out<00:00:58.020> of

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
we'll see how much rust comes out of

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:07.790 
we'll see how much rust comes out of
this<00:01:00.480> quote<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:02.420> put<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.450> rag<00:01:03.720> over<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:06.710> area<00:01:07.710> I'm

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
this quote I put a rag over the area I'm

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.880 
this quote I put a rag over the area I'm
spraying<00:01:08.160> so<00:01:08.430> nothing<00:01:08.729> sprays<00:01:09.060> back<00:01:09.680> so<00:01:10.680> let's

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
spraying so nothing sprays back so let's

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:30.420 
spraying so nothing sprays back so let's
see<00:01:11.100> what<00:01:11.250> comes<00:01:11.460> out

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.620 

alright<00:01:31.430> it<00:01:31.520> looks<00:01:31.700> like<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.880> little<00:01:32.090> rust<00:01:32.390> came

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
alright it looks like a little rust came

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.580 
alright it looks like a little rust came
out

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.580 

so<00:01:39.189> that<00:01:39.670> something<00:01:39.970> new<00:01:40.329> I<00:01:40.360> I<00:01:40.780> never<00:01:41.290> had

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
so that something new I I never had

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:50.069 
so that something new I I never had
cleaned<00:01:43.829> my<00:01:44.829> float<00:01:45.130> needle<00:01:45.630> area<00:01:46.630> before<00:01:49.079> you

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
cleaned my float needle area before you

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.770 
cleaned my float needle area before you
know<00:01:50.200> I've<00:01:50.259> never<00:01:50.409> had<00:01:50.649> a<00:01:50.680> break<00:01:50.950> with

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
know I've never had a break with

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.289 
know I've never had a break with
gasoline<00:01:52.780> in<00:01:52.899> the<00:01:52.990> oil<00:01:53.200> before<00:01:53.789> so<00:01:54.789> this<00:01:55.000> must

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
gasoline in the oil before so this must

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.669 
gasoline in the oil before so this must
be<00:01:55.390> a<00:01:55.450> design<00:01:55.990> flaw<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:57.700> these<00:01:57.850> Kawasaki

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
be a design flaw with these Kawasaki

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:05.760 
be a design flaw with these Kawasaki
x500<00:01:59.679> I<00:02:01.740> looked<00:02:02.740> at<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:02.979> gas<00:02:03.189> tank<00:02:03.579> and<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
x500 I looked at the gas tank and the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.190 
x500 I looked at the gas tank and the
diaphragm<00:02:06.100> braking<00:02:06.850> on<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:07.420> fuel<00:02:07.659> pack<00:02:07.899> hack

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
diaphragm braking on the fuel pack hack

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.190 
diaphragm braking on the fuel pack hack
is<00:02:08.500> another<00:02:08.830> reason<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.429> have<00:02:09.519> fuel<00:02:09.819> in<00:02:10.200> your

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
is another reason to have fuel in your

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.440 
is another reason to have fuel in your
oil<00:02:11.500> I<00:02:13.230> put<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.620> tank<00:02:15.519> on<00:02:15.700> my<00:02:15.730> bench<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.390> I

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
oil I put the tank on my bench and I

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.170 
oil I put the tank on my bench and I
turn<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:17.019> on<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:18.090> no<00:02:19.090> gasoline<00:02:19.569> came<00:02:19.930> out<00:02:21.180> so

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
turn it on and no gasoline came out so

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.729 
turn it on and no gasoline came out so
I'm<00:02:22.239> focusing<00:02:22.720> on<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.959> carburetors<00:02:23.500> right

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
I'm focusing on the carburetors right

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.160 
I'm focusing on the carburetors right
now

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.650 

so<00:02:29.710> alright<00:02:30.160> if<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.580> have<00:02:30.610> rust<00:02:31.420> in<00:02:31.630> your

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
so alright if you have rust in your

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.590 
so alright if you have rust in your
footballs<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:33.760> would<00:02:33.880> probably<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.330> good<00:02:34.480> idea

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
footballs it would probably a good idea

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.380 
footballs it would probably a good idea
to<00:02:36.450> pull<00:02:37.450> your<00:02:37.660> float<00:02:38.470> needle<00:02:38.680> out<00:02:39.270> blow<00:02:40.270> it

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
to pull your float needle out blow it

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.260 
to pull your float needle out blow it
out<00:02:40.480> with<00:02:40.540> some<00:02:41.910> carburetor<00:02:42.910> cleaner<00:02:45.270> don't

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
out with some carburetor cleaner don't

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.600 
out with some carburetor cleaner don't
soak<00:02:46.630> your<00:02:46.780> carburetors<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:47.380> a<00:02:47.890> big<00:02:48.280> deal<00:02:48.490> on

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
soak your carburetors and a big deal on

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.280 
soak your carburetors and a big deal on
the<00:02:48.640> carburetor<00:02:49.090> cleaner<00:02:49.300> because<00:02:49.660> I<00:02:49.840> melted

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
the carburetor cleaner because I melted

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.280 
the carburetor cleaner because I melted
plastic<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:52.209> here<00:02:52.420> you're<00:02:52.600> just<00:02:52.630> spraying<00:02:53.140> it

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
plastic so here you're just spraying it

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.070 
plastic so here you're just spraying it
out<00:02:53.440> spring<00:02:53.890> out<00:02:54.040> your<00:02:54.160> carburetors<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.080> it

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
out spring out your carburetors and it

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.190 
out spring out your carburetors and it
evaporates<00:02:56.739> it's<00:02:56.950> not<00:02:57.130> sitting<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.810> pin

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
evaporates it's not sitting so the pin

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.610 
evaporates it's not sitting so the pin
that<00:03:02.350> holds<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.830> flow<00:03:03.250> then<00:03:04.320> you<00:03:05.320> can<00:03:05.470> just

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
that holds the flow then you can just

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.760 
that holds the flow then you can just
push<00:03:05.830> it<00:03:05.980> out<00:03:06.070> with<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:07.230> small<00:03:08.230> nail

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.550 

okay
