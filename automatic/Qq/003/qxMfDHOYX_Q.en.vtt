00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.750
 this time we tried the most option 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.910
 adventurous of the a4 avant range based on 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.710
 this family version had launched the 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.449
 a4 allroad although at the beginning I could 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.949
 appear after thoroughly studying the 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.840
 characteristics of the new a4 allroad 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.220
 this is not just an operation of 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.890
 marketing for which they have painted 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.510
 war an a4 avant if it is true that no 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.460
 has pneumatic suspensions like 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.190
 the 6 all road or descent control 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.290
 in slope but if it is 180 millimeters more 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.750
 higher than the avant when mounting springs more 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.940
 trains and rims 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.500
 filming are 20 millimeters wider and 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.329
 has the body reinforced with 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.010
 structural adhesive is also what 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.590
 we see wheel arches protected by 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.210
 plastic moldings heel and a new 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.910
 cover casing and angle guard 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.440
 output both steel plus all the 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.780
 low are fair improving the 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.880
 Aerodynamic inside the a4 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.890
 allroad little or nothing the difference of a4 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.810
 avant from which derives materials and 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.850
 High quality dashboard settings 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.050
 oriented 8 degrees towards the driver and 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.630
 there is not much space for passengers 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.940
 of the rear seats and from this year 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.530
 The multifunction screen is in color 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.150
 Series under the hood mounts the same engine 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.520
 that we already know about other models of 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.670
 volkswagen group is about the 2.0 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.049
 and in its variant of 143 horses it is 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.399
 fed by direct injection by 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.039
 common rail with an injection pressure 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.200
 of 1,800 8-hole injector bars 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.240
 Variable geometry turbo e 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.890
 intercooler that only is 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.940
 associated with the 6-speed manual gearbox 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.950
 up to the controls of the a4 allroad 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.690
 from the beginning you can see the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.880
 isolation and good work from 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.160
 suspensions and allows us to circulate 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.560
 even on bumpy roads with 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.940
 total comfort your address is shown 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.410
 accurate 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.510
 and is accompanied with a gearbox 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.040
 also very very fast operation 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.600
 and precise and the only thing we can take 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.760
 of less is a little push force 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.650
 on the part of the engine the all road 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.050
 associated with 4 asymmetric attraction 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.390
 dynamic by which it is distributed in 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.070
 normal conditions 60 percent of 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.470
 the force of the engine to the rear axle and the 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.690
 40 to the front but is capable of 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.330
 distribute this force until delivering the 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.160
 85 percent to the back and up to 65 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.260
 to the forward this gives a 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.060
 much sportier behavior and 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.770
 in addition the spd has function to a 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.270
 road that identifies the terrain 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.070
 that we circulate and allows a greater 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.450
 skid wheels always 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.470
 maintaining safety criteria 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.470
 of the s &amp; p 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.260
 here the a4 allroad test is a 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.180
 car that combines good behavior 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.920
 on the road with good certain 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.020
 mischief views that we can make out 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.900
 of it are three thousand euros more than 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.550
 difference with respect to the 4 normal and 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.160
 it depends on each one the use that 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.520
 go to give the car if you are interested or not 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.520
 I the truth
