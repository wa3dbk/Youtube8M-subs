00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.070 

yeah<00:00:27.920> I<00:00:28.029> definitely<00:00:29.029> think<00:00:29.210> it's<00:00:29.960> a

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
yeah I definitely think it's a

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.409 
yeah I definitely think it's a
possibility<00:00:30.529> especially<00:00:31.430> if<00:00:32.060> you<00:00:32.150> didn't

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
possibility especially if you didn't

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.780 
possibility especially if you didn't
have<00:00:32.540> any<00:00:32.689> other<00:00:32.989> options<00:00:33.950> to<00:00:34.250> it<00:00:34.460> you<00:00:34.580> drop

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
have any other options to it you drop

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.619 
have any other options to it you drop
your<00:00:35.000> wheelchair<00:00:35.480> I<00:00:35.750> mean<00:00:36.410> I<00:00:36.680> wouldn't<00:00:37.489> go<00:00:37.629> 120

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
your wheelchair I mean I wouldn't go 120

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.290 
your wheelchair I mean I wouldn't go 120
with<00:00:38.809> the<00:00:38.960> same<00:00:39.230> thing<00:00:39.650> but<00:00:40.010> if<00:00:40.760> it's<00:00:41.120> your

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
with the same thing but if it's your

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.000 
with the same thing but if it's your
only<00:00:41.449> option<00:00:41.570> to<00:00:42.110> drive<00:00:42.320> your<00:00:42.530> wheelchair

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
only option to drive your wheelchair

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.979 
only option to drive your wheelchair
it's<00:00:43.220> definitely<00:00:43.940> a<00:00:43.970> possibility<00:00:46.780> I'm<00:00:47.780> using

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
it's definitely a possibility I'm using

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.920 
it's definitely a possibility I'm using
eye<00:00:48.440> tracker<00:00:48.770> here<00:00:49.040> too<00:00:49.370> remote<00:00:50.120> to<00:00:50.180> control<00:00:50.300> a

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
eye tracker here too remote to control a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.270 
eye tracker here too remote to control a
robot<00:00:52.150> the<00:00:53.150> idea<00:00:53.449> here<00:00:53.870> is<00:00:53.989> to<00:00:54.019> map<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.470> view

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
robot the idea here is to map the view

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.670 
robot the idea here is to map the view
of<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.610> robot<00:00:55.970> onto<00:00:56.780> my<00:00:56.960> control<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:57.559> we

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
of the robot onto my control so we

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.189 
of the robot onto my control so we
simply<00:00:57.979> look<00:00:58.190> at<00:00:58.370> different<00:00:59.330> things<00:00:59.510> in<00:00:59.930> image

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
simply look at different things in image

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.500 
simply look at different things in image
and<00:01:00.470> the<00:01:00.680> robot<00:01:01.010> is<00:01:01.040> supposed<00:01:01.489> to<00:01:01.610> navigate<00:01:02.120> to

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
and the robot is supposed to navigate to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.140 
and the robot is supposed to navigate to
those<00:01:02.690> points<00:01:03.489> to<00:01:04.489> use<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.790> eye<00:01:04.820> tracker

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
those points to use the eye tracker

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.830 
those points to use the eye tracker
first<00:01:05.479> I'm<00:01:05.630> going<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.810> perform<00:01:06.350> a<00:01:06.650> calibration

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
first I'm going to perform a calibration

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.450 
first I'm going to perform a calibration
this<00:01:08.840> is<00:01:09.049> done<00:01:09.320> by<00:01:10.180> see<00:01:11.590> that<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:13.100> eye<00:01:13.130> track

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
this is done by see that the eye track

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.330 
this is done by see that the eye track
is<00:01:13.580> tracking<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.060> position<00:01:14.479> of<00:01:14.630> my<00:01:15.049> pupil

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.620 

and

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.800 

now<00:01:23.140> I<00:01:23.650> need<00:01:24.070> to<00:01:24.460> perform<00:01:24.790> a<00:01:25.240> calibration

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
now I need to perform a calibration

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.410 
now I need to perform a calibration
against<00:01:26.259> the<00:01:26.320> screen

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.899 

and<00:01:30.870> this<00:01:31.020> way<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.440> computer<00:01:31.860> will<00:01:32.190> be<00:01:32.430> aware

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
and this way the computer will be aware

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.800 
and this way the computer will be aware
of<00:01:33.229> what<00:01:34.229> pixel<00:01:34.710> um<00:01:34.860> fixating<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.000> screen

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.840 

and<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.560> information<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.400> use<00:01:41.430> to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
and this information we can use to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.080 
and this information we can use to
control<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.450> robots<00:01:43.250> they're<00:01:44.250> gonna<00:01:44.430> say<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
control the robots they're gonna say the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.620 
control the robots they're gonna say the
eye<00:01:45.119> trackers<00:01:45.720> registering<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:47.540> where<00:01:48.540> I'm

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
eye trackers registering it where I'm

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.480 
eye trackers registering it where I'm
looking<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.640> now<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.700> need<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.270> start<00:01:51.570> up<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
looking and now we need to start up the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:02.960 
looking and now we need to start up the
application

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.800 

now<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.030> frame<00:02:04.570> rate<00:02:04.780> here<00:02:05.049> is<00:02:05.380> quite<00:02:06.189> bad<00:02:06.810> but

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
now the frame rate here is quite bad but

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.490 
now the frame rate here is quite bad but
it<00:02:07.930> proves<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.350> concept<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:10.090> can<00:02:10.390> look<00:02:11.319> in

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
it proves the concept that I can look in

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.500 
it proves the concept that I can look in
different<00:02:11.620> directions<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.910> robots<00:02:13.360> will

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
different directions and the robots will

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:30.040 
different directions and the robots will
drive<00:02:14.260> there

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.670 

yes<00:02:31.050> so<00:02:31.890> this<00:02:32.070> is<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.640> prototype<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.300> robot<00:02:34.170> that

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
yes so this is a prototype of robot that

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.580 
yes so this is a prototype of robot that
can<00:02:34.890> be<00:02:35.100> controlled<00:02:35.790> by<00:02:35.940> my<00:02:36.330> eyes<00:02:36.540> it's<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.380> very

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
can be controlled by my eyes it's a very

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.940 
can be controlled by my eyes it's a very
simple<00:02:37.940> system<00:02:38.940> been<00:02:39.390> tough<00:02:39.630> on<00:02:39.840> on<00:02:40.440> Lego

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950

and<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:10.470> video<00:03:10.710> stands<00:03:11.100> here<00:03:11.490> because<00:03:12.240> it

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
and the video stands here because it

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.050 
and the video stands here because it
needs<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.380> have<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.530> wide<00:03:14.190> angle<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.970> be

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
needs to to to have a wide angle to be

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.750 
needs to to to have a wide angle to be
able<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.270> see<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.690> wheels<00:03:15.930> there<00:03:16.890> because

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
able to see the wheels there because

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.410 
able to see the wheels there because
this<00:03:18.420> gives<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.780> very<00:03:18.810> good<00:03:19.050> feedback<00:03:19.740> on<00:03:20.420> and

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
this gives a very good feedback on and

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.570 
this gives a very good feedback on and
which<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.050> important<00:03:22.500> when<00:03:22.980> driving<00:03:23.310> the
