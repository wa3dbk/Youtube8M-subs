00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:58.069 
pull it through sex it was the remix and

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:59.919 
pull it through sex it was the remix and
since<00:00:58.249> it<00:00:58.429> was<00:00:58.579> Lady<00:00:58.850> Gaga<00:00:59.239> on<00:00:59.299> the<00:00:59.420> tray<00:00:59.659> and

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
since it was Lady Gaga on the tray and

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.420 
since it was Lady Gaga on the tray and
it<00:01:00.139> really<00:01:00.469> cared<00:01:00.829> a<00:01:00.920> lot<00:01:01.010> of<00:01:01.159> attention<00:01:01.729> and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
it really cared a lot of attention and

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.070 
it really cared a lot of attention and
just<00:01:04.430> to<00:01:04.610> question<00:01:05.059> myself<00:01:05.210> okay<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:05.900> wasn't

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
with the video um I always say it was

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.670 
with the video um I always say it was

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
predicted that that it was gonna be a

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.830 
predicted that that it was gonna be a
bad<00:01:12.860> video<00:01:13.070> might<00:01:13.400> say<00:01:13.700> that<00:01:13.730> we<00:01:14.600> speak

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840

negative like that what I will say is

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.450 
negative like that what I will say is
that<00:01:17.030> they<00:01:17.600> could<00:01:17.840> have<00:01:17.930> done<00:01:18.250> so<00:01:19.250> many

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460
