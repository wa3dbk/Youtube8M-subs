pushing<00:02:33.639> it<00:02:33.760> up<00:02:33.999> in<00:02:34.269> there<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:35.459> make<00:02:36.459> it<00:02:36.519> a

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
pushing it up in there to make it a

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.649 
pushing it up in there to make it a
little<00:02:36.939> tighter<00:02:40.980> it's<00:02:41.980> okay<00:02:42.340> if<00:02:42.730> it's<00:02:43.030> not<00:02:43.209> all

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
little tighter it's okay if it's not all

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.809 
little tighter it's okay if it's not all
nice<00:02:44.079> and<00:02:44.349> smooth<00:02:44.650> right<00:02:44.889> here<00:02:45.129> it<00:02:45.639> actually

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
nice and smooth right here it actually

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.569 
nice and smooth right here it actually
looks<00:02:46.269> better<00:02:46.389> when<00:02:46.780> it's<00:02:46.959> not<00:02:47.200> okay<00:02:48.040> so<00:02:48.069> then

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
looks better when it's not okay so then

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.539 
looks better when it's not okay so then
we<00:02:48.669> do<00:02:48.819> that<00:02:49.650> you've<00:02:50.650> got<00:02:50.739> all<00:02:50.859> the<00:02:51.010> angles<00:02:51.129> we

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
we do that you've got all the angles we

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.720 
we do that you've got all the angles we
need<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.959> then<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.590> will<00:02:54.099> need

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
need and then you will need

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.229 
need and then you will need
yes<00:02:55.419> it's<00:02:55.750> very<00:02:55.810> necessary<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:57.040> pin<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:58.000> down

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
yes it's very necessary to pin it down

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.000 
yes it's very necessary to pin it down
otherwise<00:02:59.109> it<00:02:59.439> will<00:02:59.620> bob<00:02:59.919> up<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.489> down<00:03:00.609> and

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
otherwise it will bob up and down and

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.860 
otherwise it will bob up and down and
distract<00:03:03.010> everyone<00:03:03.609> watching<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.329> distract
