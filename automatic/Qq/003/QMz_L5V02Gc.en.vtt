woofer is made of Kevlar which is a
light<00:01:03.090> stiff<00:01:03.600> material<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.350> let's<00:01:04.589> go<00:01:04.769> for

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
light stiff material so let's go for

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.609 
light stiff material so let's go for
move<00:01:05.309> without<00:01:05.580> flexing<00:01:06.299> right<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.869> if<00:01:07.439> you

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
move without flexing right and if you

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
got a little bit of damping ring right

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.660 
got a little bit of damping ring right
and<00:01:18.060> then<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.659> sort<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.560> steer<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.250> high

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
and then to sort of steer the high

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.179 
and then to sort of steer the high
frequencies<00:01:21.330> from<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.659> speaker<00:01:22.080> take<00:01:22.979> hold

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
frequencies from the speaker take hold

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.960 
frequencies from the speaker take hold
of<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.759> try<00:01:23.970> swiveling<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:25.909> so<00:01:26.909> you

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
of this and just try swiveling it so you

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.480 
of this and just try swiveling it so you
can<00:01:27.150> actually<00:01:27.299> aim<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.200> tweeter<00:01:28.799> toward<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
can actually aim the tweeter toward the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.270 
can actually aim the tweeter toward the
listener<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> so-called<00:01:31.439> dogleg

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
listener this is a so-called dogleg

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.310 
listener this is a so-called dogleg
clamp<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.060> what<00:01:33.270> you're<00:01:33.420> seeing<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.960> really

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
clamp and what you're seeing is really

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.499 
clamp and what you're seeing is really
the<00:01:34.500> ceilings<00:01:35.040> eye<00:01:35.280> view<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.670> what's<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.240> on

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the ceilings eye view of what's going on

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.590 
the ceilings eye view of what's going on
when<00:01:37.320> an<00:01:37.470> installer<00:01:37.950> from<00:01:38.310> down<00:01:38.490> below<00:01:38.850> is

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
when an installer from down below is

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.870 
when an installer from down below is
fastening<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> speaker<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.770> place<00:01:40.979> now<00:01:41.700> watch

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
fastening the speaker in place now watch

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.399 
fastening the speaker in place now watch
what<00:01:42.060> happens<00:01:42.119> when<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.170> start

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
what happens when the you start

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.330 
what happens when the you start
tightening<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.340> screw

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
tightening the screw

tightening the screw
the<00:01:46.760> leg<00:01:46.970> moves<00:01:47.299> over<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:48.200> that<00:01:48.380> rides<00:01:48.680> down

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
the leg moves over and that rides down

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.310 
the leg moves over and that rides down
the<00:01:49.159> little<00:01:49.400> slot<00:01:52.720> until<00:01:53.720> it's<00:01:53.869> cinched<00:01:54.260> down

the little slot until it's cinched down

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.530 
the little slot until it's cinched down
firmly<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.700> this<00:01:55.940> is<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.090> kind<00:01:56.509> of

ensuing speaker that that's right I am I

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.740 
ensuing speaker that that's right I am I
often<00:02:00.830> compare<00:02:01.210> general-purpose<00:02:02.210> speakers

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
often compare general-purpose speakers

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.660 
often compare general-purpose speakers
to<00:02:02.960> recessed<00:02:03.380> ceiling<00:02:03.800> lines<00:02:04.220> that's<00:02:04.460> where

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
to recessed ceiling lines that's where

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.090 
to recessed ceiling lines that's where
the<00:02:04.820> idea<00:02:05.119> is<00:02:05.330> that<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:06.290> speaker<00:02:06.649> is<00:02:06.680> largely

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
the idea is that the speaker is largely

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.460 
the idea is that the speaker is largely
invisible<00:02:07.550> and<00:02:08.270> it<00:02:08.630> just<00:02:08.840> creates<00:02:09.140> a<00:02:09.259> nice

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
invisible and it just creates a nice

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.000 
invisible and it just creates a nice
even<00:02:10.160> pool<00:02:10.489> of<00:02:10.789> sound<00:02:11.090> from<00:02:11.540> above<00:02:11.630> so<00:02:12.319> this<00:02:12.860> is

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
even pool of sound from above so this is

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.229 
even pool of sound from above so this is
not<00:02:13.160> what<00:02:13.400> you'd<00:02:13.520> want<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.730> use<00:02:13.880> if<00:02:14.000> you're<00:02:14.120> a

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
not what you'd want to use if you're a

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.229 
not what you'd want to use if you're a
really<00:02:14.569> serious<00:02:14.930> home<00:02:15.410> theater<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:16.030> would<00:02:17.030> say

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
really serious home theater I would say

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.660 
really serious home theater I would say
no<00:02:17.450> not<00:02:18.050> that<00:02:18.200> it's<00:02:18.380> some<00:02:18.620> quality<00:02:19.160> isn't<00:02:19.489> good

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
no not that it's some quality isn't good

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.870 
no not that it's some quality isn't good
enough<00:02:19.700> but<00:02:20.300> with<00:02:20.750> home<00:02:20.959> theater<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:22.190> spatial

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
enough but with home theater the spatial

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.970 
enough but with home theater the spatial
aspects<00:02:23.420> of<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.720> sound<00:02:23.930> where<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.320> effects

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
the illusion that the sound didn't come

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.590 
the illusion that the sound didn't come
from<00:02:57.560> up<00:02:57.769> above<00:02:57.920> but<00:02:58.489> rather<00:02:58.940> that<00:02:59.269> it<00:02:59.390> came

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
from up above but rather that it came

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.900 
from up above but rather that it came
from<00:02:59.630> either<00:03:00.170> level<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:01.130> one<00:03:01.519> of<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.700> things

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
from either level and one of the things

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.789 
from either level and one of the things
that<00:03:02.060> really<00:03:02.269> floored<00:03:02.600> me<00:03:02.690> when<00:03:03.140> we<00:03:03.290> tested

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
that really floored me when we tested
