00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
what I'm thinking like a SAS sort of

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.629 
what I'm thinking like a SAS sort of
army<00:06:04.139> guy<00:06:04.259> jumper<00:06:04.680> boot<00:06:04.800> half<00:06:04.979> and<00:06:05.250> then<00:06:05.370> had

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 
army guy jumper boot half and then had

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.260 
army guy jumper boot half and then had
these<00:06:05.900> sort<00:06:06.900> of<00:06:07.020> leather<00:06:07.379> patches<00:06:08.039> and<00:06:08.610> that

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
these sort of leather patches and that

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:16.459 
these sort of leather patches and that
is<00:06:09.419> really<00:06:10.020> really<00:06:10.409> cool<00:06:12.050> it's<00:06:13.050> awesome<00:06:15.469> I'm

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:16.469 
is really really cool it's awesome I'm

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.089 
is really really cool it's awesome I'm
really<00:06:16.530> impressed<00:06:16.979> is<00:06:17.250> really<00:06:18.919> good<00:06:19.919> a<00:06:19.949> bit

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
really impressed is really good a bit

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:25.640 
really impressed is really good a bit
back<00:06:21.800> it's<00:06:22.800> really<00:06:22.949> different<00:06:23.639> from<00:06:24.650> my

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
back it's really different from my

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.869 
back it's really different from my
custom<00:06:26.360> and<00:06:27.360> my<00:06:27.599> customizing<00:06:28.349> style<00:06:28.680> so<00:06:29.669> it's

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:29.879 
custom and my customizing style so it's

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.300 
custom and my customizing style so it's
just<00:06:30.030> fascinating<00:06:30.419> to<00:06:31.139> see<00:06:31.349> someone<00:06:32.009> else's

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
just fascinating to see someone else's

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.459 
just fascinating to see someone else's
approach<00:06:33.150> to<00:06:33.419> character<00:06:33.750> my<00:06:34.050> approach<00:06:34.319> would

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:34.469 
approach to character my approach would

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:38.809 
approach to character my approach would
have<00:06:34.530> been<00:06:34.650> purely<00:06:35.099> sculpted<00:06:35.819> and<00:06:37.490> and<00:06:38.490> I

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:38.819 
have been purely sculpted and and I

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:41.390 
have been purely sculpted and and I
probably<00:06:39.120> would<00:06:39.360> have<00:06:39.389> went<00:06:39.690> with<00:06:39.860> more<00:06:40.860> one

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
probably would have went with more one

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.330 
probably would have went with more one
of<00:06:41.430> his<00:06:41.639> more<00:06:41.849> super<00:06:42.680> villainous<00:06:43.680> or<00:06:44.009> you<00:06:44.250> know

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
of his more super villainous or you know

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.610 
of his more super villainous or you know
they<00:06:44.490> guess<00:06:44.969> the<00:06:45.360> really<00:06:45.569> pink<00:06:45.930> outfit<00:06:46.469> with

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
they guess the really pink outfit with

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.279 
they guess the really pink outfit with
the<00:06:46.830> the<00:06:47.699> airman<00:06:48.150> trim<00:06:48.509> all<00:06:48.750> around<00:06:48.779> it<00:06:49.199> and

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:49.289 
the the airman trim all around it and

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:50.689 
the the airman trim all around it and
stuff<00:06:49.529> I<00:06:49.710> would<00:06:49.770> have<00:06:49.949> gone<00:06:50.099> for<00:06:50.340> that<00:06:50.490> and

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699 
stuff I would have gone for that and

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:53.209 
stuff I would have gone for that and
it's<00:06:50.819> just<00:06:51.060> so<00:06:51.330> interesting<00:06:51.779> to<00:06:52.199> see<00:06:52.439> this

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:53.219
