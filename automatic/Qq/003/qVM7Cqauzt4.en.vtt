00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
this is a very very batch print-friendly

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.670 
this is a very very batch print-friendly
service<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.799> couple<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:21.079> advantages<00:01:22.079> in

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
service a couple of advantages in

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.649 
service a couple of advantages in
addition<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.400> being<00:01:23.640> able<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.909> print<00:01:24.150> cleanly

addition to being able to print cleanly
over<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:25.110> zipper<00:01:25.470> because<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.400> zipper<00:01:26.610> is

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
over this zipper because the zipper is

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.760 
over this zipper because the zipper is
now<00:01:27.000> located<00:01:27.480> into<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.260> slot

now located into the slot

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.190 
now located into the slot
you're<00:01:29.430> able<00:01:29.580> to<00:01:29.850> accomplish<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.780> print<00:01:31.140> that

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
you're able to accomplish a print that

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.410 
you're able to accomplish a print that
falls<00:01:31.530> exactly<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> same<00:01:32.520> place<00:01:32.730> every

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
falls exactly in the same place every

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.510 
falls exactly in the same place every
single<00:01:33.840> time<00:01:34.020> that's<00:01:34.650> very<00:01:34.740> important<00:01:35.400> when

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
single time that's very important when

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.490 
single time that's very important when
you<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> center<00:01:36.420> line<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:37.320> down<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
you have a center line going down the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.980 
you have a center line going down the
garment<00:01:38.010> because<00:01:38.490> when<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.060> print<00:01:39.479> comes<00:01:39.720> out

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
garment because when the print comes out

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.690 
garment because when the print comes out
of<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.170> position<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.370> center

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
of the position and you have a center

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.790 
of the position and you have a center
line<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.450> very<00:01:42.570> obvious<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> print<00:01:43.710> is
