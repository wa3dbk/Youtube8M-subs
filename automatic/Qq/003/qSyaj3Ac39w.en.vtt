which<00:04:40.570> is<00:04:40.599> a<00:04:41.340> more<00:04:42.340> robust<00:04:42.669> and<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:42.940> thought<00:04:43.210> of

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
which is a more robust and I thought of

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.779 
which is a more robust and I thought of
the<00:04:43.660> truth<00:04:44.349> there's<00:04:44.770> a<00:04:44.889> lot<00:04:45.070> of<00:04:45.220> options<00:04:45.460> I

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
the truth there's a lot of options I

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.089 
the truth there's a lot of options I
mess<00:04:45.940> with<00:04:45.970> lots<00:04:46.630> of<00:04:46.780> clips<00:04:46.960> you<00:04:47.139> can<00:04:47.289> save<00:04:47.530> and

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
mess with lots of clips you can save and

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.860 
mess with lots of clips you can save and
they're<00:04:48.340> not<00:04:48.520> there's<00:04:48.910> a<00:04:49.030> full<00:04:49.330> editor<00:04:49.690> where

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
they're not there's a full editor where

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.180 
they're not there's a full editor where
you<00:04:49.900> can<00:04:49.990> actually<00:04:50.199> join<00:04:50.560> those<00:04:50.740> clip<00:04:51.009> later

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
you can actually join those clip later

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.520 
you can actually join those clip later
on<00:04:51.430> and<00:04:51.699> trim<00:04:51.880> them<00:04:51.970> down<00:04:52.030> to<00:04:53.020> create<00:04:53.289> your<00:04:53.440> own

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
on and trim them down to create your own

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.700 
on and trim them down to create your own
little<00:04:53.770> movie<00:04:54.669> if<00:04:54.910> you<00:04:55.090> will<00:04:55.270> and<00:04:55.900> then<00:04:56.080> after

little movie if you will and then after
you're<00:04:56.800> done<00:04:56.889> with<00:04:57.099> that<00:04:57.130> you<00:04:57.490> can<00:04:57.699> transfer

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
you're done with that you can transfer

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.860 
you're done with that you can transfer
it<00:04:58.210> to<00:04:58.509> a<00:04:59.289> memory<00:04:59.800> card<00:05:00.070> and/or<00:05:00.520> a<00:05:01.150> portable

you want so definitely a lot more a lot

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.890 
you want so definitely a lot more a lot
more<00:05:09.639> functions<00:05:10.240> I<00:05:10.330> thought<00:05:10.570> there<00:05:10.750> would<00:05:10.870> be

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
more functions I thought there would be

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.800 
more functions I thought there would be
with<00:05:11.560> that<00:05:11.680> software<00:05:12.099> now<00:05:12.759> you<00:05:12.820> you<00:05:13.449> know<00:05:13.570> you

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
with that software now you you know you

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:14.969 
with that software now you you know you
were<00:05:13.900> just<00:05:14.050> talking<00:05:14.320> about<00:05:14.410> the<00:05:14.590> export

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
were just talking about the export

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.529 
were just talking about the export
feature<00:05:15.099> one<00:05:15.669> thing<00:05:15.880> that<00:05:16.000> I<00:05:16.030> think<00:05:16.150> is<00:05:16.360> gonna

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
feature one thing that I think is gonna

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:17.999 
feature one thing that I think is gonna
really<00:05:16.960> come<00:05:17.199> into<00:05:17.289> place<00:05:17.530> when<00:05:17.889> our

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
really come into place when our

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.279 
really come into place when our
PlayStation<00:05:18.490> Home<00:05:18.849> comes<00:05:19.150> out<00:05:19.389> you're

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
PlayStation Home comes out you're

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:21.330 
PlayStation Home comes out you're
probably<00:05:20.500> gonna<00:05:20.800> be<00:05:20.949> able<00:05:21.009> to<00:05:21.190> actually

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
probably gonna be able to actually

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.240 
probably gonna be able to actually
export<00:05:21.970> your<00:05:22.120> things<00:05:22.389> to<00:05:23.050> the<00:05:23.289> files<00:05:23.889> like<00:05:24.220> you

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
export your things to the files like you

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.760 
export your things to the files like you
said<00:05:24.520> over<00:05:24.789> on<00:05:25.090> your<00:05:25.300> ps3<00:05:25.570> but<00:05:26.380> then<00:05:26.500> in<00:05:26.650> your

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
said over on your ps3 but then in your

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.740 
said over on your ps3 but then in your
home<00:05:26.979> it'd<00:05:27.220> probably<00:05:27.820> be<00:05:28.030> able<00:05:28.180> to<00:05:28.389> share<00:05:28.630> it

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
home it'd probably be able to share it

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.240 
home it'd probably be able to share it
at<00:05:28.930> your<00:05:29.169> playstation<00:05:29.650> home<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:30.009> have<00:05:30.099> it

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
that's just gonna be just really so kick

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.520 
that's just gonna be just really so kick

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.920 
send out video messages unfortunately
right<00:05:42.280> now<00:05:42.490> we<00:05:42.550> can't<00:05:42.880> do<00:05:43.030> that<00:05:43.240> maybe<00:05:43.630> at<00:05:43.900> a

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
right now we can't do that maybe at a

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.960 
right now we can't do that maybe at a
future<00:05:44.349> update<00:05:44.680> we<00:05:45.220> can<00:05:45.340> see<00:05:45.520> something<00:05:45.849> like

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
future update we can see something like

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.560 
future update we can see something like
that<00:05:46.180> coming<00:05:46.419> into<00:05:46.630> play<00:05:46.900> yeah<00:05:47.800> yeah<00:05:48.370> or<00:05:49.330> maybe

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
that coming into play yeah yeah or maybe

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.330 
that coming into play yeah yeah or maybe
they've<00:05:49.900> been<00:05:49.930> you<00:05:50.199> know<00:05:50.229> maybe<00:05:50.860> they<00:05:51.039> started

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
they've been you know maybe they started

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.610 
they've been you know maybe they started
using<00:05:51.490> it<00:05:51.669> you<00:05:51.729> know<00:05:51.909> most<00:05:52.210> yeah<00:05:52.990> yeah<00:05:53.440> that

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
using it you know most yeah yeah that

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.610 
using it you know most yeah yeah that
would<00:05:53.740> be<00:05:53.770> bad<00:05:54.389> but<00:05:55.389> I<00:05:55.449> mean<00:05:55.719> maybe<00:05:56.229> later<00:05:56.560> on

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
would be bad but I mean maybe later on

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.020 
would be bad but I mean maybe later on
we<00:05:56.889> can<00:05:56.979> also<00:05:57.130> see<00:05:57.400> things<00:05:57.580> like<00:05:57.729> bake
