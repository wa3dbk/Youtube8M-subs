00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.519
 hello everyone I'm a doctor in lighthouse 60 and 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.260
 let's configure link from scratch 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.460
 the first thing we are going to put the ip of 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.460
 console in manual mode 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.480
 we are going to put a fixed ip 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.400
 but we're not going to setup the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.210
 system to networks that then load cable 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.699
 or the wifi network 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.699
 I do not know what happens 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.980
 edicta ip configuration and we put you 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.980
 in manuals 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.310
 an attentive we put one of s &amp; p that 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.310
 we want to put in my case the one of 9 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.820
 we accept it we give it to ready and 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.770
 we restart the console 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.320
 here now we are going to open the ports of 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.950
 link in the router so we access the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.829
 router web that would be one of 2.16's 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.710
 point 1.1 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.720
 we will say the points that we have put to 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.760
 the contraction of ine series ones are 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.600
 3 71 and 3 thousand 72 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.600
 good inside the uterus 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.070
 we give to atlanta 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.469
 and in advance because we will give 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.469
 to the app 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.570
 inside in the we will access to habitual 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:36.070
 servet in the case of router and you 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.070
 we will add to add 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.010
 The custom will be replaced by a name 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.170
 that we want but in this case link 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.560
 and below we put the one of felipe of the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.560
 console 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.520
 the protocol we put it in 13 pvda already 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.920
 that we will write the port of lines 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.710
 example the same case the 3 thousand 71 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.630
 and the 3 thousand 72 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.630
 and we give him to save 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.940
 I told you that if we have two consoles 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.100
 with the gh 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.380
 judy lin that we put in each one 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.630
 two different ports so in this case 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.750
 was 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.530
 3000 79 thousand 72 then the other as solar 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.230
 it should be 3000 73 and 74 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.370
 here we will go to plateau 2 and problem of 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.250
 injury and pep of comfort 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.599
 pot come with you and you have 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.430
 that there were ports directly 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.860
 in my case there are times that you really like that 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.959
 that the envelopes of the two sites in 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.959
 virtual server and in mz post 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.280
 we keep the changes 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:57.650
 We arrived to register on the page 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.650
 link point j jq 360 pointcom 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.560
 and the inside of here because we are going to create 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.560
 our browser link account 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.770
 As you can see, press the button 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.040
 register free and here we put our 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.150
 name the user our email and 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.960
 problems that put twice the 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.420
 password 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:26.060
 the insurance the question 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.060
 you have to put team fsb and you'll see 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.610
 but for such a body an account 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.610
 new apart from the one that I have 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.189
 good is the problem the web 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.280
 What's up 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.420
 nothing like that where he died 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.420
 now is the email 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.350
 in a few days the web of link little one 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.090
 novel is logical are they are being 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:17.450
 updating the improving it 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:21.109
 etc so they should 5 no failure 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:24.750
 the team in our account is 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.730
 and the security issue we will have to 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.889
 put this phrase 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.650
 has fsb we give you to register 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.590
 and in theory we are already registered 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.629
 we have to go to our mail later 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.629
 and confirm our account 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.270
 Well now we will turn to the expression 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.100
 of three 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.970
 and activate in our link account 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.970
 inside the console 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.490
 As you can see, there is a defection of 3 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.490
 to configurations 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.790
 and from a figurations and we're going to 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.430
 General configuration aj 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.770
 jq of 360 points we will put our 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.470
 email address and in our 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.920
