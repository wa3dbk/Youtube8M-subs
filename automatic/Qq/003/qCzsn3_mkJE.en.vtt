00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.760
 continues the process by 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.189
 It only feeds the fire.

 something 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.840
 is the concept of taking that little 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.600
 idea that small decision that you 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.450

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.030

 for that cause 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:06.120
 seeing the big picture at the end of the road 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.350
 to be absolutely the best and do not 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:13.590
 accommodate for reason is not talent is not 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:16.770
 the skill simply boils down to 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.570
 How hungry are you? What's your hunger? 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.790
 hunger for improvement 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.220

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.770
 success because you are willing to 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.560

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.930
 do they do not care for opinions of 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.190
 Third parties do not care how far 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.280
 have a not take days off them 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.230
 100% preparing their way and 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.020

 because all for the much greater purpose 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.070
 than any spark of happiness that 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.070
 an immediate bonus can 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.820
 achieve your goals 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:00.360
 this is pure blessing the greater the 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.690
 expectations higher but the goal 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.770
 this feeling is then amplified 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.490
 is the difference between you and them the 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.650
 professionals 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:16.040
 are those who are desirous of 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:21.530
 knock on the door of complete exhaustion 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:26.120
 every single day and let's define exhaustion 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:29.660
 to you exhaustion is that point where it is 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.830
 so painful that you can not 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.110
 force that point that hurts 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.290
 so much that you can not even think 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.370
 right is to get to that point that you 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:47.960
 You know you did absolutely everything to your 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.970
 Reach that there is nothing else that you 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.560
 could have done 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.660
 so how the difference between them and you? 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.770
 What are you doing at this stage of the 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.620
 your life 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.200
 ask if you are walking to 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.200
 closer to your goals or are you 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.620
 away from them you are hitting 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.410
 exhaust ports or is only 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.590
 uncomfortable know how to be uncomfortable 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.230
 it's not exhaustion being uncomfortable 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.620
 your mind giving up before the body 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.650
 being uncomfortable is giving up when 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.360
 I should try again 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.160
 achieving excellence happens when 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.810
 Are you going to do something that will? 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.260
 end up with you 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.150
 just to make you better from here because it's 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.700
 easier to buy tickets for a 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.280
 game to prepare for the game 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.500
 It's easier to have fun with your friends. 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.610
 than having fun in an hour in the 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.310
 stairways 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.470
 It is easier to sleep late than 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.320
 wake up to make one hundred running shots 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.150
 It's easier to go to a party than to do it. 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.360
 forced squats 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:01.440
 it's easier to watch athletes from the sofa 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.270
 be the guy behind the trophy but 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.570
 it is also much easier to look at 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.090
 back in your life and know that you gave 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.260
 all of you than to live thinking about what 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.240
 It could have been 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.460
 It's much easier not to waste your time. 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.200
 potential than to leave that burden on 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.020
 your shoulders for the rest of your life 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.730
 no one ever said that being successful 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:27.870
 It would be easy, but I'll tell you something. 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:30.870
 can you be sure it 's worth you? 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.030
 is its own creator of this history and 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.460
 there is no such business called failure 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:40.470
 You just need to tell yourself. 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:43.410
 no not this time with me but I will 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.240
 I'll try again and again and I'll go 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.790
 look for fault directly in the eyes 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.400
 and tell her that I'm willing to 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.550
 make every effort to 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.890
 Reach my goals 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.110
 because there is never any effort 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:01.430
 progress 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:05.720
 it all boils down to how much you want it 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:09.150
 How big is your appetite - 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:12.629
 Do you just want to snack or are you? 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:15.050
 starving so stay on the 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:18.800
 your goal remains targeted 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.800
 remain hungry
