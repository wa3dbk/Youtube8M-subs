cushion<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.430> what<00:03:23.120> are<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.269> variables<00:03:23.540> yeah

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
cushion and what are the variables yeah

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.750 
cushion and what are the variables yeah
so<00:03:24.260> on<00:03:24.500> this<00:03:24.680> one<00:03:24.859> has<00:03:25.070> a<00:03:25.100> little<00:03:25.310> broader

shoe that we're going to be releasing a

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.330 
shoe that we're going to be releasing a
little<00:03:33.109> bit<00:03:33.200> later<00:03:33.350> next<00:03:33.620> year<00:03:33.799> is<00:03:34.100> the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
little bit later next year is the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.030 
little bit later next year is the
provision<00:03:34.700> this<00:03:35.359> is<00:03:35.569> a<00:03:35.600> stability<00:03:36.440> version<00:03:36.950> of

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
provision this is a stability version of

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.170 
provision this is a stability version of
the<00:03:37.130> instinct<00:03:37.579> in<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.730> way<00:03:37.850> that<00:03:38.000> we<00:03:38.060> treat

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
the instinct in the way that we treat

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.440 
the instinct in the way that we treat
the<00:03:38.600> stability<00:03:39.109> here<00:03:39.910> is<00:03:40.910> through<00:03:41.420> a

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
the stability here is through a

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.430 
the stability here is through a
stability<00:03:42.019> wedge<00:03:42.530> so<00:03:43.489> this<00:03:43.670> is<00:03:43.700> called<00:03:44.000> a

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
stability wedge so this is called a

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.140 
stability wedge so this is called a
verra<00:03:45.440> singh<00:03:45.739> where<00:03:46.489> it's<00:03:46.639> been<00:03:46.910> on<00:03:47.120> the

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
verra singh where it's been on the

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.900 
verra singh where it's been on the
outside<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:48.590> it's<00:03:48.829> thick<00:03:49.040> on<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.340> inside<00:03:49.700> and

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
outside and it's thick on the inside and

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.660 
outside and it's thick on the inside and
this<00:03:50.090> this<00:03:50.540> insole<00:03:51.350> it<00:03:51.500> actually<00:03:51.829> goes<00:03:51.980> in<00:03:52.310> the

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
this this insole it actually goes in the

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.400 
this this insole it actually goes in the
shoe<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.150> create<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:53.630> support<00:03:54.109> so<00:03:54.230> rather

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
shoe to create that support so rather

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.349 
shoe to create that support so rather
than<00:03:54.620> using<00:03:54.799> rigidity<00:03:55.430> and<00:03:55.459> arch<00:03:55.850> support

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
than using rigidity and arch support

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.930 
than using rigidity and arch support
we're<00:03:56.930> able<00:03:57.109> to<00:03:57.560> keep<00:03:57.769> this<00:03:57.950> dish

make<00:05:29.180> a<00:05:29.210> little<00:05:29.419> bit<00:05:29.510> softer<00:05:29.870> a<00:05:29.900> little<00:05:29.930> bit

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
make a little bit softer a little bit

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.170 
make a little bit softer a little bit
less<00:05:30.290> protective<00:05:30.800> so<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:31.460> versatility<00:05:31.910> is

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
less protective so the versatility is

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.150 
less protective so the versatility is
there<00:05:32.419> the<00:05:33.080> innovations<00:05:33.590> there<00:05:33.800> this<00:05:34.010> is<00:05:34.130> a

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160
