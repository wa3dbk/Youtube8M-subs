00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
is to make a white cross something i

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.660 
is to make a white cross something i
look<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.500> speak<00:02:49.709> like<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:49.920> but<00:02:50.400> we're<00:02:50.580> going

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
look to speak like this but we're going

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.550 
look to speak like this but we're going
to<00:02:50.760> do<00:02:50.850> this<00:02:51.000> certain<00:02:51.330> way<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:52.200> ends

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
to do this certain way so that it ends

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.190 
to do this certain way so that it ends
up<00:02:52.820> correctly<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.880> have<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.630> have<00:02:57.810> four

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
up correctly so you have you have four

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.040 
up correctly so you have you have four
white<00:02:59.190> edges<00:02:59.640> around<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.970> yellow<00:03:00.180> Center<00:03:00.540> I'm

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
white edges around the yellow Center I'm

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.240

for me I have to see also a few minutes

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.310 
for me I have to see also a few minutes
off<00:03:25.470> just<00:03:25.769> keeping<00:03:26.600> perspective<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:28.170> you'll

chosens with the white through the

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.979 
chosens with the white through the
Greens<00:03:31.830> this<00:03:32.430> green<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:33.000> on<00:03:33.150> top<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.780> red

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
Greens this green is on top of the red

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.320 
Greens this green is on top of the red
soon<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:35.340> what<00:03:35.550> I<00:03:35.580> need<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.790> do<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.120> I'm<00:03:36.300> going

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
soon so what I need to do is I'm going

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.300 
soon so what I need to do is I'm going
to<00:03:36.480> rotate<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:37.080> top<00:03:37.320> and<00:03:37.650> when<00:03:37.800> I<00:03:37.830> rotate<00:03:38.160> the

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
to rotate the top and when I rotate the

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.979 
to rotate the top and when I rotate the
top<00:03:38.519> I'm<00:03:38.730> rotating<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.239> sign<00:03:39.420> is<00:03:39.540> parallel<00:03:39.959> to

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
top I'm rotating the sign is parallel to

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.140 
top I'm rotating the sign is parallel to
the<00:03:40.140> ceiling<00:03:40.459> so<00:03:41.459> I'm<00:03:41.550> going<00:03:41.580> to<00:03:41.700> rotate<00:03:41.850> the

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
the ceiling so I'm going to rotate the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.120 
the ceiling so I'm going to rotate the
top<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:42.570> you<00:03:42.630> notice<00:03:42.900> when<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.320> rotate<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.920> top

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
top and you notice when I rotate the top

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.580 
top and you notice when I rotate the top
these<00:03:44.790> these<00:03:45.420> petals<00:03:45.780> around<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.380> yellow

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
these these petals around the yellow

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.710 
these these petals around the yellow
Center<00:03:46.980> they<00:03:47.430> all<00:03:47.760> stay<00:03:48.030> together<00:03:48.209> nothing

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
Center they all stay together nothing

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.150 
Center they all stay together nothing
really<00:03:48.959> happens<00:03:49.320> I'm<00:03:49.440> not<00:03:49.590> I'm<00:03:49.800> not<00:03:49.830> hurting

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
really happens I'm not I'm not hurting

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.310 
really happens I'm not I'm not hurting
anything<00:03:50.430> if<00:03:50.730> i<00:03:50.850> rotate<00:03:51.209> just<00:03:51.840> here<00:03:52.019> they<00:03:52.200> all

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
anything if i rotate just here they all

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.120 
anything if i rotate just here they all
don't<00:03:52.950> stay<00:03:53.190> together<00:03:53.390> so<00:03:54.709> here's<00:03:55.709> my<00:03:55.769> white

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
don't stay together so here's my white

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
on top of a blue center so I'm going to

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.390 
on top of a blue center so I'm going to
rotate<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.750> top<00:04:00.959> until<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.410> screen<00:04:01.650> matches

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
now that's on top of the red Center if I

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.440 
now that's on top of the red Center if I
turn<00:04:07.650> this<00:04:07.680> one<00:04:07.890> more<00:04:08.010> time<00:04:08.190> now<00:04:08.970> this<00:04:09.000> green

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
turn this one more time now this green

turn this one more time now this green
is<00:04:09.600> on<00:04:09.750> top<00:04:09.930> of<00:04:09.960> the<00:04:10.110> green<00:04:10.320> center<00:04:10.710> once<00:04:11.460> you

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
is on top of the green center once you

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.490 
is on top of the green center once you
have<00:04:11.820> this<00:04:11.970> match<00:04:12.270> I'm<00:04:12.600> going<00:04:13.170> to<00:04:13.230> turn<00:04:13.380> the

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
have this match I'm going to turn the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.170 
have this match I'm going to turn the
green<00:04:13.710> side<00:04:13.920> twice<00:04:14.190> now<00:04:14.520> what<00:04:14.790> that<00:04:14.820> means

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
green side twice now what that means

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.780 
green side twice now what that means
don't<00:04:15.739> turn<00:04:16.739> anything<00:04:16.980> when<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.459> turn<00:04:17.640> to

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
don't turn anything when you turn to

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.610 
don't turn anything when you turn to
bring<00:04:17.970> side<00:04:18.209> twice<00:04:18.480> you<00:04:18.780> want<00:04:18.959> to<00:04:19.019> turn<00:04:19.170> it<00:04:19.410> so

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
bring side twice you want to turn it so

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.190 
bring side twice you want to turn it so
that<00:04:19.830> this<00:04:20.310> green<00:04:20.670> Center<00:04:20.970> rotates<00:04:21.420> or

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
that this green Center rotates or

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.670 
that this green Center rotates or
however<00:04:22.920> this<00:04:23.130> is<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.400> front<00:04:24.470> rotating<00:04:25.470> twice

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
however this is the front rotating twice

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.810 
however this is the front rotating twice
as<00:04:25.830> 180<00:04:26.370> degrees<00:04:27.410> 12<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:29.280> what<00:04:29.430> that<00:04:29.460> does<00:04:29.760> is

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
as 180 degrees 12 and what that does is

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.910 
as 180 degrees 12 and what that does is
that<00:04:30.000> takes<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.570> white<00:04:30.780> sticker<00:04:31.140> up<00:04:31.380> here<00:04:31.680> and

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
that takes the white sticker up here and

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.790 
that takes the white sticker up here and
put<00:04:32.460> it<00:04:32.580> next<00:04:32.610> to<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:32.910> white<00:04:33.090> center<00:04:33.680> so<00:04:34.680> I've

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
put it next to the white center so I've

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.320 
put it next to the white center so I've
done<00:04:34.980> that<00:04:35.130> once<00:04:35.340> and<00:04:35.610> therefore<00:04:36.000> of<00:04:36.150> them

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
done that once and therefore of them

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.030 
done that once and therefore of them
that<00:04:36.480> you<00:04:36.540> put<00:04:36.750> up<00:04:36.780> there<00:04:36.900> I<00:04:37.200> lose<00:04:37.560> three<00:04:37.860> more

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
that you put up there I lose three more

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.350 
that you put up there I lose three more
times<00:04:38.280> so<00:04:38.460> I'm<00:04:38.640> just<00:04:38.760> going<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:38.940> take<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.180> next

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
times so I'm just going to take the next

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.650 
times so I'm just going to take the next
one<00:04:39.710> here's<00:04:40.710> a<00:04:40.800> white<00:04:41.100> sticker<00:04:41.400> next<00:04:41.760> to

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
one here's a white sticker next to

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.900 
one here's a white sticker next to
yellow<00:04:42.870> Center<00:04:43.200> and<00:04:43.470> next<00:04:44.310> we<00:04:44.370> this<00:04:44.490> is<00:04:44.640> blue

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
yellow Center and next we this is blue

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.610 
yellow Center and next we this is blue
but<00:04:45.240> this<00:04:45.420> blue<00:04:45.630> is<00:04:45.780> on<00:04:45.930> top<00:04:46.110> of<00:04:46.260> your<00:04:46.350> orange

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
but this blue is on top of your orange

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.650 
but this blue is on top of your orange
center<00:04:46.920> so<00:04:47.580> I'm<00:04:47.670> going<00:04:47.730> to<00:04:47.880> rotate<00:04:48.060> this<00:04:48.390> top

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
center so I'm going to rotate this top

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.780 
center so I'm going to rotate this top
until<00:04:48.960> blue<00:04:49.260> it's<00:04:49.860> on<00:04:50.010> top<00:04:50.220> of<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.430> blue<00:04:50.580> side

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
until blue it's on top of the blue side

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.150 
until blue it's on top of the blue side
annoyed<00:04:51.200> right<00:04:52.200> now<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.440> Blues<00:04:52.710> on<00:04:52.860> top<00:04:53.010> of

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
annoyed right now the Blues on top of

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.530 
annoyed right now the Blues on top of
green<00:04:53.460> so<00:04:53.910> I'm<00:04:54.000> going<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:54.210> wait<00:04:54.270> till<00:04:54.450> it

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
green so I'm going to wait till it

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.020 
green so I'm going to wait till it
matches<00:04:54.990> now<00:04:55.950> this<00:04:56.190> matches<00:04:56.670> something<00:04:56.940> to

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
matches now this matches something to

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:05.150 
matches now this matches something to
turn<00:04:57.150> this<00:04:57.660> blue<00:04:57.900> face<00:04:58.140> twice<00:04:59.210> won<00:05:03.830> 102<00:05:04.830> and

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
turn this blue face twice won 102 and

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.070 
turn this blue face twice won 102 and
then<00:05:06.090> I'm<00:05:06.210> going<00:05:06.330> to<00:05:06.390> repeat<00:05:06.630> that<00:05:06.810> for<00:05:06.990> the

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
then I'm going to repeat that for the

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.070 
then I'm going to repeat that for the
other<00:05:07.230> tubes<00:05:07.530> white<00:05:08.520> this<00:05:09.240> is<00:05:09.360> read<00:05:09.630> this<00:05:09.870> read

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
other tubes white this is read this read

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.409 
other tubes white this is read this read
some<00:05:10.320> top<00:05:10.470> screen<00:05:10.820> turn<00:05:11.820> the<00:05:11.910> top<00:05:12.120> now<00:05:12.360> the

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
some top screen turn the top now the

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.159 
some top screen turn the top now the
Reds<00:05:12.660> on<00:05:12.750> top<00:05:12.780> of<00:05:13.050> the<00:05:13.110> red<00:05:13.320> and<00:05:14.310> just<00:05:14.460> twice

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
Reds on top of the red and just twice

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.830 
Reds on top of the red and just twice
one<00:05:16.169> more<00:05:16.410> white<00:05:17.010> orange<00:05:17.520> this<00:05:18.360> doesn't<00:05:18.570> match

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
one more white orange this doesn't match

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:26.750 
one more white orange this doesn't match
it<00:05:23.990> and<00:05:24.990> now<00:05:25.350> this<00:05:25.620> orange<00:05:25.919> matches<00:05:26.280> so<00:05:26.460> i<00:05:26.490> turn

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
it and now this orange matches so i turn

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.490 
it and now this orange matches so i turn
the<00:05:26.850> space<00:05:27.060> coins<00:05:27.360> and<00:05:28.110> when<00:05:28.230> you're<00:05:28.320> done

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
the space coins and when you're done

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.290 
the space coins and when you're done
with<00:05:28.560> this<00:05:28.890> step<00:05:29.160> you<00:05:29.340> should<00:05:29.400> have<00:05:29.730> a<00:05:29.970> cross

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
with this step you should have a cross

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.900 
with this step you should have a cross
on<00:05:30.600> the<00:05:30.840> white<00:05:30.990> slide<00:05:31.320> and<00:05:31.680> the<00:05:32.520> reason<00:05:32.790> why

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
on the white slide and the reason why

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.400 
on the white slide and the reason why
you're<00:05:33.090> matching<00:05:33.270> every<00:05:33.600> color<00:05:33.810> is<00:05:34.050> so<00:05:34.200> that

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
you're matching every color is so that

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.180 
you're matching every color is so that
each<00:05:34.919> one<00:05:35.220> of<00:05:35.280> these<00:05:35.460> things<00:05:35.760> matches<00:05:36.720> as<00:05:36.930> well

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
each one of these things matches as well

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.830 
each one of these things matches as well
next<00:05:38.190> to<00:05:38.310> the<00:05:38.370> cross<00:05:38.610> when<00:05:39.450> you<00:05:39.480> solve<00:05:39.750> the

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
next to the cross when you solve the

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.090 
next to the cross when you solve the
Rubik's<00:05:40.200> Cube<00:05:40.410> you're<00:05:40.530> not<00:05:40.680> really<00:05:40.830> solving

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
Rubik's Cube you're not really solving

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.580 
Rubik's Cube you're not really solving
stickers<00:05:41.700> you're<00:05:41.880> solving<00:05:42.060> pieces<00:05:42.570> so<00:05:43.560> you

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
stickers you're solving pieces so you

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.080 
stickers you're solving pieces so you
