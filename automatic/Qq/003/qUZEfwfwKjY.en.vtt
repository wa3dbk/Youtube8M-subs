in<00:00:16.320> from<00:00:16.680> ground<00:00:17.130> up<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:18.270> basically<00:00:18.840> here<00:00:19.109> are

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
in from ground up so basically here are

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.470 
in from ground up so basically here are
the<00:00:19.680> shins<00:00:19.890> at<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> scratch<00:00:20.400> build<00:00:20.760> which<00:00:21.240> took

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
the shins at a scratch build which took

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.910 
the shins at a scratch build which took
me<00:00:21.630> about<00:00:21.840> 25<00:00:22.170> 26<00:00:22.769> hours<00:00:23.449> I<00:00:24.449> do<00:00:24.840> not<00:00:25.320> have<00:00:25.619> a

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
me about 25 26 hours I do not have a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.920 
me about 25 26 hours I do not have a
video<00:00:26.279> showing<00:00:26.609> step<00:00:27.000> by<00:00:27.150> step<00:00:27.390> because<00:00:27.720> that

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
video showing step by step because that

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.570 
video showing step by step because that
will<00:00:28.050> probably<00:00:28.289> take<00:00:28.529> 30<00:00:28.769> mins<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.189> run<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
will probably take 30 mins to run and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.150 
will probably take 30 mins to run and
probably<00:00:29.730> not<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> good<00:00:30.960> idea<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.679> what<00:00:32.130> I

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
probably not a good idea so what I

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.290 
probably not a good idea so what I
intend<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.669> do<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.030> take<00:00:33.329> multiple<00:00:34.230> photos<00:00:34.500> of

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
beginning to end from scratch building

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.700 
beginning to end from scratch building
from<00:00:38.550> paper<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> end<00:00:40.200> product<00:00:40.440> that

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
from paper and to the end product that

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.470 
from paper and to the end product that
you<00:00:40.829> see<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.660> from<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.840> scale<00:00:43.170> allows<00:00:43.530> fine

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
you see here from the scale allows fine

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.720 
you see here from the scale allows fine
actually<00:00:45.480> from<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.780> front<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.430> has<00:00:47.430> done<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
actually from the front to has done the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.350 
actually from the front to has done the
details<00:00:48.120> looks<00:00:48.890> ok<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:49.920> think<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.489> here's<00:00:51.270> a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
details looks ok I think and here's a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.770 
details looks ok I think and here's a
back<00:00:51.539> but<00:00:52.350> other<00:00:52.680> side<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.610> bit<00:00:54.199> why<00:00:56.780> but

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
back but other side it's a bit why but

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.799 
back but other side it's a bit why but
you<00:00:58.440> know<00:00:58.530> after<00:00:58.829> my<00:00:59.430> son<00:00:59.699> put<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> little

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.680 
you know after my son put it on a little
swine<00:01:01.230> based<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.070> scale<00:01:02.340> itself<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.539> we

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
swine based on the scale itself so we

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.509 
swine based on the scale itself so we
don't<00:01:03.870> further<00:01:03.989> ado<00:01:04.199> here<00:01:04.229> are<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:05.339> photos

don't further ado here are the photos

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.429 
don't further ado here are the photos
that<00:01:05.970> i<00:01:06.000> put<00:01:06.330> together<00:01:06.450> hopefully<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.260> like
