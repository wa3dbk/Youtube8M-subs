they've taken no financial gain as of

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.910 
they've taken no financial gain as of
current<00:03:39.459> for<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.060> people<00:03:40.390> who've<00:03:40.570> already

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.949 
current for the people who've already

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
paid so why would they give up their

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.710 
paid so why would they give up their
server<00:03:44.290> space<00:03:44.590> for<00:03:44.920> people<00:03:45.040> who<00:03:45.580> have<00:03:46.510> not

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
server space for people who have not

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.570 
server space for people who have not
given<00:03:46.870> them<00:03:47.049> a<00:03:47.140> penny<00:03:47.320> and<00:03:47.590> then<00:03:48.190> you<00:03:48.340> have<00:03:48.549> a

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
given them a penny and then you have a

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.580 
given them a penny and then you have a
look<00:03:48.760> at<00:03:48.940> Sony<00:03:49.510> Online<00:03:49.660> Entertainment<00:03:49.870> say

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
look at Sony Online Entertainment say

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.830 
look at Sony Online Entertainment say
well<00:03:50.860> why<00:03:51.010> haven't<00:03:51.220> you<00:03:51.519> set<00:03:52.180> up<00:03:52.299> a<00:03:52.390> deal<00:03:52.570> with

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
well why haven't you set up a deal with

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.220 
well why haven't you set up a deal with
valve<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:54.160> could<00:03:54.700> enable<00:03:55.420> us<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.720> have<00:03:55.989> steam

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
valve that could enable us to have steam

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.860 
valve that could enable us to have steam
keys<00:03:56.470> well<00:03:56.709> their<00:03:56.980> perspective<00:03:57.549> is<00:03:57.670> okay<00:03:58.390> we

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
keys well their perspective is okay we

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.410 
keys well their perspective is okay we
could<00:03:59.110> do<00:03:59.350> that<00:03:59.380> we<00:03:59.910> we'd<00:04:00.910> have<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.120> give<00:04:01.390> a

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
could do that we we'd have to give a

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.180 
could do that we we'd have to give a
large<00:04:01.750> portion<00:04:02.079> of<00:04:02.260> money<00:04:02.470> to<00:04:02.709> valve<00:04:02.950> to

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
large portion of money to valve to

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.370 
large portion of money to valve to
enable<00:04:03.700> that<00:04:03.850> or<00:04:04.360> we<00:04:04.750> could<00:04:04.900> spend<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:05.230> money

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
enable that or we could spend the money

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.949 
enable that or we could spend the money
on<00:04:05.470> our<00:04:05.680> development<00:04:06.280> and<00:04:06.690> maybe<00:04:07.690> getting

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
on our development and maybe getting

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.810 
on our development and maybe getting
better<00:04:08.170> and<00:04:08.530> just<00:04:08.590> wait<00:04:09.100> until<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.610> game

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
better and just wait until the game

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.400 
better and just wait until the game
comes<00:04:10.090> out<00:04:10.239> of<00:04:10.360> early<00:04:10.600> access<00:04:10.750> and<00:04:11.110> everyone

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
comes out of early access and everyone

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.559 
comes out of early access and everyone
can<00:04:11.530> just<00:04:11.709> download<00:04:11.829> it<00:04:12.070> anyway

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
can just download it anyway

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.289 
can just download it anyway
so<00:04:13.170> if<00:04:13.260> you<00:04:13.379> look<00:04:13.469> it<00:04:13.620> from<00:04:13.799> that<00:04:13.890> perspective

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
so if you look it from that perspective

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.900 
so if you look it from that perspective
there<00:04:15.299> isn't<00:04:15.569> really<00:04:15.709> any<00:04:16.709> logic<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.220> getting

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
there isn't really any logic to getting

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.699 
there isn't really any logic to getting
upset<00:04:18.239> about<00:04:18.359> this<00:04:18.720> it's<00:04:19.229> just<00:04:19.320> an

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
upset about this it's just an

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.979 
upset about this it's just an
unfortunate<00:04:20.220> situation<00:04:20.669> for<00:04:21.389> the<00:04:21.479> people<00:04:21.810> who

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
unfortunate situation for the people who

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.409 
unfortunate situation for the people who
are<00:04:22.109> currently<00:04:22.410> in<00:04:22.560> later<00:04:23.009> but<00:04:23.850> it<00:04:24.180> will<00:04:24.389> be

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
are currently in later but it will be

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.629 
are currently in later but it will be
resolved<00:04:24.930> when<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.740> game<00:04:25.919> is<00:04:26.070> fully<00:04:26.310> released

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
resolved when the game is fully released

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.210 
resolved when the game is fully released
now<00:04:26.910> that<00:04:27.509> is<00:04:27.690> assuming<00:04:28.080> that<00:04:28.770> this<00:04:28.919> is<00:04:29.099> the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
were then given steam keys so that they

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.930 
were then given steam keys so that they

don't<00:05:53.400> really<00:05:53.550> think<00:05:53.729> it's<00:05:53.940> important<00:05:54.360> that

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
don't really think it's important that

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.300 
don't really think it's important that
that<00:05:54.509> needs<00:05:54.750> to<00:05:54.960> change<00:05:54.990> because<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:56.099> show

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
that needs to change because the show

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.430 
that needs to change because the show
will<00:05:56.520> eventually<00:05:56.969> adapt<00:05:57.210> to<00:05:57.419> be<00:05:57.659> serving<00:05:58.110> for

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
will eventually adapt to be serving for

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.249 
will eventually adapt to be serving for
EverQuest<00:05:59.009> next<00:05:59.099> as<00:05:59.490> well<00:05:59.759> but<00:06:00.419> for<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.080> time

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
EverQuest next as well but for the time

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:02.899 
EverQuest next as well but for the time
being<00:06:01.320> I<00:06:01.740> think<00:06:01.770> it's<00:06:02.099> important<00:06:02.490> to<00:06:02.520> say<00:06:02.699> that
