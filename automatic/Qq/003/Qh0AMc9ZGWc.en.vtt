00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.050
 I will defrost and will do it by 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.830
 the way i never used 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.050
 they did not tell him , and they said 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.000
 what is the operational defrosting method 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.520
 freezer here today i will 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.190
 do everything take video share with 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.110
 before you start 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.480
 for a start about thirty minutes ago I 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.879
 unplugged the freezer from the outlet 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.550
 so he went down and went down 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:54.750
 let's say so out of all these tubes 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:57.329
 inside further my task is to get it out 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.219
 freezer bw all contents a 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.590
 it will be easy for me because we have 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.129
 freezer that's such a 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.930
 so here 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:13.799
 I leave them with 6 shelves and and 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.500
 I bear today's cold winter 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.210
 collected myself kind i will endure all 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.259
 contents to the balcony on 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.170
 He's more open and not to 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.220
 melted nothing melted I will cover everything 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.560
 a blanket 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.960
 can there be some kind of jacket if you have 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.420
 there is no way to make content 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.360
 freezer to the street you can 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.400
 put somewhere in your kitchen or in 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.090
 another cool place in an apartment in 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.630
 the house is covered with a blanket 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.330
 and two three hours nothing with frozen 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.400
 products do not happen they do not melt a 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.710
 During this time 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:59.310
 melts all the ice freezer anri and so 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.310
 I'm starting to get all the content 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:07.990
 my periwinkle is already empty instead of section 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.500
 with frozen foods I put on 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.620
 a shelf of dice street hot water that is 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.740
 so real boiling water here is another 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.290
 empty shelf and below empty shelf 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.470
 spring-summer still put this pot I 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:29.680

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:32.230
 started at 13 already started 1315 check 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.260
 how much time will it take me from 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.350
 pairs here are a pair that forms under 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.300

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:46.540
 defrostations ie defrosting 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:48.550
 ice crackles I'll wait after 5 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.040
 10 minutes defrosting process takes place 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:55.209
 very fast I do not have time to lose 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:58.480
 wipe the water that has accumulated ice falls 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.049
 i have some saucepan with water re 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.730
 set 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:06.220
 put the legs and then again put on 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.140
 kidneys one elephant all very really 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.380
 promptly defrosted 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:16.330
 don't really like the main one don't flood 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.910
 neighbors with its base courtesy of 1429 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.810
 the freezer was already completely melted 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.580
 removed all the saucepan until completely gone 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.620
 took 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.960
 warm water add ordinary 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.590
 table vinegar and all 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.800
 all this mixture washed completely wiped 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.870
 whole interior freezer 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.450
 water with vinegar removes the smell 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.550
 frost- specific varnish and now i'm still 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.950
 once rubbed 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:49.050
 plain warm water once more 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.050
 freezer and you can run 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:56.380
 1514 that is, it took me two hours 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.980
 procedure defrost freezer 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:03.280
 she has already dried freezer 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:07.690
 Now I will close the door and turn it on. 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:11.190
 outlet this unit after half an hour when 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.680
 the freezer will come out on its like 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.530
 work schedule work mode i 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.260
 upload her food and she 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.190
 will continue to work on that 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.160
 show this method takes place to be very 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:30.190
 really quick operational of 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.310
 these two hours are probably half 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.740
 time left only for what I washed 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.140
 dried freezer defrost 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.280
 it took me very little time minutes 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:45.970
 45 is probably the maximum but maybe 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.400
 60 I recommend using this 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.560
 very practical way 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.860
 much really more to say 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.860
 efficiency thanks for watching 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.860
