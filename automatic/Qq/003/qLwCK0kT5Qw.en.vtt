00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
what I ever thought would happen but you

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.220 
what I ever thought would happen but you
have<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.610> think<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.090> way<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.959> first

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
have to think of it that way the first

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.650 
have to think of it that way the first
step<00:03:11.470> is<00:03:11.739> you<00:03:11.950> have<00:03:12.130> to<00:03:12.400> be<00:03:12.910> yourself<00:03:13.060> and

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
step is you have to be yourself and

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.559 
step is you have to be yourself and
