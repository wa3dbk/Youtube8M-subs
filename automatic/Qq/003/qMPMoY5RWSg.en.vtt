hi Joe Schoenberg fastpitch power a
couple<00:00:06.979> of<00:00:07.069> weeks<00:00:07.250> ago<00:00:07.490> we<00:00:08.029> talked<00:00:08.299> about<00:00:08.420> some

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
couple of weeks ago we talked about some

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.230 
couple of weeks ago we talked about some
of<00:00:08.809> my<00:00:08.900> favorite<00:00:08.990> drills<00:00:09.860> that<00:00:10.520> I<00:00:10.700> consider<00:00:11.120> to

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240 
of my favorite drills that I consider to

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.560 
of my favorite drills that I consider to
be<00:00:11.300> power<00:00:11.630> drills<00:00:12.519> my<00:00:13.519> opinion<00:00:14.059> is<00:00:14.210> power

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
be power drills my opinion is power

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.380 
be power drills my opinion is power
comes<00:00:15.170> from<00:00:15.290> the<00:00:15.500> ground<00:00:15.769> up<00:00:16.040> your<00:00:16.790> lower<00:00:17.060> body

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
comes from the ground up your lower body

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.670 
comes from the ground up your lower body
trunk<00:00:18.380> core<00:00:19.189> legs<00:00:20.119> they<00:00:20.779> generate<00:00:21.320> the<00:00:21.500> power

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
trunk core legs they generate the power

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.189 
trunk core legs they generate the power
so<00:00:22.250> the<00:00:22.369> plank<00:00:22.670> drills<00:00:23.060> the<00:00:23.300> ground<00:00:23.630> up<00:00:23.869> drills

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
so the plank drills the ground up drills

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.410 
so the plank drills the ground up drills
those<00:00:24.680> are<00:00:24.859> power<00:00:25.070> drills<00:00:25.460> what<00:00:26.000> about<00:00:26.180> hands

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
those are power drills what about hands

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.990 
those are power drills what about hands
deep<00:00:26.689> upper<00:00:27.470> body<00:00:27.740> is<00:00:27.980> what<00:00:28.189> generates<00:00:28.609> speed

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
deep upper body is what generates speed

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.499 
deep upper body is what generates speed
when<00:00:29.539> you<00:00:29.689> can<00:00:29.869> coordinate<00:00:30.730> lower<00:00:31.730> body<00:00:32.119> power

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
when you can coordinate lower body power

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.869 
when you can coordinate lower body power
with<00:00:32.900> upper<00:00:33.170> body<00:00:33.199> speed<00:00:33.860> now<00:00:34.550> you<00:00:34.610> got

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
with upper body speed now you got

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.869 
with upper body speed now you got
something<00:00:35.120> going<00:00:35.239> on<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.559> what's<00:00:36.890> my<00:00:37.309> favorite

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
for developing and speed and arm speed

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:44.710 
for developing and speed and arm speed
it's<00:00:42.710> progressive<00:00:43.430> wall<00:00:43.610> plus<00:00:44.059> and<00:00:44.390> let<00:00:44.659> me

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
it's progressive wall plus and let me

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.329 
it's progressive wall plus and let me
tell<00:00:44.870> you<00:00:44.960> something<00:00:45.260> it's<00:00:45.650> not<00:00:45.799> just<00:00:46.159> my

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
as awesome as he is is because he's been

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
doing a long process all life long toss

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.380 
doing a long process all life long toss
is<00:00:59.330> a<00:00:59.360> great<00:00:59.809> way<00:01:00.110> to<00:01:00.530> build<00:01:01.040> the<00:01:01.580> upper<00:01:01.879> body

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
is a great way to build the upper body

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.479 
is a great way to build the upper body
speed<00:01:02.839> that<00:01:03.199> will<00:01:03.379> coordinate<00:01:03.769> with<00:01:04.070> lower

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
speed that will coordinate with lower

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.870 
speed that will coordinate with lower
body<00:01:04.850> power<00:01:05.210> making<00:01:06.110> you<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:07.190> most<00:01:07.490> dynamic

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
body power making you the most dynamic

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.410 
body power making you the most dynamic
picture<00:01:08.630> that<00:01:08.810> you<00:01:08.960> can<00:01:09.170> be<00:01:09.320> Tama<00:01:10.220> right<00:01:11.180> now

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
picture that you can be Tama right now

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.740 
picture that you can be Tama right now
is<00:01:11.780> standing<00:01:12.290> at<00:01:12.410> 43<00:01:13.040> feet<00:01:13.280> I'm<00:01:14.180> in<00:01:14.330> a<00:01:14.360> gym<00:01:14.720> so

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
is standing at 43 feet I'm in a gym so

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.440 
is standing at 43 feet I'm in a gym so
I'm<00:01:15.110> a<00:01:15.200> little<00:01:15.440> bit<00:01:15.590> limited<00:01:15.980> but<00:01:16.820> Timah<00:01:17.180> is

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
I'm a little bit limited but Timah is

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.790 
I'm a little bit limited but Timah is
going<00:01:17.690> to<00:01:17.780> go<00:01:17.900> back<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.670> 53<00:01:19.670> feet<00:01:19.910> to<00:01:20.600> start<00:01:21.640> and

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
going to go back to 53 feet to start and

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.380 
going to go back to 53 feet to start and
normally<00:01:24.800> I<00:01:24.830> would<00:01:25.190> have<00:01:25.370> my<00:01:25.550> pitchers<00:01:26.060> throw

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
normally I would have my pitchers throw

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.380 
normally I would have my pitchers throw
five<00:01:27.110> pitches<00:01:27.560> from<00:01:27.980> each<00:01:28.130> location<00:01:28.370> and<00:01:28.970> I'd

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
five pitches from each location and I'd

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.170 
five pitches from each location and I'd
like<00:01:29.690> to<00:01:29.750> go<00:01:30.200> back<00:01:30.440> in<00:01:31.030> three<00:01:33.070> segments<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:34.820> in

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
like to go back in three segments so in

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.310 
like to go back in three segments so in
this<00:01:35.390> case<00:01:35.690> it<00:01:35.930> would<00:01:36.050> be<00:01:36.080> 53<00:01:37.010> 63<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:38.180> 73<00:01:38.990> and

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
this case it would be 53 63 and 73 and

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.260 
this case it would be 53 63 and 73 and
that<00:01:39.770> happens<00:01:40.159> to<00:01:40.280> be<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.490> limitation<00:01:41.060> that<00:01:41.090> I

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
that happens to be the limitation that I

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.480 
that happens to be the limitation that I
have<00:01:41.480> in<00:01:41.659> this<00:01:41.750> gym<00:01:42.080> so<00:01:42.680> Tama<00:01:43.010> just<00:01:43.340> for

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
demonstration purposes is going to throw

00:01:45.650 --> 00:02:02.889 
demonstration purposes is going to throw
