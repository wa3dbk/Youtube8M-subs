00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:38.340
 and here in this we click space and a 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:41.340
 half this one with only another space and a half 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.340
 windows 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.910
 here an important fact here there are times 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.820
 in which one puts me in minimized and 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.190
 when it says leave it then there is a 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.610
 error and then you can not record nor 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.370
 nothing has to be in mind 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.879
 maximized or minimized 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:07.130
 on normal or maximized screen I want 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:09.590
 propose in normal apply and accept and 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.180
 now I'm going to cut a moment to do 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.970
 that even better 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:19.180
 Well, we have already opened the halo and 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.180
 here, well, let me explain 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.010
 very well then when they have the qantas already 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.470
 before recording that here you get a 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.200
 little screen that says fair and they have to 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.780
 cut everything outside everything that just 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.869
 stay in the center this is how to leave it 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.369
 for then there you can record a 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.690
 I will give you a sample below 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.530
 Of how 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.050
 how the games are recorded as 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.300
 I explained them well, I'm going to repeat them 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.930
 again if you have not extended this 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.539
 screen here you get cut out you have to 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.750
 cut everything just the ball is left 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:59.280
 medium 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.280
 then 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.110
 Well, we are already here, this is the 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.090
 proof that it works as you will see 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.860
 when I cut it, it's like I'm 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.860
 playing in full screen but to which 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.580
 not life and this serves to record with 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.340
 2007 taxis 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.740
 and well then let's see if they can be 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.530
 conceived to show them that yes 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.310
 if they serve without prats as you see, 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.310
 Numbers come out 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.450
 but now recording with constancy we're going 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.450
 to see if we can enter 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.319
 just a moment 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.280
 to see how 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.269
 capture the flag 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:54.510
 they killed me young 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.530
 not only is it punctual 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.530
 it does not kill me 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:11.599
 for the test the red team has the 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:18.959
 flag well then here 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:21.660
 17 videos but the first death is already 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.750
 well that 's all here the micro could 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.870
 121 makes it goodbye and see you soon not 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.870
 he
