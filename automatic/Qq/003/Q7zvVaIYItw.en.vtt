00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.970 
hey Vsauce Michael here the world is
real<00:00:05.089> right<00:00:08.030> how<00:00:09.030> do<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.240> know<00:00:09.860> it's<00:00:10.860> a

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
real right how do you know it's a

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.799 
real right how do you know it's a
difficult<00:00:11.160> question<00:00:11.849> but<00:00:12.240> it's<00:00:12.420> not<00:00:12.599> rocket

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
difficult question but it's not rocket

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.580 
difficult question but it's not rocket
science<00:00:13.250> instead<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.260> asking<00:00:16.260> whether<00:00:16.440> or

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
science instead it is asking whether or

would<00:00:28.410> rise<00:00:28.560> every<00:00:28.980> morning<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.060> did<00:00:30.240> but

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
would rise every morning and it did but

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.110 
would rise every morning and it did but
it<00:00:31.199> wasn't<00:00:31.349> until<00:00:31.710> later<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.250> they<00:00:32.579> realized
