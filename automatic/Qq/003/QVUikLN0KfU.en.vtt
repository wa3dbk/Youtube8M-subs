that into a book and I wanted my book to
turn<00:00:17.910> out<00:00:18.090> pretty<00:00:18.720> much<00:00:18.869> like<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.500> notice<00:00:20.160> it

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
turn out pretty much like this notice it

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.880 
turn out pretty much like this notice it
looks<00:00:20.940> like<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> paperback<00:00:21.600> it's<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.350> size<00:00:22.619> of

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
looks like a paperback it's the size of

looks like a paperback it's the size of
a<00:00:23.250> normal<00:00:23.670> book<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> bookshelf

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.990 

how<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.120> did<00:00:30.540> that<00:00:30.720> was<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.140> took<00:00:31.200> my<00:00:31.760> ebook<00:00:32.760> which

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
how I did that was I took my ebook which

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.850 
how I did that was I took my ebook which
was<00:00:33.180> formatted<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.170> eight-and-a-half<00:00:34.650> by

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
was formatted for eight-and-a-half by

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.660 
was formatted for eight-and-a-half by
eleven<00:00:35.250> paper<00:00:35.490> and<00:00:35.820> printed<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.390> out<00:00:36.480> using

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
eleven paper and printed it out using

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.460 
eleven paper and printed it out using
special<00:00:38.670> MNR<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.570> which<00:00:39.900> prints<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
special MNR that I have which prints the

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.690 
special MNR that I have which prints the
front<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.460> back<00:00:41.880> in<00:00:42.300> front<00:00:42.630> and<00:00:42.750> back<00:00:43.110> but<00:00:43.700> it

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
front and back in front and back but it

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.130 
front and back in front and back but it
does<00:00:44.880> so<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.300> way<00:00:45.330> that's<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.750> little<00:00:46.020> bit

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
does so in a way that's a little bit

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.860 
does so in a way that's a little bit
different<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.830> may<00:00:47.160> have<00:00:47.430> most<00:00:48.150> most<00:00:48.720> of

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
different and you may have most most of

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.970 
different and you may have most most of
these<00:00:48.989> things<00:00:49.260> when<00:00:49.410> they<00:00:49.500> want<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.739> print<00:00:49.860> a

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
these things when they want to print a

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.979 
these things when they want to print a
book<00:00:50.190> will<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.790> printed<00:00:50.970> out<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.510> then

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
book will have you printed out and then

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.229 
book will have you printed out and then
they'll<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.470> fold<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.070> like<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.940> and

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
they'll have you fold it like this and

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.770 
they'll have you fold it like this and
then<00:00:54.720> you<00:00:54.900> bind<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.739> along<00:00:56.010> here<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.730> cut<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
then you bind it along here and cut the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.140 
then you bind it along here and cut the
edge<00:00:57.900> and<00:01:00.650> folding<00:01:01.650> a<00:01:01.860> stack<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.490> big<00:01:02.940> just

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
edge and folding a stack this big just

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.690 
edge and folding a stack this big just
wasn't<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.540> good<00:01:03.690> idea<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.440> I<00:01:04.470> designed<00:01:05.309> this

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
wasn't a good idea so I designed this

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.780 
wasn't a good idea so I designed this
way<00:01:05.910> of<00:01:06.259> creating<00:01:07.259> a<00:01:07.380> book<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.009> you<00:01:08.040> can

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
way of creating a book so that you can

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.499 
way of creating a book so that you can
seal<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.050> edges<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.000> then<00:01:12.000> cut<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.300> in

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
seal it on the edges and then cut it in

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.889 
seal it on the edges and then cut it in
the<00:01:12.630> middle<00:01:12.860> it'll<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.130> what<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.700> does<00:01:14.910> is<00:01:15.330> you

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
the middle it'll and what it does is you

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.580 
the middle it'll and what it does is you
get<00:01:16.610> two<00:01:17.610> books<00:01:17.850> one<00:01:18.149> from<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.509> side<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.050> one

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
get two books one from this side and one

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.580 
get two books one from this side and one
from<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.009> side

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.070 

to

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.000 
to
pages<00:01:27.830> to<00:01:28.220> go<00:01:28.400> into<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.120> thermal<00:01:29.360> binding

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
pages to go into the thermal binding

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.250 
pages to go into the thermal binding
very<00:01:31.010> simple<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:32.260> you<00:01:34.750> stack<00:01:35.750> it<00:01:35.780> up<00:01:35.960> very

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
very simple is you stack it up very

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.430 
very simple is you stack it up very
carefully<00:01:36.970> and<00:01:40.600> clamp<00:01:41.600> it<00:01:41.720> on<00:01:41.870> one<00:01:42.110> side

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
carefully and clamp it on one side

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.810 
carefully and clamp it on one side
making<00:01:43.130> sure<00:01:43.250> it's<00:01:43.570> completely<00:01:44.650> even<00:01:45.650> and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.460 

apply<00:01:49.820> a<00:01:49.850> little<00:01:50.090> hot<00:01:50.300> melt<00:01:50.570> glue<00:01:50.870> to<00:01:51.290> that

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
apply a little hot melt glue to that

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.950 
apply a little hot melt glue to that
edge<00:01:53.980> just<00:01:54.980> to<00:01:55.160> kind<00:01:55.400> of<00:01:55.490> glue<00:01:56.330> it<00:01:56.480> for<00:01:56.690> just<00:01:56.870> a

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
edge just to kind of glue it for just a

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.300 
edge just to kind of glue it for just a
few<00:01:57.140> moments<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:58.310> let<00:01:58.490> that<00:01:58.640> glue<00:01:59.390> cool<00:01:59.750> and

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
few moments you let that glue cool and

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.800 
few moments you let that glue cool and
then<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.430> do<00:02:01.580> it<00:02:01.610> on<00:02:02.260> the<00:02:03.260> other<00:02:03.470> edges

edge<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:43.310> bone<00:02:43.550> folder<00:02:44.620> right<00:02:45.620> along<00:02:45.890> there

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
edge and a bone folder right along there

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.540 
edge and a bone folder right along there
and<00:02:46.810> right<00:02:47.810> along<00:02:48.080> there<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.890> you<00:02:51.980> have<00:02:52.070> score

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
and right along there so you have score

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.330 
and right along there so you have score
marks<00:02:52.910> that<00:02:53.239> will<00:02:53.570> guide<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:54.170> as<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:57.340> create

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
marks that will guide you as you create

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.530

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
have to have pretty complete coverage

put huge amounts on there you want it to

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.250 
put huge amounts on there you want it to
go<00:03:27.590> up<00:03:27.800> into<00:03:28.069> the<00:03:28.370> pages<00:03:28.720> rather<00:03:29.720> than<00:03:29.989> along

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
go up into the pages rather than along

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.559 
go up into the pages rather than along
the<00:03:30.440> side

binding for
the<00:03:37.700> sides<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:40.040> you<00:03:40.280> do<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.550> same<00:03:40.790> thing<00:03:41.120> with

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
the sides and you do the same thing with

the sides and you do the same thing with
another<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:45.460> you<00:03:46.460> get<00:03:46.640> like<00:03:47.060> this<00:03:47.300> you<00:03:47.900> have

another and you get like this you have
to<00:03:48.140> be<00:03:48.200> very<00:03:48.350> careful<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:48.920> make<00:03:49.220> sure<00:03:49.250> that<00:03:49.490> the

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
to put it through the thermal binding

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.220 
to put it through the thermal binding
it's<00:04:08.609> pretty<00:04:08.849> hot<00:04:09.090> in<00:04:09.239> there<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:09.780> what<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:09.989> like

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230

and then
done<00:04:35.479> is<00:04:35.689> you<00:04:35.870> tap<00:04:36.560> it<00:04:36.740> very<00:04:36.949> gently<00:04:37.750> make<00:04:38.750> sure

that the page is seal and seat properly

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.360 
that the page is seal and seat properly
and<00:04:42.370> then<00:04:43.370> you<00:04:43.460> can<00:04:43.580> go<00:04:43.729> ahead<00:04:43.849> and<00:04:45.219> do<00:04:46.219> the

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
and then you can go ahead and do the

00:04:46.370 --> 00:05:00.990 
and then you can go ahead and do the
next<00:04:46.669> side

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.970 

that<00:05:02.000> is<00:05:02.510> one<00:05:03.380> side<00:05:03.680> and<00:05:04.480> the<00:05:05.480> other<00:05:05.630> side<00:05:08.980> then

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
that is one side and the other side then

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.800 
that is one side and the other side then
all<00:05:10.280> you<00:05:10.400> need<00:05:10.430> to<00:05:10.580> do<00:05:10.820> is<00:05:11.090> take<00:05:11.300> it<00:05:11.450> over<00:05:11.660> to

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
all you need to do is take it over to

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.740 
all you need to do is take it over to
your<00:05:12.050> local<00:05:12.560> print<00:05:12.950> shop<00:05:13.010> and<00:05:13.400> ask<00:05:14.270> them<00:05:14.570> if

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
they have a large paper trimmer and they

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.480 
they have a large paper trimmer and they
almost<00:05:20.720> always<00:05:21.050> do<00:05:21.500> these<00:05:21.770> are<00:05:21.950> very

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
almost always do these are very

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.520 
almost always do these are very
heavy-duty<00:05:22.820> devices<00:05:23.600> that<00:05:23.810> cut<00:05:24.080> many<00:05:24.320> many

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
heavy-duty devices that cut many many

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.230 
heavy-duty devices that cut many many
sheets<00:05:24.800> at<00:05:24.980> a<00:05:25.070> time<00:05:25.100> and<00:05:25.460> you<00:05:25.850> can<00:05:26.000> actually

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
sheets at a time and you can actually

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.260 
sheets at a time and you can actually
stack<00:05:26.810> up<00:05:27.080> maybe<00:05:27.560> ten<00:05:27.950> of<00:05:28.160> these<00:05:28.430> at<00:05:28.730> one<00:05:29.000> time

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
stack up maybe ten of these at one time

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.370 
stack up maybe ten of these at one time
and<00:05:29.570> they<00:05:30.530> can<00:05:30.710> cut<00:05:30.950> once<00:05:32.080> twice<00:05:33.080> right

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
and they can cut once twice right

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.710 
and they can cut once twice right
exactly<00:05:33.830> in<00:05:33.980> the<00:05:34.040> middle<00:05:34.280> and<00:05:34.460> a<00:05:35.090> third<00:05:35.360> trim

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
exactly in the middle and a third trim

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.570 
exactly in the middle and a third trim
on<00:05:35.930> the<00:05:36.440> bottom<00:05:36.740> just<00:05:36.770> to<00:05:37.070> make<00:05:37.250> everything

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
on the bottom just to make everything

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.180 
on the bottom just to make everything
look<00:05:38.510> pretty<00:05:38.750> and<00:05:39.020> nice<00:05:39.230> and<00:05:39.590> what<00:05:39.800> you<00:05:39.950> have

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
look pretty and nice and what you have

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.340 
look pretty and nice and what you have
after<00:05:40.550> you're<00:05:41.210> done<00:05:41.390> is<00:05:41.660> you<00:05:42.140> have<00:05:42.320> a

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
after you're done is you have a

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.570 
after you're done is you have a
paperback<00:05:42.950> book<00:05:43.250> that<00:05:43.730> looks<00:05:43.940> exactly<00:05:44.330> like
