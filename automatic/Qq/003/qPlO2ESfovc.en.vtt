so<00:02:25.110> sure<00:02:25.140> but<00:02:26.130> nowadays<00:02:26.430> when<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.000> see<00:02:27.239> it<00:02:27.330> in

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
so sure but nowadays when I see it in

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.770 
so sure but nowadays when I see it in
the<00:02:27.690> car<00:02:27.900> in<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.680> interior<00:02:29.430> even<00:02:29.910> driving

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
the car in the interior even driving

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.930 
the car in the interior even driving
around<00:02:31.020> so<00:02:31.380> there<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.920> driver<00:02:32.370> sitting<00:02:32.700> in

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
around so there is a driver sitting in

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.729 
around so there is a driver sitting in
there<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.330> it's<00:02:33.959> turning<00:02:34.200> around<00:02:34.380> the

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
there and it's turning around the

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.220 
there and it's turning around the
steering<00:02:34.920> wheel<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.750> always<00:02:36.750> have<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.050> feeling

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
steering wheel I always have the feeling

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.920 
steering wheel I always have the feeling
that<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.920> fits<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.760> fits<00:02:38.850> really<00:02:39.480> well<00:02:39.690> into

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
that it fits it fits really well into

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.800 
that it fits it fits really well into
the<00:02:40.290> interior<00:02:40.769> and<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:42.000> something<00:02:42.540> special

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
the interior and it is something special

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.530 
the interior and it is something special
and<00:02:43.680> then<00:02:44.310> behind<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.760> steering<00:02:44.970> wheel<00:02:45.120> you

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
and then behind the steering wheel you

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.740 
and then behind the steering wheel you
have<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.080> hood<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.470> underneath<00:02:47.010> this

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
have the hood and underneath this

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.790 
have the hood and underneath this
generous<00:02:48.750> big<00:02:49.290> hood<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:50.280> have<00:02:50.430> our<00:02:51.800> display

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
generous big hood you have our display

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.040 
generous big hood you have our display
unit<00:02:53.160> we<00:02:53.730> call<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.030> display<00:02:54.300> unit<00:02:54.660> which<00:02:54.840> is

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
unit we call the display unit which is

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.309 
unit we call the display unit which is
optically<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.590> unit<00:02:56.390> basically<00:02:57.390> these<00:02:57.870> are<00:02:58.019> two

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
optically a unit basically these are two

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.850 
optically a unit basically these are two
displays<00:02:58.850> but<00:02:59.850> we<00:03:00.060> wanted<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.200> connect<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.739> in

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
displays but we wanted to connect it in

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.740 
displays but we wanted to connect it in
one<00:03:02.130> unit<00:03:02.519> so<00:03:02.730> it's<00:03:03.260> aesthetically<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.560> it's<00:03:04.980> a

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
one unit so it's aesthetically it it's a

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.050 
one unit so it's aesthetically it it's a
simpler<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:07.590> less<00:03:08.130> screen<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.549> driver

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
simpler the less screen the driver

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.840 
simpler the less screen the driver
screen<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.780> having<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.530> function<00:03:10.769> as<00:03:11.280> usually

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
screen is having the function as usually

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.030 
screen is having the function as usually
it's<00:03:12.030> driver<00:03:12.360> information<00:03:12.590> speed<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.739> so<00:03:13.890> on

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
it's driver information speed and so on

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.039 
it's driver information speed and so on
night<00:03:14.610> vision<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.180> but<00:03:15.390> because<00:03:15.930> it's

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
night vision and but because it's

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.199 
night vision and but because it's
display<00:03:16.620> it's<00:03:16.739> more<00:03:16.920> flexible<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.579> on<00:03:18.060> the

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
display it's more flexible and on the

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.810 
display it's more flexible and on the
middle<00:03:18.450> screen<00:03:18.720> on<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.650> right<00:03:19.799> side<00:03:20.100> we<00:03:20.790> have

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
middle screen on the right side we have

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.000 
middle screen on the right side we have
all<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.269> navigation<00:03:21.840> system<00:03:22.260> entertainment

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
all the navigation system entertainment

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.449 
all the navigation system entertainment
and<00:03:23.310> really<00:03:24.030> impressive<00:03:24.540> animation<00:03:25.459> the

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
and really impressive animation the

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.460 
and really impressive animation the
ambient<00:03:26.850> light<00:03:27.060> we<00:03:27.360> use<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.900> exaggerate

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
ambient light we use it to exaggerate

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.069 
ambient light we use it to exaggerate
all<00:03:28.709> this<00:03:29.070> element<00:03:29.459> like<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.390> screen<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:31.049> we

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
all this element like the screen so we

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.979 
all this element like the screen so we
have<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.350> backlight<00:03:32.239> of<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.480> screen<00:03:33.780> that

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
have the backlight of the screen that

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.759 
have the backlight of the screen that
makes<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:34.380> optically<00:03:34.950> even<00:03:35.280> more<00:03:35.489> floating<00:03:36.120> in

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
makes it optically even more floating in

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.490 
makes it optically even more floating in
the<00:03:37.769> space<00:03:37.890> under<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.489> hood<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:39.140> we<00:03:40.140> have<00:03:40.290> the

mention still our four air vents in the

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.540 
mention still our four air vents in the
middle<00:04:43.030> of<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.240> dashboard<00:04:43.419> and<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:45.160> analog

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
middle of the dashboard and the analog

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.339 
middle of the dashboard and the analog
watch<00:04:46.050> for<00:04:47.050> air<00:04:47.259> vents<00:04:48.030> it's<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.419> it<00:04:49.930> has<00:04:50.110> kind

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
watch for air vents it's a it has kind

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.100 
watch for air vents it's a it has kind
of<00:04:50.380> a<00:04:50.470> heritage<00:04:50.919> and<00:04:51.660> it<00:04:52.660> gives<00:04:52.990> you<00:04:53.080> a

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
of a heritage and it gives you a

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.770 
of a heritage and it gives you a
possibility<00:04:53.289> to<00:04:53.979> make<00:04:54.280> these<00:04:54.940> air<00:04:55.240> vents<00:04:55.539> a

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
possibility to make these air vents a

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.800 
possibility to make these air vents a
little<00:04:56.110> bit<00:04:56.199> smaller<00:04:56.590> there<00:04:57.160> is<00:04:57.539> still<00:04:58.539> some

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
little bit smaller there is still some

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.719 
little bit smaller there is still some
technical<00:04:59.229> reasons<00:04:59.590> behind<00:04:59.740> it<00:05:00.039> so<00:05:00.250> we<00:05:00.460> need

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
technical reasons behind it so we need

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.969 
technical reasons behind it so we need
four<00:05:00.849> of<00:05:01.120> them<00:05:01.419> each<00:05:01.630> of<00:05:02.080> them<00:05:02.440> can<00:05:02.590> be<00:05:02.740> a<00:05:02.770> bit

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
four of them each of them can be a bit

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.189 
four of them each of them can be a bit
smaller<00:05:03.340> and<00:05:03.550> that's<00:05:03.690> aesthetically<00:05:04.690> nicer

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
smaller and that's aesthetically nicer

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.469 
smaller and that's aesthetically nicer
so<00:05:05.830> it<00:05:05.949> has<00:05:06.130> really<00:05:06.400> nice<00:05:06.520> haptics<00:05:07.030> if<00:05:07.240> you

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
so it has really nice haptics if you

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.510 
so it has really nice haptics if you
move<00:05:08.199> it<00:05:08.320> up<00:05:08.380> and<00:05:08.590> down<00:05:08.740> it<00:05:09.039> makes<00:05:09.190> a<00:05:09.280> little

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
move it up and down it makes a little

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.960 
move it up and down it makes a little
click<00:05:09.669> click<00:05:09.960> nice<00:05:10.960> details<00:05:11.380> and<00:05:11.650> the<00:05:12.580> analog
