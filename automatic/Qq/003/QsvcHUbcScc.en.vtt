our patented design works in conjunction

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.930 
our patented design works in conjunction
with<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:42.110> existing<00:00:42.860> om<00:00:43.310> throttle<00:00:43.820> and

with the existing om throttle and

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.360 
with the existing om throttle and
enables<00:00:44.900> the<00:00:45.050> rider<00:00:45.290> to<00:00:45.560> pull<00:00:45.890> on<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:46.220> trigger

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
easy trigger pole and what we call the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.470 
easy trigger pole and what we call the
pinch<00:00:59.810> which<00:01:00.320> combines<00:01:00.800> both<00:01:01.070> the

traditional and the trigger pole having
these<00:01:04.760> options<00:01:05.300> will<00:01:05.660> give<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.960> rider<00:01:06.170> a

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
these options will give the rider a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.830 
these options will give the rider a
greater<00:01:06.920> experience<00:01:07.510> because<00:01:08.510> they<00:01:08.690> will

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
greater experience because they will

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.840 
greater experience because they will
never<00:01:09.140> again<00:01:09.500> have<00:01:09.560> to<00:01:09.860> deal<00:01:10.220> with<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.580> pain

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
never again have to deal with the pain

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.050 
never again have to deal with the pain
and<00:01:11.300> fatigue<00:01:11.990> that<00:01:12.740> comes<00:01:13.010> along<00:01:13.340> with<00:01:13.580> riding

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
and fatigue that comes along with riding

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.660 
and fatigue that comes along with riding
an<00:01:14.240> ATV<00:01:14.560> just<00:01:15.560> using<00:01:16.070> your<00:01:16.190> thumb<00:01:16.460> I<00:01:18.490> loved<00:01:19.490> it

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
an ATV just using your thumb I loved it

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.000 
an ATV just using your thumb I loved it
I<00:01:19.790> thought<00:01:20.090> it<00:01:20.240> was<00:01:20.390> a<00:01:20.420> great<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:21.110> great

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
I thought it was a great a great

I thought it was a great a great
invention<00:01:22.400> I<00:01:23.410> actually<00:01:24.410> like<00:01:24.770> using<00:01:25.010> both<00:01:25.430> the

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
invention I actually like using both the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.980 
invention I actually like using both the
regular<00:01:26.480> throttle<00:01:26.930> and<00:01:27.760> this<00:01:28.760> together<00:01:29.210> pinch

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
regular throttle and this together pinch

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.050 
regular throttle and this together pinch
them<00:01:30.140> together<00:01:30.320> your<00:01:31.220> hands<00:01:31.490> surrounding<00:01:31.970> the

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
them together your hands surrounding the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.450 
them together your hands surrounding the
handlebars<00:01:32.720> just<00:01:32.990> kind<00:01:33.140> of<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.290> natural<00:01:33.770> feel

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
handlebars just kind of a natural feel

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.690 
handlebars just kind of a natural feel
to<00:01:34.700> it<00:01:34.850> I<00:01:35.350> liked<00:01:36.350> it<00:01:36.470> it<00:01:36.890> was<00:01:37.130> pretty<00:01:37.250> cool<00:01:37.550> I

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
to it I liked it it was pretty cool I

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.990 
to it I liked it it was pretty cool I
could<00:01:38.360> tell<00:01:38.890> instantaneously<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.880> know

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
could tell instantaneously you know

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.530 
could tell instantaneously you know
that's<00:01:41.659> always<00:01:41.990> been<00:01:42.200> my<00:01:42.409> biggest<00:01:42.650> issue<00:01:43.100> with

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
that's always been my biggest issue with

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.649 
that's always been my biggest issue with
with<00:01:44.540> riding<00:01:44.870> ATVs<00:01:44.990> is<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:46.420> strain<00:01:47.420> that<00:01:47.450> it

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
with riding ATVs is the strain that it

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.320 
with riding ATVs is the strain that it
puts<00:01:47.810> on<00:01:47.900> your<00:01:47.990> thumb<00:01:48.490> but<00:01:49.490> I<00:01:49.580> could<00:01:49.790> tell<00:01:50.000> that

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
puts on your thumb but I could tell that

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.410 
puts on your thumb but I could tell that
you<00:01:50.659> know<00:01:50.750> in<00:01:51.380> being<00:01:52.159> able<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.400> use<00:01:52.729> your<00:01:53.300> other

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
you know in being able to use your other

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.690 
you know in being able to use your other
finger<00:01:53.810> I<00:01:53.990> think<00:01:54.560> it<00:01:54.680> would<00:01:54.830> alleviate<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.610> lot

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
finger I think it would alleviate a lot

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.050 
finger I think it would alleviate a lot
of<00:01:55.850> that<00:01:56.950> yeah<00:01:57.950> I<00:01:58.220> have<00:01:58.549> I've<00:01:58.729> had<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:58.880> few

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
of that yeah I have I've had a few

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.760 
of that yeah I have I've had a few
customers<00:01:59.479> ask<00:01:59.659> if<00:01:59.840> there<00:02:00.020> are<00:02:00.049> any<00:02:00.170> products

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
customers ask if there are any products

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.350 
customers ask if there are any products
out<00:02:00.890> there<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.250> until<00:02:01.940> now<00:02:02.060> there<00:02:02.240> really

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
out there and until now there really

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.520 
out there and until now there really
hasn't<00:02:02.659> been<00:02:02.750> anything<00:02:03.080> close<00:02:03.260> to<00:02:03.290> this

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
hasn't been anything close to this

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.250 
hasn't been anything close to this
product<00:02:04.000> yeah<00:02:05.000> I<00:02:05.270> think<00:02:05.690> it'll<00:02:05.900> benefit

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
product yeah I think it'll benefit

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.730 
product yeah I think it'll benefit
everybody<00:02:06.590> that<00:02:06.890> uses<00:02:07.070> it<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:08.470> liked<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.619> lot
