00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:11.349
 Panasonic is using the led as a light source 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:14.120
 We can read light id signal carrying various information sent from there with smartphone 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:17.720
 Developed a technology that 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:23.090
 The conventional side is the sending side LED 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:29.420
 This would be I was there from 6 past in a place called flashing at high speed 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:30.170
 However, the brightness changes even when viewed with the human eye in order to read with a general smartphone 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.090
 Recognize 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:41.390
 It was a necessary mechanism. This is the human eye that we developed at Panasonic. 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:43.110
 It looks like it 's a high frequency that you can not see the flickering or the change in brightness at all 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.750
 I can do enough to make it fight 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.250
 This smartphone side that made it possible to read it with a general smartphone 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.660
 The technology of 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.660
 This is a feature 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:04.080
 The technology developed this time is a few hundred times faster than the conventional technology at a speed of several kilobits per second. 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:10.860
 It is possible to send and receive at high speed 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:14.380
 This technology is used as a supplement 2 for product explanation at the store or as a light source in the city 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.520
 Use as a solution to retrieve information from a signboard 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:24.130
 From digital signage 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.950
 The application which takes out more detailed information and receives explanations in other languages ​​is also considered. 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.719
 is 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:36.030
 Well then the technology will be the facility of the side shop that sends out 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:40.710
 It will be an explanation of public facilities, but receiving the information sent to it 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:45.720
 It will be people of the general consumer who pass by 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.940
 At the root of this technology development was that it was meaningless if it could not be used at Phong 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.360
 so 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:54.250
 Sorry Panasonic and not only Panasonic 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.670
 Perhaps you are the maker who finished the oscillator in various other forms 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.630
 Or any of the other IT system integrators 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.659
 So an alliance with everyone who develops services that use follow 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:10.959
 I think I should think about things like 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:17.400
 Panasonic is thinking of releasing a product that will transmit the light id by March 2016 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:17.400
 Full-scale business development is scheduled from fiscal 2016
