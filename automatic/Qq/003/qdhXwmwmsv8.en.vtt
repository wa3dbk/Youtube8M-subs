what<00:02:39.540> causes<00:02:39.720> detonation<00:02:40.230> this<00:02:40.350> is<00:02:40.470> really

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
what causes detonation this is really

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.780 
what causes detonation this is really
the<00:02:40.709> only<00:02:40.739> thing<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.069> kills<00:02:41.280> these<00:02:41.489> current

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
the only thing that kills these current

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.640 
the only thing that kills these current

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
two strokes with the gas nowadays you

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.559 
two strokes with the gas nowadays you
need<00:02:43.769> some<00:02:43.920> better<00:02:44.100> fuel<00:02:44.459> then<00:02:45.269> we<00:02:45.360> sent

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
need some better fuel then we sent

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.390 
need some better fuel then we sent
everything<00:02:45.660> off<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.110> millennium<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:47.250> can

everything off to millennium and you can
see<00:02:47.519> they<00:02:47.640> repaired<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.120> cylinder<00:02:48.620> really

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
see they repaired the cylinder really

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.380

it's a good option for you so since we

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.020 
it's a good option for you so since we
have<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.070> motor<00:03:32.280> part<00:03:32.549> we're<00:03:32.700> doing<00:03:32.880> some

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
have the motor part we're doing some

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.979 
have the motor part we're doing some
work<00:03:33.209> on<00:03:33.329> it<00:03:33.510> we<00:03:33.570> thought<00:03:33.720> it'd<00:03:33.810> be<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.930> good

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
work on it we thought it'd be a good

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.509 
work on it we thought it'd be a good
idea<00:03:34.109> to<00:03:34.320> add<00:03:34.410> some<00:03:34.590> performance<00:03:35.130> so<00:03:35.310> we<00:03:35.400> added

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
idea to add some performance so we added

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.180 
idea to add some performance so we added
the<00:03:35.640> V<00:03:35.790> force<00:03:36.260> recatch<00:03:37.290> which<00:03:37.769> works<00:03:37.950> really

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
the V force recatch which works really

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.180 
the V force recatch which works really
well<00:03:38.400> match<00:03:38.820> that<00:03:39.000> up<00:03:39.090> with<00:03:39.120> FMF<00:03:39.540> Fatih<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.049> a

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
well match that up with FMF Fatih and a

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.050 
well match that up with FMF Fatih and a
surety<00:03:41.190> silencer

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
surety silencer

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.830 
surety silencer
just<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.760> top<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.120> know<00:03:45.209> just<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.720> best

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
just the top you know just the best

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.180 
just the top you know just the best
parts<00:03:46.109> you<00:03:46.170> can<00:03:46.290> put<00:03:46.410> on<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.560> two-stroke<00:03:47.040> here

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
parts you can put on a two-stroke here

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.569 
parts you can put on a two-stroke here
work<00:03:47.370> really<00:03:47.579> well<00:03:47.810> it<00:03:48.810> helps<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.079> jetting

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
work really well it helps the jetting

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.090 
work really well it helps the jetting
run<00:03:50.579> really<00:03:50.850> clean<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:51.780> then<00:03:51.959> we<00:03:52.590> also<00:03:52.739> do<00:03:52.920> some

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
run really clean so then we also do some

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.650 
run really clean so then we also do some
a<00:03:53.190> new<00:03:53.400> chain<00:03:53.700> of<00:03:53.820> sprockets<00:03:54.209> on<00:03:54.299> so<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.540> should

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
a new chain of sprockets on so it should

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.630 
a new chain of sprockets on so it should
be<00:03:54.750> good<00:03:54.840> for<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:55.049> long<00:03:55.230> time<00:03:55.470> rental<00:03:56.100> chain<00:03:56.519> of

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
be good for a long time rental chain of

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.720 
be good for a long time rental chain of
sprockets<00:03:57.090> with<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.900> stock<00:03:58.109> gearing<00:03:58.730> works

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
sprockets with the stock gearing works

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.800 
sprockets with the stock gearing works
really<00:03:59.910> well<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.299> some<00:04:01.079> fat<00:04:01.709> bars<00:04:02.540> 604<00:04:03.540> the

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
really well and some fat bars 604 the
