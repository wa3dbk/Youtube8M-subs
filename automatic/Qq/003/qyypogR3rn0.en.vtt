the look right unfortunately I haven't
really<00:02:04.340> got<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.580> performance<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.300> the

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
really got the performance of the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.780 
really got the performance of the
handles<00:02:05.810> back<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.290> up<00:02:06.380> yet<00:02:06.650> in<00:02:07.220> America<00:02:07.700> they

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
handles back it up yet in America they

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.950 
handles back it up yet in America they
are<00:02:07.850> actually<00:02:07.940> going<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:08.240> get<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.390> two<00:02:08.660> liter

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
are actually going to get a two liter

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.750 
are actually going to get a two liter
version<00:02:09.260> whereas<00:02:10.130> balloon<00:02:10.310> actually<00:02:10.640> gonna

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
version whereas balloon actually gonna

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.250 
version whereas balloon actually gonna
get<00:02:10.940> over<00:02:11.090> here<00:02:11.420> it's<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.750> bit<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:11.990> shame

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
get over here it's a bit the shame

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.900 
get over here it's a bit the shame
because<00:02:12.560> otherwise<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.310> soul<00:02:13.520> would<00:02:13.580> seem<00:02:13.790> to

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
because otherwise the soul would seem to

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.630 
because otherwise the soul would seem to
make<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.060> lot<00:02:14.150> more<00:02:14.240> sense
