begin with but he wanted to add the

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.089 
begin with but he wanted to add the
flopping<00:01:39.569> element<00:01:40.050> to<00:01:40.170> his<00:01:40.259> game<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.800> try<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:41.099 
flopping element to his game to try and

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:42.410
