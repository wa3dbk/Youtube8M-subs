 Rain tires closed the boxes again 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:13.379
 The onset shortly before the start of drizzle was again ebbed 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:14.660
 and you decided 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.850
 Together, finally, the matter with slicks 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.570
 involved in the thing in the race over 18 laps tree 30 vehicles after all 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.189
 Basically it was only about 2 of the 38-year-old defending champion Hannes 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.800
 Heine from Mönchengladbach with the launch so embittered Bohg brother Klaus 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.120
 bloody winner of the two previous races the Soldo and 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.000
 on the Nürburgring 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.130
 on a 500 hp turbo buying Briton 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.030
 and equipped with envoy 30 more horsepower opposite the series 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.850
 UniCredit as a training game magpie 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.250
 on the best starting place 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.550
 even Vonlanthen Kids teammate Klaus Niedzwiedz 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.500
 were displaced into the second row 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.410
 is launched after Indianapolis car a so-called security state 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.030
 red and white checked letter and 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.290
 immediately takes the lead 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.710
 sharp in the blue country 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.710
 he shoots the second position from the second row 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.720
 Space, however, already in the first 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.900
 leave again 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.260
 pretty soon sat down 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.260
 and with some distance 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.440
 in the rest of the field 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.730
 her hits like "Oops 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.730
 then three years 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.870
 around 60 seconds 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.710
 with jokes and celebrations came 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.240
 2 e minor saving rate on celebration in lead 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.240
 Here he attacks the pliers in the Salzburg 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.230
 then he still has peace 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.180
 the remainder of the field was severely cut off 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.930
 Esther Kinsky I already after a few laps 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.930
 the underachieving 

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.939
 Ludwig still in front 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:18.019
 12 and 18 o'clock 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.259
 Kaya alone 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:21.359
 his fierce opponent is missing 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.059
 with lace came up 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.059
 and technical combat hanging somewhere on the track 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.769
 unfortunately could still in the closing stages 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:35.809
 without endangering the master of 1979, however, Bernsdorf 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.290
 So he is celebrating Klaus Ludwig Curtain 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.499
 under Sigi Müller 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.560
 by the way, the same finish 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.689
 as before wear 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.030
 that does not exactly speak 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.030
 for the diversity in this class 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.169
 the winner Klaus Ludwig tomorrow he travels to the USA 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.660
 Huber Beckstein weekend in Atlanta rivals American racing series 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.759
 participate 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:07.780
 his vehicle 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.540
 one prepared by his team Sax PID on Erfurt must be afraid 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.379
 Rendsburg championship in Germany that is big bred 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:35.859
 Automotive engineering 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.799
 uncompromising technology expensive technology 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.250
 a bit raw 2 of this racing series 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.709
 costs today around 300000 market 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.709
 at least as much gall formula-1 racer 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:56.789
 the reward for investment speed the goal 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.739
 in the big division over two liters displacement is the number for the victory 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.060
 in question are twice as big in the small 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.190
 4 namely 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.600
 Hans Stuck is very new in the BMW m1 Tobruk it is rumored this 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.370
 Device is by far the strongest horsepower man of course his cards 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.579
 discover exactly in the field 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.850
 However, brought in the long Bayern is not only joy 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.499
 a failure and a third place 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:31.080
 the team is certainly not the risen 800,000 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.689
 currently at 760p 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.750
 Bush but still it was a brand new car is not my problem with the 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:39.460
 Vote with only seven months 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.059
 one has today only for the third time on the racetrack ever 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:46.689
 and third place has been ok the car is competitive 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.609
 and will now show for the first time next week extensive test drives 

00:04:49.609 --> 00:04:52.609
 Companies and then have there to calm down 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.810
 The Porsche 935 was allowed by Doug Morris, the CSU is alerted 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.930
 closest to Stucks BMW but Dr 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.030
 has taken photo AP he weighs a good 50 pounds less 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.569
 the same applies to the Porsche of the French from Strasbourg though Act too 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:14.960
 only Polak both have already won a race this season 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.020
 that on the euro low last weekend 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.190
 Manfred Winkelhock from Reutlingen has already won the first race in 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.129
 Zolder World War as 600 hp when he was on top of the top riders 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:28.659
 the least will be under the hood 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:32.000
 that he just rubbed dry on the u2 and track the 

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:35.889
 Training fastest was due to the low weight under the wireless 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.719
 Handling stylist Ford Capri archway 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:41.719
 the start this time in slow motion 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.139
 fought to a momentous in the 1 to the top 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.770
 want big 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.789
 a real piece 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.909
 grows to the top 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:57.650
 but already at the entrance to the Motodrom 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.999
 three quarters 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:01.999
 in the case of the peasant women, followed by Obama 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:05.180
 Hamilton was 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.490
 Floor only up 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.490
 Problems with the 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.770
 and in fact after just one round the spotted one has to go to the pits 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.770
 Ignition misfire 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:32.409
 Jukic dropped off the summit the car probably needs some time yet 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:35.409
 Not only fast, it will also be stable 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:43.710
 the rest of the race 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.809
 is quick to tell the two researchers gates 

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:48.349
 Mosul 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:51.409
 alone at the top 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:52.990
 has visible 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.990
 to follow the difficulties 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.960
 Jochen Maas was already fix in the first round so wanted the bells 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.240
 on the race without recognizable 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.649
 protect sideways 

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:09.539
 the consequence of course is unfavorable EU helped the Nordic 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:13.469
 no chance to keep up 

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:23.399
 of the whole race, apparently 

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:27.960
 Vol at displaced the text where nine venues were able to keep up 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.399
 not to come by once 

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:33.369
 Maas in front of Polak 

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:35.610
 and so was also for a go 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.610
 but in the east 

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:42.610
 on Capri 

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.409
 7 of this division the third season 

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:47.949
 the third winner 

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:49.559
 Polak and Moers 

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:50.209
 they show
