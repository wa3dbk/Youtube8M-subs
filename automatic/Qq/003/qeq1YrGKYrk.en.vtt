00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660
 I hope to return 

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.660
 while receiving liverpool 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.150
 the euro oscillated 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.589
 more than 10% 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.039
 at the same time there is 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.589
 it's always in the goal's goal 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.589
 his home 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500
 julliard 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.600
 on this point he adds 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.170
 and that's it 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.280
 advised by the circumstances are still 100% 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.420
 he talks about his life 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.450
 France said 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.450
 more and more 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.080
 convenient 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.270
 thanks to their fate 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.270
 no one can ignore 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.879
 together these three there 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.409
 still bravo 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:41.119
 however not the arms 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:44.119
 external growth 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:47.619
 Friday 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.539
 for him the days to come 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:59.009
 problem 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.909
 beyond this sum
