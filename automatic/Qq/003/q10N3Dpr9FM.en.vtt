should<00:01:22.920> get<00:01:23.070> about<00:01:23.159> ten<00:01:23.610> point<00:01:24.000> nine<00:01:24.150> nine<00:01:26.210> ten

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
should get about ten point nine nine ten

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.100 
should get about ten point nine nine ten
point<00:01:27.450> nine<00:01:27.600> nine<00:01:27.630> nine<00:01:28.009> something<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.189> that

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
point nine nine nine something like that

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.020 
point nine nine nine something like that
are<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.229> trying<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:34.220> basically<00:01:35.220> stay<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
are you trying to basically stay on the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:51.460 
are you trying to basically stay on the
accelerator

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.000 

ah<00:01:51.610> there<00:01:52.610> we<00:01:52.700> go<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:53.480> I<00:01:53.810> could<00:01:54.200> be<00:01:54.380> my<00:01:54.560> record

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
ah there we go so I could be my record

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.900 
ah there we go so I could be my record
so<00:01:55.970> I<00:01:56.270> basically<00:01:56.720> stand<00:01:57.530> accelerator<00:01:58.490> right

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
so I basically stand accelerator right

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.810 
so I basically stand accelerator right
through<00:01:59.240> from<00:02:00.050> the<00:02:00.200> start<00:02:00.230> there<00:02:00.800> then<00:02:01.430> once

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
through from the start there then once

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.450 
through from the start there then once
it<00:02:02.060> hits<00:02:02.240> perfect<00:02:02.870> you<00:02:03.140> change<00:02:03.740> in<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:04.010> gear<00:02:04.190> too

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
it hits perfect you change in a gear too

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.610 
it hits perfect you change in a gear too
and<00:02:04.760> just<00:02:05.030> like<00:02:05.240> old<00:02:05.450> times<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:05.990> hit<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.440> nos

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
and just like old times you hit the nos

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.609 
and just like old times you hit the nos
at<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.040> same<00:02:07.340> time<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:08.030> gear<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.510> a<00:02:08.540> nos<00:02:08.869> and

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
at the same time so gear to a nos and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.440 
at the same time so gear to a nos and
you<00:02:09.770> kind<00:02:10.100> of<00:02:10.130> get<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.369> shares<00:02:10.610> like<00:02:10.820> perfect

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
you kind of get the shares like perfect

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.080 
you kind of get the shares like perfect
like<00:02:11.630> right<00:02:11.930> I'd<00:02:12.110> be<00:02:12.230> enough<00:02:12.530> perfect<00:02:13.130> let<00:02:14.000> me
