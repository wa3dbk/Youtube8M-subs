00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hello dear viewers today 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.020
 continue our landing experiment 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.240
 cucumber first in cassettes in small 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.340
 which we use for cabbage on 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.340
 then transfer to large pots 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.990
 then as usual landing in the garden also 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.820
 dear friends want to show you 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.949
 parallel what's pretty 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.740
 excellent shoots that is fine everything 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.170
 such a small percentage has gone 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.910
 on every rack not in the call that is 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.429
 we separate them immediately immediately someone 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.980
 not at all someone ascended very badly 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.590
 there is well whether the quality of the seeds 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.620
 talis preparation of the land that is possible 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.020
 this is not clear that is your opinion that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.129
 who thinks write share comments 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.840
 I will always be happy with a new opinion 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.379
 experimenting trying to find something 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.940
 new is better and more interesting and 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.280
 economical that is every opinion is very 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.680
 important but now we'll go here 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.030
 couple garden and we go to the very 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.180
 experiment to our 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.539
 that is, here here are the cucumbers that 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.119
 planted in these cabbage trays for in 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.159
 tapes they planted in it here already 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.409
 ready pots stand with holes 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.780
 that is, in previous videos when we 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.850
 cabbage rolled over I showed how these 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.430
 holes are made that is square 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.860
 such a device well here yet 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.920
 Thoughts yourself noted such a plus is 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.960
 what is seen already what the highlander went 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.060
 gone then we have something else you can 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.619
 leave will be fleece that is how well 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.990
 as far as you can see it has risen not 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.090
 Ascended, that is, and such 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.320
 confident plants that are good 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.299
 well we have already begun to grow them 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.000
 in fact, we will be transplanting now with 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.770
 that is, of course you are ready here 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.990
 here is just an example of course that is 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.079
 shoot half an hour and the video will not be very 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.909
 interesting to do with him and one 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.460
 same look but here is an example 2 Edge 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.439
 Now we put in the finished holes on 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.320
 neatly to paint on the size and 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.320
 drove and now transplanted so 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.090
 uncomplicated movement and see how it 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.870
 we will behave, that is, we separate them 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.760
 set aside 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.920
