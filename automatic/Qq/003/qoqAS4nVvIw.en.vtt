00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
first impressions of the tournament the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.560 
first impressions of the tournament the
place<00:00:29.340> obviously<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:30.029> mentioned<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.390> beach

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
place obviously you mentioned the beach

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.939 
place obviously you mentioned the beach
there<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:30.900> old<00:00:30.990> soul<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.470> setup<00:00:31.710> it's

there but old soul in the setup it's

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.069 
there but old soul in the setup it's
great<00:00:32.160> isn't<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.480> I've<00:00:33.480> never<00:00:33.690> been<00:00:33.930> here

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
great isn't it I've never been here

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.380 
great isn't it I've never been here
before<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.680> only<00:00:35.640> heard<00:00:35.820> good<00:00:35.880> things<00:00:36.090> about

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
before so I only heard good things about

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.450 
before so I only heard good things about
the<00:00:36.660> tournament<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.260> again<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.620> mean<00:00:37.860> what

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
the tournament and again I mean what

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.799 
the tournament and again I mean what
what<00:00:38.640> I've<00:00:38.760> they've<00:00:38.940> done<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.420> far<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.690> think

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
what I've they've done so far I think

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.220 
what I've they've done so far I think
it's<00:00:40.110> been<00:00:40.290> great<00:00:41.390> resurfacing<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.660> courts

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
it's been great resurfacing the courts

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.750 
it's been great resurfacing the courts
which<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.559> definitely<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.190> think<00:00:44.309> one<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
which is definitely I think one of the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.479 
which is definitely I think one of the
most<00:00:44.940> difficult<00:00:45.090> part<00:00:45.600> but<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:47.039> seems<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.399> be

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
most difficult part but it seems to be

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.060 
most difficult part but it seems to be
done<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.700> good<00:00:48.480> job<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:48.780> let's<00:00:49.739> hope<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.010> all

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
done a good job so let's hope we all

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.860 
done a good job so let's hope we all
perform<00:00:50.399> wall<00:00:50.610> here<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.030> mean<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.600> obviously

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
perform wall here I mean it's obviously

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.709 
perform wall here I mean it's obviously
proved<00:00:52.379> an<00:00:52.730> interesting<00:00:53.730> test<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.180> lot<00:00:54.629> of

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
proved an interesting test for a lot of

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.060 
proved an interesting test for a lot of
people<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.110> drawer<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.559> looking<00:00:55.920> really

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
people the drawer is looking really

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.529 
people the drawer is looking really
strong<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.730> guess<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.120> good<00:00:57.239> warm-up

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539

you gotta do week in and week out in

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.020 
you gotta do week in and week out in
this<00:01:20.130> sort<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.400> tournaments<00:01:20.820> then<00:01:20.909> where

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
this sort of tournaments then where

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.340 
this sort of tournaments then where
you've<00:01:21.119> never<00:01:21.270> been<00:01:21.479> before<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.840> guess<00:01:22.229> it

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
you've never been before I guess it

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.480 
you've never been before I guess it
doesn't<00:01:22.530> always<00:01:22.799> make<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.130> much<00:01:23.250> different

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
doesn't always make so much different

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.039 
doesn't always make so much different
but<00:01:23.580> what<00:01:23.700> sort<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:23.970> result<00:01:24.630> would<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.930> be

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
but what sort of result would you be

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.450 
but what sort of result would you be
looking<00:01:25.080> for<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.770> sort<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.009> stage<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
looking for in this sort of stage in the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.789 
looking for in this sort of stage in the
