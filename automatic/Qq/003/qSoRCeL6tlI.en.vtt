00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.470
 hello everyone as they are today are very 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.900
 well video past a lot of people asked me 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.730
 that will teach how I delineated the 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.880
 eyes then is what I'm going to teach you 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.400
 now names as thick as me the 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.259
 had made us videos but if this 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.880
 it's basically what I do already if you 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.130
 which is thicker can do it more 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.470
 thick and so the truth is the eyes 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.509
 it's a very very very easy thing is nothing 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.489
 more than you have to how to practice for 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.579
 that your hand gets used to doing the 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.800
 way you want if you build it to do 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.420
 the little line, because this one was 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.579
 that I have explained everything well 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.500
 know that this one has liked already know if yes 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.690
 they liked manito up if they have not 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.489
 subscribed and is the river button so that it 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.440
 subscribe and if they have something to tell me 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.300
 to which to ask are already commented 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.370
 below and if you are new extra that you 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.730
 like it very much and the next 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.370
 hello hello how can you see I have my 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.670
 concealer and powder base 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.980
 this is the liquid eyeliner that I use is 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.199
 de l'orÃ©al I like many of those that 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.009
 so that they are my esponjita stitch 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.860
 favorites 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.390
 I start doing a thin line 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.399
 starting from the outside corner and 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.159
 moving towards the inside 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.110
 it is much easier to go to the eyes of 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.820
 this way instead of being a line 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.700
 run as in the eye and up 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.270
 right now 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.270
 i 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.600
 for the list I make a line that goes 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.800
 from the corner of my eye to my eyebrows 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.800
 at the end of the eyebrow 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.220
 then a line is made connecting the 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.900
 line that I did before with the part of in 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.900
 half of my eye like this 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.020
 the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.770
 and finally the stuffing 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.330
 i 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.850
 Now for another eye I do the same 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.460
 I try to make the list like the 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.740
 other side not only guiding me by the 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.340
 tip of vice ja 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.340
 Y 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.210
 then I make another line and filled it in 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.210
 just as with the other eye 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.870
 if I do not feel like they look the same or similar 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.770
 it's for nothing two fix until I 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.770
 I think they look good 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.170
 there is music that is very black so I 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:50.260
 the line my eye inside 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.260
 after six tabs and I put on mascara 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.620
 and I finished the practice of what is all 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.750
 I promise you before filling my eyes 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.060
 of something so difficult for me but it is already 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.010
 much easier and it did not take as long as 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.160
 before I hope you liked it already 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.290
 you know if they liked little man up if 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.110
 they want to subscribe so there are in all 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.420
 my new videos already know button that 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.760
 subscribe and you have something that 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.140
 tell me and even discounts down better 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.140
 for the next dance
