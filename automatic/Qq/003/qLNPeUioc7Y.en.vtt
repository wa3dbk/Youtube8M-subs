00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
of you have seen his first thought is

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.130 
of you have seen his first thought is
stand<00:01:26.220> still<00:01:26.340> maybe<00:01:27.300> that'll<00:01:27.690> make<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.869> go

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
stand still maybe that'll make it go

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.410 
stand still maybe that'll make it go
away<00:01:28.640> that's<00:01:29.640> what<00:01:29.880> you're<00:01:30.000> trying<00:01:30.149> to

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
away that's what you're trying to

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.660 
away that's what you're trying to
achieve<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.080> don't<00:01:31.470> get<00:01:31.560> too<00:01:31.770> focused<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.369> what

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
achieve so don't get too focused on what

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.029 
achieve so don't get too focused on what
it<00:01:32.789> is<00:01:32.880> you're<00:01:33.090> using<00:01:33.679> remember<00:01:34.679> that<00:01:34.860> you're

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
it is you're using remember that you're

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.150 
it is you're using remember that you're
trying<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.459> establish<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:36.240> method<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.349> reaction

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
trying to establish a method of reaction

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.430 
trying to establish a method of reaction
and<00:01:38.310> you're<00:01:39.000> doing<00:01:39.179> that<00:01:39.420> by<00:01:39.660> rote<00:01:39.929> you<00:01:40.200> do<00:01:40.349> it

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
and you're doing that by rote you do it

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.260 
and you're doing that by rote you do it
enough<00:01:40.649> times<00:01:40.950> that's<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.640> first<00:01:42.060> thing

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
enough times that's the first thing

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.680 
enough times that's the first thing
he'll<00:01:42.479> try<00:01:42.810> when<00:01:43.500> he's<00:01:43.709> startled<00:01:44.190> so<00:01:44.940> paper

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
he'll try when he's startled so paper

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.740 
he'll try when he's startled so paper
bag<00:01:45.959> or<00:01:46.440> plastic<00:01:46.950> bag<00:01:47.130> rather<00:01:47.420> it's<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.479> pretty

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
bag or plastic bag rather it's a pretty

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.779 
bag or plastic bag rather it's a pretty
common<00:01:49.110> way<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.289> begin<00:01:49.470> doing<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.099> what<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.729> do

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
common way to begin doing this what I do

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.940 
common way to begin doing this what I do
is<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.539> know<00:01:51.569> he's<00:01:52.200> obviously<00:01:52.410> been<00:01:52.800> through

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
is you know he's obviously been through

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.949 
is you know he's obviously been through
this<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.190> lot<00:01:53.459> he<00:01:54.179> probably<00:01:54.390> thinks<00:01:54.599> it's<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
this a lot he probably thinks it's a

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599 
started on the other one you desensitize

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:43.930

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
bang so now once you get that space

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.140 
bang so now once you get that space
desensitized<00:06:00.800> you<00:06:01.460> want<00:06:01.669> to<00:06:01.759> bring<00:06:01.909> it<00:06:02.030> in

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
side in the right side and he sees it

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.850 
side in the right side and he sees it
out<00:06:35.419> of<00:06:35.539> the<00:06:35.599> other<00:06:35.719> eye<00:06:35.840> it's<00:06:36.289> a<00:06:36.380> completely

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:39.289 
different thing you got to start over

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:41.379 
different thing you got to start over
which<00:06:39.979> means<00:06:40.219> you<00:06:40.430> got<00:06:40.580> to<00:06:40.610> start<00:06:40.909> back<00:06:41.180> at<00:06:41.240> the

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:41.389 
which means you got to start back at the

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:43.570 
which means you got to start back at the
beginning<00:06:41.539> once<00:06:42.469> you<00:06:42.620> get<00:06:42.770> to<00:06:42.919> this<00:06:43.070> point<00:06:43.370> on

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 
this side

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.710 
this side
that<00:06:44.669> doesn't<00:06:44.939> mean<00:06:45.000> you<00:06:45.120> start<00:06:45.419> at<00:06:45.509> this

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
that doesn't mean you start at this

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.530 
and you start from scratch on the other

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.580 
and you start from scratch on the other
side<00:06:53.479> when<00:06:54.479> you<00:06:54.539> get<00:06:54.719> to<00:06:54.840> this<00:06:54.960> point<00:06:55.229> you<00:06:55.349> tie

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
side when you get to this point you tie

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.649 
side when you get to this point you tie
it<00:06:55.650> in<00:06:55.860> knots<00:06:56.069> at<00:06:56.250> the<00:06:56.280> top<00:06:56.580> and<00:06:57.240> again<00:06:57.509> you

00:06:57.649 --> 00:06:57.659 
it in knots at the top and again you

00:06:57.659 --> 00:06:59.659 
it in knots at the top and again you
desensitize<00:06:58.349> the<00:06:58.500> space<00:06:58.740> away<00:06:59.039> from<00:06:59.310> you<00:06:59.490> and

00:06:59.659 --> 00:06:59.669 
desensitize the space away from you and
