it is so that's a possibility for sure

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.740 
it is so that's a possibility for sure
but<00:01:40.430> generally<00:01:40.970> once<00:01:41.240> you<00:01:41.360> start<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:41.630> get

I<00:01:43.670> usually<00:01:44.390> recommend<00:01:44.570> with<00:01:44.870> beginning

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
I usually recommend with beginning

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
I usually recommend with beginning
because<00:01:45.440> you<00:01:45.470> have<00:01:45.710> no<00:01:45.830> business<00:01:45.950> doing

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
because you have no business doing

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.040 
because you have no business doing
sticking<00:01:46.940> your<00:01:47.000> face<00:01:47.180> in<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.420> duck<00:01:47.600> down<00:01:47.780> over

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
sticking your face in the duck down over

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.780 
sticking your face in the duck down over
the<00:01:48.140> dog<00:01:48.290> anyway<00:01:48.740> at<00:01:48.860> that<00:01:48.890> point<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:49.760> should

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
the dog anyway at that point you should

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.520 
the dog anyway at that point you should
get<00:01:50.210> much<00:01:50.570> more<00:01:50.810> comfortable<00:01:51.200> with<00:01:51.350> what's

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
get much more comfortable with what's

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.810 
get much more comfortable with what's
happening<00:01:51.860> before<00:01:52.190> you<00:01:52.280> start<00:01:52.490> doing<00:01:52.640> that

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
happening before you start doing that

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.410 
happening before you start doing that
kind<00:01:53.030> of<00:01:53.090> thing

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
kind of thing

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.120 
kind of thing
but<00:01:53.720> as<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:53.990> progress<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.650> dogs<00:01:54.830> give<00:01:55.070> you

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
but as you progress the dogs give you

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.730 
but as you progress the dogs give you
plenty<00:01:55.340> of<00:01:55.460> warning<00:01:55.550> almost<00:01:56.330> always<00:01:56.740> feeling

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
plenty of warning almost always feeling

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.170 
plenty of warning almost always feeling
it<00:01:57.950> in<00:01:58.010> the<00:01:58.070> sleeve<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:58.490> their<00:01:58.730> body<00:01:58.940> language

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
it in the sleeve and their body language

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.970 
it in the sleeve and their body language
and<00:01:59.570> their<00:01:59.690> voice<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.440> everything<00:02:00.860> will

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
and their voice and everything will

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.700 
and their voice and everything will
change<00:02:01.010> right<00:02:01.520> so<00:02:01.909> you<00:02:02.000> again<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:03.230> dogs<00:02:03.500> don't

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
change right so you again the dogs don't

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.710 
change right so you again the dogs don't
go<00:02:03.890> from<00:02:04.480> that<00:02:05.480> they<00:02:06.140> start<00:02:06.409> to<00:02:06.500> go<00:02:07.599> and<00:02:08.599> then

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
go from that they start to go and then

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.930 
go from that they start to go and then
you<00:02:08.810> go<00:02:08.840> that's<00:02:09.409> too<00:02:09.530> much<00:02:09.649> you<00:02:10.250> alleviate<00:02:10.640> the

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
you go that's too much you alleviate the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.729 
you go that's too much you alleviate the
pressure<00:02:11.120> so<00:02:11.659> that<00:02:11.810> they<00:02:11.900> don't<00:02:12.019> leap<00:02:12.319> off<00:02:12.500> or

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
pressure so that they don't leap off or

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.530 
pressure so that they don't leap off or
whatever<00:02:13.010> else<00:02:13.280> it<00:02:13.430> is<00:02:13.550> right<00:02:13.760> or<00:02:14.209> I<00:02:14.239> stress

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
whatever else it is right or I stress

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.449 
whatever else it is right or I stress
them<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.110> I<00:02:15.230> if<00:02:15.590> they<00:02:15.800> start<00:02:16.069> to<00:02:16.190> show<00:02:16.310> me

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
them and I if they start to show me

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.479 
them and I if they start to show me
stress<00:02:16.700> signs<00:02:16.909> I<00:02:17.150> let<00:02:17.599> them<00:02:17.720> win<00:02:17.930> or<00:02:18.260> I<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.950> shift

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
stress signs I let them win or I I shift

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.860 
stress signs I let them win or I I shift
my<00:02:19.670> behavior<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.120> turn<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.450> pressure<00:02:20.629> off

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
my behavior I turn the pressure off

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.170 
my behavior I turn the pressure off
whatever<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:22.099> bring<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.519> back<00:02:22.549> in<00:02:22.909> little

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
whatever and bring it back in little

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.789 
whatever and bring it back in little
increments<00:02:23.450> until<00:02:23.780> they're<00:02:24.019> nonreactive<00:02:24.319> to

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
increments until they're nonreactive to

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.020 
increments until they're nonreactive to
it<00:02:25.569> so<00:02:26.569> with<00:02:26.720> all<00:02:26.870> of<00:02:26.900> our<00:02:27.080> stressors<00:02:28.030> again

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
it so with all of our stressors again

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.809 
it so with all of our stressors again
our<00:02:29.150> basic<00:02:29.540> rule<00:02:29.690> of<00:02:29.720> thumb<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.379> always<00:02:31.220> off

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
our basic rule of thumb is always off

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.270 
our basic rule of thumb is always off
the<00:02:32.030> bike<00:02:32.209> first<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.170> if<00:02:33.740> you<00:02:33.860> take<00:02:34.010> anything

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
the bike first so if you take anything

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.460 
the bike first so if you take anything
about<00:02:34.550> stressors<00:02:35.030> away<00:02:35.420> with<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:35.780> that<00:02:36.290> would

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
about stressors away with you that would

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.730 
about stressors away with you that would
be<00:02:36.560> one<00:02:36.830> of<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.040> things

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
be one of the things

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.890 
be one of the things
don't<00:02:37.980> institute<00:02:38.700> any<00:02:38.970> new<00:02:39.360> stressor<00:02:39.780> the

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
don't institute any new stressor the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.590 
don't institute any new stressor the
first<00:02:40.200> time<00:02:40.470> while<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.250> dogs<00:02:41.460> biting<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:42.480> it

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
first time while the dogs biting do it

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.760 
first time while the dogs biting do it
when<00:02:42.750> they're<00:02:42.870> off<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.260> bite<00:02:43.410> they're

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
when they're off the bite they're

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.530 
when they're off the bite they're
frustrated<00:02:44.370> see<00:02:44.640> how<00:02:44.790> they're<00:02:44.940> gonna<00:02:45.000> respond

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
frustrated see how they're gonna respond

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.240 
frustrated see how they're gonna respond
so<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.110> they<00:02:46.350> don't<00:02:46.500> superstitiously

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
so that they don't superstitiously

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.820 
so that they don't superstitiously
associate<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.120> with<00:02:48.150> biting<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:49.560> if<00:02:49.620> they<00:02:49.710> have

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
associate it with biting so if they have

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.560 
associate it with biting so if they have
a<00:02:49.860> bad<00:02:50.070> reaction<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.760> they're<00:02:50.850> biting<00:02:51.210> then

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
a bad reaction and they're biting then

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.240 
a bad reaction and they're biting then
they<00:02:51.690> associate<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.470> emotional<00:02:52.920> state<00:02:53.070> with

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
they associate that emotional state with

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.190 
they associate that emotional state with
biting<00:02:53.460> we<00:02:54.000> potentially<00:02:54.300> damage<00:02:54.930> their

biting we potentially damage their

biting we potentially damage their
they're<00:02:55.620> biting<00:02:56.010> so<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.760> be<00:02:56.880> conservative<00:02:57.420> we

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
they're biting so to be conservative we

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.870 
they're biting so to be conservative we
always<00:02:58.260> show<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.830> dog<00:02:58.980> some<00:02:59.310> kind<00:02:59.520> of<00:02:59.580> stress

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
always show the dog some kind of stress

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.480 
always show the dog some kind of stress

push them with the stick a little bit to

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.940 
push them with the stick a little bit to

the stick I'm moving around anything but

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.360 
the stick I'm moving around anything but

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.220 
introduce those stressors when the dog's
not<00:03:17.670> biting<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.390> if<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.570> dog<00:03:18.690> starts<00:03:19.020> to<00:03:19.110> have

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
not biting so if the dog starts to have

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.990 
not biting so if the dog starts to have
about<00:03:19.380> our<00:03:19.560> reaction<00:03:20.040> we<00:03:20.370> can<00:03:20.490> alleviate<00:03:20.730> the

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
about our reaction we can alleviate the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.790 
about our reaction we can alleviate the
stress<00:03:21.210> in<00:03:21.390> return<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:21.990> then<00:03:22.440> when<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.680> dog

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
stress in return and then when the dog

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.410 
stress in return and then when the dog
is<00:03:22.830> nonreactive<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.940> it<00:03:24.060> then<00:03:24.300> we'll

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
is nonreactive to it then we'll

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.930 
is nonreactive to it then we'll
eventually<00:03:24.720> do<00:03:25.050> it<00:03:25.170> in<00:03:25.290> small<00:03:25.650> doses<00:03:26.310> wow

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
eventually do it in small doses wow

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.210 
eventually do it in small doses wow

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
right as a decoy so I may find him

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.560 
right as a decoy so I may find him
really<00:04:31.080> really<00:04:31.110> hard<00:04:31.910> if<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.120> depending<00:04:33.510> on

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
really really hard if it depending on

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.790 
really really hard if it depending on
where<00:04:33.810> he<00:04:33.900> is<00:04:33.930> in<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.140> progression<00:04:34.500> I<00:04:34.590> built

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
where he is in the progression I built

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.950 
where he is in the progression I built
it<00:04:34.920> up<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:35.190> now<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.730> really<00:04:36.180> put<00:04:36.450> it<00:04:36.540> on<00:04:36.660> him<00:04:36.840> I

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
it up and now I I really put it on him I

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.240 
it up and now I I really put it on him I
give<00:04:37.140> him<00:04:37.230> a<00:04:37.260> 30<00:04:37.470> second<00:04:37.740> fight<00:04:37.890> I'm<00:04:38.040> hitting

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
give him a 30 second fight I'm hitting

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.620 
give him a 30 second fight I'm hitting
with<00:04:38.370> sticks<00:04:38.640> I'm<00:04:38.850> banging<00:04:39.240> him<00:04:39.330> into<00:04:39.480> things

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
with sticks I'm banging him into things

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.140 
with sticks I'm banging him into things
but<00:04:39.780> in<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:39.960> end<00:04:39.990> he<00:04:40.350> beats<00:04:40.530> me<00:04:40.770> right<00:04:41.160> so<00:04:41.820> in

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
but in the end he beats me right so in

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.660 
but in the end he beats me right so in
training<00:04:42.660> and<00:04:42.780> then<00:04:43.470> we<00:04:43.980> hope<00:04:44.220> that<00:04:44.520> he

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
training and then we hope that he

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.780 
training and then we hope that he
carries<00:04:45.030> that<00:04:45.060> on<00:04:45.300> against

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
carries that on against

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.250 
carries that on against
and<00:04:46.030> stronger<00:04:46.270> and<00:04:46.390> stronger<00:04:46.510> so<00:04:46.780> that<00:04:46.960> he

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
and stronger and stronger so that he

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.710 
and stronger and stronger so that he
gets<00:04:47.470> to<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:47.680> point<00:04:47.920> where<00:04:48.640> nothing<00:04:49.360> that

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
gets to a point where nothing that

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.590 
gets to a point where nothing that
anybody<00:04:50.080> will<00:04:50.290> do<00:04:50.470> to<00:04:50.620> him<00:04:50.830> in<00:04:51.040> his<00:04:51.550> career<00:04:52.270> has

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
anybody will do to him in his career has

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.600 
anybody will do to him in his career has
chosen<00:04:52.990> discipline<00:04:53.320> whatever<00:04:53.620> it<00:04:53.740> is<00:04:53.860> will

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
chosen discipline whatever it is will

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.910 
chosen discipline whatever it is will
will<00:04:55.030> shake<00:04:55.390> his<00:04:55.540> confidence<00:04:55.570> he<00:04:56.320> knows<00:04:56.560> in

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
will shake his confidence he knows in

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.640 
will shake his confidence he knows in
his<00:04:57.070> heart<00:04:57.130> that<00:04:57.340> he<00:04:57.520> can<00:04:57.640> beat<00:04:57.850> this<00:04:58.060> thing

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
his heart that he can beat this thing

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.500 
his heart that he can beat this thing
and<00:04:59.650> that's<00:05:00.070> our<00:05:00.250> goal<00:05:00.280> in<00:05:00.820> training<00:05:01.300> always

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
and that's our goal in training always

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.600 
and that's our goal in training always
to<00:05:01.930> make<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.230> dog<00:05:02.410> stronger<00:05:03.010> more<00:05:03.160> confident

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
to make the dog stronger more confident

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.800 
to make the dog stronger more confident
better<00:05:03.910> is<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:05.050> goal<00:05:05.230> so<00:05:06.150> how<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.210> dog<00:05:07.510> wins

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
better is the goal so how the dog wins

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.200 
better is the goal so how the dog wins
depends<00:05:08.740> a<00:05:08.920> lot<00:05:09.100> on<00:05:09.160> the<00:05:09.310> dog<00:05:09.580> their

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
depends a lot on the dog their

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.810 
depends a lot on the dog their
motivation<00:05:10.840> what's<00:05:11.350> rewarding<00:05:11.560> to<00:05:11.950> them<00:05:12.130> and

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
motivation what's rewarding to them and

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.700 
motivation what's rewarding to them and
how<00:05:13.240> long<00:05:13.540> and<00:05:13.840> how<00:05:13.930> much<00:05:14.080> I<00:05:14.170> can<00:05:14.320> stress<00:05:14.530> them

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
how long and how much I can stress them

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.440 
how long and how much I can stress them
before<00:05:14.980> they<00:05:15.100> win<00:05:15.280> is<00:05:15.820> a<00:05:15.880> function<00:05:16.300> of<00:05:16.390> the

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
before they win is a function of the

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.240 
before they win is a function of the
dog's<00:05:16.630> genetic<00:05:17.080> confidence<00:05:17.560> and<00:05:17.800> where<00:05:18.100> they

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
dog's genetic confidence and where they

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.860 
dog's genetic confidence and where they
are<00:05:18.370> in<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.610> training<00:05:18.850> process<00:05:19.090> how<00:05:19.660> far

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
are in the training process how far

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.750 
are in the training process how far
along<00:05:19.960> they<00:05:20.260> are<00:05:20.290> so<00:05:21.250> if<00:05:21.310> it's<00:05:21.460> just<00:05:21.640> the

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
along they are so if it's just the

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.430 
along they are so if it's just the
object<00:05:22.300> so<00:05:22.600> if<00:05:22.660> my<00:05:22.840> dog<00:05:23.050> for<00:05:23.350> instance<00:05:23.710> is

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
object so if my dog for instance is

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.500 
object so if my dog for instance is
uncertain<00:05:26.440> about<00:05:26.820> something<00:05:27.820> new<00:05:28.120> things

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
uncertain about something new things

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.480 
uncertain about something new things
that<00:05:28.690> make<00:05:28.840> me<00:05:28.960> wait<00:05:29.200> then<00:05:29.800> you<00:05:29.830> playing<00:05:30.310> with

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
that make me wait then you playing with

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.280 
that make me wait then you playing with
the<00:05:30.610> dog<00:05:30.790> and<00:05:31.120> make<00:05:31.510> noise<00:05:31.750> with<00:05:32.020> certain

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
the dog and make noise with certain

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.110 
the dog and make noise with certain
things<00:05:32.320> and<00:05:32.800> the<00:05:32.920> dog<00:05:33.070> gets<00:05:33.340> desensitized<00:05:33.970> to

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
things and the dog gets desensitized to

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.150 
things and the dog gets desensitized to
that<00:05:34.210> and<00:05:34.960> it<00:05:35.080> gets<00:05:35.260> habituated<00:05:35.770> to<00:05:35.800> them<00:05:35.980> and

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
that and it gets habituated to them and

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.620 
that and it gets habituated to them and
then<00:05:36.250> it<00:05:36.370> no<00:05:36.460> longer<00:05:36.790> bothers<00:05:37.150> them<00:05:37.300> so<00:05:37.510> for

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
then it no longer bothers them so for

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.820 
then it no longer bothers them so for
sure<00:05:37.810> the<00:05:37.930> handler<00:05:38.230> can<00:05:38.380> do<00:05:38.440> that<00:05:38.590> kind<00:05:38.800> of

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
sure the handler can do that kind of

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.740 
sure the handler can do that kind of
thing<00:05:39.010> so<00:05:39.460> you<00:05:39.520> could<00:05:39.820> be<00:05:40.150> waving<00:05:40.480> the<00:05:40.570> stick

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
thing so you could be waving the stick

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.080 
thing so you could be waving the stick
around<00:05:40.870> and<00:05:41.560> with<00:05:42.070> the<00:05:42.160> dog<00:05:42.310> and<00:05:42.580> get<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:42.970> dog

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
around and with the dog and get the dog

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.700 
around and with the dog and get the dog
used<00:05:43.330> to<00:05:43.450> the<00:05:43.570> stick<00:05:43.750> that<00:05:43.900> way<00:05:44.110> and<00:05:44.320> it<00:05:44.620> would

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
used to the stick that way and it would

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.100 
used to the stick that way and it would
carry<00:05:44.920> over<00:05:45.340> into<00:05:46.300> lots<00:05:46.750> of<00:05:46.870> different

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
carry over into lots of different

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.260 
carry over into lots of different
situations<00:05:47.290> the<00:05:48.070> place<00:05:48.310> that<00:05:48.430> it<00:05:48.580> doesn't<00:05:49.060> is

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
situations the place that it doesn't is

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.480 
situations the place that it doesn't is
when<00:05:49.510> there's<00:05:49.690> kind<00:05:49.930> of<00:05:49.990> intent<00:05:50.530> behind<00:05:51.070> it

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
when there's kind of intent behind it

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.070 
when there's kind of intent behind it
when<00:05:51.910> we<00:05:52.030> get<00:05:52.210> into<00:05:52.390> the<00:05:52.510> dogs<00:05:52.690> and<00:05:52.960> that

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
when we get into the dogs and that

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.760 
when we get into the dogs and that
pressure<00:05:53.500> shifts<00:05:53.680> from<00:05:54.310> simply<00:05:54.850> the<00:05:54.880> item<00:05:55.480> an

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
pressure shifts from simply the item an

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.710 
pressure shifts from simply the item an
environmental<00:05:56.770> thing<00:05:56.800> to<00:05:57.730> the<00:05:58.420> way<00:05:58.540> it's

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
environmental thing to the way it's

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.480 
environmental thing to the way it's
being<00:05:58.870> wielded<00:05:59.380> and<00:05:59.560> it<00:05:59.800> has<00:05:59.950> an<00:06:00.100> aspect<00:06:00.370> of

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
being wielded and it has an aspect of

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.860 
being wielded and it has an aspect of
personal<00:06:00.910> pressure<00:06:01.090> or<00:06:01.300> physical<00:06:01.690> pressure

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
personal pressure or physical pressure

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.210 
personal pressure or physical pressure
that's<00:06:02.080> coming<00:06:02.230> with<00:06:02.500> it<00:06:02.650> and<00:06:02.800> then<00:06:03.100> the

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
that's coming with it and then the

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.310 
that's coming with it and then the
handler<00:06:03.610> can't<00:06:03.910> you<00:06:04.510> sensitize<00:06:04.960> the<00:06:05.080> dog<00:06:05.200> to

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
handler can't you sensitize the dog to

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.040 
handler can't you sensitize the dog to
that<00:06:05.440> right<00:06:05.820> because<00:06:06.820> the<00:06:07.090> dog<00:06:07.480> obviously

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
that right because the dog obviously

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.240 
that right because the dog obviously
knows<00:06:08.230> you're<00:06:08.440> not<00:06:08.560> gonna<00:06:08.710> hurt<00:06:08.920> him

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
knows you're not gonna hurt him

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.680 
knows you're not gonna hurt him
so<00:06:09.460> the<00:06:09.580> dogs<00:06:09.730> in<00:06:09.850> a<00:06:09.910> certain<00:06:10.180> state<00:06:10.360> of<00:06:10.390> mind

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
so the dogs in a certain state of mind

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.450 
so the dogs in a certain state of mind
with<00:06:11.020> their<00:06:11.230> handler<00:06:11.590> but<00:06:11.830> they're<00:06:11.980> not<00:06:12.220> in

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
with their handler but they're not in

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.510 
with their handler but they're not in
with<00:06:13.000> this<00:06:13.300> other<00:06:13.510> guy<00:06:13.750> that<00:06:14.080> maybe<00:06:14.650> will<00:06:15.310> hurt

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
with this other guy that maybe will hurt

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.780 
with this other guy that maybe will hurt
them<00:06:15.730> right<00:06:16.090> so<00:06:16.890> you<00:06:17.890> can<00:06:18.100> desensitize<00:06:18.400> the

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:18.790 
them right so you can desensitize the

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.610 
them right so you can desensitize the
dog<00:06:18.940> to<00:06:19.120> the<00:06:19.240> object<00:06:19.750> or<00:06:19.990> habituate<00:06:20.470> to<00:06:20.500> the

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
dog to the object or habituate to the

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.410 
dog to the object or habituate to the
dog<00:06:20.740> to<00:06:20.860> the<00:06:20.890> object<00:06:21.370> so<00:06:21.730> like<00:06:21.880> I<00:06:22.000> recommend

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.420 
dog to the object so like I recommend

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.820 
dog to the object so like I recommend
all<00:06:22.540> the<00:06:22.570> time<00:06:22.810> playing<00:06:23.050> hugged<00:06:23.380> with<00:06:23.680> your

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
all the time playing hugged with your

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.040 
all the time playing hugged with your
dogs<00:06:24.070> in<00:06:24.730> all<00:06:24.880> kinds<00:06:25.150> of<00:06:25.180> environmental<00:06:25.630> stuff

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
dogs in all kinds of environmental stuff

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.470 
dogs in all kinds of environmental stuff
right<00:06:26.410> so<00:06:26.860> I<00:06:26.890> have<00:06:27.130> plastic<00:06:27.550> bottles<00:06:27.940> around<00:06:28.270> I

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
right so I have plastic bottles around I

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.720
