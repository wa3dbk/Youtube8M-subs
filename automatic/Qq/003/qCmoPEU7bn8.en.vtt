load times are okay they're not slow and
they're<00:03:06.350> not<00:03:06.470> super<00:03:06.800> fast<00:03:07.220> but<00:03:07.730> they're

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
they're not super fast but they're

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.410 
they're not super fast but they're
perfect<00:03:09.070> okay<00:03:10.070> controls<00:03:10.790> are<00:03:10.970> weird<00:03:11.000> because

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
perfect okay controls are weird because

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.060 
perfect okay controls are weird because
you're<00:03:11.660> supposed<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:11.990> hold<00:03:12.110> this<00:03:12.290> sideways<00:03:12.800> so

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
you're supposed to hold this sideways so

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.310 
you're supposed to hold this sideways so
it's<00:03:13.220> kind<00:03:13.370> of<00:03:13.430> hard<00:03:13.490> for<00:03:13.700> me<00:03:13.820> to<00:03:14.000> do<00:03:14.150> that<00:03:14.320> if

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
it's kind of hard for me to do that if

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.390 
it's kind of hard for me to do that if
these<00:03:15.530> two<00:03:15.770> hands<00:03:16.040> I<00:03:16.280> like<00:03:16.640> total<00:03:17.240> pick<00:03:17.450> code

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
these two hands I like total pick code

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.910 
these two hands I like total pick code
and<00:03:19.400> i'll<00:03:20.390> use<00:03:20.800> just<00:03:21.800> a<00:03:21.920> standard<00:03:22.340> card<00:03:23.920> i'll

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
and i'll use just a standard card i'll

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.950 
and i'll use just a standard card i'll
put<00:03:25.100> off<00:03:25.220> my<00:03:25.370> back<00:03:25.550> hi<00:03:25.820> this<00:03:26.300> is<00:03:26.330> my<00:03:26.570> second

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
circuit okay I'll just do a solo all

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.740 
circuit okay I'll just do a solo all
right<00:03:37.130> now<00:03:37.430> I<00:03:37.460> can't<00:03:37.910> really<00:03:38.060> play<00:03:38.390> with<00:03:38.510> one

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
right now I can't really play with one

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.480 
right now I can't really play with one
hand<00:03:38.990> so<00:03:39.320> don't<00:03:39.560> expect<00:03:39.680> this<00:03:40.070> to<00:03:40.220> be<00:03:40.250> like

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
hand so don't expect this to be like

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.280 
hand so don't expect this to be like
super<00:03:40.910> awesome<00:03:41.270> gameplay<00:03:41.540> this<00:03:41.960> is<00:03:42.080> just

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
super awesome gameplay this is just

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.160 
super awesome gameplay this is just
proof<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.770> works<00:03:43.330> hold<00:03:44.330> two<00:03:44.600> down<00:03:44.930> to

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
proof that it works hold two down to

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.730 
proof that it works hold two down to
accelerate<00:03:45.770> I<00:03:46.070> see<00:03:46.550> I<00:03:46.580> don't<00:03:46.850> have<00:03:46.970> a<00:03:47.030> wee

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
accelerate I see I don't have a wee

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.650 
accelerate I see I don't have a wee
steering<00:03:48.740> wheel<00:03:48.950> so<00:03:49.280> it<00:03:49.430> doesn't<00:03:49.670> really<00:03:49.760> look

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
steering wheel so it doesn't really look

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:58.460 
steering wheel so it doesn't really look
like<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:51.080> either

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.839 

kind<00:03:59.470> of<00:03:59.530> hard<00:03:59.739> to<00:03:59.830> play<00:04:00.069> with<00:04:00.220> one<00:04:00.400> hand<00:04:00.640> or

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
kind of hard to play with one hand or

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.030 
kind of hard to play with one hand or
whatever<00:04:03.810> all<00:04:04.810> right<00:04:05.050> now<00:04:05.230> I<00:04:05.260> bet<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.860> first

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
whatever all right now I bet the first

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
comment saying how do I do this well my

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.420 
comment saying how do I do this well my
answer<00:04:10.420> is<00:04:10.599> i<00:04:11.110> am<00:04:11.349> not<00:04:11.530> going<00:04:11.769> to<00:04:11.980> tell<00:04:12.190> you

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
answer is i am not going to tell you

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.640 
answer is i am not going to tell you
because<00:04:12.760> i<00:04:13.239> did<00:04:13.540> not<00:04:13.569> create<00:04:13.989> this<00:04:14.230> software

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
because i did not create this software

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.060 
because i did not create this software
and<00:04:15.040> I<00:04:15.299> did<00:04:16.299> not<00:04:16.329> make<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.810> game<00:04:17.070> anything

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
and I did not make the game anything

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.370 
and I did not make the game anything
anything<00:04:18.459> like<00:04:18.790> that<00:04:18.820> I<00:04:19.239> I<00:04:19.269> had<00:04:19.750> nothing<00:04:20.109> to<00:04:20.229> do

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
anything like that I I had nothing to do

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.450 
anything like that I I had nothing to do
with<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:20.650> creation<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:22.800> sorry<00:04:23.800> it<00:04:24.280> would

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
with the creation and sorry it would

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.570 
with the creation and sorry it would
take<00:04:24.610> me<00:04:24.760> forever<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:25.240> tell<00:04:25.570> you<00:04:25.780> how<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.110> do<00:04:26.380> it

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
take me forever to tell you how to do it

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.790 
take me forever to tell you how to do it
my<00:04:27.580> wii<00:04:27.790> has<00:04:28.090> been<00:04:28.330> updated<00:04:28.840> with<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.020> 4.0

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
my wii has been updated with the 4.0

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.300 
my wii has been updated with the 4.0
firmware<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:31.380> this<00:04:32.380> is<00:04:32.410> proof<00:04:32.800> that<00:04:32.830> it<00:04:33.100> does

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
firmware so this is proof that it does

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.460 
firmware so this is proof that it does
work<00:04:33.700> with<00:04:34.150> backup<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:36.780> hopefully<00:04:37.780> you<00:04:37.900> can

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
work with backup and hopefully you can

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.550 
work with backup and hopefully you can
figure<00:04:38.710> it<00:04:38.919> out<00:04:39.040> and<00:04:39.910> good<00:04:40.870> luck<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.290> you<00:04:41.410> if

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
figure it out and good luck to you if

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.020 
figure it out and good luck to you if
you<00:04:41.590> do<00:04:41.800> if<00:04:41.919> you<00:04:42.040> do<00:04:42.190> try<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.490> figure<00:04:42.729> it<00:04:42.850> out

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
you do if you do try to figure it out

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.530 
you do if you do try to figure it out
and<00:04:44.610> so<00:04:45.610> yeah<00:04:45.880> that's<00:04:46.360> it<00:04:46.630> and<00:04:48.090> i'm<00:04:49.090> just<00:04:49.330> gonna

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
and so yeah that's it and i'm just gonna

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.129 
and so yeah that's it and i'm just gonna
epic<00:04:50.350> fail<00:04:50.680> here<00:04:51.220> Maya<00:04:51.970> one-handed<00:04:52.690> driving

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
epic fail here Maya one-handed driving

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.210 
epic fail here Maya one-handed driving
skills<00:04:54.120> but<00:04:55.120> yeah<00:04:55.240> obviously<00:04:55.570> sent<00:04:56.110> some<00:04:56.410> this

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
skills but yeah obviously sent some this

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.460 
skills but yeah obviously sent some this
game<00:04:57.460> didn't<00:04:58.030> come<00:04:58.210> with<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.570> since<00:04:59.290> when<00:04:59.440> I
