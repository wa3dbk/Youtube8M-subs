00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
months and my first puncture was just

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.020 
months and my first puncture was just

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
today and it was this thing

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.619 
today and it was this thing
a<00:00:38.300> rather<00:00:39.300> large<00:00:39.450> thought<00:00:40.219> this<00:00:41.219> thorn<00:00:41.629> went

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
a rather large thought this thorn went

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.290 
a rather large thought this thorn went
through<00:00:43.129> the<00:00:44.129> tiles<00:00:44.610> themselves<00:00:44.730> are

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
through the tiles themselves are

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.720 
through the tiles themselves are
supposed<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.719> be<00:00:46.280> reinforced<00:00:47.280> went<00:00:47.550> through

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
supposed to be reinforced went through

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.830 
supposed to be reinforced went through
the<00:00:47.879> tire<00:00:48.149> went<00:00:48.510> through<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:50.840> luckily

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the tire went through this and luckily

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.889 
the tire went through this and luckily
it<00:00:52.100> plugged<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.309> puncture<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> didn't<00:00:54.750> get

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
it plugged the puncture so I didn't get

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.299 
it plugged the puncture so I didn't get
a<00:00:54.960> flaw<00:00:57.620> but<00:01:00.079> when<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.109> had<00:01:01.440> my<00:01:01.620> previous<00:01:02.070> Baker

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
a flaw but when I had my previous Baker

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.600 
a flaw but when I had my previous Baker
had<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:02.969> 12<00:01:03.359> years<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:04.860> I've<00:01:05.250> only<00:01:05.400> ever

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
had it for 12 years and I've only ever

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.560 
had it for 12 years and I've only ever
used<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:07.200> same<00:01:07.500> set<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.130> tire<00:01:09.000> liners<00:01:09.360> were

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
used the same set of tire liners were

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.480 
used the same set of tire liners were
the<00:01:09.750> reinforced<00:01:10.200> plastic<00:01:10.710> ones<00:01:10.860> just<00:01:11.340> like

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the reinforced plastic ones just like

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.670 
the reinforced plastic ones just like
these<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.110> never<00:01:13.380> not<00:01:14.159> once<00:01:14.430> ever<00:01:15.650> had<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
these and I never not once ever had a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.010 
these and I never not once ever had a
puncture<00:01:17.220> ever<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:19.880> having<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.479> liners<00:01:21.840> out

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
puncture ever and having the liners out

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.190 
puncture ever and having the liners out
like<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.439> I've<00:01:22.710> tried<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:24.390> put<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> storm

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
like this I've tried to put a storm

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.460 
like this I've tried to put a storm
through<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.970> will<00:01:27.330> not<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.990> through<00:01:28.259> you

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
through this it will not go through you

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.859 
through this it will not go through you
and<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.640> can't<00:01:29.880> do<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.090> with<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.390> hand<00:01:30.420> by

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
and I can't do it with one hand by

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.830 
and I can't do it with one hand by
Sharia<00:01:31.549> I've<00:01:32.549> tried<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.210> put<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.600> through

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
here and it will go through very easily
