00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
and a quick size comparison between the

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.529 
and a quick size comparison between the
three<00:01:40.560> mikey<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.580> shortest<00:01:41.970> among<00:01:42.300> the

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
three mikey is the shortest among the

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.850 
three mikey is the shortest among the
two<00:01:43.319> other<00:01:43.530> brothers<00:01:43.739> Leo<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.910> Raph<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.860> he

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
two other brothers Leo and Raph and he

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.369 
two other brothers Leo and Raph and he
has<00:01:47.069> a<00:01:47.310> lighter<00:01:47.789> color<00:01:47.910> than<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.869> other<00:01:49.259> two

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:49.379 
has a lighter color than the other two

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:51.859 
has a lighter color than the other two
so<00:01:50.160> i'm<00:01:50.310> guessing<00:01:50.550> also<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.239> Donatello

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
so i'm guessing also that Donatello

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.320 
so i'm guessing also that Donatello
after<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.800> review<00:01:53.340> would<00:01:53.819> still<00:01:54.090> keep

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
after this review would still keep

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.660 
after this review would still keep
Michelangelo<00:01:55.050> as<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.649> lightest<00:01:56.190> in<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
Michelangelo as the lightest in the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.729 
Michelangelo as the lightest in the
shortest<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.390> before<00:01:58.050> we<00:01:58.080> go<00:01:58.229> through<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:58.739 
shortest and before we go through the

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:01.160 
shortest and before we go through the
articulation<00:01:59.340> points<00:01:59.369> let<00:02:00.360> me<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:00.959> show<00:02:01.140> you

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
articulation points let me just show you

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.609 
articulation points let me just show you
one<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.770> nunchucks<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.989> it's<00:02:03.989> more<00:02:04.440> like

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
one of the nunchucks and it's more like

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.859 
one of the nunchucks and it's more like
this<00:02:04.860> way<00:02:05.099> I<00:02:05.399> was<00:02:05.729> hoping<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.420> would<00:02:06.660> be<00:02:06.840> a

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
this way I was hoping that it would be a

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.040 
this way I was hoping that it would be a
flexible<00:02:07.739> weapon<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.539> do<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> lot<00:02:10.019> of

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
flexible weapon so you can do a lot of

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.559 
flexible weapon so you can do a lot of
poses<00:02:10.709> with<00:02:10.890> Mikey<00:02:11.250> but<00:02:11.489> unfortunately<00:02:12.390> it's

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
poses with Mikey but unfortunately it's

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.250 
poses with Mikey but unfortunately it's
molded<00:02:13.050> in<00:02:13.319> one<00:02:13.530> way<00:02:13.709> although<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:14.819> kind<00:02:15.090> of

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
molded in one way although it's kind of

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.050 
molded in one way although it's kind of
molded<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.560> soft<00:02:16.830> plastic<00:02:17.340> but<00:02:17.580> there's

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
molded in a soft plastic but there's

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.729 
molded in a soft plastic but there's
basically<00:02:18.420> nothing<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:19.080> can<00:02:19.200> do<00:02:19.349> when<00:02:19.620> it

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
basically nothing you can do when it

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.160 
basically nothing you can do when it
comes<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.209> possibility<00:02:21.209> for<00:02:21.480> Michelangelo

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
comes to possibility for Michelangelo

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.550 
comes to possibility for Michelangelo
and<00:02:22.730> now<00:02:23.730> for<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.150> articulation<00:02:24.989> points<00:02:25.019> we

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
and now for the articulation points we

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.780 
and now for the articulation points we
have<00:02:25.769> a<00:02:25.920> head<00:02:26.220> shoulder<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.450> elbow<00:02:28.459> wrist<00:02:29.459> and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
have a head shoulder and elbow wrist and

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.320 
have a head shoulder and elbow wrist and
leg<00:02:30.830> articulation<00:02:31.830> just<00:02:32.190> like<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.790> other<00:02:33.000> two

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
leg articulation just like the other two

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.479 
leg articulation just like the other two
turtles<00:02:34.319> and<00:02:34.760> then<00:02:35.760> we<00:02:35.970> have<00:02:36.269> a<00:02:37.489> shorter

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
turtles and then we have a shorter

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.680 
turtles and then we have a shorter
bandana<00:02:39.120> here<00:02:39.720> at<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.709> back<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.190> then<00:02:42.090> we

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
bandana here at the back and then we

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.660 
bandana here at the back and then we
have<00:02:42.840> some<00:02:43.080> holsters<00:02:43.470> here<00:02:43.710> for<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.190> nunchuck

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
have some holsters here for the nunchuck

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.520 
have some holsters here for the nunchuck
so

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
so

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.020 
so
just<00:02:45.770> what<00:02:46.010> one<00:02:46.220> of<00:02:46.250> them<00:02:46.840> for<00:02:47.840> example<00:02:49.030> we

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
just what one of them for example we

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.930 
just what one of them for example we
have<00:02:50.240> my<00:02:50.660> heat<00:02:51.010> not<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:52.130> sure<00:02:52.280> if<00:02:52.430> I'm<00:02:52.550> doing<00:02:52.730> it

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
have my heat not so sure if I'm doing it

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.320 
have my heat not so sure if I'm doing it
correctly<00:02:53.180> but<00:02:53.630> this<00:02:54.230> is<00:02:54.380> how<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.459> think<00:02:56.120> it

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
correctly but this is how I think it

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.430 
correctly but this is how I think it
should<00:02:56.870> be<00:02:57.940> huh<00:02:58.940> you<00:02:59.510> can<00:02:59.720> use<00:03:00.319> your

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
should be huh you can use your

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.290 
should be huh you can use your
imagination<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.160> how<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.430> holster<00:03:01.790> at<00:03:02.060> least

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
imagination and how to holster at least

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.840 
imagination and how to holster at least
on<00:03:02.510> Chuck's<00:03:02.840> but<00:03:03.080> one<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:03.770> them<00:03:03.890> can<00:03:04.190> be<00:03:04.340> done

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
on Chuck's but one of them can be done

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.350 
on Chuck's but one of them can be done
like<00:03:05.239> this<00:03:05.450> or<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:06.260> can<00:03:06.500> slightly<00:03:06.980> fold<00:03:07.430> the

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.760 
like this or you can slightly fold the
other<00:03:08.660> one<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.319> just<00:03:10.100> try<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.370> fit<00:03:10.880> it<00:03:11.090> in<00:03:11.330> on

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
other one and just try to fit it in on

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:21.670 
other one and just try to fit it in on

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
comparison but the rest is really

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.479 
comparison but the rest is really
