LG themselves we've already taken a look
at<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.130> lockscreen<00:02:01.430> animation<00:02:02.150> but<00:02:02.300> we<00:02:02.390> can

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
at the lockscreen animation but we can

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.240 
at the lockscreen animation but we can
see<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.840> applications<00:02:03.560> tray<00:02:03.800> looks<00:02:03.950> quite

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
see the applications tray looks quite

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.670 
see the applications tray looks quite
different<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:05.180> if<00:02:05.450> we<00:02:05.480> jump<00:02:05.840> into<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.230> themes

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
different and if we jump into the themes

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.800 
different and if we jump into the themes
we<00:02:07.460> can<00:02:07.640> see<00:02:07.820> you've<00:02:07.910> got<00:02:08.000> a<00:02:08.060> range<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.510> themes

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
we can see you've got a range of themes

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.930 
we can see you've got a range of themes
if<00:02:09.080> we<00:02:09.440> tap<00:02:09.679> through<00:02:09.920> on<00:02:10.010> marshmallows<00:02:10.340> i

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.110 
if we tap through on marshmallows i
select<00:02:11.360> applies<00:02:11.800> we<00:02:12.800> can<00:02:12.950> also<00:02:13.160> see<00:02:13.550> so<00:02:13.970> it

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
select applies we can also see so it

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.510 
select applies we can also see so it
really<00:02:14.360> does<00:02:14.630> top-to-toe<00:02:15.200> swap<00:02:16.010> out<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.370> look

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
really does top-to-toe swap out the look

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.520 
really does top-to-toe swap out the look
and<00:02:16.700> feel<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:16.940> not<00:02:17.239> only<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.660> application<00:02:18.410> the

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
and feel of not only the application the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.000 
and feel of not only the application the

background etc even your widgets so
let's<00:02:22.160> see<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.400> why<00:02:22.520> it's<00:02:22.700> not<00:02:22.790> going<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.030> be

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120
