place you can see when it pops because

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.830 
place you can see when it pops because
it<00:04:30.350> goes<00:04:30.470> flush<00:04:30.710> across<00:04:31.100> the<00:04:31.310> top<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:32.750> then

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
it goes flush across the top and then

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.270 
it goes flush across the top and then
you<00:04:32.960> drop<00:04:33.230> in<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.500> screw<00:04:33.800> from<00:04:34.040> each<00:04:34.190> side

front<00:06:10.210> surprisingly<00:06:11.210> light<00:06:11.599> because<00:06:12.020> I've

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
front surprisingly light because I've

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.739 
front surprisingly light because I've
removed<00:06:12.800> so<00:06:13.189> much<00:06:13.430> metal<00:06:13.699> from<00:06:14.029> the<00:06:14.060> blade<00:06:14.419> it

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:17.980 
removed so much metal from the blade it
is<00:06:14.900> a<00:06:14.930> hell<00:06:15.499> of<00:06:15.529> a<00:06:15.830> knife<00:06:16.039> I<00:06:16.370> figure<00:06:17.060> you<00:06:17.960> know

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
is a hell of a knife I figure you know

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.269

first<00:06:22.550> knife<00:06:22.789> this<00:06:23.029> might<00:06:23.240> be<00:06:23.419> you<00:06:23.749> know<00:06:23.779> might

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:24.229 
first knife this might be you know might

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:25.719 
first knife this might be you know might
be<00:06:24.259> a<00:06:24.409> modern-day<00:06:24.830> replacement<00:06:25.490> for<00:06:25.669> it

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729 
be a modern-day replacement for it

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:28.149
