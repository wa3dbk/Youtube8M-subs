right<00:02:41.370> away<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.209> this<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:42.540> another<00:02:42.660> one

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
right away is that this is another one

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.170 
right away is that this is another one
of<00:02:43.319> those<00:02:43.440> characters<00:02:44.010> who<00:02:44.040> unfortunately<00:02:44.760> is

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
of those characters who unfortunately is

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.440 
of those characters who unfortunately is
very<00:02:45.840> disproportionate<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:47.280> scale<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.940> way

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
very disproportionate the scale is way

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.870 
very disproportionate the scale is way

bites from the cartoon series where you

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.199 
bites from the cartoon series where you
can<00:02:52.530> see<00:02:52.860> how<00:02:53.100> massive<00:02:53.430> he<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:53.970> standing

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
can see how massive he is standing

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.760 
can see how massive he is standing
alongside<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.989> Ninja<00:02:55.290> Turtles

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
alongside the Ninja Turtles

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.400 
alongside the Ninja Turtles
and<00:02:56.180> here's<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.330> new<00:02:57.450> spider<00:02:57.750> bites<00:02:58.020> action

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
and here's the new spider bites action

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.560 
and here's the new spider bites action
figure<00:02:58.709> standing<00:02:59.489> next<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.850> turtle<00:03:00.209> figure

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
figure standing next to a turtle figure

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.280 
figure standing next to a turtle figure
he<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.320> tiny<00:03:02.250> in<00:03:02.580> comparison<00:03:02.959> aside<00:03:03.959> from<00:03:04.110> the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
he is tiny in comparison aside from the

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.990 
he is tiny in comparison aside from the
fact<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.620> his<00:03:04.830> spider<00:03:05.130> legs<00:03:05.400> stick<00:03:05.700> pretty

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
fact that his spider legs stick pretty

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.300 
fact that his spider legs stick pretty
far<00:03:06.330> off<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.630> top<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.840> his<00:03:07.050> head<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.860> actual

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
far off the top of his head the actual

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.000 
far off the top of his head the actual
figure<00:03:08.700> itself<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.570> less<00:03:10.110> than<00:03:10.290> half<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.590> size

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
figure itself is less than half the size

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.160 
figure itself is less than half the size
of<00:03:11.220> one<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.610> Ninja<00:03:11.880> Turtles<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:13.019> is

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
of one of the Ninja Turtles so this is

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.140 
of one of the Ninja Turtles so this is
another<00:03:13.470> case<00:03:13.739> where<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:14.160> figure<00:03:14.459> looks<00:03:14.820> good

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
another case where the figure looks good

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.650 
another case where the figure looks good
but<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.690> way<00:03:16.500> too<00:03:16.560> small<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:18.269> let's<00:03:18.300> go<00:03:18.600> ahead

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
but is way too small so let's go ahead

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.180 
but is way too small so let's go ahead
and<00:03:18.780> take<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.019> look<00:03:19.200> at<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.380> articulation<00:03:19.650> on

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
and take a look at the articulation on

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.880 
and take a look at the articulation on
this<00:03:20.370> guy<00:03:20.660> unfortunately<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:22.050> as<00:03:22.350> well<00:03:22.650> is

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
this guy unfortunately that as well is

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.190 
this guy unfortunately that as well is
pretty<00:03:23.160> limited<00:03:23.430> now<00:03:24.330> each<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.720> those<00:03:24.870> spider

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
pretty limited now each of those spider

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.720 
pretty limited now each of those spider
legs<00:03:25.470> that<00:03:25.620> we<00:03:25.739> popped<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.130> on<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.310> top<00:03:26.519> are

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
legs that we popped in on the top are

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.090 
legs that we popped in on the top are
ball<00:03:27.300> jointed<00:03:27.810> which<00:03:28.019> means<00:03:28.260> all<00:03:28.620> four<00:03:28.920> those

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
ball jointed which means all four those

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.380 
ball jointed which means all four those
legs<00:03:29.370> have<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.640> ability<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.000> kind<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.239> move

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
legs have the ability to kind of move

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.000 
legs have the ability to kind of move
forwards<00:03:30.870> backwards<00:03:31.110> roll<00:03:31.650> all<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:31.890> way

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
forwards backwards roll all the way

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.400 
forwards backwards roll all the way
around<00:03:32.430> in<00:03:32.670> addition<00:03:33.510> they<00:03:33.660> have<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.900> single

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
around in addition they have a single

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.009 
around in addition they have a single
joint<00:03:34.680> hinge<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:35.820> that<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.090> can<00:03:36.299> move<00:03:36.570> all<00:03:36.959> of

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
joint hinge so that you can move all of

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.199 
joint hinge so that you can move all of
the<00:03:37.410> spider<00:03:37.680> legs<00:03:37.950> up<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.489> down<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:39.000> kind<00:03:39.150> of

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
the spider legs up and down and kind of

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.729 
the spider legs up and down and kind of
bend<00:03:39.420> them<00:03:39.570> around<00:03:39.810> so<00:03:40.170> when<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.440> stretch

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
bend them around so when you stretch

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.560 
bend them around so when you stretch
them<00:03:40.890> all<00:03:41.070> out<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.549> does<00:03:41.970> make<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.299> figure

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
them all out it does make the figure

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.060 
them all out it does make the figure
look<00:03:42.750> taller<00:03:43.019> plus<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:43.500> can<00:03:43.620> get<00:03:43.739> some<00:03:43.890> really

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
look taller plus you can get some really

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.460 
look taller plus you can get some really
cool<00:03:44.190> really<00:03:45.030> creepy-looking<00:03:45.720> spider<00:03:45.930> leg

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
cool really creepy-looking spider leg

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.120 
cool really creepy-looking spider leg
poses<00:03:46.890> out<00:03:47.010> of<00:03:47.130> those<00:03:47.989> but<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.590> rest<00:03:49.890> of<00:03:50.070> the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
poses out of those but the rest of the

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.600 
poses out of those but the rest of the
figure<00:03:50.310> below<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:51.060> is<00:03:51.360> pretty<00:03:52.110> static<00:03:52.610> the

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
figure below that is pretty static the

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.390 
figure below that is pretty static the
legs<00:03:54.030> are<00:03:54.390> molded<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:55.170> place<00:03:55.500> in<00:03:55.769> that<00:03:56.010> battle

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
legs are molded in place in that battle

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.190 
legs are molded in place in that battle
stance<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:56.910> they<00:03:57.000> do<00:03:57.060> not<00:03:57.510> move<00:03:57.690> at<00:03:57.930> all

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
stance and they do not move at all

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.259 
stance and they do not move at all
the<00:03:58.650> only<00:03:58.860> other<00:03:59.040> articulation<00:03:59.700> we<00:03:59.820> get<00:04:00.060> are

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
the only other articulation we get are

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.210 
the only other articulation we get are
with<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.600> arms<00:04:00.900> which<00:04:01.110> are<00:04:01.290> ball<00:04:01.620> jointed<00:04:02.040> so

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
with the arms which are ball jointed so

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.280 
with the arms which are ball jointed so
the<00:04:02.340> arms<00:04:02.549> can<00:04:02.670> roll<00:04:02.910> around<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.420> move<00:04:03.870> up<00:04:04.110> and

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
the arms can roll around and move up and

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.560 
the arms can roll around and move up and
down<00:04:04.500> but<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.100> hands<00:04:05.489> do<00:04:05.670> not<00:04:05.700> swivel<00:04:06.239> there

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
down but the hands do not swivel there

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.720 
down but the hands do not swivel there
is<00:04:06.660> no<00:04:06.870> elbow<00:04:07.170> bends<00:04:07.470> there<00:04:07.920> is<00:04:08.100> no<00:04:08.400> other

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
is no elbow bends there is no other

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.850 
is no elbow bends there is no other
articulation<00:04:09.600> so<00:04:09.870> most<00:04:10.230> of<00:04:10.380> this<00:04:10.530> figures

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
articulation so most of this figures

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.250 
articulation so most of this figures
articulation<00:04:11.610> are<00:04:11.790> all<00:04:12.239> found<00:04:12.600> in<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.959> spider

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
articulation are all found in the spider

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.130 
articulation are all found in the spider
legs<00:04:13.470> growing<00:04:13.890> out<00:04:14.100> of<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.250> top<00:04:14.459> of<00:04:14.489> his<00:04:14.730> head

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.170

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.580 
he's really small he's just got very
minimal<00:04:26.610> articulation<00:04:27.420> but<00:04:27.750> I<00:04:27.960> will<00:04:28.320> still

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
minimal articulation but I will still

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.960 
minimal articulation but I will still
say<00:04:28.770> at<00:04:28.920> the<00:04:29.040> end<00:04:29.160> of<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.280> day<00:04:29.400> he's<00:04:29.610> a<00:04:29.640> very

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
say at the end of the day he's a very

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.480 
say at the end of the day he's a very
cool-looking<00:04:30.390> action<00:04:31.260> figure<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.800> think<00:04:32.340> the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
cool-looking action figure I think the

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.460 
cool-looking action figure I think the
character<00:04:33.030> itself<00:04:33.480> was<00:04:33.660> translated<00:04:34.260> well

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
character itself was translated well

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.740 
character itself was translated well
into<00:04:34.800> action<00:04:35.190> figure<00:04:35.430> form<00:04:35.730> I<00:04:35.940> think<00:04:36.450> some

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
into action figure form I think some

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.210 
into action figure form I think some
fans<00:04:37.050> are<00:04:37.200> probably<00:04:37.410> just<00:04:37.860> going<00:04:38.010> to<00:04:38.100> be

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
fans are probably just going to be

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.610 
fans are probably just going to be
slightly<00:04:38.580> disappointed<00:04:39.360> in<00:04:39.480> the<00:04:39.930> lack<00:04:39.960> of<00:04:40.290> his

height and also with the lack of

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.500 
height and also with the lack of
