on her that just sent home for me the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.650 
on her that just sent home for me the
many<00:02:28.350> layers<00:02:28.740> of<00:02:29.250> racism<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.210> way<00:02:30.420> that

many layers of racism and the way that

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.840 
many layers of racism and the way that
it<00:02:30.810> would<00:02:30.960> affect<00:02:31.350> even<00:02:31.800> your<00:02:32.130> relationship

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
it would affect even your relationship

with your well-meaning perhaps friends
it<00:02:36.000> also<00:02:36.210> made<00:02:36.480> me<00:02:36.510> think<00:02:36.900> about<00:02:37.050> my

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
it also made me think about my

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.740 
it also made me think about my
responsibility<00:02:38.550> in<00:02:38.730> situations<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:39.600> that

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
the impetus for writing men we reaped is

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.120 
the impetus for writing men we reaped is
that<00:02:42.150> Jasmine<00:02:42.570> Ward<00:02:42.780> lost<00:02:43.080> five<00:02:43.410> men<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.770> her

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
that Jasmine Ward lost five men in her

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.280 
that Jasmine Ward lost five men in her
life<00:02:44.160> within<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.940> very<00:02:45.150> short<00:02:45.330> period<00:02:45.630> of<00:02:46.230> time

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
life within a very short period of time

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.980 
life within a very short period of time
most<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.370> them<00:02:47.580> were<00:02:47.610> friends<00:02:48.360> but<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.720> first

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
most of them were friends but the first

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.960 
most of them were friends but the first
was<00:02:49.260> her<00:02:49.440> brother<00:02:49.770> they<00:02:50.130> were<00:02:50.190> all<00:02:50.400> very<00:02:50.610> young

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
was her brother they were all very young

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.030 
was her brother they were all very young
in<00:02:51.270> most<00:02:51.480> cases<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:52.140> starting<00:02:52.590> their<00:02:52.740> lives

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
in most cases just starting their lives

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.560 
in most cases just starting their lives
so<00:02:53.370> these<00:02:53.520> deaths<00:02:53.820> were<00:02:53.910> all<00:02:54.180> extremely

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
so these deaths were all extremely

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.660 
so these deaths were all extremely
tragic<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.710> circumstances<00:02:55.740> under<00:02:56.550> which

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
tragic the circumstances under which

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.030 
tragic the circumstances under which
each<00:02:57.000> diver<00:02:57.330> very<00:02:57.720> different<00:02:58.350> and<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.650> think<00:02:58.920> it

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
each diver very different and I think it

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.640 
each diver very different and I think it
paints<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.460> very<00:02:59.760> complex<00:03:00.450> picture<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:01.170> what

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
paints a very complex picture of what

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.800 
paints a very complex picture of what
it's<00:03:01.800> like<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.220> be<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.640> black<00:03:02.700> man<00:03:03.240> living<00:03:03.510> in

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
it's like to be a black man living in

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.050 
it's like to be a black man living in
the<00:03:03.960> United<00:03:04.320> States<00:03:04.350> perhaps<00:03:05.160> especially<00:03:05.340> in

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
the United States perhaps especially in

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.120 
the United States perhaps especially in
the<00:03:06.180> south<00:03:06.420> but<00:03:06.750> I<00:03:06.780> don't<00:03:07.230> think<00:03:07.470> exclusively

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
the south but I don't think exclusively

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.710 
the south but I don't think exclusively
at<00:03:08.220> all<00:03:08.340> whether<00:03:08.700> it's<00:03:08.940> this<00:03:09.090> underlying

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
at all whether it's this underlying

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.260 
at all whether it's this underlying
hopelessness<00:03:10.350> about<00:03:10.860> things<00:03:11.190> ever<00:03:11.550> changing

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
hopelessness about things ever changing

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.420 
hopelessness about things ever changing
especially<00:03:12.450> when<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.260> comes<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.590> economic
