00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.590
 video tutorial regarding the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.210
 halloween period 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.790
 I had so much fun e 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.730
 obviously now as you know it will start again 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.680
 another important period or 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.320
 party tricks because we are now 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.870
 already in November so in a month 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.239
 let's say a month and a half is Christmas 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.949
 in other words, it will start again 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.360
 definitely another very time 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.190
 intense with regards to videos 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.860
 More special tutorials today I have 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.300
 realized this this look that 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.580
 let's say make-up is the makeup I wear 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.070
 more often in these days I have 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.140
 worn more often in recent months e 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.120
 that you asked me in so many 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.320
 started with asking me lipstick in 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.890
 this time I decided not to use 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.320
 rubiu badly used another than of the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.690
 marilyn collection the only lipstick that 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.940
 I bought that very cute and I think 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.960
 is a little more delicate than the view 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.930
 it's less strong, I have been worshiping 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.670
 this look and use precisely red 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.189
 on the lips I assure you it really is 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.140
 very simple no guys with the set 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.329
 I leave you with the realization of the look 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.899
 I'll send you a big kiss see you at 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.899
 next video 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.560
 first use the eye primer 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.630
 I go and spread it over the whole grain 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.890
 movable eyelid that does not and eyebrows e 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.369
 also in the lower part of the eye 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.990
 from the device of color mine 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.690
 found then to pick up a beige color 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.330
 manning amat that I apply over all mine 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.200
 pro mobile part at the inner corner e 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.350
 immediately below and easy to use then 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.590
 a caramel color that faded to the corner 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.700
 outside of the eye and inside the 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.130
 fold 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.900
 this will be the only color I will go to 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.519
 also bring inside the fold 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.100
 eye only this time around the corner 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:19.569
 outside I'm going to blend a little brown 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.250
 but I recommend for this trick 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.709
 I recommend using only eye shadows 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.140
 map that give my opinion an effect more 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.060
 elegant and marry very well with the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.970
 red lipstick again this year ad 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.260
 add the right touch of black mat 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.510
 therefore use an eye shadow that is not 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.510
 too writing and not even dusty 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.690
 until the runner line also appears 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.980
 very natural and well shaded with 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.640
 other colors used on the eyelid 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.280
 mobile 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.410
 I'm going to outline a pencil line 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.290
 brown matt on the own of the cabinet 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.180
 and with really light touches and I apply 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.150
 this same pencil also in the rhyme 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.940
 superior as my usual to give a 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.790
 more sensual touch to the look I add 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.920
 fake eyelashes and these are among the 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.800
 my favorite, I love the port 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.170
 very often but obviously like in every other 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.730
 my tutorial this step is optional 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.570
 finally with regards to makeup 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.580
 Of the eyes 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:22.300
 I add a bit of mascara only on the 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:24.520
 upper lashes as a start-up base 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.959
 applying a primer and this is one of the 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.900
 my favorites because besides having a 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.090
 matting effect also carries 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.530
 however, a purifying action 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.930
 use only on special occasions 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.030
 and certainly not one day ago 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.459
 very opaque powder color of which not 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.800
 I can do without more and of which I 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.260
 I have spoken in several videos there 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.840
 benefit flawless that I use all the 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.310
 days and I like a lot 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.860
 I know it is not a product without 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.440
 silicones but I'm finding very well the 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.209
 my skin is not greasy mid-day e 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.160
 link at the end of the day the feeling of 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.860
 wearing them really comfortable has 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.769
 recently rediscovered this browser el that 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.910
 not used for a long time and that I love 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.920
 especially this part that has 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.180
 picked up for precisely going to 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.640
 surround my face 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.489
 I find it perfect is the shade of 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.660
 brown neither too cold nor too hot 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.970
 suitable to go just to give a little 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.040
 volume to the face ok now let's go to 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.280
 cover the signs of fatigue a little 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.260
 highly nominated and used lately 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.950
 the stargazer corrector that goes by 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.780
 mix with an orange shade for 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:34.360
 just go and cover the discoloration 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:36.130
 given by my little eyes other 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.010
 product has rescued from the collection 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.530
 for the winter season I love and 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.240
 this is my favorite euro figure 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.180
 far for the fall season 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.970
 winter and that I find to have a tone 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.740
 much cooler healthy skin life 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.380
 rather cold also for the blush 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.240
 rosato that I use a lot lately 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.010
 often if you decide to go to 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.289
 use a news tone on 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.229
 Lips recommend the use of a blush 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:05.700
 rosy on the cheeks to give a little one 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:05.700
 touch of color to the total look 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:10.500
 other product I can't do to 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.000
 unless I use to check mine 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.819
 lips before applying lipstick 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.530
 to give more volume and so that the 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:19.020
 red outline of my lips appears 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.280
 more defined using very often e 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.919
 red lipstick on the lips 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.340
 I am better at using it as a base 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.830
 a tint and the latter causes the 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.250
 lipstick definitely lasts longer 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:35.160
 throughout the day and if I have to be 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.410
 honestly I noticed that strangely me 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:41.039
 dry lips less than one 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:44.099
 pencil this handbag brush is 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:46.909
 a must have whenever he decides to 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:50.370
 wear a red lipstick and get out 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:52.770
 and therefore I always carry it in my purse e 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.870
 use always to spread with 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.520
 precision red but firm lipstick 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.610
 going to use a shade 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.409
 less bright red than the robot 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.810
 strawberry from the marilyn monroe collection 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:08.639
 of max that I find softer and definitely 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.889
 more suitable also for a day look 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.719
 in the craters to cut the excesses into 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:15.330
 half an hour and lipstick lab so that it does not 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:17.669
 finish everything on the limits like touch 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.800
 final for the total look I decide to 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.509
 go to illuminate the inner corner e 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.610
 to give a bit of definition also the 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:25.860
 lower lashes using though 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.210
 transparent mascara that I was enough for you 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.680
 add some accessories or 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.330
 arrange a little hair 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.949
 the trick is finished I send you a big one 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.949
 kiss and see you at the next video 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:56.069
 and all 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.069
 in the rose
