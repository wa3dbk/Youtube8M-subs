I thought about how them the style that

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.199 
I thought about how them the style that
I<00:04:15.629> did<00:04:15.840> before<00:04:16.289> with<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.799> rollers<00:04:17.220> except<00:04:17.759> now

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
I did before with the rollers except now

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.180 
I did before with the rollers except now
that's<00:04:18.479> a<00:04:18.570> little<00:04:18.810> bit<00:04:18.930> longer<00:04:19.139> the<00:04:19.530> curls<00:04:19.919> are

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
that's a little bit longer the curls are

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.930 
that's a little bit longer the curls are
definitely<00:04:20.789> loser<00:04:21.209> and<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:21.539> like

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
definitely loser and I like

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.030 
definitely loser and I like
better<00:04:22.150> this<00:04:22.450> way<00:04:22.810> because<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.710> pearls

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
better this way because the pearls

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.160 
better this way because the pearls
aren't<00:04:24.250> as<00:04:24.430> tight<00:04:24.700> with<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.270> tight<00:04:25.510> curls<00:04:25.960> I
