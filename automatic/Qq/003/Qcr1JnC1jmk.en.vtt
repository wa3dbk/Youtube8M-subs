00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.500 
Administration it's important to note
that<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.920> most<00:00:23.160> stealthy<00:00:23.550> configuration

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
that the most stealthy configuration

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.390 
that the most stealthy configuration
that<00:00:24.539> Ben<00:00:24.960> rich<00:00:25.199> could<00:00:25.439> come<00:00:25.680> up<00:00:25.859> with<00:00:26.070> was<00:00:26.130> a

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
that Ben rich could come up with was a

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.269 
that Ben rich could come up with was a
completely<00:00:27.150> circular<00:00:27.990> flying<00:00:28.769> saucer

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
completely circular flying saucer

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.759 
completely circular flying saucer
configuration<00:00:30.029> there<00:00:30.720> was<00:00:30.929> definitely<00:00:31.500> some

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
configuration there was definitely some

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.680 
configuration there was definitely some
stability<00:00:32.009> problems<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.570> they

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
stability problems with that so they

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.180 
stability problems with that so they
went<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.170> next<00:00:34.410> most<00:00:34.829> stealthy

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
went to the next most stealthy

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.069 
went to the next most stealthy
configuration<00:00:36.120> which<00:00:36.300> turns<00:00:36.630> out<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.809> be<00:00:36.960> a

diamond a basically a cut diamond that

splitter<00:01:54.840> canopy<00:01:55.500> up<00:01:55.680> front<00:01:56.100> now<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.420> dawned

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
splitter canopy up front now and dawned

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.560 
splitter canopy up front now and dawned
on<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.619> pilot<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.460> he<00:02:00.090> could<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.360> right

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
on this pilot and he could have right

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.899 
on this pilot and he could have right
into<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:00.990> aircraft<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.100> clouds<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.700> so

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
into this aircraft in the clouds and so

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.270 
into this aircraft in the clouds and so
he<00:02:03.090> called<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.600> TC<00:02:04.259> which<00:02:04.590> was<00:02:04.799> nellis<00:02:05.159> air

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
he called a TC which was nellis air
