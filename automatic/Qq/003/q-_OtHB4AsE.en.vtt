00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
stuff bad thing this is basically like

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.440 
stuff bad thing this is basically like
the<00:03:15.349> old<00:03:15.530> arcade<00:03:16.069> games<00:03:16.400> it's<00:03:16.639> a<00:03:16.730> point<00:03:17.060> style

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
the old arcade games it's a point style

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.449 
the old arcade games it's a point style
game<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:21.230> only<00:03:21.349> goal<00:03:21.590> is<00:03:21.859> you<00:03:22.129> can<00:03:22.250> beat<00:03:22.430> it

game so the only goal is you can beat it

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:30.970 
game so the only goal is you can beat it
or<00:03:25.629> now<00:03:26.629> this<00:03:26.810> robot<00:03:27.340> it's<00:03:28.340> still<00:03:28.609> retarded<00:03:29.980> it

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
or now this robot it's still retarded it

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.920 
or now this robot it's still retarded it
will<00:03:31.129> do<00:03:31.579> a<00:03:31.609> patrol<00:03:32.060> if<00:03:32.329> I<00:03:32.480> leave<00:03:32.689> him<00:03:32.810> on<00:03:32.900> his

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
will do a patrol if I leave him on his

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.909 
will do a patrol if I leave him on his
own<00:03:34.989> so<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.019> should<00:03:36.379> go<00:03:36.530> out<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:36.709> attack

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
own so I should go out and attack

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:56.020 
own so I should go out and attack
anything<00:03:52.689> uh-huh<00:03:53.709> okay<00:03:54.709> and<00:03:55.010> all<00:03:55.159> the<00:03:55.370> bonuses

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
anything uh-huh okay and all the bonuses

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.300 
anything uh-huh okay and all the bonuses
that<00:03:56.329> you<00:03:57.079> pick<00:03:57.290> up<00:03:57.639> persist<00:03:58.639> with<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.419> draw

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
that you pick up persist with the draw

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.490 
that you pick up persist with the draw
so<00:04:01.310> this<00:04:01.639> droid<00:04:01.879> has<00:04:01.940> plus<00:04:02.479> 1<00:04:02.659> over<00:04:02.690> drive<00:04:03.169> that

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
so this droid has plus 1 over drive that

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.399 
so this droid has plus 1 over drive that
I<00:04:03.530> got<00:04:03.739> are<00:04:03.859> they<00:04:04.329> this<00:04:05.329> one<00:04:05.569> has<00:04:05.870> generator

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:06.409 
I got are they this one has generator

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:08.729 
I got are they this one has generator
and<00:04:06.680> battery<00:04:07.099> size<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:08.209> i'll<00:04:08.389> have<00:04:08.569> them

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739
