this<00:04:49.560> type<00:04:49.740> of<00:04:49.770> fishing<00:04:50.040> becomes<00:04:50.400> more

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
this type of fishing becomes more

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.610 
this type of fishing becomes more

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
much more frequent and you have to head

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.640 
much more frequent and you have to head
into<00:05:00.420> the<00:05:00.600> weeds<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:00.990> retrieve<00:05:01.320> your<00:05:01.410> lure

that<00:05:26.910> way<00:05:27.090> we're<00:05:27.960> then<00:05:28.170> drag<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.650> Lua<00:05:28.800> right

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
that way we're then drag the Lua right

we<00:05:33.420> had<00:05:33.480> fewer<00:05:33.810> hang-ups<00:05:34.230> this<00:05:34.410> way<00:05:34.590> and<00:05:34.830> could

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
we had fewer hang-ups this way and could

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.010 
we had fewer hang-ups this way and could
