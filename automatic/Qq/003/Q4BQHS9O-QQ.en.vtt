00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
island I there's lots and lots of

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.460 
island I there's lots and lots of
different<00:02:42.359> dyes<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.900> can<00:02:43.049> use<00:02:43.230> with

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
different dyes that you can use with

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.550 
different dyes that you can use with
this<00:02:43.820> then<00:02:44.820> you're<00:02:44.940> simply<00:02:45.299> gonna<00:02:45.420> flips<00:02:46.019> fold

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
this then you're simply gonna flips fold

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.210 
this then you're simply gonna flips fold
down<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.299> legs<00:02:48.299> of<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.799> brad<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.340> secure<00:02:51.170> and

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
down the legs of the brad to secure and

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.949 
down the legs of the brad to secure and
this<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.400> important<00:02:53.940> because<00:02:54.090> you're<00:02:54.660> going

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
this is important because you're going

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.509 
this is important because you're going
when<00:02:55.140> you're<00:02:55.260> heating<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:56.100> need<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.340> make

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
when you're heating you need to make

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.130 
when you're heating you need to make
sure<00:02:56.549> that<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.030> have<00:02:57.239> protection<00:02:57.690> from

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
sure that you have protection from

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.630 
sure that you have protection from
whatever<00:02:58.380> your<00:02:58.650> heating<00:02:58.920> from<00:02:59.070> because<00:02:59.430> these

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
whatever your heating from because these

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.300 
whatever your heating from because these
do<00:02:59.910> get<00:03:00.120> really<00:03:00.510> hot<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.320> just<00:03:01.769> have<00:03:01.980> chosen

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
do get really hot so I just have chosen

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.789 
do get really hot so I just have chosen
to<00:03:02.549> use<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.700> casserole<00:03:03.180> dish<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.870> then<00:03:04.530> it's

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
to use a casserole dish and then it's

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.770 
to use a casserole dish and then it's
very<00:03:05.070> important<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.150> use<00:03:06.450> your

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
very important to that you use your

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.229 
very important to that you use your
paper<00:03:07.500> snips<00:03:07.829> when<00:03:08.459> you're<00:03:08.609> heating<00:03:08.820> this<00:03:09.060> up

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
paper snips when you're heating this up

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.979 
paper snips when you're heating this up
to<00:03:09.390> secure<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.140> hold<00:03:10.650> hold<00:03:11.130> your<00:03:11.660> flower<00:03:12.660> if

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
to secure and hold hold your flower if

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.380 
to secure and hold hold your flower if
you<00:03:13.440> just<00:03:13.470> use<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:14.100> paper<00:03:14.310> piercer<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.120> does

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
you just use the paper piercer it does

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.539 
you just use the paper piercer it does
get<00:03:15.630> hot<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.410> rubber<00:03:16.650> end<00:03:16.920> on<00:03:17.130> these<00:03:17.280> scissors

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
get hot the rubber end on these scissors

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.720 
get hot the rubber end on these scissors
allow<00:03:18.060> you<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.870> remain<00:03:19.230> safe<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:20.549> you're

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
allow you to remain safe so you're

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.630 
allow you to remain safe so you're
simply<00:03:21.090> going<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.390> feed<00:03:21.660> us

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
simply going to feed us

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.420 
simply going to feed us
and<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:24.879> is<00:03:25.060> just<00:03:25.359> like<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.599> unboxing<00:03:26.430> it

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
and this is just like the unboxing it

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.490 
and this is just like the unboxing it
takes<00:03:27.730> a<00:03:27.879> little<00:03:28.030> while<00:03:28.299> to<00:03:28.689> get<00:03:28.810> started

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.010 

but<00:03:31.920> once<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.340> gets<00:03:32.520> going<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:33.240> does<00:03:33.270> start<00:03:33.930> to

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
but once it gets going it does start to

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.610 
but once it gets going it does start to
go<00:03:34.350> rather<00:03:34.710> quickly

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
go rather quickly

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.770 
go rather quickly
and<00:03:37.099> it<00:03:37.250> doesn't<00:03:37.489> matter<00:03:37.670> if<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.209> folds<00:03:38.599> in<00:03:38.750> on

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
and it doesn't matter if it folds in on

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.010 
and it doesn't matter if it folds in on
itself

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:04:00.130 

it<00:03:43.380> all<00:03:43.620> adds<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.520> the<00:03:44.670> layering<00:03:44.940> effect

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.170 

just<00:04:00.500> melting<00:04:01.069> the<00:04:01.160> fabric<00:04:01.640> you<00:04:01.760> don't<00:04:02.000> want

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
just melting the fabric you don't want

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.590 
just melting the fabric you don't want
to<00:04:02.300> go<00:04:02.480> too<00:04:02.540> fast<00:04:03.050> on<00:04:03.440> this<00:04:03.590> part<00:04:04.360> because<00:04:05.360> you

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
to go too fast on this part because you

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.670 
to go too fast on this part because you
will<00:04:05.870> burn<00:04:06.080> the<00:04:06.410> fabric<00:04:08.200> I've<00:04:09.200> never<00:04:09.440> had<00:04:09.650> one

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
will burn the fabric I've never had one

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.270 
will burn the fabric I've never had one
catch<00:04:10.130> on<00:04:10.340> fire<00:04:10.610> yet<00:04:11.060> but<00:04:11.950> and<00:04:12.950> we'd<00:04:13.100> hate<00:04:13.220> to

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
catch on fire yet but and we'd hate to

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:35.410 
catch on fire yet but and we'd hate to
have<00:04:13.520> that<00:04:13.730> happen<00:04:13.760> at<00:04:14.270> your<00:04:14.300> hostess

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.250 

the<00:04:35.930> last<00:04:36.200> thing<00:04:36.440> I<00:04:36.590> like<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:36.830> do<00:04:37.570> is<00:04:38.570> go<00:04:39.170> ahead

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
the last thing I like to do is go ahead

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.720 
the last thing I like to do is go ahead
and<00:04:39.530> pick<00:04:39.650> it<00:04:39.770> up<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.010> separate<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.550> layers

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
and pick it up and separate the layers

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.730 
and pick it up and separate the layers
whoops<00:04:41.300> you<00:04:41.600> need<00:04:41.780> to<00:04:41.870> be<00:04:41.990> careful<00:04:42.170> on<00:04:42.470> this

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
whoops you need to be careful on this

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.090 
whoops you need to be careful on this
part<00:04:43.070> because<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.700> Brad<00:04:44.420> itself<00:04:44.960> is<00:04:45.200> hot<00:04:45.440> the

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
part because the Brad itself is hot the

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.690 
part because the Brad itself is hot the
fabric<00:04:46.520> is<00:04:46.700> not<00:04:46.910> but<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.390> brad<00:04:47.630> is<00:04:48.280> so<00:04:49.280> go

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
fabric is not but the brad is so go

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.780 
fabric is not but the brad is so go
ahead<00:04:49.760> and<00:04:49.880> separate<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:50.480> layers<00:04:50.660> and<00:04:51.790> then

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
ahead and separate the layers and then

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.610 
ahead and separate the layers and then
pick<00:04:53.060> them<00:04:53.210> up<00:04:53.330> on<00:04:53.570> the<00:04:53.690> back<00:04:53.900> just<00:04:54.260> by
