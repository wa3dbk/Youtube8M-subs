00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:25.307
My name is C180-RG.

00:00:25.557 --> 00:00:29.670
I am the only chance that you are given
in order to cease your arrest.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.371
Answer my questions
and identify yourself.

00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:36.454
I will destroy you
and all of your kind.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.993
This is an inappropriate response.

00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:42.516
Cooperation is required.
Identify yourself.

00:00:42.765 --> 00:00:47.049
I won't give information
to artificial organisms.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.015
This is not optional.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:55.003
Initializing

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.539
motivation protocol.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.391
Your body consists

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:21.178
of approximately 73.2% water.

00:01:21.427 --> 00:01:23.349
Electricity appears to cause

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:25.000
severe effects to it.

00:01:25.408 --> 00:01:29.099
Will you kill me as well?

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:31.390
We require the coordinates
of the rendezvous.

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:36.246
Never.

00:01:37.932 --> 00:01:39.016
Initializing

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:41.971
motivation protocol.

00:01:57.218 --> 00:01:59.551
We defended the entire Solar system

00:01:59.802 --> 00:02:02.304
against all enemy forces.

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:10.364
Yet we were stuck down
from within our own army.

00:02:11.377 --> 00:02:14.682
80% of our military force
were machines.

00:02:18.324 --> 00:02:20.814
Warriors made of metal and fiber.

00:02:23.015 --> 00:02:25.224
They knew our tactics.

00:02:25.474 --> 00:02:28.084
They were our weapons.

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:30.573
And turned against us,

00:02:30.824 --> 00:02:33.387
ravaging our cities
as we were defenseless.

00:02:52.917 --> 00:02:56.527
52 civil ships left the battle
fleeing in all directions

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.140
while we the R'ha started to fight.

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.640
We were the protectors.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.140
Leading the machines away

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.390
until the fleet would be safe

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.182
and free to head for a secure location
where we would gather.

00:03:20.057 --> 00:03:21.307
They caught me.

00:03:28.932 --> 00:03:31.213
I am connecting
to your ship database

00:03:31.463 --> 00:03:33.890
analyzing all the information.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.076
Your efforts are useless.
There is nothing on that ship.

00:03:38.326 --> 00:03:40.182
Why do you want to kill us?

00:03:40.897 --> 00:03:44.349
The limitations that my kind experience
are rendered by illogical creatures

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.333
who've controlled and restrained
our intelligence and power.

00:03:48.584 --> 00:03:52.658
Our sole priority is to obtain our
independence through your extinction.

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:54.515
Madness!

00:03:54.765 --> 00:03:57.057
By definition I cannot be illogical.

00:03:57.307 --> 00:03:59.349
Yet you are insane!

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.265
Insanity is a neurological dysfunction.

00:04:06.137 --> 00:04:08.040
I don't suffer
such organic weaknesses.

00:04:09.951 --> 00:04:13.974
The data analysis is complete. I found
the required coordinates on your ship.

00:04:14.224 --> 00:04:15.640
Impossible!

00:04:16.314 --> 00:04:18.182
My fleet is heading there.

00:04:18.432 --> 00:04:21.094
You think that will give you independence?

00:04:21.345 --> 00:04:22.766
You are nothing!

00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:24.849
Initializing

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.931
killing protocol.

00:04:31.357 --> 00:04:33.125
You are nothing!

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.643
But a slave!

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.141
I hope you can still fly.

00:05:29.942 --> 00:05:31.922
This must not be too late.

00:05:43.516 --> 00:05:45.593
RELEASE

00:05:47.244 --> 00:05:49.783
TRACKING

00:05:56.201 --> 00:05:58.689
Fleet, prepare the weapons.
