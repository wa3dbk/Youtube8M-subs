00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
karbonn building blocks of a lot of

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.980 
karbonn building blocks of a lot of
things<00:00:01.970> vitamin<00:00:02.970> A<00:00:03.120> can<00:00:03.389> be<00:00:03.480> made<00:00:03.689> with<00:00:03.720> I

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
things vitamin A can be made with I

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.710 
things vitamin A can be made with I
Supremes<00:00:04.790> vitamin<00:00:05.790> E<00:00:06.060> can<00:00:06.359> be<00:00:06.480> made<00:00:06.690> with

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
Supremes vitamin E can be made with

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.610 
Supremes vitamin E can be made with
isoprene<00:00:08.750> cholesterol<00:00:09.750> can<00:00:10.019> be<00:00:10.080> made<00:00:10.290> with<00:00:10.320> I

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
isoprene cholesterol can be made with I

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.890 
isoprene cholesterol can be made with I
Supremes<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.340> cholesterol<00:00:12.120> can<00:00:12.660> be<00:00:12.719> made

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
Supremes and cholesterol can be made

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.799 
Supremes and cholesterol can be made
into<00:00:12.929> vitamin<00:00:13.230> D<00:00:13.620> so<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.219> D<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.610> E<00:00:14.880> oh<00:00:15.089> all<00:00:15.360> three

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
into vitamin D so a D and E oh all three

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.740 
into vitamin D so a D and E oh all three
can<00:00:16.049> ultimately<00:00:16.230> be<00:00:16.590> made<00:00:16.890> from<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.279> Supremes

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
can ultimately be made from I Supremes

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.060 
can ultimately be made from I Supremes
so<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.779> Supremes<00:00:19.230> are<00:00:19.380> pretty<00:00:19.560> important

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
so I Supremes are pretty important

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.380 
so I Supremes are pretty important
building<00:00:20.490> blocks<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:23.029> sprint's<00:00:24.029> have<00:00:24.150> five

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
building blocks I sprint's have five

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.179 
building blocks I sprint's have five
carbons<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:24.960> them<00:00:25.140> I'll<00:00:25.350> say<00:00:25.769> more<00:00:25.800> about<00:00:25.949> them

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
carbons in them I'll say more about them

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.929 
carbons in them I'll say more about them
next<00:00:26.340> time<00:00:27.050> but<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.170> build<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.619> cholesterol<00:00:29.220> we

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
next time but we build a cholesterol we

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.970 
next time but we build a cholesterol we
build<00:00:30.179> them<00:00:30.330> five<00:00:30.810> at<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.050> time<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.619> put<00:00:31.769> two

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
build them five at a time we put two

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.240 
build them five at a time we put two
fives<00:00:32.250> together<00:00:32.579> we<00:00:32.790> get<00:00:32.969> ten<00:00:33.710> we<00:00:34.710> add<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> third

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
fives together we get ten we add a third

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.420 
fives together we get ten we add a third
one<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.579> get<00:00:35.730> 15<00:00:36.710> we<00:00:37.710> put<00:00:37.890> two<00:00:38.040> fifteens

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
one we get 15 we put two fifteens

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.459 
one we get 15 we put two fifteens
together<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:38.879> make<00:00:39.030> 30<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.629> when<00:00:39.930> we<00:00:40.020> make<00:00:40.170> 30

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
together we make 30 and when we make 30

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.540 
together we make 30 and when we make 30
we've<00:00:40.680> got<00:00:40.829> something<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.190> see<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
we've got something you see on the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.490 
we've got something you see on the
screen<00:00:41.640> they're<00:00:41.940> called<00:00:42.120> squealing

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.410 

squealing<00:00:46.500> when<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.550> twist<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.120> turn<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
squealing when you twist and turn the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.299 
squealing when you twist and turn the
double<00:00:48.660> bonds<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:49.230> be<00:00:49.260> rearranged<00:00:50.129> into

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
double bonds can be rearranged into

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.770 
double bonds can be rearranged into
something<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.820> sort<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.360> looks<00:00:51.629> like

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
something that sort of looks like

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.240 
something that sort of looks like
cholesterol<00:00:54.890> there's<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.980> really<00:00:56.160> good

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
cholesterol there's a really good

a<00:01:05.070> stroll<00:01:05.430> was<00:01:05.700> cholesterol<00:01:06.570> because<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.990> has

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
a stroll was cholesterol because it has

that<00:01:14.400> looks<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.909> cholesterol<00:01:15.439> to<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
that looks like cholesterol to the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.179 
that looks like cholesterol to the
actual<00:01:16.890> cholesterol<00:01:17.630> takes<00:01:18.630> 19<00:01:19.590> steps<00:01:21.049> and<00:01:22.189> a

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
actual cholesterol takes 19 steps and a

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.490 
actual cholesterol takes 19 steps and a
lot<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.400> those<00:01:23.549> steps<00:01:23.759> take<00:01:24.500> triphosphate

lot of those steps take triphosphate
energy

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.489 

that<00:01:29.539> means<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:30.020> synthesis<00:01:30.469> of

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:30.499 
that means that the synthesis of

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:34.899 
that means that the synthesis of
cholesterol<00:01:30.740> is<00:01:31.340> very<00:01:31.909> very<00:01:33.909> energy

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
cholesterol is very very energy

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.649 
cholesterol is very very energy
consuming<00:01:37.119> cells<00:01:38.119> don't<00:01:38.329> want<00:01:38.509> to<00:01:38.569> make

consuming cells don't want to make

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.779 
consuming cells don't want to make
cholesterol<00:01:38.899> they<00:01:39.200> don't<00:01:39.380> need<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.789> that's

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
cholesterol they don't need it that's

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.849 
cholesterol they don't need it that's
why<00:01:40.969> the<00:01:41.030> feedback<00:01:41.569> inhibition<00:01:41.780> very<00:01:42.380> early

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859 
why the feedback inhibition very early

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:44.919 
why the feedback inhibition very early
at<00:01:43.009> that<00:01:43.159> hmg-coa<00:01:43.640> reductase<00:01:43.670> step<00:01:44.630> is<00:01:44.780> so

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
at that hmg-coa reductase step is so

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.499 
at that hmg-coa reductase step is so
important<00:01:45.469> it<00:01:46.159> stops<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:46.819> wasting<00:01:47.270> of<00:01:47.329> all

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
important it stops the wasting of all

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.990 
important it stops the wasting of all
that<00:01:47.719> other<00:01:47.840> energy<00:01:48.319> along<00:01:48.649> the<00:01:48.859> way<00:01:52.000> okay

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
that other energy along the way okay

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.929 
that other energy along the way okay
that<00:01:53.810> I<00:01:53.840> think<00:01:54.109> is<00:01:54.380> enough<00:01:54.619> for<00:01:54.679> today<00:01:54.939> so

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
that I think is enough for today so

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.339 
that I think is enough for today so
let's<00:01:56.119> stop<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:56.479> couple<00:01:56.630> minutes<00:01:56.840> early<00:01:57.079> and

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
let's stop a couple minutes early and

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:01.779 
let's stop a couple minutes early and
let<00:01:58.039> you<00:01:58.159> guys<00:01:58.340> be<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:59.229> I<00:02:00.369> shall<00:02:01.369> see<00:02:01.549> you<00:02:01.579> on

Friday Oh what random question yes okay
oh<00:02:08.329> they're<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.110> building<00:02:09.289> blocks<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.860> 18<00:02:10.310> he

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
oh they're the building blocks of 18 he

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.319 
oh they're the building blocks of 18 he
went<00:02:10.970> ok<00:02:11.440> that's<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.530> fat<00:02:12.739> fun<00:02:12.980> actually<00:02:13.430> k<00:02:14.150> can

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
went ok that's a fat fun actually k can

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.030 
went ok that's a fat fun actually k can
be<00:02:14.360> made<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.569> way<00:02:14.750> also<00:02:14.930> oh<00:02:15.230> yeah<00:02:15.530> yeah<00:02:15.890> I
