00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
this game which is a little

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.580 
this game which is a little
disappointing<00:00:32.730> because<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:34.020> could<00:00:34.170> use<00:00:34.320> so

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
disappointing because you could use so

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.910 
disappointing because you could use so
much<00:00:34.739> more<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> actual<00:00:35.640> sims<00:00:35.940> 3<00:00:36.239> game<00:00:36.920> but

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
much more in the actual sims 3 game but

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.010 
much more in the actual sims 3 game but
you<00:00:38.250> do<00:00:38.399> get<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> upside<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.180> having<00:00:39.329> animals

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
you do get the upside of having animals

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.080 
you do get the upside of having animals
which<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.739> guess<00:00:41.190> that's<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.489> whole<00:00:41.700> point<00:00:41.910> of

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
which I guess that's the whole point of

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.040 
which I guess that's the whole point of
the<00:00:42.210> game<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.980> get<00:00:43.980> animals<00:00:44.340> but<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.570> mean<00:00:45.870> it's

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
the game to get animals but I mean it's

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.660 
the game to get animals but I mean it's
still<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.320> really<00:00:46.379> good<00:00:46.770> game<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:47.460> it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
still a really good game and I like it

and I'm glad I got it so I mean it's

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.700 
and I'm glad I got it so I mean it's
something<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.629> should<00:00:51.809> invest<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.320> if<00:00:52.559> you're

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.740 
thing about it is that there are still
locked<00:02:06.530> items<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:08.000> things<00:02:08.239> that<00:02:08.420> we<00:02:08.600> would

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
locked items the things that we would

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.389 
locked items the things that we would
probably<00:02:09.050> use<00:02:09.080> most<00:02:09.440> like<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:10.009> stroke<00:02:10.280> of

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
probably use most like the stroke of

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.670 
probably use most like the stroke of
genius<00:02:10.459> it's<00:02:11.060> locked<00:02:11.300> I'm<00:02:12.290> not<00:02:12.410> really<00:02:12.560> sure

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
genius it's locked I'm not really sure

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.070 
genius it's locked I'm not really sure
how<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:12.950> unlock<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.400> or<00:02:13.760> anything<00:02:13.970> which<00:02:14.720> sucks

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
how to unlock it or anything which sucks

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.490 
how to unlock it or anything which sucks
because<00:02:15.350> I<00:02:15.530> would<00:02:15.980> use<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.370> one<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.760> lot<00:02:17.500> so

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
because I would use that one a lot so

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.160 
because I would use that one a lot so
that's<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.799> bad<00:02:18.980> side<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.489> then<00:02:20.299> your<00:02:20.959> money

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
that's a bad side and then your money

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.620 
that's a bad side and then your money
instead<00:02:22.070> of<00:02:22.220> adding<00:02:22.580> money<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:23.000> your<00:02:23.150> thing<00:02:23.390> it

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
instead of adding money to your thing it

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.259 
instead of adding money to your thing it
actually<00:02:24.080> stays<00:02:24.500> at<00:02:24.709> a<00:02:24.739> certain<00:02:24.950> level<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.670> it

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
actually stays at a certain level and it

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.300 
actually stays at a certain level and it
won't<00:02:26.480> go<00:02:26.660> down<00:02:26.690> which<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:27.860> would<00:02:27.980> think<00:02:28.010> is<00:02:28.280> a

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
won't go down which you would think is a

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.770 
won't go down which you would think is a
good<00:02:28.489> thing<00:02:28.549> because<00:02:28.820> your<00:02:29.090> money<00:02:29.269> doesn't<00:02:29.450> go

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
good thing because your money doesn't go

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.470 
good thing because your money doesn't go
down<00:02:29.810> but<00:02:30.580> when<00:02:31.580> I<00:02:31.610> first<00:02:31.880> played<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.269> game<00:02:32.450> I

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
down but when I first played the game I

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.690 
down but when I first played the game I
wanted<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.110> biggest<00:02:33.709> bestest<00:02:34.160> house<00:02:34.340> that

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
wanted the biggest bestest house that

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.120 
wanted the biggest bestest house that
there<00:02:34.880> was<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:36.290> couldn't<00:02:36.620> do<00:02:36.799> that<00:02:36.830> because

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
there was and I couldn't do that because

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.699 
there was and I couldn't do that because
there<00:02:37.430> wasn't<00:02:37.580> enough<00:02:37.910> money<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.330> was<00:02:38.420> like

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
there wasn't enough money it was like

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.800 
there wasn't enough money it was like
I've<00:02:39.709> like<00:02:39.980> ninety-nine<00:02:40.940> thousand<00:02:41.420> dollars

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
I've like ninety-nine thousand dollars

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.220 
I've like ninety-nine thousand dollars
but<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:43.010> biggest<00:02:43.310> houses<00:02:43.640> are<00:02:43.910> like<00:02:44.230> 103,000

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
but the biggest houses are like 103,000

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.020 
but the biggest houses are like 103,000
so<00:02:45.530> you<00:02:45.620> can't<00:02:46.010> get<00:02:46.160> those<00:02:46.400> unless<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:46.910> earn

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
so you can't get those unless you earn

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.449 
so you can't get those unless you earn
money<00:02:47.269> which<00:02:48.200> meissen<00:02:48.709> doesn't<00:02:49.070> have<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.190> job

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
money which meissen doesn't have a job

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.069 
money which meissen doesn't have a job
yet<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.480> she<00:02:50.959> hasn't<00:02:51.350> earned<00:02:51.470> any<00:02:51.620> money

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
yet so she hasn't earned any money

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.539 
yet so she hasn't earned any money
another<00:02:54.079> thing<00:02:54.380> is<00:02:54.410> your<00:02:54.950> lifetime<00:02:55.370> rewards
