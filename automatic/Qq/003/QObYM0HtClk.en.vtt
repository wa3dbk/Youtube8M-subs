and now I'm going to teach you how to

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.610 
and now I'm going to teach you how to
make<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.950> rotator<00:00:09.110> take<00:00:10.110> your<00:00:10.290> piece<00:00:10.469> of

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
make a rotator take your piece of

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.330 
make a rotator take your piece of
cardstock<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.429> make<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.759> base<00:00:12.000> page<00:00:13.190> fold<00:00:14.190> it

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
cardstock and make a base page fold it

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.880 
cardstock and make a base page fold it
in<00:00:14.460> half<00:00:15.320> match<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.619> edges<00:00:18.590> crease<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.740> down

in half match the edges crease it down
the<00:00:20.010> middle<00:00:20.210> and<00:00:22.010> set<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.130> aside<00:00:24.080> now<00:00:25.080> we're

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
the middle and set it aside now we're

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.570 
the middle and set it aside now we're
going<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.380> take<00:00:25.590> another<00:00:25.859> sheet<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.220> cardstock

going to take another sheet of cardstock

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:36.860 
going to take another sheet of cardstock
and<00:00:27.119> cut<00:00:28.189> out<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.670> large<00:00:30.060> rectangle<00:00:35.600> fold<00:00:36.600> down

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
and cut out a large rectangle fold down

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.190

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
the middle match the edges as close as

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.270 
the middle match the edges as close as
possible<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:42.260> trim<00:00:43.260> them<00:00:43.469> if<00:00:43.980> they're<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
possible and trim them if they're a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.170 
possible and trim them if they're a
little<00:00:44.489> uneven<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> now<00:00:47.700> we<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.530> layer<00:00:50.180> and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
little uneven so now we have a layer and

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.930 
little uneven so now we have a layer and
for<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> rotator<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.829> need<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> v-fold

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
for a rotator we need a v-fold

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.569 
for a rotator we need a v-fold
at<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.750> top<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.980> what<00:00:56.070> we're<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.460> is

v-fold<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.580> layer<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.350> we're<00:03:04.350> going<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.560> take

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
v-fold and layer and we're going to take

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.080 
v-fold and layer and we're going to take
a<00:03:04.710> bit<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.010> double<00:03:05.430> stick<00:03:05.460> tape<00:03:08.060> we're<00:03:09.060> going

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
a bit of double stick tape we're going

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.120 
a bit of double stick tape we're going
to<00:03:09.240> take<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.510> double<00:03:09.810> stick<00:03:10.020> tape<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.470> put<00:03:11.040> it

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
to take the double stick tape and put it

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.420 
to take the double stick tape and put it
on<00:03:11.250> one<00:03:11.460> half<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.990> v-fold<00:03:15.920> make<00:03:16.920> sure<00:03:17.190> it

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
on one half of the v-fold make sure it

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.350 
on one half of the v-fold make sure it
stays<00:03:19.400> within<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.670> V<00:03:23.060> now<00:03:24.060> we're<00:03:24.210> going<00:03:24.300> to

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
stays within the V now we're going to

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.500 
stays within the V now we're going to
take<00:03:24.660> our<00:03:25.590> circular<00:03:26.160> piece<00:03:26.400> so<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.210> smaller

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
take our circular piece so the smaller

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.810 
take our circular piece so the smaller
tab<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:27.990> we<00:03:28.110> just<00:03:28.320> folded<00:03:28.770> we're<00:03:29.640> going<00:03:29.760> to

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
tab that we just folded we're going to

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.500 
tab that we just folded we're going to
line<00:03:30.120> up<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.720> edge<00:03:31.380> in<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.070> center<00:03:32.490> with<00:03:33.390> the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
line up the edge in the center with the

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.250 
line up the edge in the center with the
center<00:03:33.780> point<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.260> edge<00:03:35.480> of<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.750> V<00:03:36.930> on<00:03:37.110> the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
center point and edge of the V on the

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.200 
center point and edge of the V on the
layer<00:03:37.470> so<00:03:38.310> let's<00:03:38.340> line<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.910> up<00:03:40.850> push<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:42.000> down

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
layer so let's line that up push it down

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:50.050 
layer so let's line that up push it down
and<00:03:42.680> close<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:47.310> now<00:03:47.550> you<00:03:47.610> have<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:48.240> rotator

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
and close it and now you have a rotator

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.480 
and close it and now you have a rotator
mine<00:03:51.060> sticks<00:03:51.390> out<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.540> little<00:03:51.660> bit<00:03:52.220> so<00:03:53.220> if<00:03:53.370> it

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
mine sticks out a little bit so if it

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.350 
mine sticks out a little bit so if it
does<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:54.150> can<00:03:54.180> just<00:03:54.450> untape<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:56.210> you<00:03:57.210> can<00:03:57.330> just

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
does you can just untape it you can just

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.010 
does you can just untape it you can just
trim<00:03:57.720> down<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.110> edges<00:03:58.260> really<00:03:58.860> quickly<00:04:00.020> that

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
trim down the edges really quickly that

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.920 
trim down the edges really quickly that
way<00:04:01.340> your<00:04:02.340> pop-ups<00:04:02.790> stay<00:04:03.150> within<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.750> base

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
way your pop-ups stay within the base

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.430 
way your pop-ups stay within the base
page<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.770> your<00:04:05.430> viewer<00:04:06.020> gets<00:04:07.020> the<00:04:07.200> full

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
movement with something that literally

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.700 
movement with something that literally
jumps<00:04:15.990> off<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.170> page

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:18.710 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.220 

great<00:04:19.739> so<00:04:20.609> there's<00:04:20.790> your<00:04:20.940> rotator

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
great so there's your rotator

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.390 
great so there's your rotator
and<00:04:22.320> that's<00:04:23.040> how<00:04:23.190> we<00:04:23.250> make<00:04:23.630> rotators

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
and that's how we make rotators

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.760 
and that's how we make rotators
