cable and run down down the side cuz you

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.450 
cable and run down down the side cuz you
know<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:28.050> fits<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.500> groove<00:02:28.710> but<00:02:29.160> don't<00:02:29.340> do

that<00:02:29.520> using<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.300> airflow<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.920> circulate

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
that using you the airflow to circulate

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.680 
that using you the airflow to circulate
through<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.160> whole<00:02:32.400> console<00:02:32.970> now<00:02:33.360> for

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
through the whole console now for

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.660 
through the whole console now for
keeping<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.320> ps4<00:02:34.800> from<00:02:34.920> being<00:02:35.190> too<00:02:35.430> dusty

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.240 
keeping the ps4 from being too dusty
what<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.210> do<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.810> maybe<00:02:37.590> about<00:02:37.740> like<00:02:37.950> once<00:02:38.160> a

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
what I do is maybe about like once a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.250 
what I do is maybe about like once a
week<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.520> just<00:02:38.580> dust<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.000> top<00:02:39.210> off<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:40.110> know

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
and then for the edges maybe about once

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.840 
and then for the edges maybe about once
a<00:02:42.840> month<00:02:42.990> I<00:02:43.260> just<00:02:43.620> get<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.800> vacuum<00:02:44.250> vacuum<00:02:44.550> the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
edges vacuum the back I just do that but

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.750 
edges vacuum the back I just do that but
don't<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:49.830> know<00:02:49.920> take<00:02:50.280> apart<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.730> whole

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
don't you know take apart the whole

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.200 
don't you know take apart the whole
piece<00:02:51.090> for<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.870> then<00:02:52.440> get<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:52.950> aerosol<00:02:53.880> spray

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
piece for and then get a aerosol spray

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.680 
piece for and then get a aerosol spray
can<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.450> spray<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:55.020> into<00:02:55.680> each<00:02:56.160> individual

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
can and spray it into each individual

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.630 
can and spray it into each individual
part<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.620> first<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:59.010> all<00:02:59.070> is<00:02:59.250> just<00:02:59.400> too

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
part that it first of all is just too

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.040 
part that it first of all is just too
much<00:02:59.760> of<00:02:59.820> a<00:02:59.970> hassle<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.420> second<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:00.840> all<00:03:00.930> you

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
much of a hassle and second of all you

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.710 
much of a hassle and second of all you
could<00:03:01.140> probably<00:03:01.290> damage<00:03:01.770> something<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.720> you

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
could probably damage something and you

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.540 
could probably damage something and you
just<00:03:03.780> don't<00:03:03.990> want<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.380> deal<00:03:04.590> with<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:05.040> okay

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
just don't want to deal with that okay

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.930

now<00:04:01.700> that<00:04:01.910> I<00:04:01.940> look<00:04:02.090> on<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.270> website<00:04:02.450> I<00:04:02.690> think

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
now that I look on the website I think

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
now that I look on the website I think
it's<00:04:03.110> actually<00:04:03.410> around<00:04:03.530> under<00:04:04.460> $20<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:05.870> that's

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
it's actually around under $20 so that's

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.980 
it's actually around under $20 so that's
even<00:04:07.040> better<00:04:07.340> if<00:04:07.610> you<00:04:08.030> want<00:04:08.420> to<00:04:08.510> get<00:04:08.720> one<00:04:08.840> off<00:04:08.960> a

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
even better if you want to get one off a

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.810 
even better if you want to get one off a
Best<00:04:09.260> Buy<00:04:09.350> that's<00:04:09.830> where<00:04:09.980> I<00:04:10.010> got<00:04:10.160> mine<00:04:10.400> off<00:04:10.580> of

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
Best Buy that's where I got mine off of

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.270 
Best Buy that's where I got mine off of
and<00:04:11.510> like<00:04:11.750> I<00:04:11.900> said<00:04:11.960> about<00:04:12.380> keeping<00:04:12.830> it<00:04:12.980> at<00:04:13.130> a

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
and like I said about keeping it at a

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.490 
and like I said about keeping it at a
angle<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.240> think<00:04:14.630> it<00:04:14.690> just<00:04:14.840> gives<00:04:14.990> a<00:04:15.080> better<00:04:15.230> air

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
angle I think it just gives a better air

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.009 
angle I think it just gives a better air
circulation<00:04:15.530> throughout<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.609> ps4<00:04:17.150> so<00:04:17.780> as

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
circulation throughout the ps4 so as

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.590 
circulation throughout the ps4 so as
long<00:04:18.290> as<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.980> vent<00:04:19.250> is<00:04:19.489> just<00:04:19.850> going<00:04:20.030> outwards

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
long as the vent is just going outwards

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.900 
long as the vent is just going outwards
not<00:04:20.870> behind<00:04:21.200> a<00:04:21.260> wall<00:04:21.470> I<00:04:21.650> normally<00:04:22.340> keep<00:04:22.550> this

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
not behind a wall I normally keep this

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.260 
not behind a wall I normally keep this
actually<00:04:23.390> toward<00:04:23.780> this<00:04:24.680> side<00:04:25.090> blowing<00:04:26.090> out

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
actually toward this side blowing out

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.760 
actually toward this side blowing out
that<00:04:26.540> way<00:04:26.720> and<00:04:26.930> not<00:04:27.050> toward<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.410> world<00:04:27.590> is

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
that way and not toward the world is

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.230 
that way and not toward the world is
this<00:04:28.130> is<00:04:28.280> just<00:04:28.430> for<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.610> sake<00:04:28.760> of<00:04:28.790> video<00:04:29.030> so

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
this is just for the sake of video so

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.760 
this is just for the sake of video so
you<00:04:29.300> guys<00:04:29.450> can<00:04:29.630> see<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:30.760> so<00:04:31.760> that<00:04:32.300> I<00:04:32.510> think<00:04:32.770> it

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
you guys can see it so that I think it

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.520 
you guys can see it so that I think it
works<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.400> best<00:04:34.580> in<00:04:34.940> this<00:04:35.300> angle<00:04:35.540> it<00:04:36.290> should

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
works the best in this angle it should

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.440 
works the best in this angle it should
be<00:04:36.620> in<00:04:36.710> the<00:04:36.770> highest<00:04:36.950> I<00:04:37.250> I<00:04:37.880> think<00:04:38.150> it<00:04:38.360> just

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
be in the highest I I think it just

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.240 
be in the highest I I think it just
slipped<00:04:38.780> but<00:04:39.350> it<00:04:39.560> should<00:04:39.770> be<00:04:39.890> in<00:04:39.980> the<00:04:40.070> highest

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
slipped but it should be in the highest

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.060 
slipped but it should be in the highest
angle<00:04:40.730> so<00:04:40.970> up<00:04:41.210> and<00:04:41.420> then<00:04:41.780> disco<00:04:42.410> and<00:04:42.530> find<00:04:42.860> it

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
angle so up and then disco and find it

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.310 
angle so up and then disco and find it
doesn't<00:04:43.370> get<00:04:43.730> scraped<00:04:44.240> like<00:04:44.510> on<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.810> on<00:04:44.960> the

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
doesn't get scraped like on the on the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.830 
doesn't get scraped like on the on the
on<00:04:45.950> the<00:04:46.370> shelf<00:04:46.640> or<00:04:46.760> anything<00:04:47.180> that<00:04:47.510> it's<00:04:47.660> at<00:04:47.810> a

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
on the shelf or anything that it's at a

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.440 
on the shelf or anything that it's at a
low<00:04:48.080> angle<00:04:48.320> it's<00:04:48.770> it's<00:04:49.310> good<00:04:49.580> it<00:04:49.760> fits<00:04:50.060> fine

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
low angle it's it's good it fits fine

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.210 
low angle it's it's good it fits fine
and<00:04:50.960> I<00:04:51.080> mean<00:04:51.260> everything<00:04:51.710> about<00:04:51.800> it<00:04:52.100> is

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
and I mean everything about it is

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.940 
and I mean everything about it is
actually<00:04:52.550> pretty<00:04:52.850> good<00:04:53.350> it<00:04:54.350> would<00:04:54.620> be<00:04:54.740> nice<00:04:54.920> if

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
actually pretty good it would be nice if

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.590 
actually pretty good it would be nice if
the<00:04:55.520> USB<00:04:56.060> ports<00:04:56.360> would<00:04:56.450> be<00:04:56.570> 3.0<00:04:57.260> ports<00:04:57.680> but

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
the USB ports would be 3.0 ports but

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.880 
the USB ports would be 3.0 ports but
it's<00:04:59.600> fine<00:04:59.840> I<00:04:59.870> mean<00:04:59.990> it's<00:05:00.230> just<00:05:00.290> for<00:05:00.530> a<00:05:00.590> chill

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
it's fine I mean it's just for a chill

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.460 
it's fine I mean it's just for a chill
fan<00:05:01.190> and<00:05:01.400> it's<00:05:01.520> just<00:05:01.790> for<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.090> PlayStation<00:05:02.750> so

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
fan and it's just for the PlayStation so

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.530 
fan and it's just for the PlayStation so
I<00:05:03.500> think<00:05:03.830> this<00:05:04.310> is<00:05:04.370> actually<00:05:04.820> a<00:05:04.850> really<00:05:05.180> good

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
I think this is actually a really good

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.830 
I think this is actually a really good
purchase<00:05:06.290> now<00:05:07.160> space<00:05:07.700> wise<00:05:08.000> it<00:05:08.270> will<00:05:08.450> have<00:05:08.630> to

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
purchase now space wise it will have to

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.460 
purchase now space wise it will have to
be<00:05:09.050> you<00:05:09.740> know<00:05:09.860> flat<00:05:10.280> horizontal<00:05:10.690> so<00:05:11.690> I<00:05:11.750> give

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
be you know flat horizontal so I give

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.190 
be you know flat horizontal so I give
enough<00:05:12.740> room<00:05:12.860> for<00:05:13.370> let's<00:05:14.030> say<00:05:14.240> like<00:05:14.540> a<00:05:14.600> laptop

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
enough room for let's say like a laptop

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.880 
enough room for let's say like a laptop
or<00:05:15.560> something<00:05:16.250> like<00:05:16.610> that<00:05:16.880> but<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:18.110> if<00:05:18.800> you

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
or something like that but and if you

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.230 
or something like that but and if you
did<00:05:19.040> when<00:05:19.190> use<00:05:19.310> it<00:05:19.430> for<00:05:19.520> a<00:05:19.550> laptop<00:05:19.730> you<00:05:19.940> can

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
did when use it for a laptop you can

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.880 
did when use it for a laptop you can
actually<00:05:20.510> hook<00:05:20.600> up<00:05:20.720> a<00:05:20.840> Logitech<00:05:21.260> mouse<00:05:21.500> with<00:05:21.860> a

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
actually hook up a Logitech mouse with a

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.100 
actually hook up a Logitech mouse with a
little<00:05:22.160> dongle<00:05:22.610> in<00:05:22.760> the<00:05:22.910> back<00:05:23.120> and<00:05:23.450> then<00:05:23.870> hook

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
little dongle in the back and then hook

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.409 
little dongle in the back and then hook
hook<00:05:24.620> it<00:05:24.770> up<00:05:24.919> to<00:05:25.130> the<00:05:25.250> laptop<00:05:25.430> and<00:05:25.880> it<00:05:26.300> would

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
hook it up to the laptop and it would

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.120 
hook it up to the laptop and it would
still<00:05:26.630> work<00:05:26.900> out<00:05:27.110> fine<00:05:27.350> that's<00:05:27.620> that's<00:05:27.890> what<00:05:28.100> I

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
still work out fine that's that's what I

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.510 
still work out fine that's that's what I
do

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520
