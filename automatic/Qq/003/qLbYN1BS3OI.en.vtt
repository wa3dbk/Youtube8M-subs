00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:15.839
 it happened a terrible chub broke. 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:24.019
 and drove tees to finger therefore apparently 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:29.490
 fishing for today is over I 'll go do 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:34.130
 the operation is terribly painful but nothing 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:53.250
 do you need to somehow get the hook 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:57.750
 do it this way the couple jerking 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:04.010
 poke through the skin to come out 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:08.189
 his sting and now try to bite it off 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:12.530
 I donâ€™t see something else 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.530
 it should be with us now 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:41.330
 oh so painful 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:44.990
 what a good hook u wobbler here 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.080
 that is why he holds so securely 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.510
 fish and helped us catch today 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.420
 sudachka will not be angry with him 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:58.420
 in any case, to say thank you to 100 cm and 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.420
 there is 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.810
 that's what happened here so I cut 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:12.220
 hook got it through 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:20.660
 finger bitten off and therefore it 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:24.620
 sting I let go of these minutes 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.690
 you start to regret that you do not have 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.880
 car full first-aid kits 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:34.610
 but on my luck out of nowhere 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.340
 apparently once again on the toes of the feet 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.980
 I bought a plaster and for sure it is for us now 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.800
 will help to continue fishing 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:46.850
 cover the patch and still try 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.600
 catch chub well or who will send us 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.940
 century 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.100
 maybe it will be windows and maybe 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.230
 again although it is hardly time already 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.550
 quite a lot and pike probably now 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.140
 from the coast will begin to move away 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.950
 sorry i will stay alone glue up 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.160
 hand and then we'll see you again at 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.160
 river
