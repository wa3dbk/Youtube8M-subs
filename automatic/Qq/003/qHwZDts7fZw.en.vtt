00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
on come on come on bill that across and

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.100 
on come on come on bill that across and
I<00:02:14.980> need<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.250> break<00:02:15.520> this<00:02:15.550> block<00:02:16.210> here<00:02:16.570> I<00:02:16.780> gotta

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
I need to break this block here I gotta

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.720 
I need to break this block here I gotta
think<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.440> trumpet<00:02:17.830> is<00:02:17.980> actually<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.520> may<00:02:18.700> be

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
think the trumpet is actually it may be

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.570 
think the trumpet is actually it may be
a<00:02:18.940> little<00:02:19.210> bit<00:02:19.480> bigger<00:02:19.900> than<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:21.190> though<00:02:21.550> I

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
a little bit bigger than this though I

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.840 
a little bit bigger than this though I
think<00:02:22.590> all<00:02:23.590> right<00:02:23.710> let's<00:02:24.160> just<00:02:24.340> let's<00:02:24.520> just<00:02:24.580> go

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
think all right let's just let's just go

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
think all right let's just let's just go
ahead<00:02:24.940> and<00:02:25.060> we're<00:02:25.330> going<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.510> go<00:02:25.630> with<00:02:25.840> it

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
ahead and we're going to go with it

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.300 
ahead and we're going to go with it
we're<00:02:26.050> gonna<00:02:26.110> go<00:02:26.380> we're<00:02:26.800> going<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:26.980> go<00:02:27.100> with<00:02:27.280> it

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
we're gonna go we're going to go with it

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.440 
we're gonna go we're going to go with it
right<00:02:27.550> now<00:02:27.610> we're<00:02:27.880> not<00:02:28.000> going<00:02:28.120> to<00:02:28.180> worry<00:02:28.390> about

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
right now we're not going to worry about

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.200 
right now we're not going to worry about
it<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:29.220> then<00:02:30.220> we're<00:02:30.430> going<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.670> we're<00:02:31.120> going

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
it and then we're going to we're going

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.480 
it and then we're going to we're going
to<00:02:31.270> build<00:02:31.510> this<00:02:31.750> up<00:02:31.960> then<00:02:32.830> we're<00:02:32.980> also<00:02:33.160> going

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
to build this up then we're also going

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.699 
to build this up then we're also going
to<00:02:33.580> build<00:02:33.910> maybe<00:02:34.480> some<00:02:34.750> Pistons<00:02:35.260> we<00:02:35.560> have

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
to build maybe some Pistons we have

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.570 
to build maybe some Pistons we have
Pistons<00:02:36.250> maybe<00:02:37.650> which<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.770> don't<00:02:38.830> look<00:02:39.400> see<00:02:39.550> I

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
Pistons maybe which I don't look see I

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.949 
Pistons maybe which I don't look see I
can't<00:02:40.030> find<00:02:40.209> in<00:02:40.330> which<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.540> never<00:02:40.600> actually

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
can't find in which I never actually

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.340 
can't find in which I never actually
used<00:02:41.920> them<00:02:42.130> on<00:02:42.280> PE<00:02:42.840> I'm<00:02:43.840> gonna<00:02:43.990> have<00:02:44.200> trouble

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
used them on PE I'm gonna have trouble

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.820 
used them on PE I'm gonna have trouble
finding<00:02:44.739> this<00:02:46.080> I'm<00:02:47.080> not<00:02:47.380> gonna<00:02:47.500> worry<00:02:47.739> about

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
finding this I'm not gonna worry about

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.280 
finding this I'm not gonna worry about
it<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:48.280> i'll<00:02:48.459> leave<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:48.940> be<00:02:49.270> but<00:02:49.810> i'm<00:02:49.930> gonna<00:02:50.080> put

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
it so i'll leave it be but i'm gonna put

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.590 
it so i'll leave it be but i'm gonna put
that<00:02:50.500> there<00:02:51.040> so<00:02:51.370> this<00:02:51.820> is<00:02:51.940> going<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.239> be<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
that there so this is going to be the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.710 
that there so this is going to be the
actual<00:02:52.810> like<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.860> buttons<00:02:54.760> here<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.540> looks

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
actual like the buttons here it looks

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.229 
actual like the buttons here it looks
like<00:02:55.780> possibly<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:57.459> we'll<00:02:57.610> keep<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:57.970> there

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
like possibly so we'll keep that there

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.710 
like possibly so we'll keep that there
