actually the first one I've bought and

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.990 
actually the first one I've bought and
then<00:04:23.560> I<00:04:23.770> went<00:04:24.070> to<00:04:24.130> both<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.460> rest<00:04:24.669> of<00:04:24.850> them

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
then I went to both the rest of them

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.350 
then I went to both the rest of them
because<00:04:25.210> I<00:04:25.300> like<00:04:25.479> them<00:04:25.539> so<00:04:25.870> much

because I like them so much

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.909 
because I like them so much
these<00:04:28.360> are<00:04:28.539> really<00:04:29.199> some<00:04:29.440> of<00:04:29.470> my<00:04:29.590> favorite

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
these are really some of my favorite

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.749 
these are really some of my favorite
glosses<00:04:30.310> pepper<00:04:31.889> instead<00:04:32.889> that's<00:04:33.160> pure<00:04:33.490> cider

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
glosses pepper instead that's pure cider

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:37.529 
glosses pepper instead that's pure cider
and<00:04:35.460> so<00:04:36.460> there's<00:04:36.580> all<00:04:36.789> the<00:04:36.910> ones<00:04:37.030> I<00:04:37.150> haven't

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.210 
and so there's all the ones I haven't
seen<00:04:37.720> nine<00:04:37.960> of<00:04:38.169> them<00:04:38.349> and<00:04:38.560> I<00:04:38.590> think<00:04:38.620> there<00:04:39.099> may

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
seen nine of them and I think there may

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.710 
seen nine of them and I think there may
be<00:04:39.250> one<00:04:39.580> or<00:04:39.699> two<00:04:39.729> more<00:04:40.090> that<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.300> haven't<00:04:40.479> gotten

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
single store is going to have them all

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.680 
single store is going to have them all
so<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:48.250> nudes<00:04:48.520> are<00:04:48.820> really<00:04:49.060> good<00:04:49.240> news<00:04:49.479> and
