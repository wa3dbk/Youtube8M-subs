00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
hello Panzer here with another build

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.920 
hello Panzer here with another build
video<00:00:06.870> it's<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.319> end<00:00:07.500> when<00:00:07.799> BK<00:00:08.400> 644<00:00:09.240> -<00:00:09.570> tell<00:00:09.840> me

video it's the end when BK 644 - tell me
something<00:00:10.140> case<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.430> I'm<00:00:12.390> going<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.810> be

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
something case and I'm going to be

something case and I'm going to be
showing<00:00:13.470> a<00:00:13.710> quick<00:00:14.010> unboxing<00:00:14.130> here<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.880> then

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
showing a quick unboxing here and then

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.970 
showing a quick unboxing here and then
we'll<00:00:15.180> get<00:00:15.270> right<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.800> building<00:00:16.800> this

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
we'll get right to building this

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.259 
we'll get right to building this
low-budget<00:00:17.849> computer<00:00:19.460> and<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.550> comes

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:21.269 
low-budget computer and it comes

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.640 
low-budget computer and it comes
packaged<00:00:21.839> just<00:00:21.990> like<00:00:22.109> pretty<00:00:22.259> much<00:00:22.380> every

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
packaged just like pretty much every

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.499 
packaged just like pretty much every
case<00:00:22.829> out<00:00:23.070> there<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.210> really<00:00:24.390> not

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
case out there so that is really not

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.480 
case out there so that is really not
much<00:00:24.749> to<00:00:24.990> describe<00:00:25.470> but<00:00:25.829> here's<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.310> case

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
much to describe but here's the case

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.179 
much to describe but here's the case
it's<00:00:26.730> not<00:00:26.909> too<00:00:27.060> big<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.509> not<00:00:27.599> too<00:00:27.779> small<00:00:28.189> it's

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
it's not too big and not too small it's

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.009 
it's not too big and not too small it's
right<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.489> between<00:00:29.579> I'd<00:00:29.909> say<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.659> motherboard

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
right in between I'd say the motherboard

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.350 
right in between I'd say the motherboard

so<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.630> go<00:00:52.040> here<00:00:53.040> is<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.460> inside<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
so here we go here is the inside the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.610 
so here we go here is the inside the
case<00:00:54.120> what<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:55.020> when<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.170> open<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.470> up

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
case what you get when you open it up

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.210 
case what you get when you open it up
and<00:00:56.240> we'll<00:00:57.240> cut<00:00:57.420> right<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.040> good<00:00:59.040> old

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
and we'll cut right to that good old

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.330 
and we'll cut right to that good old
mesh<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.240> the<00:01:00.380> CPU<00:01:01.380> I'll<00:01:01.560> be<00:01:01.650> the<00:01:01.770> main<00:01:01.980> fan

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
mesh for the CPU I'll be the main fan

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.950 
mesh for the CPU I'll be the main fan
actually<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.880> this<00:01:03.000> case<00:01:03.330> there's<00:01:03.570> not<00:01:03.720> a<00:01:03.750> lot

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
actually on this case there's not a lot

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.080 
actually on this case there's not a lot
of<00:01:03.990> other<00:01:04.109> cooling<00:01:04.829> options<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.670> that's<00:01:05.820> ok

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
of other cooling options but that's ok

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.179 
of other cooling options but that's ok
for<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.390> type<00:01:06.539> of<00:01:06.570> build<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.740> remove<00:01:07.979> this

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
for this type of build so to remove this

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.069 
for this type of build so to remove this
bay<00:01:08.490> here<00:01:08.759> we<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.119> removed<00:01:09.539> the<00:01:09.600> front<00:01:09.689> panel

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
bay here we just removed the front panel

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.160 
bay here we just removed the front panel
and<00:01:10.259> this<00:01:10.530> screw<00:01:10.859> and<00:01:11.270> it'll<00:01:12.270> get<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:13.049> able

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
and this screw and it'll get to be able

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.179 
and this screw and it'll get to be able
to<00:01:13.380> actually<00:01:13.740> install<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.070> motherboard

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
to actually install the motherboard

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.249 
to actually install the motherboard
because<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.450> can't<00:01:15.689> really<00:01:15.869> do<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.140> while

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
because you can't really do it while

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.719 
because you can't really do it while
this<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.499> in<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.679> way<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:17.340> important<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
this is in the way it's important to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.489 
this is in the way it's important to
hold<00:01:17.819> down<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.060> plastic<00:01:18.659> tab<00:01:18.840> lifting<00:01:19.200> up

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:19.499 
hold down that plastic tab lifting up

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:23.149 
hold down that plastic tab lifting up
otherwise<00:01:19.829> it<00:01:20.100> won't<00:01:20.189> come<00:01:20.490> out<00:01:21.859> so<00:01:22.859> it<00:01:23.009> comes

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
otherwise it won't come out so it comes

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.980 
otherwise it won't come out so it comes
with<00:01:23.249> screws<00:01:23.460> for<00:01:23.939> mounting<00:01:23.969> hard<00:01:24.600> drives<00:01:24.840> and

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.230 
which it does and I was really having
fun<00:01:57.029> with<00:01:57.209> the<00:01:57.740> ufi<00:01:58.740> BIOS<00:01:59.490> today's<00:01:59.939> who's

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
fun with the ufi BIOS today's who's

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.649 
fun with the ufi BIOS today's who's
added<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.130> main<00:02:02.729> storage<00:02:03.090> will

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
added to this so the main storage will

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.980 
added to this so the main storage will
be<00:02:03.689> OCZ<00:02:04.469> vertex<00:02:05.340> for<00:02:05.549> solid-state<00:02:06.359> drive<00:02:06.719> and

be OCZ vertex for solid-state drive and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.990 
be OCZ vertex for solid-state drive and
I'll<00:02:07.709> be<00:02:07.859> using<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.250> adapter<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.849> came

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
I'll be using the adapter that it came

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.780 
I'll be using the adapter that it came
with<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:10.229> looks

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
with and it looks

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.000 
with and it looks
very<00:02:12.000> nice<00:02:12.269> and<00:02:12.900> I'm<00:02:13.560> just<00:02:13.709> going<00:02:13.829> to<00:02:13.950> be
