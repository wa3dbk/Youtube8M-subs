00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.300
 welcome to another 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.099
 destroy me this time on the free 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:23.089
 world service correctly said yes 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:25.019
 first of all just before you have these servers 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.880
 james bond actually in such a 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.380
 dome where it for example now like 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.720
 the server ring stands and right here 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.560
 for example, in these rules is 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.560
 password in it 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.240
 then comes an information wall 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.460
 where right well that arises with a 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:46.520
 you can enter that specific command 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:50.580
 is actually easy to find 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.350
 and before that means you have to 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:57.060
 Let's see where you put us where 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.420
 illogical shows what does one mean 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:05.129
 impossible is there for example 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:09.600
 somewhere so i do not have to be an example 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:18.240
 insult merkur for example two- 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:21.929
 or so or why graf or at novasol 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.979
 Gaudi so Christians do not understand something like that 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:31.710
 makes sense to the rules I 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:35.340
 speak this if this finish it 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.520
 means for you when the time and the 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.799
 password also found and then 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.399
 you go then turn that turns 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.289
 you around 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.869
 that means then I have here on this 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.670
 you have side that is called this one 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.639
 enter command and then have to 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.670
 you can click on the right in the back 

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:59.069
 clap film and then you land 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:02.189
 here in front and first in advance that they 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:05.099
 is a city image that is an early one 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.560
 server where he could do many things 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:10.020
 for example, it could look like something 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.450
 I did and 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.150
 At first, I thought you were lost 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.120
 stop over now but I have to say that is 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.290
 it's actually very well marked 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.210
 with these pictures here once goes 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.580
 Especially since this is really big 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.640
 designed they say good from when the 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.330
 wall then go to the teleporter 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:34.290
 satisfied and to the minecraft school what 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:38.370
 that brings everything or just like that 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.920
 not what i stand short term options 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.470
 Settings are official down 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.610
 extra because of the recording it does not mean 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.860
 want that my pc is so bad 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.180
 but I have to deny extra 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.490
 a little better, yes you could as well 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.790
 friends helps colleagues on this 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.950
 gamble and are now, I have been playing here 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.890
 that's when I look if 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:09.720
 Here's what's so important for me here 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:15.650
 yes here are the admins freshman area 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:18.480
 speak ok had freshman areas 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.400
 which team is shaped here is the notes 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.010
 that is, the new world can there be here 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:45.390
 build and so you could immediately 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:52.790
 We'll ask back and return 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:56.340
 I do not know anything but that works 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.390
 but that works and they say three 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:06.380
 wait seconds and then I am too 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:09.860
 come here north teleporter okay 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:15.410
 the question is where my goal in the middle 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:17.489
 Springfeld population here is west 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.150
 south here 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.460
 And yes, everything else will come out there 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.280
 I do not know, I'll go in for a moment 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:31.400
 bit out the map looks very good 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:39.120
 but what he's all about right now and so 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:40.580
 here even the early picture means yes 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.530
 but decided 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.870
 yes and with starter kit funky but also 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.440
 that means you have that here 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:53.250
 starter kit with a complete complete 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:58.139
 he in things yes and there it could only 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:01.050
 suddenly things start to get that way 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.699
 a lore not long inside me 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.300
 I do not know that either 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:09.300
 but yes and I hope I expect that 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.620
 reasonably so, actually 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.130
 always well filled 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:18.110
 I was reading bad 237 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:22.259
 yes the imperator star moderator 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.610
 two presenters think so also 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.880
 supporters watching online 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.500
 about 12 supporters about 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.180
 maybe they still noticed me 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:35.400
 It does not exactly build a few bombs 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:39.020
 Team name as well as the build team believe 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.630
 here too, never the pictures here 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.150
 supporters and there is then on it 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.960
 what to do and so on and what he am 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.909
 best can 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.530
 These can act and two 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:51.419
 land immediately yes i hope it has you 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.219
 fallen when jan thumb up and thumb 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.240
 Down this place really worth it 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:58.500
 to really help because the map 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.330
 just look ugly 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.330
 or if I say that is
