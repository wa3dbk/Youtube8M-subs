while standard electronics would

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.100 
while standard electronics would
certainly<00:00:02.760> help<00:00:03.090> them<00:00:03.300> close<00:00:03.449> that<00:00:03.720> gap<00:00:03.899> to

thousand pounds so I'm gonna take a good
look<00:01:05.580> around<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.909> factory<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.450> see<00:01:06.479> exactly

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
look around the factory to see exactly

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:16.280 
look around the factory to see exactly
how<00:01:07.259> they<00:01:07.409> make<00:01:14.509> right<00:01:15.509> today<00:01:15.899> we're<00:01:16.170> gonna

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
how they make right today we're gonna

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.469 
how they make right today we're gonna
make<00:01:16.470> one<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.799> these<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:17.789> start<00:01:18.119> with<00:01:18.240> this

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
make one of these so we start with this

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.380 
make one of these so we start with this
a<00:01:18.690> wax<00:01:19.080> mold<00:01:19.440> made<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.190> the<00:01:20.340> factory<00:01:20.759> here<00:01:21.000> that

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
a wax mold made in the factory here that

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.779 
a wax mold made in the factory here that
is<00:01:21.690> sprayed<00:01:22.020> with<00:01:22.470> ceramic<00:01:23.039> ceramic<00:01:23.310> slurry

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
is sprayed with ceramic ceramic slurry

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:25.310 
is sprayed with ceramic ceramic slurry
and<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.360> something<00:01:24.539> like<00:01:24.750> an<00:01:24.899> eight-day

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
and it's something like an eight-day

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.710 
and it's something like an eight-day
process<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.070> put<00:01:26.280> all<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.550> ceramic<00:01:26.880> around

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
process to put all this ceramic around

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.499 
process to put all this ceramic around
this<00:01:27.990> once<00:01:28.979> you've<00:01:29.220> made<00:01:29.429> that<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.060> then<00:01:30.270> put

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
this once you've made that you then put

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.559 
this once you've made that you then put
it<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.810> an<00:01:30.929> oven<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.409> melt<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.580> out<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.360> there

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
it in an oven and melt this out of there

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:35.450 
it in an oven and melt this out of there
as<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.020> see<00:01:34.140> you've<00:01:34.530> got<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.770> area<00:01:35.069> here

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
as you can see you've got this area here

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.490 
as you can see you've got this area here
which<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.789> hollow<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.050> your<00:01:37.259> mold

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
which is hollow and that is your mold

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.270 
which is hollow and that is your mold
the<00:01:38.190> next<00:01:38.429> process<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:39.179> take<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.569> titanium

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
the next process is to take the titanium

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.120 
the next process is to take the titanium
heat<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.490> all<00:01:41.670> up<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.060> about<00:01:42.710> 1700<00:01:43.710> degrees

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.669 
heat that all up to about 1700 degrees
feed<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.240> bar<00:01:45.690> another<00:01:45.990> great<00:01:46.319> big<00:01:46.530> machine

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
feed that bar another great big machine

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.700 
feed that bar another great big machine
over<00:01:47.159> there<00:01:47.190> into<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.060> mold<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.659> there<00:01:49.500> you

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
over there into this mold and there you

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.740 
over there into this mold and there you
end<00:01:49.920> up<00:01:50.100> with<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> product<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:51.000> there<00:01:51.210> once<00:01:51.570> it

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
end up with a product in there once it

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.480 
end up with a product in there once it
cools<00:01:51.990> down<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.590> chip<00:01:52.920> away<00:01:53.070> all<00:01:53.310> this

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
cools down you chip away all this

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.969 
cools down you chip away all this
ceramic<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.180> then<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.930> end<00:01:55.229> up<00:01:55.439> with<00:01:55.649> a

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
ceramic and then you end up with a

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.429 
ceramic and then you end up with a
perfectly<00:01:56.729> formed<00:01:57.090> piece<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.570> titanium<00:01:57.719> like

perfectly formed piece of titanium like
that

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
that

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.109 
that
that's<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.350> casting<00:02:01.920> side<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.579> but<00:02:03.090> a

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
that's the casting side of it but a

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.539 
that's the casting side of it but a
large<00:02:03.450> part<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> 500<00:02:04.590> skilled<00:02:04.920> workforce

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
large part of the 500 skilled workforce

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.639 
large part of the 500 skilled workforce
is<00:02:05.759> devoted<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.450> actual<00:02:06.750> coal<00:02:06.990> bending<00:02:07.530> of

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
is devoted to the actual coal bending of

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:19.210 
is devoted to the actual coal bending of
the<00:02:07.680> titanium<00:02:08.069> pipes

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.980 

so<00:02:19.640> what<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:19.970> point<00:02:20.120> of<00:02:20.300> all<00:02:20.390> this<00:02:20.450> shaping

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
so what is the point of all this shaping

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.780 
so what is the point of all this shaping
and<00:02:21.140> forming<00:02:21.350> it's<00:02:21.710> not<00:02:21.890> just<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.340> look<00:02:22.460> called

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
and forming it's not just to look called

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.690 
and forming it's not just to look called
a<00:02:22.940> properly<00:02:23.480> designed<00:02:23.960> exhaust<00:02:24.740> system<00:02:25.220> will

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
a properly designed exhaust system will

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.550 
a properly designed exhaust system will
extract<00:02:26.300> more<00:02:26.540> power<00:02:26.900> from<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.140> engine<00:02:27.470> it

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
extract more power from the engine it

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.960 
extract more power from the engine it
will<00:02:27.650> make<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:27.980> flow<00:02:28.250> it's<00:02:28.490> a<00:02:28.550> bit<00:02:28.700> like<00:02:28.850> an

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
will make it flow it's a bit like an

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.390 
will make it flow it's a bit like an
athlete<00:02:29.360> with<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.540> nose<00:02:29.780> clip<00:02:30.110> on<00:02:30.260> air<00:02:30.710> going<00:02:31.130> in

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
athlete with a nose clip on air going in

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.480 
athlete with a nose clip on air going in
it's<00:02:31.640> got<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.150> flow<00:02:32.450> out<00:02:32.710> so<00:02:33.710> here<00:02:33.980> on<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.250> dyno

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
it's got to flow out so here on the dyno

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.700 
it's got to flow out so here on the dyno
now<00:02:34.910> we<00:02:35.210> just<00:02:35.420> check<00:02:35.690> out<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.020> see<00:02:36.200> exactly

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
now we just check out to see exactly

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.340 
now we just check out to see exactly

not just about maximum power is about

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.030 
not just about maximum power is about
