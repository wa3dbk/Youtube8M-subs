00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
awkward so I'll just do my arms and

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.300

you'll be able to see the color

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.640 
you'll be able to see the color
difference<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.939> just<00:02:18.900> give<00:02:19.019> me<00:02:19.049> a<00:02:19.170> quarter<00:02:19.590> of

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
difference so just give me a quarter of

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.960 
difference so just give me a quarter of
a<00:02:19.709> second<00:02:19.980> I'll<00:02:20.069> be<00:02:20.099> right<00:02:20.189> back<00:02:20.489> well<00:02:20.819> I'm

shoulder down and back along the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.800 
shoulder down and back along the
underside<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:40.340> color<00:02:40.520> is<00:02:40.610> super<00:02:41.480> super

my<00:05:26.270> first<00:05:26.540> impression<00:05:27.080> on<00:05:27.170> the<00:05:27.470> dark<00:05:27.740> cocoa

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
my first impression on the dark cocoa

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.350 
my first impression on the dark cocoa
brown<00:05:28.520> one<00:05:29.330> hour<00:05:29.450> tan<00:05:29.810> it's<00:05:30.470> not<00:05:31.100> as<00:05:31.370> dark<00:05:32.000> as<00:05:32.300> I

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
brown one hour tan it's not as dark as I

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.880 
brown one hour tan it's not as dark as I
thought<00:05:32.870> it<00:05:33.050> was<00:05:33.140> going<00:05:33.320> to<00:05:33.410> be<00:05:33.590> but<00:05:33.800> that's

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
thought it was going to be but that's

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.740 
thought it was going to be but that's
not<00:05:34.100> necessarily<00:05:34.460> a<00:05:34.610> bad<00:05:34.790> thing<00:05:34.850> because<00:05:35.330> I'm

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
not necessarily a bad thing because I'm

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.650 
not necessarily a bad thing because I'm
so<00:05:35.990> pale<00:05:36.260> it's<00:05:36.500> only<00:05:36.650> so<00:05:36.950> dark<00:05:37.220> my<00:05:37.460> skin<00:05:37.730> can<00:05:38.060> go

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
so pale it's only so dark my skin can go

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.280 
so pale it's only so dark my skin can go
however<00:05:39.440> I<00:05:39.800> would<00:05:40.760> equate<00:05:41.050> the<00:05:42.050> color

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
however I would equate the color

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.630 
however I would equate the color
provided<00:05:43.010> by<00:05:43.340> the<00:05:43.400> dark<00:05:43.940> as<00:05:45.010> two<00:05:46.010> layers<00:05:46.310> of

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
provided by the dark as two layers of

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.270 
provided by the dark as two layers of
the<00:05:47.060> original<00:05:47.480> so<00:05:47.780> if<00:05:48.020> you<00:05:48.410> apply<00:05:48.590> a<00:05:48.800> layer<00:05:49.250> of

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
the original so if you apply a layer of

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.580 
the original so if you apply a layer of
