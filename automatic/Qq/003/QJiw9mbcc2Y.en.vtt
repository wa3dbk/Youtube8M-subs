00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 Welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.190
 easter egg today I'll show you again 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.040
 a wonderful steak 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.860
 borderlands and that I show you 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:16.830
 today the release scream and the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:19.650
 we find in the city zibo junction 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.980
 from the dlc the secret armory of general 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.170
 knoxx let's just go here 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.859
 be careful not to fall down 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.269
 has happened to me once before yes I am 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.610
 a little clumsy but there you can 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.480
 also not change it and that is 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.850
 the object of desire here in the back 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.590
 this cottage 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.510
 up here you can see it's red the door 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.219
 is closed 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.020
 but that is kind of not a problem of 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.280
 directly opposite on the other side 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.899
 there is a button and that here 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.690
 he will not turn green or something like that 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.539
 you just press once and already 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.270
 The whole opens here and already 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.199
 we would have discovered the easter egg and 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:08.330
 Although the eleven scream with a lot 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:13.260
 Interesting gyros as nipples 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.420
 I think that's very funny yes 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.259
 It would be that with the easter egg 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.119
 actually already 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.009
 you can not do much more but 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.159
 there is something here in these little animals 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.210
 funny in there and that we have here 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.869
 an enemy in it 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.640
 who takes meat by a stalk level 61 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.479
 I am 46 but I try anyway 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.100
 to kill 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.659
 you can do it a little bit somehow 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.259
 be washed out that finally on 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.490
 I just try that 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.750
 come here 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:50.110
 belies me a lot if he wants me 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:50.110
 badly got rid of boy ok ok 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.810
 be packed 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.250
 oh yes it seems yes that's okay 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.540
 if I do not get too close to him now 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.479
 I can go just like that now 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.710
 but somehow it takes me 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.149
 all too long I would be the whole 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.680
 accelerate and we see and stand 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.810
 After that I would just go again 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.810
 say yes to the same 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.390
 that has taken but now synonymous 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.500
 my goodness okay i would say so 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.140
 Just do it again for a short time 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.300
 into the house because I want the things 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.610
 he just will not lose 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:29.280
 see drop down but here directly 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.360
 is not it just steaming you 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.410
 yes as I said I want the things 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.940
 just do not bring down now 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:40.360
 but also live okay I have nothing 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.350
 said he does not lose okay I would 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.490
 now a little bit more 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.460
 will continue for a while 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.930
 beat up but oh well that's in 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.110
 Ground for the video I hope I have it 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.720

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.520

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.120
 I say and then I wish one
