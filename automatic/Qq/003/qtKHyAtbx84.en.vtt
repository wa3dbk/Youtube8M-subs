00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.099
 hello everyone again but the second package 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.220
 this today it is a led and a flashlight 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.220
 ultrafire 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.480
 66 there are 200 2000 lumens 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:25.279
 how about us someone is not sealed 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.279
 can the roof 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:40.980
 by the way 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:43.430
 and Kitty also colin west to explore 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.430
 have written 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:01:00.440
 219 209 what a bicycle click with a whistle 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.440
 lanterns 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:18.450
 charger and battery 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:24.229
 ultrafire is such a 3000 battery 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.229
 milliamper with case with case 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:38.050
 Wow, you feel so metal here, but 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.970
 such a lens 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.970
 knows no glass yet don't know 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:02:05.480
 and we see it as necessary to the truth 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:12.520
 nauseous and her husband did not sell the euro connector from 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:12.520
 well in general, something like this is done 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:25.910
 here it is clear I will not see this help 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.120
 I believe that even for ordinary batteries 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.120
 people 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:43.670
 360 rotations too 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.330
 I got on very well in that it can 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.130
 many pull money but no it seemed 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.610
 just the human factor is not added 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:56.320
 80 grams are not directly weighed by the way on 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.070
 mail all I sit weighing 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.950
 having previously read 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.750
 reading the regulatory documents 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.510
 on vodka 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:16.250
 yes here we are 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:16.250
 Yes, I almost do not know the batteries are charged 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.620
 check that that is 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:36.090
 interesting dice so small whether 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:47.780
 Chipped whether with Tes such a little even no 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:47.780
 Instructions as inserted so it 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.310
 so loud 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.680
 so really how to embed there 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.680
 With a spring here is sochi 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.180
 so in general, okay, well, in principle, all 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.900
 about how I will fly you 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.440
 then show in a separate video now 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.620
 sometimes all the boy everything is in place everything everything 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.620
 until 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.600
 Hi there, I will use 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.060
 flashlight on 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:45.660
 wherever the light 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:51.020
 Now on the near border guards flashlight 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.020
 ultrafire hold so 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.509
 Well, yes there certainly can be seen even though 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.210
 it's us square 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.000
 16th floor 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.220
 she hits 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.569
 three hundred meters we learn 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.380
 and it is nowhere
