00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:04.709 
water and I would take the q-tip and go
around<00:02:02.590> and<00:02:02.859> swab<00:02:03.249> out<00:02:03.639> the<00:02:04.179> mealy<00:02:04.389> bug

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
around and swab out the mealy bug

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.019 
around and swab out the mealy bug
because<00:02:04.990> it<00:02:05.200> is<00:02:05.349> very<00:02:05.920> susceptible<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.639> it<00:02:06.909> as

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:07.029 
because it is very susceptible to it as

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:08.940 
because it is very susceptible to it as
a<00:02:07.060> houseplant<00:02:07.329> so<00:02:07.929> you<00:02:07.990> might<00:02:08.290> want<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.590> put<00:02:08.830> it

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
a houseplant so you might want to put it

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.740 
a houseplant so you might want to put it
in<00:02:09.100> a<00:02:09.610> sprayer<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.450> then<00:02:11.140> spray<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.650> plant<00:02:12.250> it

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
in a sprayer and then spray the plant it

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.540 
in a sprayer and then spray the plant it
it's<00:02:12.870> easier<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.470> do<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.590> depending<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.400> the

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
it's easier to do that depending on the

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.540 
it's easier to do that depending on the
size<00:02:14.820> of<00:02:15.180> your<00:02:15.350> plant<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.650> they<00:02:17.130> can<00:02:17.280> really

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
size of your plant and they can really

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.520 
size of your plant and they can really
stay<00:02:17.730> pop<00:02:18.000> bound<00:02:18.270> for<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.660> while<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.320> not

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
stay pop bound for a while it's not

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.340 
stay pop bound for a while it's not
really<00:02:20.010> fussy<00:02:20.640> into<00:02:20.910> having<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.690> big<00:02:21.870> pot<00:02:22.080> so

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
really fussy into having a big pot so

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.750 
really fussy into having a big pot so
you<00:02:22.380> don't<00:02:22.620> have<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.920> worry<00:02:23.130> about<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.610> it

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
you don't have to worry about that it

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.370 
you don't have to worry about that it
can<00:02:23.910> even<00:02:24.030> go<00:02:24.210> two<00:02:24.270> or<00:02:24.450> three<00:02:24.720> years<00:02:24.960> before

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
can even go two or three years before

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.190 
can even go two or three years before
you<00:02:25.500> pot<00:02:25.740> up<00:02:25.890> your<00:02:26.120> plant<00:02:27.120> again<00:02:27.450> unless<00:02:28.020> of

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
you pot up your plant again unless of

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.040 
you pot up your plant again unless of
course<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.530> crack<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.920> pot<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.480> then<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.810> is

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
course it's crack the pot and then it is

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.970 
course it's crack the pot and then it is
time<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:32.130> repot<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.090> otherwise<00:02:34.050> just<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.709> little

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
time to repot it otherwise just a little

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.540 
time to repot it otherwise just a little
bit<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.780> organic<00:02:37.040> liquid<00:02:38.040> fertilizer

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
bit of a organic liquid fertilizer

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.850 
bit of a organic liquid fertilizer
that's<00:02:39.240> balanced<00:02:39.810> out<00:02:39.930> something<00:02:40.320> like<00:02:40.410> 10<00:02:40.680> 10

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
that's balanced out something like 10 10

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.460 
that's balanced out something like 10 10
10<00:02:41.070> if<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.370> feel<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.330> need<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.630> fertilize<00:02:42.990> it

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
10 if you feel you need to fertilize it

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.620 
10 if you feel you need to fertilize it
I<00:02:43.650> never<00:02:43.790> fertilize<00:02:44.790> mine<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.150> give<00:02:45.510> them<00:02:45.600> a

I never fertilize mine I give them a

I never fertilize mine I give them a
