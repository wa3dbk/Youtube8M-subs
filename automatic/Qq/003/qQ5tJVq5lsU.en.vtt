00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
more a more comprehensive level than the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.469 
more a more comprehensive level than the
other<00:02:08.099> one<00:02:08.340> that's<00:02:08.489> styled<00:02:08.940> just<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:09.270> this

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
other one that's styled just like this

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.089 
other one that's styled just like this
it's<00:02:09.690> longer<00:02:10.259> than<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.679> other<00:02:10.860> one

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
it's longer than the other one

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.760 
it's longer than the other one
definitely<00:02:11.670> because<00:02:12.060> you're<00:02:12.360> going<00:02:12.510> up

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
definitely because you're going up

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.520

once then you go up again and then I

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.750 
once then you go up again and then I
think<00:02:15.770> you<00:02:15.830> go<00:02:15.980> up<00:02:16.070> a<00:02:16.130> total<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.400> like<00:02:16.520> three

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760

why<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:14.870> have<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.350> make<00:03:15.500> them<00:03:15.620> spin<00:03:16.010> all<00:03:16.280> that

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
why you have to make them spin all that

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.070 
why you have to make them spin all that
much<00:03:16.700> just<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:17.120> make<00:03:17.270> them<00:03:17.360> stay<00:03:17.570> straight<00:03:17.900> and

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
much just to make them stay straight and

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.840 
much just to make them stay straight and
they<00:03:18.560> fall<00:03:18.770> you<00:03:19.190> know<00:03:19.250> they<00:03:19.490> fall<00:03:19.670> back

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
they fall you know they fall back

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.840 
they fall you know they fall back
anyways<00:03:20.270> but<00:03:21.050> actually<00:03:21.770> right<00:03:21.980> here<00:03:22.010> is<00:03:22.459> an

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
anyways but actually right here is an

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.030 
anyways but actually right here is an
important<00:03:23.300> part<00:03:23.480> because<00:03:24.230> after<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.680> just<00:03:24.860> spin

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
important part because after I just spin

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.500 
important part because after I just spin
this<00:03:25.160> box<00:03:25.430> right<00:03:25.580> here<00:03:25.700> there's<00:03:26.270> a<00:03:26.390> little

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
this box right here there's a little

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.330 
this box right here there's a little
opening<00:03:27.140> behind<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.530> fence<00:03:27.740> and<00:03:28.040> you<00:03:28.160> can

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
opening behind the fence and you can

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.530 
opening behind the fence and you can
kind<00:03:28.459> of<00:03:28.580> just<00:03:28.640> skip<00:03:28.970> through<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.240> level

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
kind of just skip through the level

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.600 
kind of just skip through the level
there's<00:03:29.810> no<00:03:29.990> boxes<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:30.830> as<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:31.160> can<00:03:31.280> see<00:03:31.310> I'm

there's no boxes and as you can see I'm
spinning<00:03:31.910> behind<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:32.420> fence<00:03:32.600> just<00:03:33.260> checking

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
spinning behind the fence just checking

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.949 
spinning behind the fence just checking
but<00:03:34.340> there's<00:03:34.580> no<00:03:34.700> boxes<00:03:35.180> right<00:03:35.300> there<00:03:35.360> you<00:03:35.810> can

quite a bit and I don't know why they

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.220 
quite a bit and I don't know why they
were<00:03:55.880> just<00:03:55.970> so<00:03:56.120> awkwardly<00:03:56.570> together<00:03:56.930> but

I think the second island and the third
island<00:04:14.330> is<00:04:14.450> well<00:04:14.600> in<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.780> background<00:04:15.200> but

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380

the side of it and I'm not going to go

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.130 
the side of it and I'm not going to go
through<00:04:34.970> every<00:04:35.270> single<00:04:35.450> one<00:04:35.750> because<00:04:35.990> that's

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
through every single one because that's

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.350 
through every single one because that's
ten<00:04:36.650> apples<00:04:36.890> per<00:04:37.280> box<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:37.850> we'd<00:04:38.030> be<00:04:38.180> here
