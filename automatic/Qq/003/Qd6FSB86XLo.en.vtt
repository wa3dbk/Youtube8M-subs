like<00:06:56.050> the<00:06:56.289> new<00:06:56.470> figures<00:06:56.889> they'd<00:06:57.250> all<00:06:57.759> the

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 
like the new figures they'd all the

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:07.950 
the hands would would be down words but
it's<00:07:05.979> stupid<00:07:06.430> because<00:07:06.909> the<00:07:07.030> hands<00:07:07.300> would<00:07:07.479> hang

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:16.349 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:19.890 

definitely<00:07:17.349> a<00:07:17.380> cheaper<00:07:17.860> figure<00:07:18.280> not<00:07:18.849> as<00:07:19.150> good

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:19.900 
definitely a cheaper figure not as good

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.459 
definitely a cheaper figure not as good
as<00:07:20.229> the<00:07:20.620> new<00:07:21.009> ones<00:07:21.479> the<00:07:22.479> likeness<00:07:22.930> is<00:07:23.169> pretty

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:23.469 
as the new ones the likeness is pretty

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:27.390

good<00:07:23.740> the<00:07:24.190> sayings<00:07:24.699> are<00:07:24.940> alright<00:07:26.009> my<00:07:27.009> only

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 
good the sayings are alright my only

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.990 
good the sayings are alright my only
that<00:07:28.180> I<00:07:28.210> own<00:07:29.130> the<00:07:30.130> only<00:07:30.279> thing<00:07:30.550> why<00:07:30.669> I<00:07:30.699> don't

that I own the only thing why I don't

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.879 
that I own the only thing why I don't
recommend<00:07:31.210> this<00:07:31.750> is<00:07:31.870> because<00:07:32.229> of<00:07:32.440> the<00:07:32.560> heavy

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:32.889

boots and children may injure themselves

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:40.409 
boots and children may injure themselves
or<00:07:36.699> just<00:07:37.210> injure<00:07:37.719> their<00:07:38.680> siblings<00:07:39.130> but<00:07:40.060> other
