really starts to come into its own on a
circuit<00:01:50.800> like<00:01:50.950> this<00:01:50.980> because<00:01:51.340> you<00:01:51.460> can<00:01:51.640> do<00:01:52.770> all

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
circuit like this because you can do all

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.170 
circuit like this because you can do all
the<00:01:54.040> kind<00:01:54.280> of<00:01:54.370> Larry<00:01:55.270> stuff<00:01:55.690> if<00:01:55.870> you<00:01:55.990> want<00:01:56.170> to

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
just the combination of agility okay so

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.120 
just the combination of agility okay so
I<00:02:22.280> don't<00:02:22.489> think<00:02:22.970> it's<00:02:23.120> just<00:02:23.300> as<00:02:23.930> nimble<00:02:24.410> as<00:02:24.470> an

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130
