00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
creation so sadly I can make this

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.660 
creation so sadly I can make this
life-sized<00:00:27.859> because<00:00:28.859> well<00:00:29.039> life-size<00:00:29.460> would

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
life-sized because well life-size would

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.510 
life-sized because well life-size would
be<00:00:29.849> like<00:00:30.029> about<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> metre<00:00:30.599> tall<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.590> just

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
be like about a metre tall and I just

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.100 
be like about a metre tall and I just
don't<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.880> enough<00:00:32.969> pieces<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.480> make<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.899> at

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
don't have enough pieces to make it at

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.850 
don't have enough pieces to make it at
that<00:00:34.290> scale<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:35.489> i<00:00:35.520> just<00:00:35.730> made<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.710> just<00:00:37.710> need

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.619 
that scale so i just made it I just need
a<00:00:37.920> smaller<00:00:38.250> version<00:00:40.550> it's<00:00:41.550> pretty<00:00:41.760> detailed<00:00:42.270> I

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629

these just made some makeshift tools and
the<00:01:36.990> bottom<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.560> bit<00:01:37.770> fragile<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.299> you

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
the bottom it's a bit fragile so you

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.469 
the bottom it's a bit fragile so you
have<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.079> be<00:01:40.110> really<00:01:40.530> careful<00:01:40.710> with<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.250> but<00:01:42.210> it

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
have to be really careful with it but it

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.679 
have to be really careful with it but it
still<00:01:42.990> looks<00:01:43.229> pretty<00:01:43.320> good<00:01:43.820> top<00:01:44.820> bit<00:01:45.600> of

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
still looks pretty good top bit of

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.850 
still looks pretty good top bit of
little<00:01:45.899> pieces<00:01:48.110> on<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.259> side<00:01:49.500> there's<00:01:49.799> a
