00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 and I go to the point the turn starts 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.570
 if I come here I go straight to 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.890
 I invite you to the noise 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.390
 the pattern begins 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.260
 can you name the last part please 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.260
 direct entry 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.500
 if I come for any of this 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.370
 sector 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.440
 50 degrees 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.570
 while the direct I go straight to 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.820
 the point and I start to make a 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.579
 sustenance 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.370
 but there would have to start meeting 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.110
 Once I changed my start flag 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.239
 at 180 degrees it is correct 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.530
 The moment that arrived is when 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.300
 I have symptoms let's leave them at 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.050
 moment I 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.040
 if I arrive in this area 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.040
 as i enter 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.310
 not having it we can already 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.930
 the patterns and if we have not seen it 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.290
 now it allows logic but we have not 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.840
 involved with very well 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.379
 they have a drop in English or in the 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.210
 rhyme 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.700
 I adjusted day I heard that but I do not know 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.320
 I understood him I'm going to open here I'm going to 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.659
 Get to the point 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.659
 I'm going to continue with a lag 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.359
 30 degrees so if these are 2 105 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.359
 points I will continue 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.380
 and the difference then 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.380
 105 - 30 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.009
 30 degrees for a minute at the moment 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.070
 they change the flag and I know I'm 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:44.909
 at the point start counting a minute 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.909
 30 seconds 45 50 and 55 56 57 58 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.140
 180 degrees I come back 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.850
 and the thing here is an interception 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.399
 accepting I'm trying this radial that 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.860
 is what I was told in the 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:13.450
 remember that the order was to keep 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.450
 on course 285 to 1,500 feet 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.280
 all in a blog 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.370
 be radiant always be radial 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.740
 it's always going to be like that for one side can 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.450
 be more ridiculous of the final information 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.950
 of the tell us right now that those 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.570
 we have the course 0 90 to 3,000 feet to 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.280
 completely change the figure but the 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.310
 point the three options have how many 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.130
 options have 360 ​​degrees 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:44.060
 but the point is how the airport 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.360
 migrants will always do to the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.300
 right the settings if they are standard are 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.099
 to the right if they were not standard 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.220
 it specifies that the turns are going to be 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.670
 to the left 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.920
 but it could be the same as we understand 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.520
 for being here is what I'm saying 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.709
 if you do not say anything, it is that it is a 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.180
 standard pattern 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.829
 if it does not have to be a pattern 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.939
 standard then they will specify that the 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.939
 turns have to be made 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.890
 all right 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.100
 upstairs we know why they call it 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.100
 the record 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.959
 what is the area that we have left 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.959
 All this 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.020
 parallel 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.110
 parallel entry I come from here 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.610
 I go straight to the point once I change 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.710
 the little flag 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.460
 I will rotate parallel 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.330
 when revealing that my store hold 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.330
 I'm going 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.620
 5 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:05.370
 once I pass there starts to count 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:10.670
 the time 1 minute 30 seconds 45 50 55 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.670
 6 78 60 60 seconds 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.620
 plus 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:27.520
 in parallel because the parallel and because 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.260
 can not do there already a run 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.300
 is going to have a pattern on the right 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.650
 because the instructions was to keep the 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.390
 Pattern 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.689
 on course 28 well 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.879
 remember that all this will be for 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:45.469
 stay in that pattern but I'm 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:48.529
 coming with here that's why I have to go 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:50.119
 parallel wait for the minute to have 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:52.039
 a sufficient distance so that when 

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:53.779
 I do logic of hundreds of 180 degrees 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.519
 so I can go back and I can go back to 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:57.519
 mop and want to enter and maintain 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.100
 to direct directly to the point 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.170
 start pattern 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.440
 I come in tears for anyone 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.780
 of these sectors came here, "he continued. 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.340
 30 degrees off course with me 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.870
 they said 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.870
 continued one minute 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.549
 the pattern the moment the entry and there 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:32.819
 again to the point the pattern 

00:05:28.549 --> 00:05:34.559
 how will the entrance be and then the 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.669
 parallel if I come any by 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:38.519
 any of this sector 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:40.849
 I have to the point I will go parallel that goes 

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:40.849
 to be fair 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:52.219
 15 minutes minutes to the left 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:56.869
 the sacred ones that are 180 the idea is 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:58.680
 trachea and central when it says parallel 

00:05:56.869 --> 00:06:03.159
 it means 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:06.340
 in this case on the right side 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:06.340
 that is 

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:16.360
 on the right side of the wood 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.940
 that is, I could not continue being here and 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:25.800
 do this you can not 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.800
 the ellipses are parallel
