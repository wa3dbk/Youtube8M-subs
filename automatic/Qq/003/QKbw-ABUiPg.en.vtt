friend Jay had written and I was really

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.830 
friend Jay had written and I was really
intrigued<00:00:32.130> by<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.640> lot<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.210> philosophies

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
intrigued by a lot of the philosophies

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.770 
intrigued by a lot of the philosophies
and<00:00:34.230> thought<00:00:34.440> processes<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:36.570> made

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
and thought processes in it and it made

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.709 
and thought processes in it and it made
sense<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.230> me<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.579> when<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:38.910> got<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.149> bend<00:00:39.540> on

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
sense to me and so when I got to bend on

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.049 
sense to me and so when I got to bend on
August<00:00:40.050> 19th<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.620> had<00:00:40.770> just<00:00:41.070> taken<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
August 19th I had just taken a

August 19th I had just taken a
significant<00:00:42.690> time<00:00:42.840> off<00:00:43.020> running<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.500> it

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
significant time off running and it

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.560 
significant time off running and it
started<00:00:43.980> back<00:00:44.100> running<00:00:44.610> again<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.300> thought

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
started back running again and I thought

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.770 
started back running again and I thought
I<00:00:45.870> should<00:00:46.200> definitely<00:00:46.920> look<00:00:47.160> up<00:00:47.370> Jay<00:00:47.910> rebound

red wine
the<00:01:03.430> rep<00:01:03.610> lab<00:01:03.820> is<00:01:04.059> basically<00:01:04.869> a<00:01:04.930> two<00:01:05.229> tiered

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
the rep lab is basically a two tiered

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.200 
the rep lab is basically a two tiered
approach<00:01:05.530> right<00:01:06.010> so<00:01:06.280> we're<00:01:06.820> thinking<00:01:07.150> about

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
approach right so we're thinking about

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.060 
approach right so we're thinking about
having<00:01:07.750> good<00:01:08.020> ingredients<00:01:08.500> for<00:01:08.650> dinner<00:01:08.680> and<00:01:09.010> a

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
really good recipe to cook with so we

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.539 
really good recipe to cook with so we
start<00:01:11.500> talking<00:01:11.619> about<00:01:11.799> ingredients<00:01:12.159> that

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
start talking about ingredients that

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.070 
start talking about ingredients that
comes<00:01:12.759> from<00:01:13.060> an<00:01:13.270> athlete<00:01:13.600> who's<00:01:13.810> strong

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
comes from an athlete who's strong

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.469 
comes from an athlete who's strong

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
yeah we definitely put our clinical hat

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.680 
yeah we definitely put our clinical hat
on<00:01:18.159> to<00:01:18.700> improve<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.119> ingredients<00:01:19.600> for

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
on to improve the ingredients for

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.420 
on to improve the ingredients for
putting<00:01:19.960> in<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.890> then<00:01:21.009> we<00:01:21.100> start<00:01:21.340> talking

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
putting in and then we start talking

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.280 
putting in and then we start talking
about<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.850> recipe<00:01:22.300> it's<00:01:22.720> important<00:01:23.110> to<00:01:23.170> make

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
about the recipe it's important to make

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.590 
about the recipe it's important to make
sure<00:01:23.440> that<00:01:23.619> you<00:01:23.710> have<00:01:23.920> good<00:01:24.190> form<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.670> so<00:01:25.210> what

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
sure that you have good form and so what

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.240 
sure that you have good form and so what
the<00:01:25.690> rep<00:01:25.840> lab<00:01:26.020> allows<00:01:26.229> us<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.470> do<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:26.830> to<00:01:26.950> go<00:01:27.070> one

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
the rep lab allows us to do is to go one

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.300 
the rep lab allows us to do is to go one
step<00:01:27.520> beyond<00:01:28.330> so<00:01:29.320> we're<00:01:29.440> not<00:01:29.560> looking<00:01:29.920> at<00:01:30.009> just

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
step beyond so we're not looking at just

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.550 
step beyond so we're not looking at just
you<00:01:30.520> know<00:01:30.640> okay<00:01:31.240> how<00:01:31.659> much<00:01:31.810> do<00:01:32.049> you<00:01:32.140> run<00:01:32.350> but

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
you know okay how much do you run but

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.200 
you know okay how much do you run but
looking<00:01:32.860> at<00:01:32.920> more<00:01:33.040> run<00:01:33.220> quality<00:01:33.670> right<00:01:34.030> so

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
looking at more run quality right so

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.460 
looking at more run quality right so
what<00:01:34.330> does<00:01:34.420> your<00:01:34.450> volume<00:01:34.899> look<00:01:35.020> like<00:01:35.229> what<00:01:35.410> are

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
what does your volume look like what are

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.320 
what does your volume look like what are
your<00:01:35.590> miles<00:01:35.740> look<00:01:35.979> like<00:01:36.190> we<00:01:36.940> were<00:01:37.060> able<00:01:37.179> to

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
your miles look like we were able to

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.090 
your miles look like we were able to
take<00:01:37.570> Lindsay's<00:01:37.990> form<00:01:38.289> and<00:01:38.530> actually<00:01:38.800> distill

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
take Lindsay's form and actually distill

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.460 
take Lindsay's form and actually distill
it<00:01:39.190> down<00:01:39.220> to<00:01:39.429> bites<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.479> ones<00:01:40.690> and<00:01:40.899> zeroes<00:01:41.200> and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
it down to bites and ones and zeroes and

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.190 
it down to bites and ones and zeroes and
and<00:01:42.310> get<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.520> better<00:01:42.880> handle<00:01:43.360> on<00:01:43.420> what<00:01:43.600> types<00:01:43.990> of

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
and get a better handle on what types of

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.169 
and get a better handle on what types of
loads<00:01:44.470> runnings<00:01:44.979> placing<00:01:45.369> on<00:01:45.460> her<00:01:45.610> we're<00:01:46.090> able

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
loads runnings placing on her we're able

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.899 
loads runnings placing on her we're able
to<00:01:46.330> make<00:01:46.479> some<00:01:46.659> cues<00:01:46.990> on<00:01:47.319> form<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.610> help<00:01:48.729> her

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
to make some cues on form to help her

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.279 
to make some cues on form to help her
actually<00:01:49.210> make<00:01:49.330> running<00:01:49.509> easier<00:01:49.869> on<00:01:49.990> her<00:01:50.110> body

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
actually make running easier on her body

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.020
