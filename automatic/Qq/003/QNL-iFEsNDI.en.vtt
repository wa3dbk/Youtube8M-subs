00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.010
 this stadium has lived many 

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:11.530
 exceptional football 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.010
 exact strongest on the continent 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.430
 Although Fernando thinks I saw the saints 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.869
 from pelé to real de alfredo di stéfano and 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.869
 to argentina playing with maradona 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.170
 says that saints are the strongest 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.080
 of the continent 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.539
 hello I am fernando niembro I am Mariano 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.750
 closs and we are the voices of pes 2014 for 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.750
 Argentina 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.630
 for me it means a passion and a 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.800
 profession would give the feeling that the 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.870
 second part I would notice more cold more 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.970
 away everything done professional put a 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.270
 distance there is definitely a 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.610
 fierce rivalry between the two in health 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.820
 that distance seems to me to be a 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.160
 obligation to be accurate to have 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.489
 precision to understand more what is 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.489
 play 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.330
 soccer is part of me 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.620
 very important my life did well in 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.390
 hit the arch but that's no more 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.890
 tennis liked to be playing 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.100
 so with them with the truly 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.010
 professionals and I think that just 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.530
 so unlink in the part where where 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.420
 I really dedicated myself to this final 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.490
 of regulation time with a draw in 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.620
 the score so the game was going to 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.200
 deciding on penalties that allowed them 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.800
 be on many occasions in the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.990
 final of the champions 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.120
 what it means to broadcast a match of 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.300
 virtual football an experience 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.820
 unforgettable was something so so equal so 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.770
 identical they had a golden age in the 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.510
 90s that culminated and quite 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.950
 brother with what we usually do 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.900
 live on the different courts in the 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.910
 different places that was born and left 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.250
 naturally as soon as I got into that 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.380
 world I realized that it is 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.940
 just like football that is played all 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.940
 the days 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.690
 when there is no football, there is a truth 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.850
 empty a feeling that something is missing 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.250
 and that's why I think it's already so 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.860
 impregnated that ultimately goes from the 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.840
 hand with tooth 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.730
 the heat of football has always 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.470
 remembered 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.840
 the latest signals the whistle blows 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.629
 of the referee and the match ends 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.090
 Greetings to our friends from 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.090
 let's talk then the language of football
