00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.879 
definitely okay with them I don't find
that<00:03:27.690> they<00:03:27.840> were<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.200> much<00:03:28.349> cheaper<00:03:28.739> that<00:03:28.859> I

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
that they were so much cheaper that I

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.129 
that they were so much cheaper that I
might<00:03:29.160> go<00:03:29.310> for<00:03:29.459> them<00:03:29.549> again<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.599> then<00:03:30.750> also<00:03:30.959> I

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
might go for them again and then also I

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.900 
might go for them again and then also I

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
just out of the waterproof so I decided

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.330 
just out of the waterproof so I decided
to<00:03:36.690> give<00:03:36.810> this<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:36.989> shot<00:03:37.109> I<00:03:37.500> don't<00:03:38.010> particularly

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
to give this a shot I don't particularly

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.659 
to give this a shot I don't particularly
like<00:03:38.819> it<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.150> feel<00:03:39.329> like<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.599> stings<00:03:39.900> my<00:03:40.079> eyes<00:03:40.260> um

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.129 
like it I feel like it stings my eyes um
it's<00:03:41.669> just<00:03:41.940> not<00:03:42.209> something<00:03:42.569> I<00:03:42.900> would<00:03:43.049> probably

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
it's just not something I would probably

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.159 
it's just not something I would probably
repurchase<00:03:44.040> but<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.699> was<00:03:44.910> in<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.239> pinch<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:45.870> I

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
repurchase but it was in a pinch and I

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.569 
repurchase but it was in a pinch and I
will<00:03:46.410> finish<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:46.829> off<00:03:46.919> because<00:03:47.160> it's<00:03:47.400> what<00:03:47.549> i

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579
