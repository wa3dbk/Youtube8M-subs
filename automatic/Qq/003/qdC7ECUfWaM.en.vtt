00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hi, everyone, I'm your friend, RaÃºl, says, today, I come a little out of the wave because of 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.269
 I've seen many videos insulting the border many others insulting the 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.299
 strict and cers good I just come today with this video to do a bit of 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.409
 intermediary although personally I like much more playing the cof 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:20.599
 I plan to be objective in my comments and I hope everything goes well 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:22.109
 i start 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.489
 good first for those who insult the cob 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:28.039
 I personally think that this game has a wide range of movements 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.789
 I think many more than the strict one to iTunes the car was fine until the 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:33.980
 level 96 8 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.770
 then they would put those blowjobs that the team was 4 and a 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.970
 click extra iker that screwed me 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.760
 and I stopped playing 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.160
 and so it was during the sale and 9 things 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.789
 2000 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.460
 and 2001 those machines personally make me a fucking shit but after 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.710
 came with her thousand and two and as everything was rearranged from the others I did not 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.700
 I want the graphics and the scenarios improved a lot 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.390
 but personally the fighting style of three of a chin gassed alternating 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.250
 I do not like 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.820
 but good another thing that the santicos complain about are the movements 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.940
 I look for those two mona are the best of the 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.090
 game since you have to know the whole circle of movements to be able to do 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.810
 a combo in front and those who complain about this because I can not say otherwise 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:18.810
 more than 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.960
 They are mediocre poor people who do not know how to play and simply open their noses to 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.619
 shit if I think there are monkeys that do not even click if they are in the game but 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:28.950
 good let's leave the cob 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.719
 now the strict to iters 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.779
 this game the one that says that it is a garbage is asshole is one of the games 

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:38.309
 pioneers of art and dictated two we played it as small so I do not know 

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:41.780
 Do assholes saying it's the worst shit that ever existed 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.570
 and personally I like only the editions where there are not so many pinches 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.960
 monkeys suckers like that fucking samurai can or I do not know what chingaos is not 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.340
 it's worth to fuck 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.299
 or the fucking gang member that with chains and pointed hair that then that ching 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.960
 adolfo maple there and so on 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.480
 the fighting style is still the same the seats are short the game can be 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.159
 get tedious because of the combat modality 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.149
 as they tried to make the combos longer when the bus bar 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.260
 power and the monkey was getting faster but the only thing that made people guess 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.819
 celebrate as 20 girl kicks the 20 weak points that's stupid this 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.680
 game I stopped liking when they took out the editions alfar and I do not know how many 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.910
 blowjobs that is there they started to take out so much fucking asshole that they are just 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.879
 filling and that are not worth for cigars and dried only one or the other but the 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.629
 general, they always choose themselves 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.799
 now the strict country kers criticize the costs for the plus versions of 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.760
 the cobos I do not know if you do not remember do not do assholes but the strict country 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.349
 kers also has his champions version or do not know what and mothers 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.480
 where can you get the fucking power screen and even fly with the monkeys 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.290
 that just as a reminder and also about the buggy mistakes 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.290
 I agree that the cost of a puter of errors 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.049
 but they have to be very special conditions for them to happen 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.359
 he came to think that these are left with all the intention 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.439
 because editing condition changes are almost never the same but that's my 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:06.400
 point of view 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.489
 and everyone can think what they want 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.099
 and there are those who say that the car has no history and that they just grab onto 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.639
 shit 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.409
 good fucking ignorant fucking if you have history and everything is derived from a 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.409
 legend of Japanese mythology that is called 'the legend of the sword accuse the 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.959
 day which snk gave her own interpretation to accommodate her to the game 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.259
 mainly based on I want 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:32.489
 and csif one but almost all the monkeys intervene in the story and all the 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.869
 games are related to each other 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:36.739
 it's not just a fucking tournament and now 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.769
 has a whole story to follow 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.480
 the only version that I believe has nothing to do with history is the 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.209
 antler and eight but he has not investigated very well and I'm not very sure 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.819
 and for those who say that there is a load of kilos 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:49.959
 they are right 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.890
 if there is a putero but it has to do with the story where they clone here or the 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:58.519
 trains to use it well that's only roughly because I do not plan to tell 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.900
 the whole story because it gives me the cave 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.860
 if they were given the task of investigating a little bit instead of opening the snout to 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.329
 asshole would understand 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.419
 like the strict one to go kers has its history also for the assholes that 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.019
 they say it's done to wii 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.760
 well at least the versions that I like if they have 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.970
 the others are worth to me mother and with goals said before 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.890
 the whole story from the beginning is based on region and paulativamente enters 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:22.390
 the queen 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.890
 for those who do not know at the beginning was the fart with the country they are and then already 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.730
 came out the story of aquarming something useful that also nothing else has to do with 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.210
 the two mentioned above 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.540
 and there are even movies in the game for those who are interested in knowing a little 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.480
 and if they are going to criticize something unless it is groundless but only speak to 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.900
 I asshole but good to finish I keep playing the two games except 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.680
 of the editions that mention that I'm both shit are very funny 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.600
 and therefore I do not criticize anyone who plays strict and kers nor does 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.180
 nobody who plays with only those who put the plus and do not stop doing 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.039
 maximum 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.330
 but that's another issue that I'll discuss later 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.030
 I just say that this lawsuit between costs and strict fahid kers is not going to 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.949
 have an end since we all have different tastes 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.689
 better stop fucking each other and everyone plays their favorite 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:12.699
 I say goodbye now not without first thanking missiles and zero coma two that helped me 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.039
 with the program you're fine and thank you 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:16.669
 good to be cool and see you soon
