00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.090
 and everyone to the question while I bring my children to the 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.090
 these gaps in the back four 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:11.040
 be careful with the climate say goodbye 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.129
 yes, of course, there are 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.800
 if we went now if the blues is clear play building home the question 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.930
 how often do I have that in a game that really draws the opponent in the clear 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.849
 Game structure that I have to leave first 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.449
 to let the work in the game structure are not young women footballers 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:27.980
 absolutely worth our 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.140
 We want to be in possession of the ball as soon as possible Elfie Wutke 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.510
 can play 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.730
 but if now the topic is going to go down thanks to all the world say here is the ball 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.200
 And while he walks the page then we stand on both sides 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.300
 I can tell that she is this topic fitness striker so far only nine days earlier 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.630
 but increased and also some of these groups is 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.049
 Center to make stronger to direct players 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:54.680
 then he already spoke «as one stays with the topic 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.780
 the distances there are people who say 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.280
 Parents need to pay attention between the players that one is there then 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.520
 People have to bid between the players 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.940
 I do not really think much of these distances I have to be honest 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.640
 say 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.750
 makes sense to me distances owner banks 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.120
 if the opponent clear play build-up 1 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.190
 if we really have a compact field here but what happened 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.820
 as soon as the ball is played 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.980
 as soon as the ball is recorded this position 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.620
 who did not hold the haircuts because we do not if not 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.980
 provides 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.050
 we need 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.570
 and we are we are making a flock around the Basler around that is if the ball 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.330
 which is recorded 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.250
 which you sometimes miss the signal from Sulzfeld that at City 2 »he played something 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.650
 change that now then he had to sure he slips out 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.180
 he radiates and the corporation needs it he should be there he was soldier of 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.900
 income 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.350
 and then I already formed 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.660
 yes, where are the distances right now? 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.560
 they are not there anymore and i should not be there either 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.360
 that's what the people of Basel want 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.780
 create the pressure 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.759
 the tunnel complies with distances 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.280
 then you can only 19 90 euros against the ball 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.050
 produce 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.299
 then you can go on strike again, "says 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.860
 these were about those in the team 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.370
 the team was foreseeable and we'll do it in one-on-one 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.959
 room 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.859
 out of it again 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.390
 but I hold in general 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.350
 I do not think much of turning off units 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.629
 That's why today I am very important to my children 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.309
 which should behave in which situation 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:27.139
 to come back to the topic it is an opponent clear play structure 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:29.050
 then we can say 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.879
 how does Bender fit in for example now? 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:32.740
 they are 8 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.619
 Defeats yes 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:36.909
 Let's join the guys with one 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.549
 Berben food 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.929
 then, for example, game would be possible 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:43.139
 the ball is running 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.640
 and the Russians now over the line have to stay excited 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.950
 then the door opened a bit but when the excavator in the 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:50.919
 mirror 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:54.359
 the distances must be greater swell and you could do so 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.879
 You could check that if he was a game that says Bucher 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:01.999
 and are agreeing right now we want a distance must be shorter now and 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:04.999
 everyone has to ask but beware 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.689
 which cereal with children 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.239
 Lose songs at play time which from their share time for 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.930
 Coordination and time for technology 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.349
 how much more important 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.349
 What he really wants to become is something that will keep coming up 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:23.019
 that's why I did not think so after that boy did with those 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.440
 "Games" by far and what is not all 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.099
 should be much better 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.849
 you do with one with one 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.260
 Percent of the Irish crisis 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.260
 that you will adjust again Abs 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.629
 and that you really are the only people 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:38.860
 up to high "You are me" 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.079
 Weckesser should double 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.979
 Dexia more meaningful to play the kicker can save their contacts and 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:45.659
 improves those of him 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.129
 or you make a little tactic meeting before a game 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.480
 what after the game talks about his tactics and finally discuss people 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.849
 individually 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.020
 where she was not well moved shows she still likes to hit 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.769
 and children learn to project in the square as well on the square 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.079
 I understand them too 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.609
 So this one quotes a time ago 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.469
 It really does not imply we build but it was then delighted 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:11.000
 would have been possible 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.679
 otherwise it would be really great 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:15.599
 that will be rehabilitated to the playground 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.199
 six runs maybe my game then saw one of the game against the 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.469
 do the two or against the only one who I would be 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.409
 Now I want to go in there 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.469
 and then I just want you on a back four the thicket 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:32.550
 that made sure that the 70 top the top 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.029
 leave the front midfield again 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:37.949
 and in the next game will finally get me on many 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.460
 we give them that already understand 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.420
 he was also a bit more time 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.750
 and the deeds of factual implementation need not be considered 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.080
 but I take it time has finally come and what technology 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.039
 it already sees a time it should be on 1 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.059
 yes Vienna 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:58.499
 7 yes and then with four times a week accordingly then take care of you 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:02.429
 Tell the squatting place where always exactly what people 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:07.139
 but then something had canceled the wm team offer the youth vintage 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.139
 and in general I tried to settle that is insofar should the 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.590
 Distributed to communities 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.539
 it is in the sense of the word 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.580
 The year before declined, it is generally forbidden 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.189
 there was a player is now complete to show how this works and the 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:24.050
 We never offer any other position to neglect 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.389
 Tailwind is offered would be Euro 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.160
 but then again and of course I have to always and always 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:32.139
 explained again 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:33.659
 Dr 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:37.470
 Martin down to the topic of a dealer percent 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.279
 said Gabriel 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:43.649
 the people we feel still addressable twelve man injured brain works 

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:47.389
 and everyone needs to know exactly what a reclining position demands of him 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.039
 but in advance 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.810
 that these important points would not do that 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.960
 this is a staged 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.749
 11 2% traded b-youth percent 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:04.249
 also commander Christian but in youth he consented to show 2% 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:05.889
 we tell them what 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.159
 each of us care »required limitation of salaries 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.759
 - if Elvis lay down 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.820
 what is the bow being played 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.570
 but these different pictures and so on that's really nice idea though 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.679
 8 5 percent of them distance Dorsten
