00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
another diverter on there just like I

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.949 
another diverter on there just like I
have<00:02:27.420> on<00:02:27.570> my<00:02:28.910> Dutch<00:02:29.910> bucket<00:02:30.270> system<00:02:30.450> over<00:02:30.810> here

divert water so this one are in one tube
into<00:02:57.090> here<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.570> can<00:02:57.690> see<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.930> water

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
into here is you can see the water

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.360 
into here is you can see the water
pebbles<00:02:58.380> still<00:02:59.150> I<00:03:00.530> just<00:03:01.530> run<00:03:01.709> one<00:03:01.920> tube<00:03:02.190> to

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
pebbles still I just run one tube to

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.890 
pebbles still I just run one tube to
kind<00:03:02.549> of<00:03:02.610> limit<00:03:02.910> its<00:03:03.030> water<00:03:03.269> right<00:03:03.600> because

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
kind of limit its water right because

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.150 
kind of limit its water right because
it's<00:03:04.049> not<00:03:04.650> overflowing<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.600> also

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
it's not overflowing that and I also

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.350 
it's not overflowing that and I also
increase<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.400> angle<00:03:08.549> of<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.959> tube<00:03:11.269> you<00:03:12.269> know

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
increase the angle of the tube you know

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.060 
increase the angle of the tube you know
hoping<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.780> little<00:03:13.290> more<00:03:13.530> dry<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.739> can<00:03:13.860> see

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
hoping a little more dry you can see

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.530 
hoping a little more dry you can see

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
what i did i just increase the angle of

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.949 
what i did i just increase the angle of
the<00:03:22.320> tube<00:03:23.000> cut<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.090> water<00:03:24.269> back<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.720> seems

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
the tube cut the water back and it seems

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.120 
the tube cut the water back and it seems
to<00:03:25.470> be<00:03:25.650> okay<00:03:27.350> oddly<00:03:28.350> enough<00:03:28.380> they<00:03:28.650> still<00:03:28.890> seem

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
to be okay oddly enough they still seem

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.590 
to be okay oddly enough they still seem
to<00:03:29.160> consume<00:03:29.549> as<00:03:29.670> much<00:03:29.790> water<00:03:30.000> during<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.480> day

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
to consume as much water during the day

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.060 
to consume as much water during the day
like<00:03:30.630> transpire<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.470> water<00:03:31.650> like<00:03:31.890> three

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
like transpire the water like three

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.410 
like transpire the water like three
gallons<00:03:33.380> six<00:03:34.380> gallons<00:03:34.739> rather<00:03:34.920> three<00:03:35.430> he<00:03:36.329> has

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
gallons six gallons rather three he has

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.729 
gallons six gallons rather three he has
a<00:03:36.480> three<00:03:36.720> gallon<00:03:36.840> tank<00:03:37.140> that's<00:03:37.320> why<00:03:37.470> I'm<00:03:37.530> going

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
a three gallon tank that's why I'm going

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.740 
a three gallon tank that's why I'm going
bigger<00:03:37.920> so<00:03:38.760> anyway<00:03:39.000> everybody's<00:03:39.450> doing

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
bigger so anyway everybody's doing

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.539 
bigger so anyway everybody's doing
really<00:03:40.260> really<00:03:40.350> exceptionally<00:03:41.220> well<00:03:41.370> I'm
