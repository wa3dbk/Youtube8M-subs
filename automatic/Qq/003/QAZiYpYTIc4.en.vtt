00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.160 
about 10 inches I wouldn't call that 10
inches<00:05:34.250> I'd<00:05:34.430> say<00:05:34.610> that's<00:05:36.370> no<00:05:37.630> well<00:05:38.630> shit<00:05:38.990> maybe

it<00:05:39.350> is<00:05:41.050> anyway<00:05:42.050> we've<00:05:42.410> got<00:05:42.470> this<00:05:42.800> thing<00:05:42.860> going

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
it is anyway we've got this thing going

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.310 
it is anyway we've got this thing going
here<00:05:43.520> I<00:05:43.580> don't<00:05:43.790> know<00:05:43.970> if<00:05:44.000> this<00:05:44.180> is<00:05:44.360> I<00:05:44.630> think

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
here I don't know if this is I think

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.180 
here I don't know if this is I think
this<00:05:45.560> is<00:05:45.680> just<00:05:45.710> plastic<00:05:46.480> copies<00:05:47.480> yeah

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
this is just plastic copies yeah

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.070 
this is just plastic copies yeah
definitely<00:05:49.190> plastic<00:05:49.700> but<00:05:50.630> this<00:05:50.780> basically

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
definitely plastic but this basically

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.780 
definitely plastic but this basically
works<00:05:51.350> as<00:05:51.530> the<00:05:51.560> air<00:05:51.770> duct<00:05:52.100> as<00:05:52.280> you<00:05:52.400> can<00:05:52.520> see<00:05:52.669> it

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
works as the air duct as you can see it

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.480 
works as the air duct as you can see it
takes<00:05:52.940> up<00:05:53.180> two<00:05:53.419> slots<00:05:54.130> you've<00:05:55.130> got<00:05:55.250> the<00:05:55.340> actual

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
takes up two slots you've got the actual

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.390 
takes up two slots you've got the actual
card<00:05:55.850> here<00:05:56.120> and<00:05:56.330> then<00:05:56.480> we've<00:05:56.690> got<00:05:56.810> this

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
card here and then we've got this

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.850 
card here and then we've got this
cooling<00:05:58.400> duct<00:05:58.720> I'm<00:05:59.720> assuming<00:06:00.169> this<00:06:00.290> fan<00:06:00.560> here

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
cooling duct I'm assuming this fan here

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.909 
cooling duct I'm assuming this fan here
sucks<00:06:01.250> in<00:06:01.520> the<00:06:02.000> air<00:06:02.180> and<00:06:02.540> blows<00:06:02.870> it<00:06:02.900> out<00:06:03.230> the

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
sucks in the air and blows it out the

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:06.580 
sucks in the air and blows it out the
back<00:06:04.130> here<00:06:04.840> should<00:06:05.840> work<00:06:05.990> pretty<00:06:06.169> good<00:06:06.410> it

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
back here should work pretty good it

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.450 
back here should work pretty good it
looks<00:06:06.710> like<00:06:06.860> it's<00:06:07.040> triple<00:06:07.730> SLI<00:06:08.210> ready<00:06:09.460> which

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
looks like it's triple SLI ready which
