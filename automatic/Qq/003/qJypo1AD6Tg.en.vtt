00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.599
 Russia has already announced that they intend to 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.679
 check witness testimony 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.719

 the day I flew su-25 hung with rockets 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.720
 and just a few hours later it became 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.470
 aware of the tragedy 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.000

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.650
 man sitting with his back to the camcorder 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.779
 perhaps the most important witness 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.849
 the worst offing crime 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.769

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.579
 who hit a boeing near Donetsk he fears 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.620
 for his life therefore hides his face 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.540
 and a voice opposite him journalists 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.170
 Komsomolskaya by the words chief editor 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.090
 kp 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.430
 this man came to him himself comes 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.750
 man shows his documents 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.750
 Ukrainian passport 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.940
 documents confirming his real 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.579
 work biography start talking 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.530
 with him 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.480
 answers are all pretty believable and by 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.550
 According to a secret witness on July 17 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.019
 about an hour before the crash of a boeing with 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.250
 air bases in the village of aviator ska and 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.990
 three attack aircraft took off 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.240
 one of them with two class rockets 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.799
 air-to-air they do not enter regular 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.380
 ammunition and rarely used on 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.159
 su-25 so the airbase worker drew 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.009
 attention to it 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.080
 returned this attack aircraft already without missiles two 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.409
 other aircraft and never returned after 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.409
 what 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.560
 at 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.330
 segments grow this one plane 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.520
 Essentials need hands and most importantly 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.340
 the witness says the name of the pilot you know 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.030
 with this pilot saw you know him 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.100
 and you can tell as summoned - it 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.770
 was a pilot Voloshin he was alone in the plane 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.090
 it was easy this name his not know service in 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.740
 Ukrainian air force does have 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.910
 Captain Vladislav Voloshin him twice 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.160
 shown on Ukrainian television 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.700
 the first time he got an officer 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.010
 epaulettes 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.020
 here is a fragment of that report fly 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.240
 dreamed since childhood vladislav voloshin 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.220
 first enrolled in Lugansk military face 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.930
 and the navigators after came to study in 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.260
 Kharkov scoreboard 2007 the city of Dzhankoy 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.400
 in the Crimea here we were flying to 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.470
 light aircraft but the second 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.520
 the plot in it is Vladislav Voloshin already flying 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.560
 on su-25 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.450
 for lieutenant vladislav lushin this 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.570
 dust shnui fees you are the oldest remembered 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.850
 on all lives it feels like I'm on 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.220
 one step higher climbed his 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.110
 career life by the words 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.150
 witnesses on July 17 after landing 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.640
 Vladislav Voloshin was very scared and 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.560
 uttered a few strange words phrase 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.800
 grunted heard where the plane is not there 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.190
 evening evening the phrase was 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.660
 the issue. and there already with this plane in 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.880
 something connected minutes turned out not 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.320
 you need a temporary living nothing of that 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.790
 what the secret witness told no 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.640
 contradict tactical and technical 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.050
 the characteristics of the Su-25 attack rook 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.209
 really can't climb 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.010
 height of 10 kilometers as a boeing but it 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.459
 could easily make missiles lowered 7 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.590
 kilometers the more footprint has already been given 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.980
 coordinates him which area in his and 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:17.150
 topic to meet with this 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.120
 by plane and then you see a couple of teams 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.640
 see or suggest that 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:26.750
 azimuth such a height so everything is calm 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.870
 this pilot can go to this share in 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.120
 the desired point and from any angle in 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.230
 principle can beat him maybe 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.720
 indeed it was a pilot error 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.870
 which they orient themselves in the situation 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.819
 either took a passenger plane for 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.879
 Russian reconnaissance aircraft 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.219
 either he was given incorrect data 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.719
 target designation must also understand 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:50.090
 eye competent authorities of Ukraine and 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:51.409
 and ICAO Russian investigators lead their 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.150
 own investigation of the case 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.859
 Boeing crash they have already installed 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.540
 contact with the witness and soon 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.819
 time will officially interrogate him 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.969
 investigators plan first to get 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.040
 from him information relating to the subject 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:07.609
 investigations also circumstances 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.239
 Boeing crashes voiced by him in an interview 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:12.739
 edition to check 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.989
 the authenticity of this information and their 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.250
 objectivity investigation results 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.150
 international commission for some reason

 classified 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.320
 promises to make them public no sooner 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.050
 mid-2015 possible appearance 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.099
 new witness will speed up this process 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.810
 will have to either confirm either 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.910
 refute his testimony but 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.340
 ignore such information no longer 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.120
 get in Linden Trushkin hope maturation
