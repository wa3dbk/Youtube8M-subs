00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
fictional so a fictional character but I

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.319 
fictional so a fictional character but I
think<00:01:48.450> carry<00:01:48.689> bronze<00:01:49.049> real<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.680> honest

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
think carry bronze real to be honest

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.810 
think carry bronze real to be honest
some<00:01:51.329> some<00:01:51.899> people<00:01:52.020> upload<00:01:52.979> YouTube<00:01:53.189> videos

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
some some people upload YouTube videos

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.749 
some some people upload YouTube videos
and<00:01:54.360> it's<00:01:54.780> half<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.500> time<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.189> know<00:01:56.430> they

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
and it's half of the time you know they

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.179 
and it's half of the time you know they
have<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> herobrine<00:01:57.689> mod<00:01:57.990> installed<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:59.159> I

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
have a herobrine mod installed but I

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.240 
have a herobrine mod installed but I
think<00:01:59.549> herobrine<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.149> real<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.500> if<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.070> have

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
think herobrine is real so if you have

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.859 
think herobrine is real so if you have
something<00:02:02.579> like<00:02:02.610> single<00:02:03.119> player<00:02:03.360> commands

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
something like single player commands

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.899 
something like single player commands
and<00:02:04.110> trying<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.500> spawn<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.100> herobrine<00:02:05.700> you

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
and trying to spawn in herobrine you

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.080 
and trying to spawn in herobrine you
can't<00:02:06.210> because<00:02:06.750> he's<00:02:07.500> not<00:02:07.770> actually<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
can't because he's not actually on the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.860 
can't because he's not actually on the
mob<00:02:09.330> list<00:02:09.840> but<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.229> think<00:02:10.649> he's<00:02:11.190> what<00:02:11.489> they<00:02:11.670> call

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
mob list but I think he's what they call

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.040 
mob list but I think he's what they call
hidden

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
hidden

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.860 
hidden
mob<00:02:13.200> maybe<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:14.220> mob<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.700> can't<00:02:15.030> spawn<00:02:15.570> you

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
mob maybe the mob you can't spawn you

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.320 
mob maybe the mob you can't spawn you
just<00:02:16.080> gotta<00:02:16.260> live<00:02:16.590> let<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.130> spawn<00:02:17.460> every<00:02:18.000> once

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
just gotta live let it spawn every once

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.880 
just gotta live let it spawn every once
