00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 
out and I make a second video to see if

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.249 
out and I make a second video to see if
this<00:07:09.300> one<00:07:09.539> was<00:07:09.750> broken<00:07:10.289> or<00:07:10.589> defective<00:07:11.159> or<00:07:12.259> well

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:13.259 
this one was broken or defective or well

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:15.079 
this one was broken or defective or well
not<00:07:13.469> usually<00:07:13.680> when<00:07:13.979> they<00:07:14.129> go<00:07:14.310> back<00:07:14.580> you<00:07:14.909> can

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:15.089 
not usually when they go back you can

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:16.820 
not usually when they go back you can
hear<00:07:15.300> you<00:07:15.479> can<00:07:15.629> feel<00:07:15.810> the<00:07:15.930> little<00:07:16.110> grains<00:07:16.500> and

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830 
hear you can feel the little grains and

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.589 
hear you can feel the little grains and
and<00:07:17.159> all<00:07:17.339> the<00:07:17.430> other<00:07:17.550> stuff<00:07:17.819> that<00:07:17.879> that<00:07:18.360> that's

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:18.599 
and all the other stuff that that that's

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:21.350 
and all the other stuff that that that's
in<00:07:18.839> there<00:07:19.020> you<00:07:19.979> can<00:07:20.129> feel<00:07:20.310> them<00:07:20.430> loosely<00:07:21.029> and

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 
in there you can feel them loosely and

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.329 
in there you can feel them loosely and
and<00:07:21.719> they<00:07:21.870> start<00:07:22.379> to<00:07:22.469> break<00:07:22.649> apart<00:07:22.680> and<00:07:23.159> come

00:07:23.329 --> 00:07:23.339 
and they start to break apart and come

00:07:23.339 --> 00:07:25.909 
and they start to break apart and come
out<00:07:23.719> so<00:07:24.719> it's<00:07:24.810> time<00:07:24.839> to<00:07:24.930> get<00:07:25.139> clogs<00:07:25.649> on<00:07:25.830> the

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 
out so it's time to get clogs on the

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:31.850 
out so it's time to get clogs on the
line<00:07:27.560> so<00:07:29.000> it's<00:07:30.000> a<00:07:30.240> good<00:07:30.419> video<00:07:30.599> to<00:07:30.960> go<00:07:31.139> the

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.860 
line so it's a good video to go the

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.170
