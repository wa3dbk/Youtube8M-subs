very easy I'm using acrylic paints for
this<00:01:07.740> design<00:01:08.100> because<00:01:08.369> they're<00:01:08.760> easier<00:01:09.150> to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
this design because they're easier to

painting one on every nail they are
tricky<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.479> do<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.200> if<00:01:31.350> you're<00:01:31.500> not<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.650> great

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
tricky to do so if you're not a great

tricky to do so if you're not a great
painter<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.820> skip<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.299> step<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.170> go

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
painter just skip this step and go

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.570 
painter just skip this step and go
straight<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.130> tree

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
straight to the tree

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:47.390 
straight to the tree
which<00:01:35.850> are<00:01:36.150> much<00:01:36.510> easier<00:01:36.870> to<00:01:37.620> do<00:01:46.310> using<00:01:47.310> a

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
which are much easier to do using a

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.760 
which are much easier to do using a
striper<00:01:47.730> polish<00:01:48.060> or<00:01:48.510> a<00:01:48.570> striper<00:01:49.020> brush<00:01:49.200> and

and<00:01:52.560> slowly<00:01:53.340> pull<00:01:53.760> up<00:01:57.080> sometimes<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.680> right

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
and slowly pull up sometimes the right

and slowly pull up sometimes the right
tools<00:01:59.280> help<00:01:59.790> an<00:02:00.030> awful<00:02:00.690> lot<00:02:00.870> and<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.650> good<00:02:02.010> soft

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
tools help an awful lot and a good soft

flexible<00:02:03.780> striper<00:02:04.230> brush<00:02:04.410> makes<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.550> so

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
flexible striper brush makes this so

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.150 
flexible striper brush makes this so
much<00:02:06.120> easier<00:02:06.660> but<00:02:07.230> if<00:02:07.410> you<00:02:07.530> don't<00:02:07.710> have<00:02:07.890> one

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
much easier but if you don't have one

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.100 
much easier but if you don't have one
