00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.170 
to me is a museum or direction we have
socialized<00:02:03.750> losses<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.520> socialize<00:02:06.000> and

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
socialized losses and we socialize and

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.550 
socialized losses and we socialize and
because<00:02:06.390> we<00:02:06.509> need<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.750> keep<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.020> system<00:02:07.170> going

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
because we need to keep the system going

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.020 
because we need to keep the system going
but<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.829> want<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.009> make<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.160> point<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.640> mean

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
but I want to make this point I mean

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.589 
but I want to make this point I mean
there<00:02:09.119> are<00:02:09.239> ways<00:02:09.509> out<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:10.259> where<00:02:10.860> it's

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
there are ways out of this where it's

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.770 
there are ways out of this where it's
the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.210 
the
current<00:02:13.050> generation<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.890> would<00:02:14.010> bear<00:02:14.190> the

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
current generation that would bear the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.240 
current generation that would bear the
loss<00:02:14.490> for<00:02:14.819> example<00:02:15.510> if<00:02:16.380> we<00:02:16.560> had<00:02:16.740> inflation

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
loss for example if we had inflation

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.430 
loss for example if we had inflation
over<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:17.970> next<00:02:18.180> three<00:02:18.330> four<00:02:18.510> five<00:02:18.720> years<00:02:19.110> it

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
over the next three four five years it

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.199 
over the next three four five years it
would<00:02:19.830> be<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.130> current<00:02:20.459> people<00:02:20.940> who<00:02:21.000> hold

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
would be the current people who hold

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.809 
would be the current people who hold

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
to why the problem with inflation it's

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.650 
to why the problem with inflation it's
an<00:02:33.930> expectation<00:02:34.260> phenomena<00:02:35.130> ok<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:36.239> problem

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
an expectation phenomena ok the problem

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.600 
an expectation phenomena ok the problem
is<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.959> can<00:02:37.140> print<00:02:37.500> money<00:02:37.739> print<00:02:38.400> money

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
is that you can print money print money
