like<00:06:39.980> this<00:06:40.490> I<00:06:42.370> don't<00:06:43.370> see<00:06:43.790> any<00:06:44.030> reason<00:06:44.660> why<00:06:44.690> you

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
like this I don't see any reason why you

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.740 
like this I don't see any reason why you
couldn't<00:06:47.380> these<00:06:48.380> things<00:06:48.800> really<00:06:49.490> don't<00:06:49.940> blow

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:08.510 
immense pressure needed for something

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.740 
immense pressure needed for something

bottle or even a spaghetti squash so I'm

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.620 
bottle or even a spaghetti squash so I'm
gonna<00:07:20.020> declare<00:07:21.020> this<00:07:21.320> safe<00:07:21.770> but<00:07:22.450> why<00:07:23.450> would

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:23.630 
gonna declare this safe but why would

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:25.960 
gonna declare this safe but why would
you<00:07:23.780> want<00:07:24.020> to<00:07:24.169> do<00:07:24.320> it<00:07:24.470> there's<00:07:24.740> no<00:07:24.890> reason<00:07:25.190> to

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:25.970 
you want to do it there's no reason to

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:37.519 
you want to do it there's no reason to
do<00:07:26.150> it<00:07:26.390> but<00:07:27.100> technically<00:07:28.100> it's<00:07:28.580> safe
