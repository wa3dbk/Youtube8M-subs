okay<00:00:12.100> go<00:00:12.310> so<00:00:12.580> the<00:00:12.730> telescope<00:00:13.420> guy<00:00:13.540> you're

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:13.660 
okay go so the telescope guy you're

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.910 
okay go so the telescope guy you're
actually<00:00:13.750> looking<00:00:14.050> at<00:00:14.260> the<00:00:14.440> minute<00:00:14.710> is<00:00:14.860> a

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
actually looking at the minute is a

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.280 
actually looking at the minute is a
celestron<00:00:15.880> powerseeker<00:00:17.280> its<00:00:18.280> a<00:00:18.430> 50<00:00:18.900> time<00:00:19.900> at

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.290 
celestron powerseeker its a 50 time at

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.630 
celestron powerseeker its a 50 time at
50<00:00:20.680> millimeter<00:00:21.100> lens<00:00:21.600> it's<00:00:23.040> basically<00:00:24.040> one<00:00:24.490> of

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
50 millimeter lens it's basically one of

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.400 
50 millimeter lens it's basically one of
the<00:00:24.790> it's<00:00:25.779> the<00:00:25.869> basic<00:00:26.350> design<00:00:27.870> that<00:00:28.870> was<00:00:28.990> first

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
the it's the basic design that was first

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.260 
the it's the basic design that was first
used<00:00:29.530> by<00:00:29.860> by<00:00:30.700> Galileo<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.800> all<00:00:33.070> of<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:33.400> all<00:00:34.210> of

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
used by by Galileo and all of the all of

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.710 
used by by Galileo and all of the all of
his<00:00:34.570> collaborators<00:00:35.199> at<00:00:35.379> the<00:00:35.470> time<00:00:35.699> when

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
his collaborators at the time when

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.390 
his collaborators at the time when
runabouts<00:00:37.720> when<00:00:37.960> astronomy<00:00:38.800> was<00:00:38.949> becoming

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
runabouts when astronomy was becoming

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.400 
runabouts when astronomy was becoming
really<00:00:40.150> big<00:00:40.420> thing<00:00:40.720> when<00:00:40.960> when<00:00:41.260> the

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
really big thing when when the

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.850 
really big thing when when the
scientists<00:00:41.830> were<00:00:42.280> really<00:00:43.649> putting<00:00:44.649> their

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
scientists were really putting their

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.040 
scientists were really putting their
efforts<00:00:45.190> into<00:00:45.670> into<00:00:46.030> these<00:00:46.120> devices<00:00:46.570> in<00:00:46.960> order

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
efforts into into these devices in order

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.950 
efforts into into these devices in order
to<00:00:47.350> see<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:47.800> celestial<00:00:48.340> objects<00:00:48.820> now<00:00:49.510> I<00:00:49.540> just

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
to see the celestial objects now I just

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.930 
to see the celestial objects now I just
like<00:00:50.110> to<00:00:50.260> point<00:00:50.380> out<00:00:50.590> that<00:00:50.800> that<00:00:51.040> a<00:00:51.100> lot<00:00:51.430> of<00:00:51.460> the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
like to point out that that a lot of the

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.180 
like to point out that that a lot of the
deep<00:00:52.239> space<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:52.600> sky<00:00:53.079> objects<00:00:53.500> were<00:00:53.649> actually

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
deep space and sky objects were actually

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.360 
deep space and sky objects were actually
discovered<00:00:54.730> around<00:00:55.570> that<00:00:55.989> time<00:00:56.370> obviously

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
discovered around that time obviously

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.280 
discovered around that time obviously
there<00:00:57.760> was<00:00:57.850> no<00:00:58.059> where<00:00:58.329> no<00:00:58.780> prizes<00:00:59.050> for

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
there was no where no prizes for

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.170 
there was no where no prizes for
discovering<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.250> moon<00:01:00.430> because<00:01:00.700> that<00:01:01.030> one

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
discovering the moon because that one

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.079 
discovering the moon because that one
was<00:01:01.329> quite<00:01:01.600> obvious<00:01:02.399> but<00:01:03.399> little<00:01:03.640> things<00:01:03.670> like

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
was quite obvious but little things like

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.740 
was quite obvious but little things like
the<00:01:04.660> same<00:01:05.130> Jupiter's<00:01:06.540> you've<00:01:07.540> got<00:01:07.690> of

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
the same Jupiter's you've got of

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.749 
the same Jupiter's you've got of
Jupiter's<00:01:08.140> got<00:01:08.290> a<00:01:08.320> lot<00:01:08.770> more<00:01:08.800> moons<00:01:09.160> but<00:01:09.430> she's

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
Jupiter's got a lot more moons but she's

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:15.330 
Jupiter's got a lot more moons but she's
got<00:01:09.940> four<00:01:10.180> prominent<00:01:10.509> nunes<00:01:10.899> and<00:01:13.530> those<00:01:14.530> are

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
got four prominent nunes and those are

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.100 
got four prominent nunes and those are
what<00:01:15.520> I<00:01:15.550> hope<00:01:16.000> to<00:01:16.030> see<00:01:16.330> tonight<00:01:16.600> if<00:01:16.840> possible

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
what I hope to see tonight if possible

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.420 
what I hope to see tonight if possible
and<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.950> sky<00:01:18.159> is<00:01:18.220> looking<00:01:18.430> okay<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.860> we<00:01:21.250> should

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
and the sky is looking okay so we should

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.890 
and the sky is looking okay so we should
be<00:01:21.549> good<00:01:21.580> we<00:01:22.060> should<00:01:22.270> be<00:01:22.360> good<00:01:22.510> with<00:01:22.750> this

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
be good we should be good with this

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.750 
be good we should be good with this
particular<00:01:23.170> telescope<00:01:23.890> it's<00:01:24.070> not<00:01:24.310> one<00:01:24.520> of<00:01:24.549> the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
particular telescope it's not one of the

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.760 
particular telescope it's not one of the
more<00:01:25.030> it's<00:01:25.510> not<00:01:25.659> the<00:01:25.900> most<00:01:26.110> i<00:01:26.440> powered

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
more it's not the most i powered

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.500 
more it's not the most i powered
telescope<00:01:27.189> you<00:01:27.310> can<00:01:27.430> never<00:01:27.580> buy<00:01:27.760> it<00:01:28.000> is<00:01:28.479> a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
telescope you can never buy it is a

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.140 
telescope you can never buy it is a
budget<00:01:28.750> telescope<00:01:29.409> but<00:01:30.250> that's<00:01:30.490> not<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.880> say

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
budget telescope but that's not to say

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.450 
budget telescope but that's not to say
that<00:01:31.180> it<00:01:31.600> won't<00:01:31.930> allow<00:01:32.200> us<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.619> get<00:01:33.159> really

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
that it won't allow us to get really

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.929 
that it won't allow us to get really
good<00:01:33.810> views<00:01:34.810> of<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.080> sky<00:01:35.320> I've<00:01:35.580> like<00:01:36.580> i<00:01:36.610> said

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
good views of the sky I've like i said

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.830 
good views of the sky I've like i said
i've<00:01:37.210> i've<00:01:37.960> seen<00:01:38.710> a<00:01:39.010> lot<00:01:39.909> of<00:01:40.180> detail<00:01:40.600> through

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
medium one which is absolutely fantastic

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.400 
medium one which is absolutely fantastic
for<00:02:36.670> viewing<00:02:36.940> planets<00:02:37.360> etc<00:02:39.120> literally<00:02:40.410> plug

for viewing planets etc literally plug
in<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.710> play<00:02:41.800> this<00:02:42.640> one<00:02:43.000> however<00:02:43.270> is<00:02:43.660> far<00:02:44.290> too

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
in and play this one however is far too

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.140 
in and play this one however is far too
strong<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:45.220> don't<00:02:45.460> understand<00:02:45.850> why<00:02:45.970> they

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
strong I don't understand why they

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.900 
strong I don't understand why they
actually<00:02:46.540> ship<00:02:46.840> this<00:02:47.020> with<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.560> telescope

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
actually ship this with the telescope

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.390 
actually ship this with the telescope
because<00:02:48.910> in<00:02:49.300> my<00:02:49.450> opinion<00:02:49.570> this<00:02:50.470> magnification

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
because in my opinion this magnification

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.740 
because in my opinion this magnification
is<00:02:52.410> just<00:02:53.410> too<00:02:53.650> great<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.670> telescope<00:02:55.300> cannot

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
is just too great the telescope cannot

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.920 
is just too great the telescope cannot

order for this to magnify it enough for

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.070 
it to be here a clear object in the sky
and<00:03:05.500> but<00:03:06.430> not<00:03:06.610> bad<00:03:06.820> not<00:03:07.209> bad<00:03:07.240> if<00:03:07.540> you've<00:03:07.690> got<00:03:08.050> a

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
and but not bad not bad if you've got a

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.430 
and but not bad not bad if you've got a
really<00:03:08.320> clear<00:03:08.650> night<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:10.480> next<00:03:10.900> piece<00:03:11.110> is<00:03:11.140> an

erecting<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.370> piece<00:03:12.910> which<00:03:13.420> basically<00:03:13.990> means

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
erecting I piece which basically means

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.290 
erecting I piece which basically means
well<00:03:15.250> if<00:03:15.580> you've<00:03:15.790> ever<00:03:15.910> looked<00:03:16.090> through<00:03:16.270> a

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
well if you've ever looked through a

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.090 
well if you've ever looked through a
telescope<00:03:16.330> you'll<00:03:16.900> find<00:03:17.200> that<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.650> objects

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
telescope you'll find that the objects

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.699 
telescope you'll find that the objects
you<00:03:18.160> look<00:03:18.370> at<00:03:18.550> upside<00:03:19.240> down<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:20.410> all<00:03:20.560> this

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
you look at upside down and all this

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.340 
you look at upside down and all this
does<00:03:20.950> is<00:03:20.980> literally<00:03:21.610> flip<00:03:22.300> them<00:03:22.480> back<00:03:22.720> the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
does is literally flip them back the

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.530 
does is literally flip them back the
right<00:03:23.590> way<00:03:23.620> up<00:03:24.010> it's<00:03:24.370> only<00:03:24.520> 1.5<00:03:24.910> times

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
right way up it's only 1.5 times

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.470 
right way up it's only 1.5 times
magnification<00:03:25.959> it's<00:03:26.590> not<00:03:26.740> too<00:03:26.920> bad<00:03:27.480> decent

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
magnification it's not too bad decent

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.780 
magnification it's not too bad decent
for<00:03:28.570> looking<00:03:28.750> at<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:28.930> moon<00:03:29.080> and<00:03:29.550> what<00:03:30.550> we<00:03:30.670> have

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
for looking at the moon and what we have

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.000 
for looking at the moon and what we have
here<00:03:31.030> is<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.209> free<00:03:31.450> x<00:03:31.720> barlow<00:03:32.230> lens<00:03:32.260> which

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
here is a free x barlow lens which

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.520 
here is a free x barlow lens which
basically<00:03:33.430> magnifies<00:03:34.090> any<00:03:34.780> object<00:03:35.260> that

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
basically magnifies any object that

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.070 
basically magnifies any object that
you're<00:03:35.650> looking<00:03:35.769> through<00:03:36.150> your<00:03:37.150> eyepiece<00:03:37.630> by

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
you're looking through your eyepiece by

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.110 
you're looking through your eyepiece by
free<00:03:38.350> yeah<00:03:39.070> do<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.580> maths<00:03:41.610> this<00:03:42.610> is<00:03:42.790> really

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
free yeah do the maths this is really

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.050 
free yeah do the maths this is really
quite<00:03:43.390> good<00:03:43.980> when<00:03:44.980> used<00:03:45.220> with<00:03:45.400> either<00:03:45.640> of

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
quite good when used with either of

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.490 
quite good when used with either of
these<00:03:46.269> two<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.810> get<00:03:46.930> some<00:03:47.110> impressive

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
these two you get some impressive

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.530 
these two you get some impressive
magnification<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.370> there's<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.940> telescope

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
magnification and there's the telescope

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.750 
magnification and there's the telescope
provides<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:50.470> beautiful<00:03:51.070> amount<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.400> light<00:03:51.580> in

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
provides a beautiful amount of light in

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.460 
provides a beautiful amount of light in
order<00:03:51.880> for<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.209> to<00:03:52.239> magnify<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.900> objects<00:03:53.410> in

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
order for you to magnify the objects in

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.560 
order for you to magnify the objects in
the<00:03:53.590> sky<00:03:53.890> it<00:03:54.430> just<00:03:54.640> gobbles<00:03:54.940> up<00:03:55.060> just<00:03:55.330> enough

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
the sky it just gobbles up just enough

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.300 
the sky it just gobbles up just enough
in<00:03:55.810> order<00:03:55.959> to<00:03:56.200> get<00:03:56.380> clearer<00:03:56.620> picture<00:03:57.070> of<00:03:57.100> the

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
in order to get clearer picture of the

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.550 
in order to get clearer picture of the
object<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:57.989> obviously<00:03:58.989> you<00:03:59.080> guys<00:03:59.320> know<00:03:59.530> what

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
object and obviously you guys know what

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.050 
object and obviously you guys know what
this<00:03:59.800> is<00:03:59.860> instead<00:04:00.489> of<00:04:00.519> looking<00:04:00.730> at<00:04:01.000> it

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
this is instead of looking at it

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.729 
this is instead of looking at it
straight<00:04:01.420> on<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:01.870> can<00:04:02.050> look<00:04:02.200> at<00:04:02.350> it<00:04:02.470> by

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
straight on you can look at it by

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.520 
straight on you can look at it by
leaning<00:04:03.160> over<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.870> particular<00:04:04.870> you<00:04:05.230> put<00:04:05.380> your

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
leaning over the particular you put your

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.150 
leaning over the particular you put your
eyepiece<00:04:05.830> in<00:04:06.040> there<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:07.739> sorry<00:04:09.030> yet<00:04:11.040> put<00:04:12.040> your

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
eyepiece in there and sorry yet put your

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.220 
eyepiece in there and sorry yet put your
eye<00:04:12.220> peas<00:04:12.430> in<00:04:12.610> there<00:04:12.790> it<00:04:13.540> slots<00:04:14.019> on<00:04:14.200> the

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
eye peas in there it slots on the

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.890 
eye peas in there it slots on the
telescope<00:04:14.800> and<00:04:15.130> it<00:04:15.910> allows<00:04:16.150> you<00:04:16.299> to<00:04:16.450> view

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
telescope and it allows you to view

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.750 
telescope and it allows you to view
downwards<00:04:17.410> it's<00:04:17.739> a<00:04:18.040> lot<00:04:18.370> more<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:18.729> makes

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
downwards it's a lot more it makes

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.460 
downwards it's a lot more it makes
viewing<00:04:19.390> a<00:04:19.570> lot<00:04:19.690> more<00:04:19.810> comfortable<00:04:20.019> at<00:04:20.320> night

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
viewing a lot more comfortable at night

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.730 
viewing a lot more comfortable at night
especially<00:04:21.600> especially<00:04:22.600> when<00:04:22.900> it's<00:04:23.050> cold<00:04:23.290> you

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
especially especially when it's cold you

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.200 
especially especially when it's cold you
don't<00:04:23.890> want<00:04:24.010> to<00:04:24.070> be<00:04:24.160> bending<00:04:24.490> over<00:04:24.729> too<00:04:24.970> much

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
don't want to be bending over too much

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.940 
don't want to be bending over too much
so<00:04:25.570> that<00:04:25.720> allows<00:04:25.960> just<00:04:26.320> a<00:04:26.440> little<00:04:26.710> bit<00:04:26.830> more

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
so that allows just a little bit more
