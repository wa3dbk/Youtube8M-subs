00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:10.850
 The products we will introduce this year are among the Ultrabooks 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:14.900
 The two rabbits, performance and portability, as well as the iPad 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:19.630
 Even if you brag to a person, come in and see how much such a woman is 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.570
 It is Lenovo ThinkPad x1 carbon 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.349
 You might have noticed the name of the product 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.079
 I tried to make his case with carbon fiber. 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:33.480
 You just can not see it. 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:38.300
 I can not see the carbon fiber- specific plaid. 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:43.809
 It seems to be a tradition of the sink pad that has been around for 20 years. 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.809
 Oh, that's a good thing if you boast about how good you are . 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:52.780
 In fact, the carbon fiber is 10 times more than steel danced 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:55.390
 But the weight is one fifth of the point 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:01.750
 Of course it is not easy to make 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:07.450
 It's also worth the price, but look at it. There's no better material than this. 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:12.460
 Lenovo x1 Carbon overcomes all of the errors in the early Ultrabook 6 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:16.240
 Keeping the identity of ThinkPad brand, which boasts 20 years of history, 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:21.759
 It's made of advanced materials and latest parts. 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:25.070
 When you see this pointing stick called the moon bean when you open the screen, 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:29.869
 The elasticity of the ThinkPad comes up. 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:35.299
 Anthem blast hanging down touchpad touchscreen smartphone 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:36.080
 The changes that reflect the latest trend are combined to make it feel more mature ultrabook 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:41.420
 give 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:45.110
 The ThinkPad's keyboard is famous for its traditional touch 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:50.090
 It is different from the keyboard of other notebooks 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:56.020
 If you type directly, your fingertips will be resilient. 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.020
 Finger does not feel tired even when working with documents for a long time. 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:11.030
 Where do you usually use your laptop? 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:14.190
 Companies are growing, and at least for meetings at least, most 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:19.580
 The situation is inevitable. 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:24.480
 ThinkPad Carbon Diamondbacks won're already embedded tooth play ports by default 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:28.650
 High resolution output of 2560 pais 1600 is possible 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.770
 Of course you can output dvr or vga through the adapter. 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:36.630
 Presentation of video device can be presented 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.400
 But you do not need to use a projector until you talk in three small conference rooms. 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.920
 I will not. 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:46.530
 The sink pad x1 carbon 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.480
 The 14-inch screen is completely tilted, so talk to each other on the screen 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.480
 good 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.409
 300 under bright and clear screen 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:59.340
 Eye case without color change at any angle 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:04.260
 It is possible to apply a wide viewing angle panel 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.790
 Go to the meeting room and wait a while for a new Wi-Fi connection 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.750
 Unlike team members 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.519
 I've connected in two seconds, then I've got someone to show me the material 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.120
 Think about it. 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:19.610
 It's a small part, but I do not think it'll stand out. 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.610
 Thinkpad x1 Carbon is possible.
