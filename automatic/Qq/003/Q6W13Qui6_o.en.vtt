switching over to the display on the

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.600 
switching over to the display on the
iPad<00:02:04.750> probably<00:02:05.590> due<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:05.920> resolution<00:02:06.430> size

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610

the connected iPad using I display so

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.550 
the connected iPad using I display so
after<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.250> launch<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:27.940> display<00:02:28.540> app<00:02:28.750> it's

after you launch the I display app it's

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.210 
after you launch the I display app it's
going<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:29.920> take<00:02:30.330> 10<00:02:31.330> 20<00:02:31.630> seconds<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.830> fully

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.720 
going to take 10 20 seconds to fully
open<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:35.200> will<00:02:35.350> then<00:02:35.560> go<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.890> your<00:02:36.370> iPad

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
open and you will then go to your iPad

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.350 
open and you will then go to your iPad
and<00:02:37.080> open<00:02:38.080> up<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:39.040> display<00:02:39.400> app<00:02:39.610> there<00:02:40.090> and

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
and open up the I display app there and

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.450 
and open up the I display app there and
they<00:02:41.140> will<00:02:41.260> attempt<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.650> sync<00:02:41.950> up<00:02:42.130> with<00:02:42.310> each

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
they will attempt to sync up with each

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.920 
they will attempt to sync up with each
other<00:02:42.670> now<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:43.330> far<00:02:43.480> I've<00:02:43.540> had<00:02:43.690> pretty<00:02:43.810> good

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
other now so far I've had pretty good

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.330 
other now so far I've had pretty good
luck<00:02:44.050> with<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.320> process<00:02:44.800> I've<00:02:45.010> read<00:02:45.190> some

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
luck with that process I've read some

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.010 
luck with that process I've read some
reviews<00:02:45.490> online<00:02:45.790> where<00:02:46.270> people<00:02:46.300> think<00:02:46.840> that

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
reviews online where people think that

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.810 
reviews online where people think that
there<00:02:47.560> are<00:02:47.590> some<00:02:47.830> issues<00:02:47.950> with<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:48.340> it

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
there are some issues with that it

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.880 
there are some issues with that it
happens<00:02:49.360> for<00:02:49.540> me<00:02:49.660> but<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.350> takes<00:02:50.680> upwards

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
happens for me but it it takes upwards

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.830 
happens for me but it it takes upwards
of<00:02:51.190> probably<00:02:51.580> 30<00:02:51.880> seconds<00:02:52.330> for<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.540> entire

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
of probably 30 seconds for the entire

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.130 
of probably 30 seconds for the entire
connection<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.710> happen<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:54.250> it's<00:02:54.430> pretty<00:02:54.700> slow

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
connection to happen so it's pretty slow

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.160 
connection to happen so it's pretty slow
its<00:02:56.140> speaking<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.709> slow<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:58.390> actually<00:02:58.870> moving

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
its speaking of slow the actually moving

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.830 
its speaking of slow the actually moving
objects<00:02:59.980> around<00:03:00.100> on<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.880> iPad<00:03:01.209> is<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.420> bit<00:03:01.660> of<00:03:01.780> a

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
going to go and I'm going to grab a

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.210 
going to go and I'm going to grab a
Bonjour<00:03:06.880> window<00:03:07.239> in<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.810> chat<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.500> I'm<00:03:09.130> gonna

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
Bonjour window in a chat and I'm gonna

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.660 
Bonjour window in a chat and I'm gonna
drag<00:03:09.550> it<00:03:09.580> over<00:03:13.890> I'm<00:03:14.890> gonna<00:03:15.040> drop<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:15.310> off<00:03:15.459> right

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
drag it over I'm gonna drop it off right

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.780 
drag it over I'm gonna drop it off right
here<00:03:15.790> in<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:15.940> middle<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:18.280> can<00:03:18.430> see<00:03:18.610> that

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
here in the middle and you can see that

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.170 
here in the middle and you can see that
it's<00:03:18.910> still<00:03:19.180> moving<00:03:19.720> it's<00:03:20.260> been<00:03:20.680> five<00:03:21.550> six

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
it's still moving it's been five six

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.199 
it's still moving it's been five six
seconds<00:03:22.630> or<00:03:22.900> since<00:03:23.709> I<00:03:23.950> actually<00:03:24.250> took<00:03:25.000> my

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
seconds or since I actually took my

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.870 
seconds or since I actually took my
mouse<00:03:25.360> off<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.780> window<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.370> lag<00:03:27.640> is

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
mouse off the window so the lag is

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.060 
mouse off the window so the lag is
pretty<00:03:28.150> significant<00:03:28.870> on<00:03:29.110> this<00:03:29.380> when<00:03:29.950> you're

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
pretty significant on this when you're

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.220 
pretty significant on this when you're
moving<00:03:30.220> objects<00:03:30.790> around<00:03:30.900> when<00:03:31.900> you're<00:03:32.020> typing

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
moving objects around when you're typing

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.340 
moving objects around when you're typing

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
when you're scaling this display is

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
show you just a little bit of the cursor

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.900 
show you just a little bit of the cursor
motion<00:03:47.709> so<00:03:48.130> I'm<00:03:48.220> going<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.430> move<00:03:48.550> my<00:03:48.700> cursor

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
motion so I'm going to move my cursor

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.540 
motion so I'm going to move my cursor
right<00:03:49.470> I'm<00:03:50.470> gonna<00:03:50.620> move<00:03:50.769> it<00:03:50.890> up<00:03:51.040> down<00:03:53.550> it's

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
right I'm gonna move it up down it's

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.240 
right I'm gonna move it up down it's
completely<00:03:55.500> all<00:03:56.500> over<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:56.769> place<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:57.160> and

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
completely all over the place it and

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.509 
completely all over the place it and
left<00:03:58.620> actually<00:03:59.620> knowing<00:03:59.829> where<00:04:00.100> the<00:04:00.220> cursor

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
left actually knowing where the cursor

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:01.560 
left actually knowing where the cursor
is<00:04:00.609> going<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:00.850> end<00:04:00.970> up<00:04:01.060> is<00:04:01.209> probably<00:04:01.329> the

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
is going to end up is probably the

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.360 
is going to end up is probably the
biggest<00:04:01.750> problem<00:04:02.140> with<00:04:02.230> us<00:04:02.410> especially<00:04:03.070> when

biggest problem with us especially when

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.720 
biggest problem with us especially when
it

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
it

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.960

-<00:04:03.970> you<00:04:04.599> know<00:04:04.720> fairly<00:04:05.200> technical<00:04:06.040> tasks<00:04:06.760> like

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
- you know fairly technical tasks like

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.750 
- you know fairly technical tasks like

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
dragging objects so I'm gonna track

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.629 
dragging objects so I'm gonna track
moment<00:04:14.470> go<00:04:14.560> back<00:04:14.739> over<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:17.769> you<00:04:18.010> can<00:04:18.160> see<00:04:18.400> kind

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
moment go back over and you can see kind

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.789 
moment go back over and you can see kind
of<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.729> difference<00:04:19.180> now<00:04:19.389> where<00:04:19.720> you<00:04:20.709> know

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
of the difference now where you know

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.020 
of the difference now where you know
obviously<00:04:21.130> I<00:04:21.220> don't<00:04:21.280> have<00:04:21.400> these<00:04:21.549> lined<00:04:21.790> up

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
obviously I don't have these lined up

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.570 
obviously I don't have these lined up
but<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.050> slowness<00:04:23.530> factor<00:04:23.919> when<00:04:26.580> we're

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
but the slowness factor when we're

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:37.230 
but the slowness factor when we're
dragging<00:04:28.000> items<00:04:28.270> between<00:04:34.860> so<00:04:36.060> kind<00:04:37.060> of<00:04:37.150> in

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
dragging items between so kind of in

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.420 
dragging items between so kind of in
summation<00:04:37.570> it's<00:04:38.050> definitely<00:04:38.620> serviceable

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
summation it's definitely serviceable

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.659 
summation it's definitely serviceable
for<00:04:39.490> some<00:04:39.820> tasks<00:04:40.300> but<00:04:41.289> it<00:04:41.530> is<00:04:41.680> buggy<00:04:41.979> and<00:04:42.370> it's

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
for some tasks but it is buggy and it's

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.610 
for some tasks but it is buggy and it's
probably<00:04:42.940> not<00:04:43.300> going<00:04:43.630> to<00:04:43.750> be<00:04:43.900> a<00:04:44.260> great

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
probably not going to be a great

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.610 
probably not going to be a great

on<00:04:48.130> occasion<00:04:48.639> I<00:04:48.789> think<00:04:49.090> that<00:04:49.330> this<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:50.050> third

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
on occasion I think that this the third

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.740 
on occasion I think that this the third
time<00:04:50.680> that<00:04:50.710> we've<00:04:50.949> used<00:04:51.160> it<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:52.539> other

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
time that we've used it and the other

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.560 
time that we've used it and the other
two<00:04:52.990> times<00:04:53.260> we<00:04:53.440> both<00:04:53.620> had<00:04:53.860> crashes<00:04:54.419> doing<00:04:55.419> that

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
two times we both had crashes doing that

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
as a second display but it technically

as a second display but it technically
works

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
I wouldn't as a quick addendum I did

I wouldn't as a quick addendum I did
want<00:05:39.800> to<00:05:39.860> point<00:05:40.160> out<00:05:40.370> that<00:05:40.729> once<00:05:41.090> items<00:05:41.419> are<00:05:41.720> on

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
the iPad they are actually clickable so

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:52.719 
the iPad they are actually clickable so
you<00:05:44.990> can<00:05:47.530> move<00:05:48.530> them<00:05:48.680> around<00:05:48.740> via<00:05:49.160> touch<00:05:51.490> it<00:05:52.490> is

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
you can move them around via touch it is

00:05:52.729 --> 00:06:02.080 
you can move them around via touch it is
just<00:05:53.090> slow<00:06:00.490> great<00:06:01.490> just<00:06:01.669> want<00:06:01.789> to<00:06:01.849> make<00:06:01.940> sure<00:06:01.970> I

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
just slow great just want to make sure I

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.640 
just slow great just want to make sure I
pointed<00:06:02.389> that<00:06:02.419> out<00:06:02.509> as<00:06:02.750> well<00:06:02.870> in<00:06:03.080> case<00:06:03.259> anyone

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
pointed that out as well in case anyone

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.710 
pointed that out as well in case anyone
was<00:06:03.770> wondering<00:06:03.800> about<00:06:04.160> the<00:06:04.400> actual

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
was wondering about the actual

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.540 
was wondering about the actual
touchscreen<00:06:05.720> if<00:06:06.199> ocation<00:06:06.620> of<00:06:06.740> it<00:06:06.889> it<00:06:07.280> does

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
touchscreen if ocation of it it does

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.600 
touchscreen if ocation of it it does
again<00:06:07.880> it<00:06:08.120> does<00:06:08.479> work<00:06:08.720> it's<00:06:09.020> just<00:06:09.139> probably

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
again it does work it's just probably

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.080 
again it does work it's just probably
not<00:06:10.610> something<00:06:11.090> you<00:06:11.180> actually<00:06:11.330> want<00:06:11.780> to<00:06:11.840> do
