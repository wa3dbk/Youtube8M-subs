00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
was set up now all over this true as far

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.390 
was set up now all over this true as far
as<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> UFC<00:01:10.500> needing<00:01:10.920> McGregor

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
as the UFC needing McGregor

that's<00:01:11.670> very<00:01:11.820> true<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.510> don't<00:01:13.290> think<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.710> they

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
that's very true I don't think that they

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.200 
that's very true I don't think that they
would<00:01:14.040> risk<00:01:15.259> losing<00:01:16.460> their<00:01:17.460> integrity<00:01:17.790> by

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
would risk losing their integrity by

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.640 
would risk losing their integrity by
fixing<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.380> fight<00:01:19.650> because<00:01:21.110> if<00:01:22.110> they<00:01:22.500> get

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
fixing this fight because if they get

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.469 
fixing this fight because if they get
found<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.400> that's<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.820> happened<00:01:24.240> or

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
found out that that's what happened or

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.420 
found out that that's what happened or
you<00:01:25.080> know<00:01:25.200> that's<00:01:25.619> what<00:01:25.740> they<00:01:25.830> were<00:01:25.920> trying<00:01:26.250> to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
you know that's what they were trying to

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.870 
you know that's what they were trying to
do<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.840> UFC<00:01:28.229> will<00:01:28.439> instantly<00:01:28.799> become<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> WWE

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
do the UFC will instantly become the WWE

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.480 
do the UFC will instantly become the WWE
all<00:01:30.630> right<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.560> don't<00:01:31.860> think<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.280> that's

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
all right and I don't think that that's

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.340 
all right and I don't think that that's
what<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> case<00:01:33.000> was<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.869> honest<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.229> you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
what the case was to be honest with you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.770 
what the case was to be honest with you
I<00:01:34.380> think<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.829> Mendes<00:01:35.820> came<00:01:36.060> out<00:01:36.240> fighting<00:01:36.509> he

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
I think that Mendes came out fighting he

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.969 
I think that Mendes came out fighting he
wasn't<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> hidden<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> whole

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
mean sokar keep saying people say well

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.670 
mean sokar keep saying people say well
Mendes<00:01:42.329> never<00:01:42.570> has<00:01:42.750> stamina<00:01:43.020> issues

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
Mendes never has stamina issues

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.469 
Mendes never has stamina issues
how<00:01:44.009> could<00:01:44.159> he<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.310> stamina<00:01:44.579> issues<00:01:44.939> well

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
how could he have stamina issues well

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.980 
how could he have stamina issues well
the<00:01:46.200> guy<00:01:46.380> wasn't<00:01:46.619> he<00:01:47.430> was<00:01:47.670> not<00:01:47.939> in<00:01:48.750> shape<00:01:49.140> for

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
the guy wasn't he was not in shape for

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.749 
the guy wasn't he was not in shape for
McGregor<00:01:51.990> okay<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.649> think<00:01:53.189> he<00:01:53.399> only<00:01:53.520> had<00:01:53.640> like

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
McGregor okay I think he only had like

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.399 
McGregor okay I think he only had like
what<00:01:53.939> 10<00:01:54.149> days<00:01:54.329> or<00:01:54.630> two<00:01:54.930> weeks<00:01:54.960> or<00:01:55.229> something

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
what 10 days or two weeks or something

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.929
