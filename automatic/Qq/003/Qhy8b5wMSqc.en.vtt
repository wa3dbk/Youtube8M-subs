00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.960
 trans was born in 2003 from a 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.210
 the small group of friends 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.739
 traditional, the island of 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.009
 north to south and west to east to 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:30.279
 trade, the ancients did 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.769
 Canarian aborigines and a little bit like 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.540
 homage to that way of life because 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:37.300
 We decided to do it already a trekking plan 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.680
 and competition like that in 2003 we started with 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.140
 the first other great canary that 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.570
 It crossed the island from the port of 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.510
 Agaete and up to the port of Arinaga 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.149
 sixty-seven runners three 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.890
 modalities and very few means clear 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.540
 We were the friends with the desire and with the 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.220
 illusion of doing something new and different 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.580
 and that more or less was the birth of 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.580
 the trans 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.239
 because at the beginning there was no half I think 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.750
 that the word was to define the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.540
 means were I have many friends 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:13.380
 well-known people who believed in the project 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.470
 and in the illusion of the group of crazy people that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.210
 we started with all this and then with a 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.040
 restaurant we got the paella with 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.470
 a sports store we got some 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.830
 prize the rest were friends that signaled 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.810
 come on we put stones we buy ribbons 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.700
 giving the push as we get 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.110
 take out the first editions little by little 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.180
 the test was growing and it was 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.010
 requiring many more means nowadays 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.909
 some institutions are involved 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.999
 public not those that should 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.530
 is not the measure that you should for the 

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:45.830
 international impact that the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.810
 Gran Canaria for the Canary Islands 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.490
 that does continue with the illusion of much 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.040
 people many collaborators and still of 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.900
 many private companies that follow 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.900
 betting on this project 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.360
 although three times you can choose three 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.210
 moments of 10 years to detract from 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.100
 complicated canaries 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:15.110
 maybe the goal in the trans 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.240
 capacity of all the components of 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.180
 the capacities jose luís the chair of 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.920
 wheels accompanied by reinaldo and by and 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.800
 by Cesar has been one of the moments 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.230
 more keys the transgrancanaria in a 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.730
 very emotional moment any entry 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.260
 goal of anyone from 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.470
 Sebastian full in the latest edition 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.630
 until 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.430
 the last the participants maybe all 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.660
 one of the most endearing characters of 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.630
 the trans meta says it all because 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.230
 the culmination of a training of a 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.300
 goal and the challenge of getting 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.800
 cross the island in the time stipulated 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.360
 the organization because the face says it 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.650
 everything and that's why they are all moments 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.010
 those of us who stayed in the other great 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.010
 canary 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.910
 Well, although the next anniversary is not 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.230
 they are ten years behind what grancanaria 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.989
 we have done so because the number 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.550
 it was not 2003 2013 but it really 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.440
 account 2003 also with which they are 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.530
 11 years behind grancanario 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.730
 again there are a lot of things we have 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.890
 renewed the tour that the main thing 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.030
 because many people like that asked us and 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.000
 because we ourselves wanted 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.290
 oxygenate and do something different 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.300
 then now the whole first part 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.980
 to the center of the island that the 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.270
 garañón is new for both 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.250
 advanced modalities and 119 km 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.070
 is much more mountaineering has little 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.860
 track travels places where it is very very 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.480
 complicated to arrive if it is not this way 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.660
 walking and on very, very little trails 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.340
 known 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.140
 will give a lot to talk about is another great 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.470
 Canary Islands especially because of the hardness 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.540
 modality of 119 has a lot of unevenness 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.370
 and more new things because we suppress the 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.380
 competitive weights the breastplate of 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.490
 competition in an element that already 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.480
 we had to distinguish the 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.640
 runners in the different modalities 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.410
 at the time of your entry goals and to the 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.530
 time that they will receive the heat of 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.480
 public then know from where they came from 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.530
 we have suppressed it so that 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.880
 runners can carry their own 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.190
 advertising now there are many runners 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.959
 with sponsor and so that they can also 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.090
 take the clothes that are useful to you 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.579
 feel better the most comfortable for them in 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.900
 your place we will put a bracelet of 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.480
 customized with each modality that is 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.820
 volunteer too 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.100
 and more new things 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.200
 in the transgrancanaria we have put 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.940
 external provisioning points before 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.030
 we did not have them now to the runners 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.440
 they can be assisted in four points of 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.910
 control and it will be an external help 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.560
 controlled so that the runners 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.690
 receive that provisioning 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.070
 personalized not only must be limited to 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.750
 the food habits of the back in 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.790
 Canary Islands but can receive that 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.090
 external assistance in key points of the 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.090
 test 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.380
 well, if you can not have the corridos 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.930
 lose because you know that we are growing 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.919
 year after year, you are teaching us and we are going 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.720
 teaching everyone and we go 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.199
 learning in the race outside how to go 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.199
 getting better 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.800
 and in addition to the tour totally 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.840
 different from what you 've seen in other years 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.800
 If you have not run it, never do not tell 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.090
 you can lose because it 's one of the 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.090
 big Europe you know that north 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:16.020
 face has 55 tests in the world that 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.300
 They are Mount Fuji Los Angeles, Laredo 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.220
 mont-blanc and after grancanaria and then 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.990
 I will not be transgrancanaria is not 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.780
 have been in one of the great 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.000
 we are putting a lot of effort into that 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.660
 come out all right we are innovating 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.030
 bringing new things 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.680
 You will see that one more year we are going to 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.420
 surprise and let's take a little step 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.540
 within the world of the ultra trail 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:44.410
 and nothing without more enplazarte to see us here 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.170

 It will be a very large party already 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.409
