00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
good power grid fuel efficiency as far

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.089 
good power grid fuel efficiency as far
as<00:00:30.960> safety<00:00:31.170> goes<00:00:31.380> with<00:00:31.650> these<00:00:31.769> things<00:00:31.949> you

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
as safety goes with these things you

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.920 
as safety goes with these things you
won't<00:00:32.250> find<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.640> higher<00:00:32.880> rated<00:00:33.360> safety<00:00:33.750> one

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
won't find a higher rated safety one

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.840 
won't find a higher rated safety one
it's<00:00:34.770> got<00:00:34.920> many<00:00:35.040> things<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.550> such<00:00:35.730> as

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
it's got many things to it such as

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.760 
it's got many things to it such as
crumple<00:00:36.239> zones<00:00:36.450> they<00:00:36.930> have<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.380> art<00:00:37.559> they

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
crumple zones they have the art they

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.319 
crumple zones they have the art they
have<00:00:37.950> everything<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:38.579> breaking<00:00:38.969> nowadays

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
have everything with breaking nowadays

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.510 
have everything with breaking nowadays
actually<00:00:39.840> what<00:00:39.989> they<00:00:40.020> do<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.860> got<00:00:41.010> anti<00:00:41.340> roll

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
actually what they do it's got anti roll

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.220 
actually what they do it's got anti roll
mitigation<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.629> if<00:00:42.750> you're<00:00:42.840> going<00:00:42.960> around<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
mitigation so if you're going around a

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.660 
mitigation so if you're going around a
corner<00:00:43.379> what<00:00:43.649> happens<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.219> posh<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
corner what happens is it posh the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.490 
corner what happens is it posh the
brakes<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.510> instead<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.840> having<00:00:46.050> your<00:00:46.170> vehicle

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
brakes so instead of having your vehicle

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.080 
brakes so instead of having your vehicle
lean<00:00:46.710> from<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> g-force<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.640> almost<00:00:47.850> rolled

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
lean from the g-force it almost rolled

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.940 
lean from the g-force it almost rolled
over<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.780> evens<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.260> out<00:00:49.350> around<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> corner

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
over it evens it out around the corner

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.189 
over it evens it out around the corner
and<00:00:50.010> sells<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.370> down<00:00:50.489> very<00:00:50.730> nicely<00:00:50.989> as<00:00:51.989> long

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
and sells you down very nicely as long

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.930 
and sells you down very nicely as long
as<00:00:52.350> safety<00:00:52.649> goes<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.219> right<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:53.820> in

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
as safety goes to this right here in

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.549 
as safety goes to this right here in
fact<00:00:54.239> if<00:00:54.480> there's<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.690> fire<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.170> engine

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
fact if there's a fire on the engine

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.830 
fact if there's a fire on the engine
these<00:00:55.890> tabs<00:00:56.219> burn<00:00:56.520> off<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:57.180> falls<00:00:57.420> down<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
these tabs burn off it falls down and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.630 
these tabs burn off it falls down and
smolders<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.320> fire<00:00:58.500> kind<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.160> neat<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.460> not

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
smolders the fire kind of neat and not

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.490 
smolders the fire kind of neat and not
useful<00:00:59.850> even<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> journeys<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.379> get

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
useful even in the journeys if you get

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.110 
useful even in the journeys if you get
in<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.649> front<00:01:01.829> end<00:01:02.100> collision<00:01:02.309> what<00:01:02.760> happens

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
in the front end collision what happens

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.270 
in the front end collision what happens
is<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> engine<00:01:03.570> drops<00:01:04.049> down<00:01:04.290> actually<00:01:04.589> and

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
is the engine drops down actually and

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.590 
is the engine drops down actually and
goes<00:01:05.489> underneath<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.030> vehicle<00:01:06.180> instead<00:01:06.479> of

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
goes underneath the vehicle instead of

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.270 
goes underneath the vehicle instead of
coming<00:01:06.840> through<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> cab<00:01:07.229> no<00:01:07.619> direction<00:01:08.159> it's

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
coming through the cab no direction it's

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.830 
coming through the cab no direction it's
not<00:01:08.460> directed<00:01:08.729> at<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.240> passenger<00:01:09.810> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
not directed at the passenger and

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.880 
not directed at the passenger and
