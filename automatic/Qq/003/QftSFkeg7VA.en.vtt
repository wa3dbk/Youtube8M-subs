threshold<00:01:37.200> where<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.649> can<00:01:37.770> start<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.100> grow

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249 
threshold where we can start to grow

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:39.169 
threshold where we can start to grow
some<00:01:38.429> of<00:01:38.460> these<00:01:38.609> when<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:38.939> talk<00:01:39.119> about

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
some of these when you talk about

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.989 
some of these when you talk about
climate<00:01:39.390> change<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:40.490> mean<00:01:41.490> are<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.640> talking

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:41.999 
climate change I mean are you talking

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:44.569 
climate change I mean are you talking
about<00:01:42.060> trying<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.840> take<00:01:43.649> advantage<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
about trying to take advantage of the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.520 
about trying to take advantage of the
fat<00:01:44.759> dirt<00:01:44.969> if<00:01:45.780> we're<00:01:45.960> all<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.350> go<00:01:46.469> to

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
fat dirt if we're all going to go to

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.580 
fat dirt if we're all going to go to
hell<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.009> handcart<00:01:47.280> because<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:48.289> the<00:01:49.289> change

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
hell in a handcart because of the change

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.899 
hell in a handcart because of the change
in<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.770> climate<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.670> what<00:01:50.789> you're

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
in the climate is that what you're

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.719 
in the climate is that what you're
trying<00:01:50.999> to<00:01:51.149> do<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.539> it<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:51.960> what<00:01:52.859> we<00:01:53.429> I

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
trying to do is it just that what we I

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.129 
trying to do is it just that what we I
mean<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.210> know<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> science<00:01:54.749> is<00:01:54.869> kind<00:01:55.079> of

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:55.139 
mean you know the science is kind of

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:57.800 
mean you know the science is kind of
undeniable<00:01:55.710> we've<00:01:56.189> got<00:01:56.369> if<00:01:57.299> we're<00:01:57.509> good<00:01:57.659> from

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
undeniable we've got if we're good from

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.679 
undeniable we've got if we're good from
today<00:01:58.049> we've<00:01:58.289> got<00:01:58.319> 40<00:01:59.069> years<00:01:59.249> of<00:01:59.310> some<00:01:59.880> kind<00:02:00.539> of

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
today we've got 40 years of some kind of

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.029 
today we've got 40 years of some kind of
climate<00:02:01.020> change<00:02:01.049> going<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:02.009> all

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
climate change going on you know for all

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.889 
climate change going on you know for all
our<00:02:02.280> past<00:02:02.490> actions<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.090> bristle<00:02:03.420> system<00:02:03.810> is

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
our past actions the bristle system is

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.500 
our past actions the bristle system is
very<00:02:04.020> slow<00:02:04.109> one<00:02:04.439> you've<00:02:04.590> got

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
very slow one you've got

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.240 
very slow one you've got
you<00:02:06.170> know<00:02:06.260> it's<00:02:06.380> reliant<00:02:06.770> mostly<00:02:07.070> on<00:02:07.160> the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
you know it's reliant mostly on the

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.500 
you know it's reliant mostly on the
oceans<00:02:07.550> and<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.790> takes<00:02:07.970> a<00:02:08.060> long<00:02:08.210> time<00:02:08.270> to

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
oceans and that takes a long time to

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.150 
oceans and that takes a long time to
circulate<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.290> change<00:02:09.530> in<00:02:09.710> heat<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.100> that

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
circulate the change in heat and that

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.550 
circulate the change in heat and that
kind<00:02:10.400> of<00:02:10.460> stuff<00:02:10.520> yeah<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.270> even<00:02:12.170> if<00:02:12.260> we're<00:02:12.410> good

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
kind of stuff yeah so even if we're good

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.990 
kind of stuff yeah so even if we're good
from<00:02:12.920> tomorrow<00:02:13.160> we've<00:02:13.370> got<00:02:13.400> some<00:02:13.700> climate

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
from tomorrow we've got some climate

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.650 
from tomorrow we've got some climate
change<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.300> come<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.980> know<00:02:16.100> about<00:02:16.660> about

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
change to come and you know about about

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.540 
change to come and you know about about
the<00:02:17.780> sixth<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.680> know<00:02:18.770> that's<00:02:18.980> seventeen

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
the sixth you know that's seventeen

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.880 
the sixth you know that's seventeen
eighteen<00:02:19.820> percent<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.300> our<00:02:20.800> contribution<00:02:21.800> to

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
eighteen percent of our contribution to

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.470 
eighteen percent of our contribution to
climate<00:02:21.980> change<00:02:22.220> is<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.880> do<00:02:23.000> with<00:02:23.150> our<00:02:23.270> diet

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
climate change is to do with our diet

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.690 
climate change is to do with our diet
and<00:02:24.010> if<00:02:25.010> we<00:02:25.190> can<00:02:25.400> grow<00:02:26.290> organic<00:02:27.290> food<00:02:28.130> that<00:02:28.580> we

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
and if we can grow organic food that we

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.070 
and if we can grow organic food that we
normally<00:02:28.820> sauce<00:02:29.180> from<00:02:29.330> overseas<00:02:29.750> we're

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
normally sauce from overseas we're

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.720 
normally sauce from overseas we're
knocking<00:02:30.410> out<00:02:30.530> all<00:02:30.740> that<00:02:30.950> carbon<00:02:31.250> load<00:02:31.550> that

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
knocking out all that carbon load that

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.640 
knocking out all that carbon load that
normally<00:02:32.000> goes<00:02:32.150> with<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.290> clean<00:02:33.470> down

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
normally goes with it so you clean down

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.260 
normally goes with it so you clean down
on<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:33.860> food<00:02:34.010> miles<00:02:34.190> as<00:02:34.370> well<00:02:34.550> cut<00:02:34.970> down<00:02:35.120> the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
on the food miles as well cut down the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.610 
on the food miles as well cut down the
food<00:02:35.390> miles<00:02:35.600> if<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:35.870> can<00:02:36.050> do<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.200> organically

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
food miles if you can do it organically

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.710 
food miles if you can do it organically
that's<00:02:36.860> grains<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.340> know<00:02:37.520> everything<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.570> do

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
that's grains you know everything to do

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.620 
that's grains you know everything to do
with<00:02:38.980> carbon<00:02:39.980> dioxide<00:02:40.430> nitrous<00:02:41.120> oxide<00:02:41.480> and

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
with carbon dioxide nitrous oxide and

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.000 
with carbon dioxide nitrous oxide and
methane<00:02:41.750> which<00:02:42.110> are<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.320> three<00:02:42.500> big<00:02:42.680> ones<00:02:42.710> as

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
methane which are the three big ones as

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.340 
methane which are the three big ones as
far<00:02:43.160> as<00:02:43.250> climate<00:02:43.670> change<00:02:43.880> goes<00:02:44.090> okay<00:02:44.540> if<00:02:45.200> we

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
far as climate change goes okay if we

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.660 
far as climate change goes okay if we
can<00:02:45.470> cut<00:02:45.590> all<00:02:45.710> those<00:02:45.830> out<00:02:46.010> without<00:02:46.250> changing

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
can cut all those out without changing

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.370 
can cut all those out without changing
our<00:02:46.790> diet<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.210> know<00:02:47.240> I<00:02:47.330> mean<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:48.080> know<00:02:48.200> it's

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
our diet you know I mean you know it's

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.540 
our diet you know I mean you know it's
like<00:02:48.500> most<00:02:48.710> of<00:02:48.890> us<00:02:48.980> I'm<00:02:49.160> not<00:02:49.310> going<00:02:49.490> to

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
like most of us I'm not going to

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.000 
like most of us I'm not going to
undiscovered<00:02:50.060> oil<00:02:50.390> just<00:02:50.990> because<00:02:51.260> it's<00:02:51.410> you

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
undiscovered oil just because it's you

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.430 
undiscovered oil just because it's you
know<00:02:52.040> greener<00:02:52.850> not<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:53.930> if<00:02:53.990> we<00:02:54.080> can<00:02:54.170> grow<00:02:54.320> it

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
know greener not to so if we can grow it

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.410 
know greener not to so if we can grow it
in<00:02:54.530> this<00:02:54.650> country<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.550> produce<00:02:55.850> it<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.180> offer

it to the domestic market we're giving
ourselves<00:02:59.480> you<00:02:59.900> know<00:02:59.930> a<00:03:00.050> very<00:03:00.350> very<00:03:00.560> green

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
ourselves you know a very very green

ourselves you know a very very green
low-carbon<00:03:01.130> diet<00:03:01.850> which<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.209> part<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.900> it

low-carbon diet which is a part of it

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.720 
low-carbon diet which is a part of it
and<00:03:03.140> we've<00:03:03.830> got<00:03:03.980> climate<00:03:04.280> change<00:03:04.459> coming

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
and we've got climate change coming

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.820 
and we've got climate change coming
whether<00:03:05.120> we're<00:03:05.300> good<00:03:05.450> or<00:03:05.600> not<00:03:05.750> from<00:03:06.500> now<00:03:06.650> on
