00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hi everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.029
 this brand new video like everyone 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.950
 you will know yesterday at the apple keynote 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.240
 presented all the new devices of 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.250
 this year including the most important 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.660
 the iPhone 5 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.009
 and this is exactly what we will talk about 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.009
 This video begins immediately 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.800
 let's start talking about hardware in 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.010
 detail of the processor which is a 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.560
 asset so powerful and powerful from 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.619
 ensuring an architecture on the phone a 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.930
 64 bit which until now had been seen 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.610
 only on one computer but indeed 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.890
 the iPhone 5 s can safely 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.110
 compete and therefore be compared to 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.540
 a computer or a console then 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.579
 reaching very very similar levels 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.039
 the iPhone 5 has also been defined 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.260
 as the best gaming device 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.390
 portable given the quantity almost 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.520
 endless games downloadable from the app 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.670
 store including the great classics like 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.350
 dead space infinity blade and asphalt and if 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.809
 first you said that these games 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.530
 they could fully enjoy only on PC 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.300
 or console 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.390
 now you will be satisfied since 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.909
 also thanks to the support of opengl 3.0 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.640
 the iPhone 5 allows you to view 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.250
 rich and complex graphic effects 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.369
 so far only tolerated by a 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.970
 mac or a pc next to the 7 processor 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.680
 there is the new motion processor co 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.630
 m7 which collects the data provided 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.090
 of the gyroscope and compass accelerometer 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.729
 to lighten the work of the processor 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.900
 at 7 this among other things will allow 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.520
 creating apps related to fitness 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.229
 extremely detailed sophisticated 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.579
 ok now let's start talking about one 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.579
 of the greatest novelties of this 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.720
 device that is the known touch id 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.329
 better like the fingerprint reader 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.790
 digital in the key but it was indeed 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.189
 mounted a cut sapphire crystal 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.829
 laser than with the touch sensor 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.079
 capacitive is able to memorize the 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.750
 the fingerprint of the finger that touches 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.549
 from anywhere the home button the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.250
 pacÃ¬ di is associated with the section 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.530
 security in fact just like in the movies 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.090
 now it will no longer be necessary to enter 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.429
 the boring code to access our 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.009
 phone to unlock it 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.190
 just touch the home button and if there 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.380
 fingerprint is recognized 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.280
 then the one set will match 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.010
 as a password 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.300
 it will unlock the device now 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.150
 let's talk about another big news 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.950
 of the iPhone 5 you have the camera 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.440
 first of all from this image we can 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.750
 note that the cell for the led is the 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.700
 double than that of the iPhone 5 e 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.370
 predecessors and the reason is a lot 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.790
 simple because there is now a double 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.160
 flash led john the first in the world not 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.310
 only mounted on a phone but even 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.770
 on a camera the eyesight camera 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.500
 remained 8 megapixels but with a 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.080
 highest aperture or 2.2 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.150
 and a new larger sensor these 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.480
 features combined with the 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.910
 isp processor integrated into the chip to 7 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.890
 will ensure an autofocus up to two 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.840
 times more precise and a time of 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.850
 faster image acquisition 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.970
 without forgetting a stabilization 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.560
 automatic and a dynamic range 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.300
 much better and the last horse 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.520
 battle of the camera is 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.380
 definitely the breast mod 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.920
 in this particular mode it will be 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.780
 can shoot video at 120fps 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.280
 obviously designed to be 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.320
 slowed down in technical terms you can 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.360
 apply a slow motion effect 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.580
 a bit like the slow prodi application 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.430
 app store the only disadvantage of the 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.640
 breast mode is that it will not support the full 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.650
 hd in fact the maximum quality will be 720p 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.930
 that however the quality more than good 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.019
 the iPhone 5 s will be available in three 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.959
 sidereal gray or better colors 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.090
 champagne and silver the price should 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.160
 be almost identical to that 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.600
 of the iPhone 5 at the time of exit also 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.040
 if in Italy it has not yet been 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.530
 officially communicated 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.510
 unfortunately Italy is not part of 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.360
 countries that will receive the first one immediately 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.730
 wave of iphone 5s then us Italians 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.200
 to see iphone 5 in store e 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.280
 ready to be bought we will have to 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.200
 wait for December 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.970
 having said that I hope the video will 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.620
 both liked and useful 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.480
 I recommend you subscribe to my channel 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.130
 comment if you liked the video 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.769
 you can safely share it on 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.630
 twitter and on facebook and I also remember you 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.709
 to follow me on the two social networks 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.229
