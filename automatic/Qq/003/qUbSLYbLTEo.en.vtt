00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello everyone I'm pink I'm going to 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.799
 teach a curious game called 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.240
 disco emilio navas is a game that has 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.490
 called a lot of attention for his 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.380
 originality since we're going to do this 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.170
 kind of geek is there all day in 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.449
 the computer we use miners from 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.880
 bitcoin and you'll think that that said it's 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.160
 an electronic currency that was created in 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.840
 Japanese as a kind of network yes 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.689
 you want more information about this 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.920
 you can put in google 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:32.160
 find better information than the one 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.480
 I 'm going to give you the same. 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.850
 it has really caught my attention 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.040
 I was watching a couple of years ago and 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.350
 how this bit coin worked and in 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.930
 game that I find super super original 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.420
 as you are seeing I am here looking 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.579
 bitcoin we have a little monkey in which 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.899
 we will be able to improve different things 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.210
 as you are seeing here for example 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.879
 we can improve the way in which 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.079
 let's win bitcoin it means that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.500
 if for example we are playing the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.500
 screen 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.550
 I lost a third of what I had 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.610
 nothing of what it contains but 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.740
 and they have given me a gift of enough 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.420
 bitcoins the truth is a game that is 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.430
 a lot what we're going to talk about the room 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.190
 as you saw speak to be a little 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.770
 rotten we have different tasks and 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.020
 different challenges we can also improve 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.190
 the old ones where we're going to win here 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.190
 we have a kind of lottery 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.119
 and like all our online earnings 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:39.490
 they are going to increase here we have investment and 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.970
 let's win different discs in mode 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.350
 offline for example if I buy I'm going to 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.070
 to buy 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.229
 He profitably sent what we are going to do 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.299
 is that we are going to earn even more as you see 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.000
 there in the bitcoins that won by second 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.040
 they have increased and well this is also not 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.270
 It is a great game but it offers us 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.670
 originality that is pretty funny 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.009
 the very cool result I 'm playing 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.259
 one day and peak and the truth that I do not 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.260
 like 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:16.110
 a sure look that I'm going to hook 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.110
 to be taught by the curious 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.459
 I suppose that he will soon leave for 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.470
 android and good I hope you have 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.970
