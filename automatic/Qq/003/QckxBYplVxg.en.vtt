00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.250
 we can drive up here 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.950
 of course we want the 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.130
 use other five gears and to do so 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.840
 we first learn in the first gear and 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.160
 as soon as I have the need 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.160
 upshift, for example, right now 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.150
 Yes 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.369
 lever and presses with the course from below 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.879
 to the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.879
 follow 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.060
 makes it again so that the camera better 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.890
 catch now 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.370
 in the second course now have quarter 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.370
 to switch 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.770
 50 things but only 4000 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:51.300
 recommendations so 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.540
 of course he is allowed to drive the whole trip 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.540
 little 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.730
 king classics do not panic like 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.440
 pull in 2 clutch and light 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.580
 in the front and made boundaries and comes 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.410
 again to a standstill 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.860
 the worst thing we can do is 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.500
 the you remain on casting that we 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.860
 not coupling because then comes the engine 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.720
 against the braking power but evil ends 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.980
 or for the beginning of the thinking steering wheel 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.020
 somehow quite panic and frowning 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.270
 think because steering is one again 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.880
 art of the mainzer beirates video to it 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.710
 is just different than you think more 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.910
 I would not say in advance is that 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.210
 appropriate video later in the 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.210
 playlist 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.170
 should 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.550
 with the now on the club area out 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.220
 We have a coffee is printed 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.560

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.690
 driving instructor and the books and year 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.160
 rise forces machine is put on 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.140
 We always go from left open 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.670
 machine on the ground that most 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.650
 machines or all machines so me 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.870
 No obligation has its stalls on 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.920
 the right side 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.860
 it means now if I'm from the 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.740
 ascend the other side 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.450
 I have to and I have to go a little bit too 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.770
 pull me and so on and that falls 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.760
 me here then I have just that 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.310
 shit then I can go right back 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.320
 going home from the left side tends 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.890
 the machine has to me, I'm 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:56.000
 in the ass on it and I sit stand 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.720
 high and fits everything well we do that 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.180
 machine on 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.750
 we make sure that the emergency is out 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.100
 switch not on but also on 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.180
 45 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.950
 and then we do ours 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.390

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.410
 Cars that come on the car also 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.510

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.640

 situated times gone off 1 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:21.730
 and then we go very slowly and 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.730
 who says one or auditor then 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.190
 and of course, do not forget it as soon as we 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.260
