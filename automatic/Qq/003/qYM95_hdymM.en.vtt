00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
glass block circle it's in the middle of

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.719 
glass block circle it's in the middle of
nowhere<00:01:56.829> it's<00:01:57.829> quite<00:01:58.250> as<00:01:58.430> cool<00:02:00.070> yeah<00:02:01.070> they're

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
randomly generates these paths also a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.020 
randomly generates these paths also a
bit<00:02:14.209> like<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:15.200> past<00:02:15.620> sun<00:02:15.920> up<00:02:16.250> really<00:02:16.819> really

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
middle of the air then I phloem dhone

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.759 
middle of the air then I phloem dhone
and<00:02:27.530> then<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.709> go<00:02:27.860> there<00:02:28.010> like<00:02:28.190> just<00:02:29.650> still<00:02:30.650> got
