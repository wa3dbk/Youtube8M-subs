also<00:01:09.860> you<00:01:10.550> see<00:01:10.760> here<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.660> forks<00:01:12.020> upside<00:01:12.620> down

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
also you see here the forks upside down

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.220 
also you see here the forks upside down
as<00:01:13.070> first<00:01:13.460> time<00:01:13.760> on<00:01:13.940> a<00:01:13.970> blade<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.510> see<00:01:14.990> them<00:01:15.140> on

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
as first time on a blade you see them on

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.680 
as first time on a blade you see them on
the<00:01:15.320> sp1<00:01:15.620> but<00:01:16.250> not<00:01:16.430> on<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.640> blade<00:01:16.850> but<00:01:17.570> they've

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
the sp1 but not on the blade but they've

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.120 
the sp1 but not on the blade but they've
now<00:01:17.960> got<00:01:18.170> them<00:01:18.320> as<00:01:18.440> light<00:01:18.650> as<00:01:18.890> ordinary

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
now got them as light as ordinary

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.890 
now got them as light as ordinary
telescopic<00:01:19.820> from<00:01:20.000> forks<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:20.600> that's<00:01:20.780> why

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
telescopic from forks so that's why

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.240 
telescopic from forks so that's why
they've<00:01:21.050> gone<00:01:21.170> with<00:01:21.380> them<00:01:21.560> but<00:01:21.740> you<00:01:21.890> do<00:01:22.040> get

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
they've gone with them but you do get

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.060 
they've gone with them but you do get
more<00:01:22.430> rigidity<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:23.360> talking<00:01:24.290> about<00:01:24.470> rigidity

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
more rigidity and talking about rigidity

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.520 
more rigidity and talking about rigidity
up<00:01:25.730> on<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.180> frame<00:01:26.390> here<00:01:26.420> if<00:01:27.020> you<00:01:27.200> can<00:01:27.350> follow

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
up on the frame here if you can follow

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.250 
up on the frame here if you can follow
me<00:01:27.730> the<00:01:28.730> frame<00:01:28.940> twin<00:01:29.270> spar<00:01:29.570> looks<00:01:29.930> somewhat

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
me the frame twin spar looks somewhat

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.260 
me the frame twin spar looks somewhat
similar<00:01:30.320> but<00:01:30.980> much<00:01:31.340> beefier<00:01:31.910> up<00:01:32.090> at<00:01:32.210> the

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
similar but much beefier up at the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.510 
similar but much beefier up at the
headstock<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:32.750> they<00:01:33.020> say<00:01:33.200> it's<00:01:33.350> actually<00:01:33.520> 30%

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
headstock and they say it's actually 30%

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.760 
headstock and they say it's actually 30%
more<00:01:34.760> rigid<00:01:35.150> than<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.510> old<00:01:35.660> one<00:01:35.900> but<00:01:36.530> having

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
more rigid than the old one but having

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.290 
more rigid than the old one but having
said<00:01:36.980> that<00:01:37.040> I'm<00:01:37.520> gonna<00:01:37.700> throw<00:01:37.880> this<00:01:37.970> pitted

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
said that I'm gonna throw this pitted

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.540 
said that I'm gonna throw this pitted
grass<00:01:38.960> away<00:01:39.230> I<00:01:39.380> mean<00:01:39.980> said<00:01:40.190> that<00:01:40.370> they've

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
grass away I mean said that they've

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.760 
grass away I mean said that they've
actually<00:01:40.700> built<00:01:41.150> on<00:01:41.390> some<00:01:41.840> flexibility<00:01:42.560> in

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
actually built on some flexibility in

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
the center this doesn't mean it's gonna

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.150 
the center this doesn't mean it's gonna
hinge<00:01:44.600> but<00:01:44.870> it<00:01:45.020> gives<00:01:45.200> some<00:01:45.470> movement<00:01:45.980> some

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
hinge but it gives some movement some

okay<00:03:11.670> but<00:03:12.030> what<00:03:12.210> about<00:03:12.420> down<00:03:12.690> in<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.960> engine

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
okay but what about down in the engine

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.350 
okay but what about down in the engine
room<00:03:13.260> here<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.310> bit<00:03:14.490> that<00:03:14.610> really<00:03:14.940> matters<00:03:15.240> to

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
room here the bit that really matters to

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.520 
room here the bit that really matters to
most<00:03:15.480> people<00:03:15.960> it's<00:03:16.890> up<00:03:17.070> in<00:03:17.310> capacity<00:03:17.900> 929<00:03:18.900> CC

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
most people it's up in capacity 929 CC

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.130 
most people it's up in capacity 929 CC
and<00:03:19.800> it's<00:03:20.040> also<00:03:20.220> up<00:03:20.550> by<00:03:20.760> 22<00:03:21.209> brake<00:03:21.600> horsepower

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
and it's also up by 22 brake horsepower

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.540 
and it's also up by 22 brake horsepower
so<00:03:22.410> there's<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.620> lot<00:03:22.800> of<00:03:22.920> poke<00:03:23.130> in<00:03:23.340> there

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
so there's a lot of poke in there

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.280 
so there's a lot of poke in there
they've<00:03:24.180> shortened<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.660> stroke<00:03:24.900> as<00:03:25.080> well

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
they've shortened the stroke as well

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.110 
they've shortened the stroke as well
that<00:03:25.560> increases<00:03:25.920> allows<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.520> engine<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.820> spin

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
that increases allows the engine to spin

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.760 
that increases allows the engine to spin
up<00:03:27.239> higher<00:03:27.480> eleven<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.200> half<00:03:28.260> thousand

slimmer than the old blades if you

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.690 
slimmer than the old blades if you
remember<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.320> early<00:04:37.530> blades<00:04:37.800> very<00:04:37.980> bulbous

they<00:04:39.540> slimmed<00:04:39.870> down<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.170> tank<00:04:40.380> a<00:04:40.500> lot<00:04:40.620> but

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
they slimmed down the tank a lot but

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.620 
they slimmed down the tank a lot but
taking<00:04:41.280> it<00:04:41.370> lower<00:04:41.580> so<00:04:41.910> you<00:04:42.000> got<00:04:42.150> exactly<00:04:42.300> the

taking it lower so you got exactly the

taking it lower so you got exactly the
