 job 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.950

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.609
 the one that is not paper is not an attitude with a control tape 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.160
 this quintet of control when the brains of the device are here 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.570

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.280
 the video and sound outputs 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.620

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.190
