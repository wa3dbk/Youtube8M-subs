00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.520
 good morning the sugar makers this cake 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.740
 that is already three chocolates does not require 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.810
 No kind of presentation because all 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.880
 you know her and I know that many of you put her in 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.740
 usual practice but good as 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.900
 I had not recorded the video I decided 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.480
 and encouraged me today is the birthday of 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.170
 samuel and on his favorite cover like that 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.180
 what am I going to do 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.920
 extra large the ingredients that I'm going to 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.960
 put the recipe is for this amount of 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.910
 cake if you want to do less then 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.769
 matches in half the first thing that 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.440
 you see here are chocolate chocolates 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.720
 black chocolate with milk and chocolate 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.320
 white then I will use this mold 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.030
 that removable and for the base we are going to 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.659
 use normal cookies those that 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.699
 more like it and a little butter and 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.430
 then to make the creams we will mix 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.050
 of chocolates with curd you can 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.879
 buy any brand cream 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.290
 then on top to decorate it already 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.820
 put some almond coloring 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.900
 because he likes it a lot but you can 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.700
 decorate it with whatever you want 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.050
 I like the layer of cookies that 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.240
 be finite but as there are I like 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.000
 pretty fat I'm going to put almost a 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.680
 cookies package 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.680
 for this recipe a cookie 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.320
 If you do not have a machine, you can do it in 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.420
 a rag with a roller or good with the 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.700
 normal chopper of the blender I'm going to 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.850
 put cookies and a little butter 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.369
 about 100 grams if you see that 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.049
 it does not do not stay very compact we add 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.800
 a little bit more I have it at temperature 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.829
 environment and let's mix it 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.689
 all 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:50.479
 I'm back, you see I have this 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.159
 another form of presentation I thought 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.960
 I'm going to make the big cake and 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.429
 I will also teach how to do the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.000
 individual mold you can also do it 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.960
 in a glass without any problem first 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.720
 I'm going to do the little one 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.190
 as I do not get off the record I'm going to put 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.060
 a tiny amount 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.060
 of cookies 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.840
 and the rest 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.489
 is a base enabled with butter 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.470
 of you know that they burn we will have to 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.500
 pressing with a spatula spoon 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.950
 or hands to form a whole layer 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.390
 uniform and well solid in the part 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.390
 bottom of our model 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.489
 well I have the bases in the fridge 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.549
 cooling that while we're going to do the 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.200
 creams I'm going to start with a cream 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.719
 white for the three colors will be 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.780
 exactly the same is worth 200 grams of 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:54.819
 milk 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.740
 I see the good ends and of 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.970
 momix in a pot is exactly what 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.450
 same 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.640
 200 grams 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.110
 of cream for riding 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.110
 an envelope of curd 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.540
 It is important that when the country 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.310
 you do in a pot you do not do it here 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.440
 they have to be moving all the time 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.850
 Curd because if not start 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.850
 solidify by the walls 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.860
 and finally the chocolate 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.480
 we split it into some things for 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.840
 help him melt 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.450
 As it is written, it is not necessary 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:42.330
 split it from ounces and where are we going to 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:45.250
 set it to 90 degrees so that it goes 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.700
 undoing the chocolate 90 degrees 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.160
 speed 4 or so and you in the 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.370
 referee or on fire at a temperature 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.989
 that does not get to boil the milk but that 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.740
 yes he is saying chocolate 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:02.080
 for about 7 minutes 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.680
 already the time has passed we already have 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.510
 our white cream lists what you do not 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.580
 I have commented is that it takes time 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.310
 to make this cake not for the 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.650
 processing is not complicated at all 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.500
 because between layer and layer you have to leave it 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.700
 cool and in the fridge 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.660
 I'm going to put the 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.660
 a white 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.870
 and the rest we put it 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.370
 you have to stop stirring while 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.930
 Warm chocolate because otherwise no 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.710
 it would come out in lumps and be careful with 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.290
 that 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:46.340
 I'm going to put the fridge 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:49.760
 half an hour to make the next layer 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.960
 well it has returned to me that I have cold the 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.699
 first cap of the pie have power 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.919
 put the fridge that is not too hot 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.110
 because it's called a fridge is going to spoil 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.900
 and food is going to spoil 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.449
 ok let's put the second layer of 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.360
 milk chocolate in this case 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:11.449
 and here goes the trick of the day so that 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.099
 then the layers as they are very solid do not 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.610
 slide when the court is that to 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:19.300
 Sometimes the trick is with a fork 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.300
 make a few lines 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.900
 what will make the two layers 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.300
 stay with each other 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.300
 let's make some lines 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.640
 you can make a glass like I have 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.490
 commented before night also in 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.660
 individual portions is great 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.610
 another thing if it is not at the time that 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.160
 cool the bottom part down a lot because 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.770
 hasten to sink is not 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.290
 second layer in the white we're going to 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:53.010
 use a spoon upside down that goes to 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:56.070
 make the cream expand better and not 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:59.240
 fall or on a point directly to see 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.240
 if they send it here 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:09.710
 so we avoid that waterfall-like hit 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.250
 which sometimes causes the masses to sink 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.250
 about others 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.759
 I'm going to put a little bit the little one 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:16.759
 I do not forget 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.319
 good third layer I'm not going to do it anymore 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.719
 because it is exactly the same for the 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:34.509
 dark chocolate let's let it 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:36.550
 cool this second layer the striped 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:38.289
 same with the fork and we put a 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.240
 third layer we let it cool 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:42.159
 completely for at least 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.800
 four hours and poseidÃ³n day for another 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:46.930
 better and in this case I'm going to decorate it 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.159
 with a bit of crispy I hope that you 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.319
 have liked the recipe that is very 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:52.180
 simple and I know that many know it and 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:54.340
 for birthday special occasion 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.469
 It's true that I played a lot because it's a 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.500
 recipe that many portions come out is 

00:06:56.469 --> 00:07:01.900
 pretty consistent and for the 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:05.400
 birthday is ideal to everyone you 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.400
 like until next time
