music or song files that you're trying
to<00:01:23.420> sync<00:01:23.799> so<00:01:25.420> besides<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.570> music<00:01:26.869> ipod<00:01:27.079> app

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
to sync so besides the music ipod app

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.630 
to sync so besides the music ipod app
you<00:01:27.560> can<00:01:27.680> pretty<00:01:27.860> much<00:01:27.950> use<00:01:28.040> any<00:01:28.220> other

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
you can pretty much use any other

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.850 
you can pretty much use any other
application<00:01:29.180> while<00:01:29.630> syncing<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:30.290> i<00:01:30.590> think

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
application while syncing and i think

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.319 
application while syncing and i think
this<00:01:31.009> is<00:01:31.159> a<00:01:31.189> really<00:01:31.549> good<00:01:31.759> tweak<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.150> i<00:01:32.210> would

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
this is a really good tweak and i would

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.170 
this is a really good tweak and i would
actually<00:01:32.420> recommend<00:01:32.780> downloading<00:01:33.259> it<00:01:33.770> and

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
actually recommend downloading it and

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.850 
actually recommend downloading it and
also<00:01:35.180> what<00:01:35.540> this<00:01:35.720> tweak<00:01:35.930> does<00:01:36.110> is<00:01:36.350> it<00:01:36.500> makes<00:01:36.560> it

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
also what this tweak does is it makes it

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.460 
also what this tweak does is it makes it
so<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:37.430> can<00:01:37.610> show<00:01:37.850> your<00:01:38.570> normal<00:01:39.049> wallpaper

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470

so you can show your normal wallpaper
while<00:01:39.860> syncing<00:01:40.159> and<00:01:40.430> it<00:01:40.579> doesn't<00:01:40.850> show<00:01:41.000> the
