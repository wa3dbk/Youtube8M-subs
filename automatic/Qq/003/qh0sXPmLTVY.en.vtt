00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
through to the striker I actually

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.840 
through to the striker I actually
changed<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.559> little<00:00:40.680> bit<00:00:40.890> where<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.100> drew<00:00:41.430> 11

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850

tiles<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.510> i<00:00:42.570> just<00:00:42.780> made<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> team<00:00:43.379> with<00:00:44.010> those

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219

11<00:00:44.579> tiles<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.149> random<00:00:45.450> order<00:00:45.600> but<00:00:45.870> I've

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
11 tiles in a random order but I've

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.200 
11 tiles in a random order but I've
decided<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.710> once<00:00:47.160> again<00:00:47.340> draw<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.850> one<00:00:48.030> by<00:00:48.180> one

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
through it to the strikers now I've done

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.569 
through it to the strikers now I've done
this<00:00:52.620> because<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.039> makes<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> little<00:00:53.399> bit

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
this because it makes it a little bit

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.760

more difficult for me and as I said the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.860 
more difficult for me and as I said the
only<00:00:55.949> way<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.850> get<00:00:57.030> another<00:00:57.180> word<00:00:57.420> onto
