 It is widely known that plants 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.030
 They contain nutrients that are 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.830
 beneficial for the skin so good 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.490
 calculations are willing to travel 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.500
 distant distances to get the most 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.310
 that apply your farmer market on your 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.590
 face there may be a more dignified option 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.740
 today there are hundreds of cosmetic products 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.259
 on the shelves from makeups to 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.840
 beauty serums and many contain a 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:34.290
 very necessary realizer of the skin in 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.989
 a convenient small package like what 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.390
 makes life can be difficult for 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.089
 our skin our largest organ 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.850
 is constantly bombarded by 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:47.250
 levels of pollution increases and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.280
 to make things worse our skin 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.040
 loses elasticity and moisture with the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.500
 age the serums are the form used 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.360
 most recent by the companies of 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.100
 cosmetics in the advertises for 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.440
 provide health to the skin 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.340
 are popular with artists of 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.379
 makeup 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.600
 who believe this formula based on 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.060
 water can help represent the skin 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.190
 and can be applied with a layer 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.460
 protective before applying the 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.460
 makeup 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.110
 my friend 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:34.370
 singing though it may be easy to use 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.140
 producing it is another story before 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.390
 start working on the ground the 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.700
 workers should start the day with 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.760
 an air shower that leaves the bacteria 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.310
 behind that door which highlights the 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.010
 serum of any cosmetic cream is your 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.640
 high water content of 80 to 90 per 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.900
 hundred so he 's 15 he takes his achÃ© 2 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.780
 or very well pig 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.510
 first water is bombed from the ground to 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.820
 through a micro filter with 24 thousand 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.490
 times smaller than the width of a 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.490
 human hair this removes chlorine and 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.920
 sediment then put in a tank and 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.690
 is exposed to ultraviolet rays what 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.090
 attacks and kills any organism 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.480
 harmful that you see and if any bacteria 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.330
 manages to survive after that sounds 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.560
 an alarm and they have to start all of 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.810
 new 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.000
 the makeup and many products of 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.520
 skin care consist of several 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.030
 different compounds an ingredient 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.700
 common is glycerin which can be 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.550
 found in animals and plants is a 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.400
 moisturizer which means that it attracts 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.310
 moisture from the environment to the skin 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.110
 the semovientes on the other hand are used 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.660
 to prevent losses of 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.560
 humidification and also to soften the 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.260
 skin and make it more tender these 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.480
 ingredients are oil based like this 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.269
 that must be mixed with all that 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.940
 pure water for fast absorption and 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.459
 easy but the water molecules and 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.430
 oil does not mix well this machine 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.340
 Uses high temperature pressure and whisks 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.730
 gently to make sure that it 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.760
 Mix well each manufacturer evokes 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.480
 your own secret ingredient and this is not 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.880
 it is different this rough and ancestral 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.690
 could hide the secret so that the 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.600
 skin look healthy 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.790
 for more than three thousand years ginseng has 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.920
 been used in Asia by his acquaintances 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.940
 therapeutic benefits as for the 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.190
 treatment of cold and lethargy and 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.900
 these researchers believe that they can 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.380
 help accelerate the pace of production 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.420
 of collagen dermatologists say that 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.520
 Collagen plays a very important role 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.520
 to keep the skin healthy 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.100
 the researchers here hope to harvest 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:12.280
 the powers of this ancestral root going 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.940
 directly to its source the mother cell 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.280
 vegetable using a secret process of 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.950
 high technology have isolated and cultivate 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.040
 a particular strain known as the 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.889
 powerful multi cell and they called it 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.600
 toxic 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.270
 surviving in a nutritious broth the 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.250
 cells are added to the fire 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.919
 the mixture is then heated by three 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.980
 hours to combine the varied 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.980
 compounds then extracted from the tank 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.980
 for the next stage but before a 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.139
 little leisure time yet 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.680
 staggering from the heat stress 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.560
 extreme 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.990
 the mixture of oil and ingredients with 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.500
 water base need days to 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:59.169
 stabilize before it can be 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:03.730
 otherwise bottled their collectors 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:05.560
 the serum can be separated from one another 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.650
 is then moved to a line of 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.430
 assembly where a machine pumps a 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.860
 exact amount inserted in this 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.690
 small shiny bottle the serum is 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.900
 ready to get the attention of 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.930
 customers looking skin 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:25.720
 healthy appearance so here what 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.970
 has although it may not be the elixir 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.490
 of youth some hope that the 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.740
 serum can help eliminate some of 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.090
 those 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.090
 unwished
