00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.960 
fan clutch and wastegate solenoids seems
like<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.039> lot<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.220> people<00:00:17.520> have<00:00:17.609> had<00:00:17.760> that

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
like a lot of people have had that

problem nobody's really had a solution

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.109 
problem nobody's really had a solution
there's<00:00:22.050> been<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> few<00:00:22.380> workarounds<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:23.220> wanted

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
there's been a few workarounds I wanted

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.460 
there's been a few workarounds I wanted
to<00:00:24.180> figure<00:00:24.300> out<00:00:24.420> what<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.720> was<00:00:24.810> once<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.320> for

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
to figure out what it was once and for

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.849 
to figure out what it was once and for
all

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
all

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.130 
all
those<00:00:26.220> circuits<00:00:26.699> they<00:00:27.480> all<00:00:27.599> traced<00:00:27.900> back<00:00:28.080> to

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
those circuits they all traced back to

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.160 
those circuits they all traced back to
few<00:00:28.560> six<00:00:28.920> which<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.369> 10<00:00:29.640> amp<00:00:29.789> fuse<00:00:30.170> keeps

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
few six which is a 10 amp fuse keeps

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.520 
few six which is a 10 amp fuse keeps
blowing<00:00:32.360> originally<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.420> disconnected<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
blowing originally I disconnected the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.030 
blowing originally I disconnected the
wiring<00:00:35.010> up<00:00:35.190> at<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.660> up<00:00:36.660> at<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> actual<00:00:37.200> sensor

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
wiring up at the up at the actual sensor

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.299 
wiring up at the up at the actual sensor
and<00:00:38.280> fan<00:00:38.309> clutch<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:40.710> fuse<00:00:40.920> would<00:00:41.040> still

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
and fan clutch and the fuse would still

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.369 
and fan clutch and the fuse would still
blow<00:00:41.610> even<00:00:41.879> with<00:00:42.149> nothing<00:00:42.510> connected<00:00:43.260> so

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
blow even with nothing connected so

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.750 
blow even with nothing connected so
obviously<00:00:43.800> there<00:00:44.010> was<00:00:44.100> some<00:00:44.280> sort<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.520> chafed

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
obviously there was some sort of chafed

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.529 
obviously there was some sort of chafed
wire<00:00:45.059> somewhere<00:00:45.920> so<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.280> went<00:00:48.000> through<00:00:48.210> all<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
wire somewhere so I went through all the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.040 
wire somewhere so I went through all the
the<00:00:48.960> wiring<00:00:49.350> diagrams<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.570> tried<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.600> you

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
the wiring diagrams and tried to you

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.990 
the wiring diagrams and tried to you
know<00:00:52.140> trace<00:00:52.379> out<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> wires<00:00:52.829> looking<00:00:53.760> for

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
know trace out the wires looking for

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.849 
know trace out the wires looking for
likely<00:00:54.539> source<00:00:56.449> did<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.570> few<00:00:57.750> things<00:00:57.989> checked<00:00:58.800> a

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
likely source did a few things checked a

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.279 
likely source did a few things checked a
few<00:00:59.010> things<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.460> kind<00:00:59.640> one<00:01:00.449> finally<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.079> ended

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
few things it's kind one finally I ended

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.770 
few things it's kind one finally I ended
up<00:01:01.350> tracing<00:01:01.829> back<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.640> connector<00:01:03.239> here<00:01:03.270> I

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
up tracing back to this connector here I

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.149 
up tracing back to this connector here I
think<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:05.000> C<00:01:06.000> 130<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> diagrams<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.979> could

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
think it's C 130 on the diagrams I could

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.270 
think it's C 130 on the diagrams I could
be<00:01:08.280> mistaken<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.650> wire<00:01:10.979> right

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
be mistaken on that this this wire right

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.219 
be mistaken on that this this wire right
here<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> corner<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:13.110> actual<00:01:15.229> circuit

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
here in the corner is the actual circuit

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.719 
here in the corner is the actual circuit
or<00:01:16.380> wire<00:01:16.710> for<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> circuit<00:01:17.400> that's<00:01:17.549> causing

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
or wire for the circuit that's causing

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.330 
or wire for the circuit that's causing
the<00:01:17.970> problem<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.650> believe<00:01:19.650> that's<00:01:19.770> pink<00:01:20.220> with

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the problem I believe that's pink with

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.149 
the problem I believe that's pink with
yellow<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.990> disconnected<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.619> connector

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
yellow so I disconnected that connector

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.179 
yellow so I disconnected that connector
just<00:01:24.290> basically<00:01:25.290> have<00:01:25.380> been<00:01:25.439> troubleshooting

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
just basically have been troubleshooting

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.719 
just basically have been troubleshooting
by<00:01:26.310> blowing<00:01:27.380> mini<00:01:28.380> mini<00:01:28.590> fuses<00:01:29.159> trying<00:01:29.640> to

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
by blowing mini mini fuses trying to

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.850 
by blowing mini mini fuses trying to
figure<00:01:29.970> out<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.360> stops<00:01:30.630> blowing<00:01:30.930> but

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
figure out what it stops blowing but

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.640 
figure out what it stops blowing but
finally<00:01:32.700> dribbling<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.420> connector<00:01:34.229> with

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
finally dribbling that connector with

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.649 
finally dribbling that connector with
the<00:01:34.680> fuse<00:01:34.950> box<00:01:35.100> open<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.700> saw<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> pop<00:01:36.299> out<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the fuse box open I saw a pop out of the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.020 
the fuse box open I saw a pop out of the
corner<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:36.990> my<00:01:37.110> eye<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.590> I've<00:01:38.310> been<00:01:38.490> able<00:01:38.909> to

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
corner of my eye and I've been able to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.340 
corner of my eye and I've been able to
replicate<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.810> pretty<00:01:40.020> much<00:01:40.140> without<00:01:40.320> fail

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
replicate it pretty much without fail

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.499 
replicate it pretty much without fail
except<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.439> time<00:01:43.680> well<00:01:43.979> anyway<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.700> flipped

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
except this time well anyway I flipped

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.050 
except this time well anyway I flipped
it<00:01:45.600> up<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:47.340> don't<00:01:47.369> know<00:01:47.549> if<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.759> can<00:01:47.880> see

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
it up and I don't know if you can see

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.510 
it up and I don't know if you can see
that<00:01:48.240> right<00:01:48.750> there<00:01:49.369> BAM

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
that right there BAM

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.260 
that right there BAM
there's<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.030> chafe<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.840> I'm<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.380> gonna<00:01:53.270> put

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
there's the chafe so I'm just gonna put

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.550 
there's the chafe so I'm just gonna put
something<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.689> those<00:01:54.810> wires<00:01:55.020> clean<00:01:55.380> them<00:01:55.500> up

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
something on those wires clean them up

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.450 
something on those wires clean them up
and<00:01:55.890> I'm<00:01:56.399> assuming<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.000> will<00:01:57.540> fix<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.460> p0

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
and I'm assuming that will fix the p0

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.000 
and I'm assuming that will fix the p0
