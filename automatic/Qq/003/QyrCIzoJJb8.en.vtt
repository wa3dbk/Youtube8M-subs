00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.899
 good afternoon today i demonstrated 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.219
 how to solve september puzzle from the series 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:16.139
 12 months so start to take out 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:22.619
 a clip of this item tell us 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:27.380
 will need to skip the ring through 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:31.519
 paper clip first person 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.519
 missed we enter the ring 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:39.090
 we leave the same way with the second 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.090
 ring 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.400
 skip the ring through the clip 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.730
 want a ring skip two triangles 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:55.730
 and the first ring through tight inside 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:19.880
 all missed now let us through the third 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:22.900
 we pass the ring around the perimeter 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.900
 first ring 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.490
 so skip the two rings and 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.390
 all triangles through the clip 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.880
 missed and exit exactly the same 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.100
 way back to the original 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:48.619
 state run triangles and 2 2 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.619
 rings through the box 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.130
 this 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.090
 come on 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:20.000
 and exit the first ring 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.000
 send out pass through the perimeter 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.340
 skip the first ring 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.939
 go inside 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.939
 2 rings 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.680
 skip the first ring and two 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.680
 triangle 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.670
 missed 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.670
 go through the second ring 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:24.490
 so now skip 1 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:32.940
 triangle and skip through the clip in 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:32.940
 blood father thank you all
