00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.019 

it's<00:00:05.990> hard<00:00:06.290> to<00:00:06.410> get<00:00:06.680> any<00:00:06.800> power<00:00:07.160> out<00:00:07.640> of<00:00:07.850> these

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:08.029 
it's hard to get any power out of these

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:14.049 
it's hard to get any power out of these
small<00:00:09.100> DC<00:00:10.100> motors<00:00:12.369> when<00:00:13.369> it<00:00:13.520> is<00:00:13.670> under<00:00:13.969> the

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
small DC motors when it is under the

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.410 
small DC motors when it is under the
load<00:00:14.240> is<00:00:14.510> very<00:00:14.539> hard<00:00:15.049> to<00:00:15.230> turn<00:00:16.090> so<00:00:17.090> I'm<00:00:17.240> gonna

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
load is very hard to turn so I'm gonna

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.200 
load is very hard to turn so I'm gonna
give<00:00:17.900> it<00:00:18.020> a<00:00:18.109> good<00:00:18.320> spin<00:00:18.680> to<00:00:18.890> see<00:00:19.130> what<00:00:19.910> voltage

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
give it a good spin to see what voltage

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.929 
give it a good spin to see what voltage
and<00:00:20.689> how<00:00:20.869> it<00:00:21.109> would<00:00:21.320> light<00:00:21.500> up<00:00:21.710> the<00:00:22.339> 12<00:00:22.669> volt

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
and how it would light up the 12 volt

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.700 
and how it would light up the 12 volt
bow<00:00:24.369> you<00:00:25.369> see<00:00:25.609> it<00:00:25.789> likes<00:00:26.029> it<00:00:26.210> very<00:00:27.009> slightly

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
bow you see it likes it very slightly

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:37.000 
bow you see it likes it very slightly
goes<00:00:30.710> up<00:00:30.949> to<00:00:31.130> maybe<00:00:31.369> about<00:00:31.669> 6<00:00:32.150> volts<00:00:36.010> I'm

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
goes up to maybe about 6 volts I'm

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.500 
goes up to maybe about 6 volts I'm
turning<00:00:38.830> this<00:00:39.830> thing<00:00:39.890> as<00:00:40.370> hard<00:00:40.640> as<00:00:40.760> I<00:00:40.910> can<00:00:41.270> by

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
turning this thing as hard as I can by

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.920 
turning this thing as hard as I can by
hand<00:00:41.810> which<00:00:42.590> means<00:00:42.620> in<00:00:43.310> real<00:00:43.790> wind<00:00:44.150> situation

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
hand which means in real wind situation

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.580 
hand which means in real wind situation
is<00:00:45.140> not<00:00:45.410> going<00:00:45.620> to<00:00:45.710> turn<00:00:45.860> that<00:00:46.160> much<00:00:46.340> faster

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:01:01.840 

about<00:00:51.590> 7<00:00:52.130> volts<00:00:56.590> so<00:00:57.590> this<00:00:57.830> is<00:00:58.070> how<00:00:58.790> this<00:01:00.850> small

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
about 7 volts so this is how this small

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:16.730 
about 7 volts so this is how this small
DC<00:01:02.120> motor<00:01:02.630> looks<00:01:03.290> like

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.740 

you<00:01:17.310> can't<00:01:17.579> say<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.600> doesn't<00:01:19.049> work<00:01:20.750> but

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
you can't say that it doesn't work but

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.520 
you can't say that it doesn't work but
it's<00:01:21.990> very<00:01:22.829> hard<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.310> make<00:01:23.579> it<00:01:24.320> work<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.500> way

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
it's very hard to make it work the way

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.190 
it's very hard to make it work the way
you<00:01:25.680> want<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.340> work

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
you want it to work

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.980 
you want it to work
so<00:01:28.200> my<00:01:28.530> next<00:01:28.950> project<00:01:29.580> would<00:01:29.729> be<00:01:30.000> something

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
so my next project would be something

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.639 
so my next project would be something
like<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:32.360> very<00:01:33.360> small<00:01:33.810> wind<00:01:34.140> turbine

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
like this a very small wind turbine

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:41.389 
like this a very small wind turbine
output<00:01:35.840> in<00:01:36.840> milliamps<00:01:37.200> with<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:39.799> bicycle<00:01:40.799> axle

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
output in milliamps with a bicycle axle

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.719 
output in milliamps with a bicycle axle
so<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.600> where<00:01:42.929> the<00:01:43.110> propeller<00:01:43.590> group<00:01:44.009> of

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
so this is where the propeller group of

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.160 
so this is where the propeller group of
the<00:01:45.000> place<00:01:45.960> would<00:01:46.320> go<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:48.600> would<00:01:48.810> have<00:01:48.959> to

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the place would go and I would have to

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.219 
the place would go and I would have to
status<00:01:50.780> with<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:52.080> rotor<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.799> between<00:01:54.229> there

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
status with this rotor in between there

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:04.370 
status with this rotor in between there
will<00:01:55.289> be<00:01:55.350> magnets<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.130> both<00:01:56.459> sides<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.229> think

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
will be magnets on both sides so I think

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.969 
will be magnets on both sides so I think
this<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.950> only<00:02:05.100> type<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:08.989> motor<00:02:09.989> or<00:02:10.500> axial

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
this is the only type of motor or axial

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.400 
this is the only type of motor or axial
flux<00:02:11.190> motor<00:02:11.549> that<00:02:11.910> will<00:02:12.090> turn<00:02:12.390> well<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:13.019> DC

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
flux motor that will turn well the DC

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:22.369 
flux motor that will turn well the DC
motor<00:02:16.010> just<00:02:18.230> turn<00:02:19.230> very<00:02:19.560> well

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.410 

so<00:02:23.379> the<00:02:23.709> setup<00:02:24.040> would<00:02:24.400> look<00:02:24.670> something<00:02:25.390> like

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
so the setup would look something like

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.930 
so the setup would look something like
this
