it also has a hinge system let me go
back<00:04:02.200> out<00:04:03.390> it<00:04:04.390> also<00:04:04.570> has<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:04.989> hinge<00:04:05.500> system<00:04:05.890> that

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
back out it also has a hinge system that

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.979 
back out it also has a hinge system that
is<00:04:07.380> i'm<00:04:08.380> assuming<00:04:08.980> that<00:04:09.280> its<00:04:09.430> patent-pending

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
is i'm assuming that its patent-pending

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.050 
is i'm assuming that its patent-pending
but<00:04:10.989> it<00:04:11.260> allows<00:04:11.560> for<00:04:11.920> you<00:04:11.950> to<00:04:12.130> put<00:04:12.519> it<00:04:12.610> in<00:04:12.760> like

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
but it allows for you to put it in like

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.770 
but it allows for you to put it in like
I<00:04:13.090> have<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:13.450> right<00:04:13.750> here<00:04:13.810> in<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:15.150> laptop<00:04:16.150> mode

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
I have it right here in the laptop mode

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.979 
I have it right here in the laptop mode
are<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:19.000> can<00:04:19.120> flip<00:04:19.359> it<00:04:19.390> all<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.750> way<00:04:19.870> around

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
are you can flip it all the way around

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:20.810 
are you can flip it all the way around
and<00:04:20.470> put

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
and put

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.470 
and put
tablet<00:04:21.420> mode<00:04:21.600> which<00:04:21.960> is<00:04:21.990> like<00:04:22.380> that<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:23.480> then

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
tablet mode which is like that and then

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.750 
tablet mode which is like that and then
they<00:04:24.630> have<00:04:24.810> a<00:04:24.840> portrait<00:04:25.470> mode<00:04:25.680> which<00:04:26.400> is<00:04:26.550> like

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
you can do it pretty much like that as

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.560 
you can do it pretty much like that as
well<00:04:33.510> now<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.380> cons<00:04:34.830> of<00:04:35.160> this<00:04:35.250> little<00:04:35.820> system

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
well now the cons of this little system

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.380 
well now the cons of this little system
is<00:04:36.960> it's<00:04:37.800> still<00:04:38.010> do<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:38.640> still<00:04:38.880> have<00:04:39.030> to<00:04:39.150> touch
