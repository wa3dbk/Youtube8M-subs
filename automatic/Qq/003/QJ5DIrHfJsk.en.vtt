but when Tim was redoing the electric we

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.320 
but when Tim was redoing the electric we
accidentally<00:01:32.310> knocked<00:01:32.520> some<00:01:32.729> plaster<00:01:33.090> out<00:01:33.210> of

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
right now by the way it's got like I

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.980 
right now by the way it's got like I
don't<00:05:04.040> know<00:05:04.220> 80<00:05:04.820> minutes<00:05:05.210> left<00:05:05.390> or<00:05:05.630> something

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
don't know 80 minutes left or something

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.970 
don't know 80 minutes left or something
Oh<00:05:06.110> 64<00:05:06.980> minutes<00:05:07.190> good<00:05:07.790> that's<00:05:08.510> it's<00:05:09.170> just<00:05:09.470> the

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
Oh 64 minutes good that's it's just the

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.160 
Oh 64 minutes good that's it's just the
most<00:05:10.130> ridiculously<00:05:10.730> long<00:05:10.910> upload<00:05:11.330> times<00:05:11.570> and

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
most ridiculously long upload times and

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.040 
most ridiculously long upload times and
so<00:05:12.940> that's<00:05:13.940> sort<00:05:14.150> of<00:05:14.210> what<00:05:14.390> we've<00:05:14.540> been<00:05:14.750> trying

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
so that's sort of what we've been trying

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.600 
so that's sort of what we've been trying
to<00:05:15.140> figure<00:05:15.290> out<00:05:15.530> is<00:05:15.710> when<00:05:15.920> we<00:05:16.070> can<00:05:16.220> film<00:05:16.490> it

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
to figure out is when we can film it

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.520 
to figure out is when we can film it
because<00:05:17.030> I<00:05:17.270> also<00:05:17.600> have<00:05:17.900> to<00:05:17.990> go<00:05:18.110> back<00:05:18.290> this

we're gonna split it into two parts but

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.260 
we're gonna split it into two parts but
I<00:05:24.830> promise<00:05:25.310> you<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:25.670> mail<00:05:25.790> vlog<00:05:26.030> will<00:05:26.240> be

it's lighter than the other camera or

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.370 
it's lighter than the other camera or
something<00:05:44.270> so<00:05:44.450> like<00:05:44.660> have<00:05:44.870> it<00:05:44.960> on<00:05:45.080> my<00:05:45.200> lap

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
something so like have it on my lap

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.510 
something so like have it on my lap
while<00:05:45.590> I'm<00:05:45.680> sitting<00:05:45.920> on<00:05:45.980> the<00:05:46.100> couch<00:05:46.220> and<00:05:46.400> then

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
while I'm sitting on the couch and then

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.070 
while I'm sitting on the couch and then
I<00:05:46.550> stand<00:05:46.820> up<00:05:47.030> not<00:05:47.240> even<00:05:47.450> realizing<00:05:47.780> that<00:05:47.930> it's

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
I stand up not even realizing that it's

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.010 
I stand up not even realizing that it's
on<00:05:48.200> my<00:05:48.320> lap<00:05:49.040> and<00:05:49.580> that's<00:05:49.700> like<00:05:49.850> go<00:05:50.600> sliding

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
on my lap and that's like go sliding

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.540 
on my lap and that's like go sliding
across<00:05:51.230> the<00:05:51.320> floor<00:05:51.470> I<00:05:51.950> don't<00:05:52.310> think<00:05:52.460> this

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
across the floor I don't think this

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.460 
across the floor I don't think this
camera<00:05:52.850> wants<00:05:53.270> to<00:05:53.390> actually<00:05:53.540> work<00:05:53.960> but<00:05:54.320> it's

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
camera wants to actually work but it's

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:55.570 
camera wants to actually work but it's
holding<00:05:54.740> up<00:05:54.860> better<00:05:55.010> than<00:05:55.130> the<00:05:55.220> other<00:05:55.370> one<00:05:55.550> did

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
holding up better than the other one did

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.610 
holding up better than the other one did
because<00:05:55.940> that<00:05:55.970> one<00:05:56.270> dropped<00:05:56.480> once<00:05:56.750> and<00:05:57.050> broke

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
because that one dropped once and broke

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.590 
because that one dropped once and broke
this<00:05:58.250> one's<00:05:58.490> been<00:05:58.700> dropped<00:05:58.940> like<00:05:59.090> 60<00:05:59.450> times

this one's been dropped like 60 times

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.480 
this one's been dropped like 60 times
