 no matter how much we do 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.200
 let's be student entrepreneurs artists

 sportsmen no matter we all 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.100
 need motivation to be able to 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.810
 move forward in this first video 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.609
 I will tell you about the philosophy of 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.619
 baby then you know when we 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:56.630
 were bebela who took us three 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.659
 essential things and those things 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.909
 we use throughout 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.709
 our life just to be able to evolve 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.110
 to achieve our goals 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.520
 to be able to realize our dreams the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.829
 first thing that life taught us 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.369
 it's always having a goal to 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.040
 reach 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.730
 why because simply 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.700
 the man evolves 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.650
 when it is a term goal the 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.540
 second thing is always 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.549
 use the means we have in 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.090
 face of us to be able to reach this 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.129
 goal 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.590
 a lot of people say yes but 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.600
 I am waiting to go for ways the beautiful 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.819
 world there is no pure Mombris not 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.980
 good ways the right time on the 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.560
 world has realized that you have to 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.910
 change and the right way is the way 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.440
 that you have in front of you 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.780
 that's why to a sentence that says 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.090
 do what you want with the means that 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.889
 you have until you have better 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.130
 third thing that life taught me 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:51.650
 it's patience 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.280
 the first thing we said is to have 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.500
 an objective 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.090
 one of the first goals that life 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.540
 gave us when we were baby 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.710
 it's learning to walk 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.150
 life could have made sure that 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.620
 when we are led we arrive 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.990
 directly to walk but he did not 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.730
 did it like that he made sure that 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.560
 we were learning to walk because it 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.110
 wanted to show me that in all our 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.970
 life we ​​must always have 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.400
 goals to be achieved for the purpose 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.750
 evolve 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.700
 the second thing that life has us 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.530
 learned when we were db it's from 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.240
 always use the means that we 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.320
 have in front of us for 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.000
 achieve our goals 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.380
 the baby when he wants to walk 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.350
 what he does and it goes well 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.850
 use all objects every 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.700
 things he will find in front of him 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.010
 to try to stand up to 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.930
 start walking if a sofa in front 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.980
 from him he's going to hold the couch for 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.200
 try to stand up 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.180
 if there is a chair he will hold the chair 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.640
 six fires and well he will put himself 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.380
 standing using his bed no matter 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.360
 means no matter what things that goes 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.400
 prove in front of him he will try to 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.110
 use them to stand up and 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.480
 Coy has the arms of his mother and his father 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.480
 it's even better you see that 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.640
 life wanted 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.980
 make it clear that we need to 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.730
 always used the means that are in 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.950
 face of him 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.170
 the third thing that life has us 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.379
 learned when we were bbc1 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.480
 perseverance and we can find that 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.760
 in the baby also the baby when at 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.709
 this market goal and that left 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.400
 constant to stand up in order to 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.709
 can eat 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.750
 what is happening to him well he's going 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.580
 falling several times but each time 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.949
 that he falls he always ends up getting 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.490
 raise up he can fall without faith but 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.840
 will always end up getting up and when 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.610
 he is tired what is he doing and 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.530
 well he will sleep but the next day he 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.970
 will start again 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.460
 unfortunately we adults them 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.110
 when we encounter difficulties 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.820
 when we are in front of a door 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.840
 that closes when people put me 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.190
 the roadblocks 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.190
 when we meet chess 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.990
 the majority of them give up 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.220
 recoil drops because they think 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.410
 that they can not go until 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.420
 last did not understand that it is in 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.760
 persevering that we always end up 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.840
 arrive 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.400
 so why am I telling you all this 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.110
 it's just to tell you 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.010
 this 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.010
 never give up on your dream 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.599

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.240

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:16.470
