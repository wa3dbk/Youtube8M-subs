i'm teaching beginners how to knit

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.570 
i'm teaching beginners how to knit
simply<00:00:10.300> because<00:00:10.920> you're<00:00:11.920> essentially<00:00:12.250> using

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
simply because you're essentially using

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.160 
simply because you're essentially using
the<00:00:12.700> knit<00:00:12.880> stitch<00:00:13.059> to<00:00:13.389> cast<00:00:13.599> on<00:00:13.809> so<00:00:14.080> that

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.170 
the knit stitch to cast on so that

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.900 
the knit stitch to cast on so that
leaves<00:00:14.500> one<00:00:14.920> last<00:00:14.950> thing<00:00:15.429> for<00:00:15.490> you<00:00:15.700> to<00:00:15.730> have<00:00:15.820> to

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
leaves one last thing for you to have to

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.550 
leaves one last thing for you to have to
remember<00:00:16.270> when<00:00:16.540> you<00:00:16.660> actually<00:00:16.840> start<00:00:17.080> your

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
remember when you actually start your

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.530

knitting i also like using it because
it's<00:00:19.750> my<00:00:19.869> mom's<00:00:20.110> method<00:00:20.860> of<00:00:20.950> choice<00:00:21.099> and<00:00:21.520> I

00:00:24.299 --> 00:00:24.309 
enjoy my mom so what you need to do is

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:27.420 
enjoy my mom so what you need to do is
start<00:00:24.849> out<00:00:25.059> with<00:00:25.390> a<00:00:25.660> slip<00:00:26.200> knot<00:00:26.230> to<00:00:26.410> do<00:00:27.220> that

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
start out with a slip knot to do that

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.620 
start out with a slip knot to do that
you<00:00:28.300> take<00:00:28.509> your<00:00:28.689> yarn<00:00:28.869> and<00:00:29.770> you<00:00:29.890> create<00:00:30.220> a

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
you take your yarn and you create a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.840 
you take your yarn and you create a
little<00:00:31.630> loop<00:00:31.869> like<00:00:32.050> a<00:00:32.079> curse<00:00:32.380> of<00:00:32.590> e<00:00:32.860> as<00:00:33.550> you<00:00:33.700> can

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
little loop like a curse of e as you can

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.510 
little loop like a curse of e as you can
see<00:00:34.060> here<00:00:34.360> and<00:00:34.800> then<00:00:35.800> you<00:00:35.920> take<00:00:36.070> your<00:00:36.130> tail

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
see here and then you take your tail

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.370 
see here and then you take your tail
which<00:00:36.820> is<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.210> yarn<00:00:37.660> that's<00:00:37.840> not<00:00:38.080> connected

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
which is the yarn that's not connected

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.660 
which is the yarn that's not connected
to<00:00:38.590> the<00:00:38.680> skein<00:00:38.980> of<00:00:39.010> you<00:00:39.250> the<00:00:39.910> skin<00:00:40.210> end<00:00:40.480> and<00:00:40.780> you

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
to the skein of you the skin end and you

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.820 
to the skein of you the skin end and you
push<00:00:42.670> it<00:00:42.850> through<00:00:43.180> that<00:00:43.390> loop<00:00:43.630> you<00:00:44.500> don't<00:00:44.650> pull

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
push it through that loop you don't pull

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.640 
push it through that loop you don't pull
it<00:00:44.860> all<00:00:45.040> the<00:00:45.070> way<00:00:45.220> through<00:00:45.670> but<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:47.260> pull<00:00:47.560> it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
it all the way through but you pull it

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.080 
it all the way through but you pull it
so<00:00:47.800> you<00:00:47.860> see<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.370> loop<00:00:49.410> like<00:00:50.410> so<00:00:50.970> then<00:00:51.970> you

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
so you see the loop like so then you

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.120 
so you see the loop like so then you
take<00:00:52.300> your<00:00:52.480> needle<00:00:52.630> and<00:00:52.989> you<00:00:53.739> insert<00:00:54.100> it

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
take your needle and you insert it

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
take your needle and you insert it
through<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.670> loop<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.800> you<00:00:56.950> take<00:00:57.220> the<00:00:57.670> ends

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
through the loop and you take the ends

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.260 
through the loop and you take the ends
and<00:00:59.050> you<00:00:59.110> pull<00:00:59.410> it<00:00:59.590> so<00:00:59.770> it's<00:00:59.890> secure<00:01:00.370> you<00:01:01.120> want

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
and you pull it so it's secure you want

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.970 
and you pull it so it's secure you want
it<00:01:01.329> to<00:01:01.480> be<00:01:01.690> secure<00:01:02.170> but<00:01:02.200> not<00:01:02.500> so<00:01:02.739> tight<00:01:02.770> that

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
it to be secure but not so tight that

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.110 
it to be secure but not so tight that
you<00:01:03.160> can't<00:01:03.460> move<00:01:03.640> it<00:01:03.820> easily<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:05.199> and<00:01:05.470> down

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
you can't move it easily up and down

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.580 
you can't move it easily up and down
alright<00:01:07.120> so<00:01:07.330> now<00:01:07.479> it's<00:01:07.720> time<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.200> start<00:01:08.440> with

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
alright so now it's time to start with

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.940 
alright so now it's time to start with
the<00:01:08.710> actual<00:01:08.950> cast<00:01:09.250> on<00:01:10.560> you're<00:01:11.560> going<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:11.740> take

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
the actual cast on you're going to take

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.690 
the actual cast on you're going to take
your<00:01:11.979> other<00:01:12.220> needle<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:14.400> sort<00:01:15.400> it<00:01:15.460> through

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
your other needle and sort it through

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.280 
your other needle and sort it through
that<00:01:15.880> loop<00:01:16.120> that<00:01:16.390> you've<00:01:16.510> just<00:01:16.690> created<00:01:16.990> on

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
that loop that you've just created on

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.820 
that loop that you've just created on
the<00:01:18.659> left<00:01:19.659> hand<00:01:19.870> needle<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:23.380> see<00:01:23.530> I<00:01:23.560> have<00:01:23.799> my

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
the left hand needle you see I have my

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.640 
the left hand needle you see I have my
needles<00:01:24.250> in<00:01:24.370> a<00:01:24.430> little<00:01:24.670> X<00:01:24.909> like<00:01:25.270> this<00:01:25.650> you're

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
needles in a little X like this you're

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.469 
needles in a little X like this you're
going<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:27.220> wrap<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.729> yarn<00:01:27.760> around<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.210> back

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
going to wrap the yarn around the back

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:40.130 
going to wrap the yarn around the back
needle<00:01:34.320> dip<00:01:35.320> under<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:37.420> pull<00:01:37.659> that<00:01:37.810> loop<00:01:38.020> up

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
needle dip under and pull that loop up

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.330 
needle dip under and pull that loop up
so<00:01:41.140> you<00:01:41.200> see<00:01:41.409> you<00:01:41.500> have<00:01:41.619> another<00:01:41.799> loop<00:01:42.040> here

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
so you see you have another loop here

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.800 
so you see you have another loop here
now<00:01:42.670> you<00:01:42.729> want<00:01:42.940> to<00:01:43.000> get<00:01:43.090> this<00:01:43.270> sleep<00:01:43.540> on<00:01:43.690> the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
now you want to get this sleep on the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.020 
now you want to get this sleep on the
left<00:01:44.110> hand<00:01:44.530> needle<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:45.159> goal<00:01:45.310> is<00:01:45.490> is<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.729> have

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
left hand needle the goal is is to have

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.219 
left hand needle the goal is is to have
all<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.270> stitches<00:01:46.570> on<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:46.720> left<00:01:46.930> hand<00:01:47.080> needle

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
all the stitches on the left hand needle

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.050 
all the stitches on the left hand needle
so<00:01:47.530> you<00:01:47.590> dip<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:50.100> pull<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:51.130> off<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.640> you

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
so you dip it and pull it off and you

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.660 
so you dip it and pull it off and you
can<00:01:52.090> see<00:01:52.360> now<00:01:52.510> i<00:01:52.540> have<00:01:52.810> my<00:01:52.840> next<00:01:53.260> stitch

can see now i have my next stitch

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.219 
can see now i have my next stitch
alright<00:01:54.670> so<00:01:54.880> now<00:01:55.000> you've<00:01:55.240> created<00:01:55.810> your<00:01:55.990> first

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
alright so now you've created your first

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.870 
alright so now you've created your first
two<00:01:56.500> from<00:01:56.770> here<00:01:57.070> on<00:01:57.220> you're<00:01:57.369> going<00:01:57.490> to<00:01:57.549> just

two from here on you're going to just

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.880 
two from here on you're going to just
repeat<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.270> same<00:01:58.570> thing<00:01:58.720> again<00:01:58.960> and<00:01:59.020> again<00:01:59.350> by
