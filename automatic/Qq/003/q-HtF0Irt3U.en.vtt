00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.540
 hello I'm pillar guillÃ©n teacher of 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.370
 I welcome you to the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.800
 second class of intensive 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.630
 dactyloscopy in the first one we were 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.880
 seeing the general aspects we met 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.460
 that were the deltas the nuclei the 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.740
 systems the marginal nuclear limitations 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.039
 basilar etcetera and today we are going to learn 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.720
 to formulate its use and its formulation for 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.119
 that is going to serve this well to know 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.119
 identify a person we go there 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.399
 The Spanish dactyloscopic system is the 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.589
 we will continue to carry out 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.859
 our formulation and its formulation of 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:46.159
 those here achieve more if you remember in the 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.690
 first class we were talking about what 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:50.539
 we classified 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.640
 the fingers according to whether they had deltas or not 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.159
 had deltas according to the 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.710
 core of our dactylograms we are going to 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.289
 have four adult types dextro 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.239
 sinister cough cough ibi 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.789
 adults are those here achieves more 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.580
 who lack delta the dextro of cough 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:09.229
 are those that have a delta located at 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.569
 right of the observer always at 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.759
 regarding the nucleus the sinister of the cough 

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:16.069
 a delta to the left of the observer 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.799
 that is, the nucleus would remain to the other 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:21.080
 side and the seers when they have two or 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.330
 more celtas I want to make you one 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.580
 point and that is when we go to 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.130
 do the formulation let's take the 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.200
 imprints printed in this case will be 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.600
 inverted or flipped over 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.280
 our natural footprints is to say this 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.720
 it will be the natural footprint to remember 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.360
 we also saw it in the first class 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.489
 we will leave the impression and we will see it at 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.489
 backwards from its normal form 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.730
 adults as we said are those who do not 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.240
 they have delta but they are not going to have 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.700
 a marked or very observable figure of 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.280
 core there are of two types can be 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.950
 pure or pseudo high or pin and formes 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.100
 let's see them 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.899
 this is one of the pto if you realize not 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.259
 we have delta and we do not have a 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.849
 core figure of ridges like those that 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.090
 we saw in the previous ones in the form of 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.640
 rounded shape 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.680
 this would be a pure adult but also 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.569
 we can have a pseudo delta or delta 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.569
 pink and form in this case 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:29.040
 the crests and targets and up with 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.040
 Pine or tent form 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.650
 those extra high as we said 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.690
 a delta located to the right of the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.280
 person who is watching often 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.740
 be more frequent in the hands 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.020
 left 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.900
 and how are they so we have here 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.760
 the delta if I am observing it 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.490
 that you are watching him, you see 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.230
 which is to the right of the nucleus that is 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.740
 we have left under here 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.660
 yes we have a well-formed core 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.110
 by the hikes and ridges according to 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.470
 this little triangle would be the delta to the 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.470
 right 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.080
 the sinister of the cough the same but at 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.330
 otherwise we have a delta located at 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.010
 left of the person watching 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.159
 to be more frequent in the hands 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.159
 right 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.430
 in this case we would have it here I am 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.980
 observing the fingerprint the 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.980
 impression I'm left the core to the 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.300
 right and the delta on the left 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.300
 we have a sinister pto 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.670
 and finally the videos are those that 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.890
 they have two or more highs in good planes 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.530
 differentiated videos 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.209
 will have only two deltas but can 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.459
 be that they have three that are trident as 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.080
 pool and deltas etc. but always the 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.160
 we are going to include in the group of 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.160
 videos of agreement 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.659
 we would have here the nucleus in the center 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.159
 and two different deltas in planes 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.239
 differentiated 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.239
 from the left and from the right 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.990
 that's the general rule but it can be 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.820
 that we suffer from some type of anomaly 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.220
 fingerprint that can be either 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.130
 congenital or acquired in the course 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.500
 of time the congenital what are the 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.420
 pruning and polydactyly that is having more 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.700
 of five fingers in that case the finger 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.790
 excess would not be computed at the time of 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:28.000
 formulate the activity electro less 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.830
 of five fingers in the case in that case the 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.900
 missing finger is worth if for example 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.840
 was the index when formulating the 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.940
 index we would put a zero and the 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.550
 syndactylia have two or more fingers 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.950
 united in that case if we have them together 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.170
 around here but they leave us free 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.409
 of the dactylogram we would count them as if 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.839
 were two separate fingers 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.939
 acquired anomalies we have the pnc and 

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:52.099
 the ies that is the cheapening or the 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:54.509
 fingers without movement 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:57.940
 we would try to help the person to 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:05:00.350
 be able to capture your fingerprint 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.450
 surgical accident amputations 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.300
 etcetera we would put a zero on 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.740
 the place of that missing finger 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.110
 scars that are signals triggered 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.720
 for injuries for example we could put 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.850
 in case of illegibility an X or 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.650
 wear and tear by manipulation 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.290
 professional according to this can they 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.670
 be the exceptions to the types of 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.120
 normal ticos that we have seen at 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.120
 beginning 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.730
 and we entered with the formulation before 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.950
 nothing we will remember that the thumbs and 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.570
 the rest of the fingers were formulated 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.670
 other than the thumbs always with 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.340
 uppercase letters and the rest of fingers 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.410
 with numbers the adults with one for 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.930
 thumbs and with a 1 for the rest of 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.480
 fingers the dextro of the cough with a d for 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.700
 the thumb and for the rest with a 2 what 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.010
 sinister cough with an s for the 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.220
 thumb and with a 3 for the rest of fingers 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.890
 and the biden cough with a v of bertiz thread 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.410
 the rope for the thumb and with a 4 for 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.900
 the rest of fingers then having this 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.060
 clear we will see that we are going to represent 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.350
 the dactylograms of the 10 fingers of the 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:07.480
 hands in printed form 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.110
 we may have a dactylogram 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.220
 ambiguous or transitional they are called 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.130
 these are the ones that we for example 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.860
 we think that we are facing a delta but 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.120
 something also makes us think that yes 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.130
 there is a delta and that can be a 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.350
 sinister high then how 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.360
 formulate and masters if we are more 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.530
 convinced that it is one of the touch a 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.380
 sinister of the pto 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:32.300
 in the case of the thumb 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.009
 formulate and masters with a 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.860
 and how we think it can be a 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:39.360
 sinister high 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.699
 we would put a 3 as an exponent 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.319
 if it was the auricular finger that 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:45.530
 we think it 's a high one but also 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:48.870
 It may be a high loss 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:51.610
 we would put the 3 because you already know that the 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:55.590
 rest of fingers are formulated with numbers 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.590
 sorry we would put a 1 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:03.770
 and the 3 above agree 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:07.960
 well this would be for the case of the dark 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.960
 and achieves more ambiguous or transitional 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.240
 how abnormalities are formulated 

00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:15.610
 I have advanced it to the 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.830
 polydactyly principle not be 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.020
 keep in mind the finger over the 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.629
 activity electro we will put a zero 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.190
 the syndactyly just as if there were 

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:27.370
 separation as long as it's not 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:29.139
 possible in the case of acquired ones the 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.759
 pnc and the is will help in printing 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:33.580
 and if he could not because it is 

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:36.009
 illegible we would put an X in the case 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.599
 of the amputations a zero but if the 

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:39.550
 amputation is not total we will have to 

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:43.000
 indicate in letter that this amputation is 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:46.349
 partial and in the case of illegibility we 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.349
 we also go to the X 

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.410
 Y 

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.940
 Y 

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.800
 Y 

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.870
 to
