then I definitely recommend this tweet
this<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.069> staple<00:00:08.610> on<00:00:08.970> all<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.870> my<00:00:09.990> jailbroken

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
this is a staple on all of my jailbroken

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.339 
this is a staple on all of my jailbroken
devices<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.309> what<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.210> does<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.630> change<00:00:12.660> up

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
devices and what it does is change up

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.340 
devices and what it does is change up
your<00:00:13.590> animations<00:00:14.460> on<00:00:14.639> your<00:00:15.509> springboard

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
your animations on your springboard

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.900 
your animations on your springboard
right<00:00:16.529> here<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:16.890> every<00:00:17.100> time<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.580> switch

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
right here so every time that you switch

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.849 
right here so every time that you switch
a<00:00:18.029> page<00:00:18.300> it's<00:00:18.600> going<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.170> give<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.680> a

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
a page it's going to give you a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.710 
a page it's going to give you a
different<00:00:20.550> animation<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.180> can<00:00:21.210> set<00:00:21.570> this

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
different animation you can set this

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.859 
different animation you can set this
obviously<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:23.130> barrel<00:00:23.670> app<00:00:23.820> now<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
obviously in the barrel app now the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.150 
obviously in the barrel app now the
reason<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.199> I'm<00:00:25.380> covering<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.830> right<00:00:26.039> now

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
reason that I'm covering this right now

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.429 
reason that I'm covering this right now
because<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.490> actually<00:00:26.760> an<00:00:27.090> older<00:00:27.480> tweak

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
because this is actually an older tweak

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.349 
because this is actually an older tweak
but<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.740> was<00:00:28.890> updated<00:00:29.279> for<00:00:29.310> iOS<00:00:29.670> 7<00:00:29.970> as<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.240> can

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
but it was updated for iOS 7 as you can

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.990 
but it was updated for iOS 7 as you can
clearly<00:00:30.510> see<00:00:30.859> is<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.250> there<00:00:32.489> are<00:00:32.669> new

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
clearly see is that there are new

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.990 
clearly see is that there are new
animations<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.110> were<00:00:34.350> just<00:00:34.800> recently<00:00:35.460> added

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
animations that were just recently added

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.060 
animations that were just recently added
so<00:00:36.149> there's<00:00:36.329> actually<00:00:36.660> five<00:00:36.960> new<00:00:37.380> animations

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
so there's actually five new animations

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.770 
so there's actually five new animations
so<00:00:38.190> we're<00:00:38.280> going<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.430> go<00:00:38.640> through<00:00:38.879> all<00:00:39.030> five<00:00:39.750> of

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
so we're going to go through all five of

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.290 
so we're going to go through all five of
those<00:00:40.110> right<00:00:40.770> now<00:00:41.010> now<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> show<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.059> guys

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
these are all the different animations

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.170 
these are all the different animations

which are all brand new these four were

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.470 
which are all brand new these four were
updated<00:00:49.829> today<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.370> wave<00:00:50.910> was<00:00:51.120> actually

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
updated today and wave was actually

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.290 
updated today and wave was actually
updated<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.379> few<00:00:53.219> days<00:00:53.370> ago<00:00:53.520> maybe<00:00:53.850> last<00:00:54.120> week

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
updated a few days ago maybe last week

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.670 
updated a few days ago maybe last week
but<00:00:54.629> I'm<00:00:54.719> going<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.899> show<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.140> all<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.559> these

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
but I'm going to show you all of these

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.709 
but I'm going to show you all of these
so<00:00:56.190> let's<00:00:56.430> go<00:00:56.550> ahead<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.730> check<00:00:56.969> out<00:00:57.120> wave<00:00:57.420> to

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
so let's go ahead and check out wave to

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.720 
so let's go ahead and check out wave to
begin<00:00:58.020> with<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:58.920> see<00:00:59.100> exactly<00:00:59.430> what

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
begin with and you can see exactly what

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.020 
begin with and you can see exactly what
that<00:00:59.850> does<00:01:01.129> so<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.370> see<00:01:02.579> they<00:01:02.760> move

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
that does so you can see they move

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.630 
that does so you can see they move
exactly<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:04.500> line<00:01:04.769> at<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> time<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:07.520> you<00:01:08.520> can

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
exactly one line at a time and you can

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.630 
exactly one line at a time and you can
see<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.909> fading<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.570> like<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:10.640> so

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
see it fading in just like that so

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.359 
see it fading in just like that so
pretty<00:01:11.939> cool<00:01:12.380> little<00:01:13.380> animation<00:01:13.650> right<00:01:14.159> there

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
pretty cool little animation right there

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.160 
pretty cool little animation right there
so<00:01:15.060> now<00:01:15.090> let's<00:01:15.450> check<00:01:15.509> out<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.900> next<00:01:16.020> one

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
so now let's check out the next one

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.950 
so now let's check out the next one
which<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.890> going<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.369> be<00:01:17.490> icon<00:01:18.060> roll<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.570> this

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
which is going to be icon roll and this

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.289 
which is going to be icon roll and this
one's<00:01:19.140> actually<00:01:19.470> pretty<00:01:19.500> cool<00:01:19.860> too<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:21.119> let's

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
one's actually pretty cool too so let's

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.810 
one's actually pretty cool too so let's
check<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.600> out

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
check that out

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.710 
check that out
and<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.090> see<00:01:24.299> they<00:01:24.509> basically<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.229> do<00:01:25.439> a

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
and you can see they basically just do a

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.350 
and you can see they basically just do a
roll<00:01:27.720> over<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> next<00:01:28.860> page<00:01:29.130> one<00:01:29.970> complete

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
roll over to the next page one complete

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.190 
roll over to the next page one complete
roll<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.409> next<00:01:31.650> one<00:01:31.799> we<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.130> here<00:01:32.460> is

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
roll and the next one we have here is

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.330 
roll and the next one we have here is
called<00:01:34.200> vortex<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:34.890> was<00:01:35.009> actually

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
called vortex and this was actually

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.310 
called vortex and this was actually
pretty<00:01:35.520> cool<00:01:35.700> too<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:35.939> can<00:01:36.210> see<00:01:36.420> once<00:01:37.079> it

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
pretty cool too you can see once it

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.160 
pretty cool too you can see once it
starts<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.189> take<00:01:38.820> effect<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.479> actually<00:01:39.509> fades

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
starts to take effect it actually fades

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.770 
starts to take effect it actually fades
in<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.710> next<00:01:41.040> page<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.700> then<00:01:42.150> rolls<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.630> of

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
in the next page and then rolls out of

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.740 
in the next page and then rolls out of
it<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.790> see<00:01:45.000> right<00:01:45.180> there<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.479> it

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
it so you can see right there that it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.990 
it so you can see right there that it
makes<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.079> circle<00:01:46.799> right<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.399> screen<00:01:47.729> and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
makes a circle right on the screen and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.510 
makes a circle right on the screen and
then<00:01:48.090> fades<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.720> other<00:01:49.140> icons<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.950> they

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
then fades in the other icons and they

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.590 
then fades in the other icons and they
expand<00:01:51.000> out<00:01:51.240> at<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:52.079> end<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.380> animation

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
expand out at the end of the animation

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.090 
expand out at the end of the animation
alright<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:54.750> now<00:01:54.869> let's<00:01:55.110> check<00:01:55.290> out<00:01:55.500> shrink

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
alright so now let's check out shrink

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.100 
alright so now let's check out shrink
and<00:01:56.280> shrink<00:01:57.149> completely<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.810> these<00:01:57.960> are

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
and shrink completely so these are

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.410 
and shrink completely so these are
basically<00:01:58.469> pretty<00:01:59.100> close<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> same<00:02:00.360> thing

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
basically pretty close to the same thing

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.300 
basically pretty close to the same thing
but<00:02:01.259> they<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> little<00:02:02.100> bit<00:02:02.219> different

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
but they do have a little bit different

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.160 
but they do have a little bit different
aspect<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.210> can<00:02:03.329> see<00:02:03.479> exactly<00:02:03.780> what<00:02:04.049> this

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
aspect so you can see exactly what this

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.100 
aspect so you can see exactly what this
does<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.579> makes<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.909> icons<00:02:06.329> much<00:02:06.719> smaller

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
does is it makes the icons much smaller

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.770 
does is it makes the icons much smaller
and<00:02:07.290> then<00:02:07.409> continues<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:07.979> fade<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.450> next

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
and then continues to fade in the next

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.380 
and then continues to fade in the next
page<00:02:10.080> before<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.220> icons<00:02:11.730> are<00:02:11.910> completely

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
page before the icons are completely

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.970 
page before the icons are completely
gone<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.290> could<00:02:13.410> probably

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
gone so you could probably

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.760 
gone so you could probably
guess<00:02:14.190> what<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.300> shrink<00:02:16.110> completely<00:02:16.560> does

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
guess what the shrink completely does

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.009 
guess what the shrink completely does
and<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.430> makes<00:02:17.640> those<00:02:17.879> shrink<00:02:18.480> completely

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
and it makes those shrink completely

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.650 
and it makes those shrink completely
before<00:02:19.379> the<00:02:19.530> next<00:02:19.739> page<00:02:20.120> starts<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.239> fade<00:02:21.450> in

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
before the next page starts to fade in

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.259 
before the next page starts to fade in
as<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.140> can<00:02:22.290> see<00:02:22.470> right<00:02:22.650> there<00:02:23.269> but

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
as you can see right there but

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.900 
as you can see right there but
