don't<00:01:23.820> know<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.030> seems<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.509> simpler<00:01:25.380> game

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650

of<00:01:25.920> course<00:01:26.280> simpler<00:01:26.700> than<00:01:26.909> dungeon<00:01:27.509> dice<00:01:27.540> but

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
