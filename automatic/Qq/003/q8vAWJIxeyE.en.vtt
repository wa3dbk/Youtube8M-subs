there<00:00:01.530> are<00:00:01.650> many<00:00:01.800> ways<00:00:02.040> in<00:00:02.340> which<00:00:02.389> things<00:00:03.389> may

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
there are many ways in which things may

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.030 
there are many ways in which things may
be<00:00:03.629> transported<00:00:04.319> across<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.830> cell<00:00:05.009> membrane

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
be transported across the cell membrane

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.670 
be transported across the cell membrane
such<00:00:05.580> as<00:00:05.819> diffusion<00:00:06.569> active<00:00:07.140> transport

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
such as diffusion active transport

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.850 
such as diffusion active transport
facilitated<00:00:08.370> diffusion<00:00:08.519> etc<00:00:09.389> however<00:00:10.230> one<00:00:10.829> of

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
facilitated diffusion etc however one of

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.489 
facilitated diffusion etc however one of
these<00:00:11.039> is<00:00:11.339> the<00:00:11.789> process<00:00:12.239> of<00:00:12.360> bulk<00:00:12.780> transport

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:13.499 
these is the process of bulk transport

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:17.120 
these is the process of bulk transport
where<00:00:14.459> the<00:00:15.089> cell<00:00:15.749> will<00:00:16.020> use<00:00:16.199> its<00:00:16.440> membrane<00:00:16.830> to

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
where the cell will use its membrane to

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.999 
where the cell will use its membrane to
engulf<00:00:17.519> something<00:00:18.359> outside<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.019> cell<00:00:19.259> there

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:20.009 
engulf something outside the cell there

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.159 
engulf something outside the cell there
are<00:00:20.130> different<00:00:20.460> forms<00:00:20.759> of<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.419> one

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:22.169 
are different forms of this in one

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.519 
are different forms of this in one
process<00:00:22.500> known<00:00:23.310> as<00:00:23.339> pinocytosis<00:00:24.289> the<00:00:25.289> cell

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
process known as pinocytosis the cell

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.710 
process known as pinocytosis the cell
membrane<00:00:26.009> will<00:00:26.249> pinch<00:00:26.640> inward<00:00:26.999> and<00:00:27.210> engulf

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
membrane will pinch inward and engulf

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.749 
membrane will pinch inward and engulf
simply<00:00:28.439> some<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> surrounding<00:00:29.490> cell

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
simply some of the surrounding cell

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.990 
simply some of the surrounding cell
fluid<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.900> happens<00:00:31.380> quite<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.220> great<00:00:32.489> deal<00:00:32.520> as

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
fluid this happens quite a great deal as

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.660 
fluid this happens quite a great deal as
especially<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.230> cells<00:00:34.500> lining<00:00:34.829> blood<00:00:35.219> vessels

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
especially in cells lining blood vessels

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.540 
especially in cells lining blood vessels
so<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.300> pinocytosis<00:00:36.770> has<00:00:37.770> been<00:00:38.039> compared<00:00:38.460> to

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
so this pinocytosis has been compared to

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.910 
so this pinocytosis has been compared to

engulf<00:00:52.280> indecisive<00:00:53.359> is<00:00:54.359> caused<00:00:54.899> when

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
engulf indecisive is caused when

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.250 
engulf indecisive is caused when
receptors<00:00:56.280> bind<00:00:56.730> their<00:00:57.059> ligands<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.929> so<00:00:58.050> that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
receptors bind their ligands and so that

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.340 
receptors bind their ligands and so that
the<00:00:58.440> area<00:00:58.800> where<00:00:59.129> specific<00:01:00.089> ligands<00:01:00.359> exist<00:01:01.109> is

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the area where specific ligands exist is

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.619 
the area where specific ligands exist is
the<00:01:01.859> area<00:01:02.160> which<00:01:02.339> is<00:01:02.579> then<00:01:02.910> brought<00:01:03.210> into<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the area which is then brought into the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.160 
the area which is then brought into the
cell<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.929> form<00:01:04.410> a<00:01:04.530> vesicle<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.580> for<00:01:05.820> example<00:01:06.330> if

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
cell to form a vesicle so for example if

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.090 
cell to form a vesicle so for example if
there<00:01:07.620> are<00:01:07.650> LDL<00:01:08.580> receptors<00:01:09.560> for<00:01:10.560> LDL

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
there are LDL receptors for LDL

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.760 
there are LDL receptors for LDL
particles<00:01:11.640> which<00:01:11.790> transport<00:01:12.330> lipids<00:01:12.770> when

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
particles which transport lipids when

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.400 
particles which transport lipids when
LDL<00:01:14.250> particles<00:01:14.820> bind<00:01:15.150> their<00:01:15.390> receptors<00:01:15.960> this

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
LDL particles bind their receptors this

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.980 
LDL particles bind their receptors this
can<00:01:16.680> stimulate<00:01:16.920> then<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.060> engulfing<00:01:18.720> or<00:01:18.870> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
can stimulate then the engulfing or the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.440 
can stimulate then the engulfing or the
endocytosis<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:20.160> this<00:01:20.460> region<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.390> is

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
endocytosis of this region this is

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.430 
endocytosis of this region this is
receptor<00:01:22.260> mediated<00:01:22.410> endocytosis<00:01:24.440> bulk

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.890 
receptor mediated endocytosis bulk
transport<00:01:26.010> may<00:01:26.430> also<00:01:26.670> allow<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.420> cell<00:01:27.690> to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
transport may also allow a cell to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.550 
transport may also allow a cell to

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
engulf a large solid object so it is a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.830 
engulf a large solid object so it is a
large<00:01:31.920> solid<00:01:32.280> object<00:01:32.880> which<00:01:32.940> binds<00:01:33.630> a

large solid object which binds a
receptor<00:01:34.410> and<00:01:34.620> then<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.520> cell<00:01:35.730> membrane<00:01:36.060> will

microglia and the brain could engulf

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.230 
microglia and the brain could engulf
this<00:01:42.750> but<00:01:43.530> then<00:01:43.680> osteo<00:01:44.220> class<00:01:44.280> may<00:01:44.880> do<00:01:45.060> this

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
this but then osteo class may do this

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.500 
this but then osteo class may do this

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.740 
with bone fragments and as it dissolves
bone<00:01:48.870> and<00:01:49.550> there<00:01:50.550> are<00:01:50.700> cells<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.540> liver
