spawn<00:00:25.970> in<00:00:26.000> a<00:00:26.450> mega<00:00:27.080> taiga<00:00:27.500> I<00:00:27.529> find<00:00:27.740> like<00:00:27.859> right

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
spawn in a mega taiga I find like right

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.640 
spawn in a mega taiga I find like right
on<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:28.130> edge<00:00:28.279> of<00:00:28.550> a<00:00:29.060> mega<00:00:29.990> taiga<00:00:30.699> biome<00:00:31.699> and<00:00:32.059> a

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
on the edge of a mega taiga biome and a

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.380 
on the edge of a mega taiga biome and a
kind<00:00:33.650> of<00:00:33.739> like<00:00:33.830> regular<00:00:34.129> taiga<00:00:34.430> biome<00:00:34.550> so<00:00:34.850> he's

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
kind of like regular taiga biome so he's

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.939 
kind of like regular taiga biome so he's
pulling<00:00:35.720> right<00:00:35.960> here<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:36.410> there's<00:00:36.680> like<00:00:36.860> the

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
pulling right here and there's like the

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.590 
pulling right here and there's like the
irregular<00:00:37.309> taiga<00:00:37.519> biome<00:00:37.730> then<00:00:38.269> it<00:00:38.390> kind<00:00:38.540> of

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
irregular taiga biome then it kind of

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.180 
irregular taiga biome then it kind of
transition<00:00:39.080> into<00:00:39.290> like<00:00:39.410> a<00:00:39.440> regular<00:00:39.620> forest

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
transition into like a regular forest

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.950 
transition into like a regular forest
back<00:00:40.400> there<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:40.850> then<00:00:41.300> you<00:00:41.390> go<00:00:41.540> right<00:00:41.570> behind

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
back there and then you go right behind

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
is right up here and this is the biome

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.660 
is right up here and this is the biome
guys<00:00:57.050> and<00:00:57.469> these<00:00:57.649> biomes<00:00:58.129> are<00:00:58.250> awesome

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
guys and these biomes are awesome

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.700 
guys and these biomes are awesome
they're<00:00:58.789> huge<00:00:59.120> and<00:00:59.300> they're<00:00:59.809> very<00:00:59.989> unique<00:01:00.230> to

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
they're huge and they're very unique to

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.229 
they're huge and they're very unique to
a<00:01:00.739> clicking<00:01:01.280> party<00:01:01.460> the<00:01:01.550> other<00:01:01.610> biomes<00:01:02.030> are

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
a clicking party the other biomes are

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.689 
a clicking party the other biomes are
sick<00:01:02.510> and<00:01:02.930> I<00:01:03.320> think<00:01:03.770> this<00:01:03.949> biome<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.520> ice

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
sick and I think this biome and the ice

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.850 
sick and I think this biome and the ice
bikes<00:01:05.030> biome<00:01:05.390> are<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:06.050> most<00:01:06.229> like<00:01:06.530> unique

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
bikes biome are the most like unique

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.400 
bikes biome are the most like unique
biomes<00:01:07.220> that<00:01:07.399> have<00:01:07.930> I've<00:01:08.930> been<00:01:09.110> in<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.259> game

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
biomes that have I've been in the game

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.080 
biomes that have I've been in the game
so<00:01:09.740> we'll<00:01:09.890> go<00:01:10.009> ahead<00:01:10.039> and<00:01:10.250> we'll<00:01:10.670> kind<00:01:10.880> of<00:01:10.940> fly

these<00:01:22.549> biomes<00:01:22.909> are<00:01:23.090> giant<00:01:23.689> which<00:01:24.290> is<00:01:24.409> why

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
these biomes are giant which is why

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.170 
these biomes are giant which is why
they're<00:01:24.799> called<00:01:25.040> megataiga<00:01:25.490> biomes<00:01:25.909> and

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
they're called megataiga biomes and

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.359 
they're called megataiga biomes and
there's<00:01:26.390> also<00:01:26.540> these<00:01:26.750> amazing<00:01:27.439> cobblestone

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
real quick there's caves and stuff full

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.850 
real quick there's caves and stuff full
of<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.119> plates<00:01:47.299> too<00:01:47.479> great<00:01:47.780> weren't<00:01:48.710> robably

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
of the plates too great weren't robably

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.530 
of the plates too great weren't robably
one<00:01:49.009> of<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.159> best<00:01:49.310> megataiga<00:01:49.909> seeds<00:01:50.360> I've

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
one of the best megataiga seeds I've

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.630 
one of the best megataiga seeds I've
seen<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.140> spawn<00:01:52.070> pretty<00:01:52.280> much<00:01:52.400> right

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
seen and you spawn pretty much right

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.280 
seen and you spawn pretty much right
inside<00:01:53.000> of<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:53.360> it's<00:01:53.509> it's<00:01:53.810> a<00:01:53.930> great<00:01:54.140> deal

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
inside of it so it's it's a great deal

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.929 
inside of it so it's it's a great deal
right<00:01:54.320> there<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:54.890> I<00:01:55.369> already<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:55.670> can<00:01:55.790> see

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
right there and I already you can see

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.370 
right there and I already you can see
there's<00:01:56.090> wolves<00:01:56.299> there's<00:01:56.659> wolves<00:01:56.810> there<00:01:57.110> a

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
there's wolves there's wolves there a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.590 
there's wolves there's wolves there a
bunch<00:01:57.950> of<00:01:58.070> them<00:01:58.189> there<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:58.729> they're<00:01:59.180> all<00:01:59.360> over

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
bunch of them there and they're all over

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.810 
bunch of them there and they're all over
the<00:01:59.720> sea<00:01:59.930> because<00:02:00.259> I'm<00:02:00.530> not<00:02:00.710> sure<00:02:00.950> why<00:02:01.159> but

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
the sea because I'm not sure why but

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.520 
the sea because I'm not sure why but
wolves<00:02:02.149> really<00:02:02.360> like<00:02:02.570> to<00:02:02.659> go<00:02:02.720> spawn<00:02:03.079> in<00:02:03.380> these

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
wolves really like to go spawn in these

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.319 
wolves really like to go spawn in these
seeds<00:02:03.799> and<00:02:03.979> I'm<00:02:04.100> spawning<00:02:04.430> this<00:02:04.640> one<00:02:04.880> the

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
seeds and I'm spawning this one the

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.179 
seeds and I'm spawning this one the
tiger<00:02:05.570> biomes<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.200> forests<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:06.979> snow

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.100 
tiger biomes the forests and the snow
biomes<00:02:07.520> but<00:02:08.269> they<00:02:08.329> tend<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.540> spawn<00:02:08.840> in<00:02:08.989> this

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
biomes but they tend to spawn in this

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.770 
biomes but they tend to spawn in this
one<00:02:09.290> a<00:02:09.320> lot<00:02:09.649> it's<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:09.920> little<00:02:10.070> more<00:02:10.369> kind<00:02:10.519> of<00:02:10.780> fly

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
one a lot it's a little more kind of fly

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.270

these guys all kind of turn around

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.910 
these guys all kind of turn around
actually<00:02:20.900> it's<00:02:21.170> not<00:02:21.260> really<00:02:21.319> gonna<00:02:21.530> load

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
actually it's not really gonna load

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.500 
actually it's not really gonna load
but<00:02:22.520> they<00:02:22.610> make<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.849> taiga<00:02:23.030> biome<00:02:23.240> sir

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
but they make it taiga biome sir

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.420 
but they make it taiga biome sir
probably<00:02:23.780> want<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:23.930> be<00:02:24.020> best-looking<00:02:24.860> biomes

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
probably want to be best-looking biomes

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.220 
probably want to be best-looking biomes
that<00:02:25.670> have<00:02:25.790> been<00:02:25.910> added<00:02:26.660> into<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.900> game<00:02:26.930> guys
