hello my name is brianna and I'm going
to<00:00:02.669> be<00:00:02.760> teaching<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:03.360> short<00:00:03.780> short<00:00:04.290> lesson<00:00:04.770> on

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
to be teaching a short short lesson on

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.509 
to be teaching a short short lesson on
the<00:00:05.400> dihybrid<00:00:05.670> cross<00:00:06.560> okay<00:00:07.560> dihybrid<00:00:08.189> cross

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
the dihybrid cross okay dihybrid cross

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.180 
the dihybrid cross okay dihybrid cross
is<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:09.570> hybrid<00:00:09.750> ation<00:00:10.200> using<00:00:10.530> two<00:00:10.679> traits<00:00:10.980> with

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
is a hybrid ation using two traits with

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.950 
is a hybrid ation using two traits with
two<00:00:11.309> alleles<00:00:11.700> each<00:00:13.250> here<00:00:14.250> are<00:00:14.340> some<00:00:14.460> facts<00:00:14.960> it

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
two alleles each here are some facts it

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.540 
two alleles each here are some facts it
is<00:00:16.109> usually<00:00:16.470> used<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.770> test<00:00:16.920> dominant<00:00:17.430> and

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
is usually used to test dominant and

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.390 
is usually used to test dominant and
recessive<00:00:17.609> traits<00:00:18.830> this<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:19.980> what<00:00:20.130> Mendel

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
recessive traits this is what Mendel

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.029 
recessive traits this is what Mendel
invented<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.470> is<00:00:22.470> also<00:00:22.680> known<00:00:22.920> as

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
invented and is also known as

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.689 
invented and is also known as
crossbreeding<00:00:23.550> Mendel<00:00:24.680> crossbred<00:00:25.680> peas<00:00:26.279> to

crossbreeding Mendel crossbred peas to

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.580 
crossbreeding Mendel crossbred peas to
see<00:00:27.269> their<00:00:27.510> dominant<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.019> recessive<00:00:28.080> traits

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
see their dominant and recessive traits

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.410 
see their dominant and recessive traits
and<00:00:29.840> with<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.399> crossbreeding<00:00:32.399> there<00:00:33.000> are<00:00:33.090> 16

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
and with this crossbreeding there are 16

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.119 
and with this crossbreeding there are 16
possible<00:00:33.570> genotypes<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:36.210> ratio<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.809> 9<00:00:37.739> 23

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
possible genotypes and the ratio is 9 23

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.450 
possible genotypes and the ratio is 9 23
3<00:00:38.879> 2<00:00:39.000> 3<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.450> 3<00:00:39.629> 2<00:00:39.750> 1<00:00:40.640> so<00:00:41.640> now<00:00:41.940> I'm<00:00:42.090> going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:43.460> make

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
3 2 3 and 3 2 1 so now I'm going to make

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.069 
3 2 3 and 3 2 1 so now I'm going to make
a<00:00:44.489> chart<00:00:44.820> for<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.090> guys<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.930> should

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
a chart for you guys and you should

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.459 
a chart for you guys and you should
probably<00:00:46.700> take<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:47.940> an<00:00:48.059> example<00:00:48.469> so

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
probably take this as an example so

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.100 
probably take this as an example so
these<00:00:49.649> four<00:00:49.950> across<00:00:50.190> here<00:00:50.750> this<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.930> one

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
these four across here this is one

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.790 
these four across here this is one
parent<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.210> guess<00:00:54.510> I'll<00:00:54.780> call<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.230> parent

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
parent so I guess I'll call and parent

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.020 
parent so I guess I'll call and parent
number<00:00:56.039> one

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
number one

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.779 
number one
and<00:00:58.239> these<00:00:58.750> down<00:00:59.020> here<00:00:59.430> parent<00:01:00.430> number<00:01:00.640> to

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
and these down here parent number to

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:07.499 
and these down here parent number to
each<00:01:03.420> parent<00:01:04.420> has<00:01:04.570> four<00:01:05.049> apparently<00:01:05.920> okay<00:01:06.610> so

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
each parent has four apparently okay so

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.170 
each parent has four apparently okay so
now<00:01:08.470> what<00:01:09.040> we're<00:01:09.190> going<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:09.400> do<00:01:09.520> I<00:01:09.790> guess<00:01:10.030> if

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
now what we're going to do I guess if

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.100 
now what we're going to do I guess if
you<00:01:10.299> can<00:01:10.450> call<00:01:10.600> it<00:01:10.659> almost<00:01:10.930> like<00:01:11.049> a

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
you can call it almost like a

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.480 
you can call it almost like a
multiplication<00:01:11.560> chart<00:01:11.890> you're<00:01:12.310> going<00:01:12.430> to

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
multiplication chart you're going to

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.870 
multiplication chart you're going to
take<00:01:12.610> this<00:01:12.790> and<00:01:13.119> this<00:01:13.270> and<00:01:13.540> you'll<00:01:13.780> get<00:01:13.930> this

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
take this and this and you'll get this

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.980 
take this and this and you'll get this
so<00:01:15.990> these<00:01:16.990> two<00:01:17.259> will<00:01:17.440> turn<00:01:17.590> out<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.830> be<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:18.190> a<00:01:18.990> B

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
so these two will turn out to be a a B

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.940 
so these two will turn out to be a a B
b-but<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.970> will<00:01:22.090> turn<00:01:22.240> into<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:26.740> will

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
b-but it will turn into a be this will

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.029 
b-but it will turn into a be this will
be<00:01:27.310> a<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:30.700> lowercase<00:01:31.630> B<00:01:32.020> which<00:01:32.679> will<00:01:32.860> also

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
be a a be lowercase B which will also

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.169 
be a a be lowercase B which will also
turn<00:01:33.280> out<00:01:33.369> to<00:01:33.490> be<00:01:33.580> capital<00:01:33.970> a<00:01:34.090> capital<00:01:34.360> B<00:01:36.179> this

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
turn out to be capital a capital B this

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.410 
turn out to be capital a capital B this
will<00:01:37.360> be<00:01:37.450> a<00:01:37.710> lowercase<00:01:38.710> a<00:01:39.270> capital<00:01:40.270> B<00:01:40.390> capital

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
will be a lowercase a capital B capital

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.580 
will be a lowercase a capital B capital
B<00:01:41.289> and<00:01:41.819> also<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.960> will<00:01:44.050> turn<00:01:44.200> out<00:01:44.259> to<00:01:44.470> be

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
B and also it will turn out to be

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.480 
B and also it will turn out to be
capital<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.610> capital<00:01:45.759> B<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:47.220> then<00:01:48.220> these<00:01:48.429> two

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
capital and capital B and then these two

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.930 
capital and capital B and then these two
would<00:01:49.270> turn<00:01:49.450> out<00:01:49.479> to<00:01:49.750> be<00:01:49.920> capital<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:51.069> lowercase

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
would turn out to be capital a lowercase

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.200 
would turn out to be capital a lowercase
a<00:01:52.240> capital<00:01:52.990> be<00:01:53.110> lowercase<00:01:53.830> B<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:54.460> this<00:01:55.000> will

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
a capital be lowercase B and this will

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.930 
a capital be lowercase B and this will
also<00:01:55.420> turn<00:01:55.960> out<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.229> be<00:01:56.350> capital<00:01:56.830> a<00:01:56.979> capital<00:01:57.250> B

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
also turn out to be capital a capital B

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.459 
also turn out to be capital a capital B
so<00:01:58.780> these<00:01:58.929> are<00:01:59.110> basically<00:01:59.530> what<00:02:00.429> you<00:02:00.580> want<00:02:01.469> now

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
so these are basically what you want now

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.130 
so these are basically what you want now
we're<00:02:02.590> going<00:02:02.680> to<00:02:02.740> do<00:02:02.950> this<00:02:03.430> and<00:02:03.729> that

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
we're going to do this and that

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.040 
we're going to do this and that
so<00:02:06.830> these<00:02:07.580> two<00:02:07.729> together<00:02:07.850> would<00:02:08.179> be<00:02:08.210> capital<00:02:08.899> a

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
so these two together would be capital a

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.090 
so these two together would be capital a
capital<00:02:09.319> a<00:02:09.830> capital<00:02:10.180> B<00:02:11.180> lowercase<00:02:11.690> B<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.230> as

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
capital a capital B lowercase B and as

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.890 
capital a capital B lowercase B and as
you<00:02:13.220> can<00:02:13.370> see<00:02:13.930> this<00:02:14.930> is<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.830> same<00:02:16.280> as<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:17.690> one

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
you can see this is the same as this one

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.600 
you can see this is the same as this one
so<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:19.100> get<00:02:19.280> capital<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.910> capital<00:02:19.940> B<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:21.610> then

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
so you get capital a capital B and then

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.000 
so you get capital a capital B and then
this<00:02:22.850> is<00:02:24.610> capital<00:02:25.610> a<00:02:25.760> capital<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.900> lowercase<00:02:27.650> B

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
this is capital a capital a lowercase B

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.480 
this is capital a capital a lowercase B
lowercase<00:02:28.459> B<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:30.260> get<00:02:30.500> for<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.310> first

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
lowercase B and you get for the first

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.540 
lowercase B and you get for the first
time<00:02:32.110> capital<00:02:33.110> a<00:02:33.260> lowercase<00:02:33.680> B<00:02:36.100> for<00:02:37.100> these<00:02:37.220> you

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
time capital a lowercase B for these you

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.510 
time capital a lowercase B for these you
get<00:02:37.760> capital<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.750> lowercase<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.860> capital<00:02:40.400> B

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:29.820 
so you guys all want these if you want
I'll<00:03:59.239> list<00:03:59.450> them<00:03:59.599> real<00:03:59.810> quick

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.740 

now<00:04:30.430> if<00:04:30.580> you're<00:04:30.730> wondering<00:04:30.760> about<00:04:31.210> this<00:04:31.480> ratio

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
now if you're wondering about this ratio

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.160 
now if you're wondering about this ratio
it's<00:04:32.290> saying<00:04:32.920> that<00:04:33.040> they<00:04:33.250> would<00:04:33.400> be<00:04:33.490> 9<00:04:33.910> of<00:04:34.240> one

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
it's saying that they would be 9 of one

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:41.070 
it's saying that they would be 9 of one
so<00:04:35.740> if<00:04:36.640> i'm<00:04:36.820> correct<00:04:38.100> one<00:04:39.100> two<00:04:39.730> three<00:04:40.480> four

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
so if i'm correct one two three four

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.940 
so if i'm correct one two three four
five<00:04:42.630> six<00:04:43.830> seven<00:04:44.830> eight<00:04:45.540> and<00:04:46.540> nine<00:04:46.920> so<00:04:47.920> that's

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
five six seven eight and nine so that's

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.220 
five six seven eight and nine so that's
the<00:04:48.250> nine<00:04:48.630> then<00:04:49.630> there's<00:04:49.810> going<00:04:49.930> to<00:04:49.990> be<00:04:50.020> three

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
the nine then there's going to be three

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.900 
the nine then there's going to be three
of<00:04:50.380> another

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:06.350 

one<00:04:53.630> two<00:04:54.290> three<00:04:56.950> okay

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.399 

and<00:05:06.629> there's<00:05:07.199> going<00:05:07.349> to<00:05:07.409> be<00:05:07.439> three<00:05:07.710> of<00:05:07.830> another

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409

and there's going to be three of another
which<00:05:10.409> is<00:05:11.870> one<00:05:13.400> two<00:05:14.750> three<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:16.020> then<00:05:16.469> one<00:05:16.949> of
