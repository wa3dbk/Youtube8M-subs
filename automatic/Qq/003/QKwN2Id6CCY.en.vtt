00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
all right this is the last startup for

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.379 
all right this is the last startup for
now<00:00:04.609> nothing<00:00:05.609> else<00:00:05.759> has<00:00:05.940> guessed<00:00:06.240> so<00:00:08.389> not

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
now nothing else has guessed so not

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.910 
now nothing else has guessed so not
gonna<00:00:09.570> bother<00:00:09.750> putting<00:00:10.200> guessing<00:00:10.650> until<00:00:10.769> I

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
gonna bother putting guessing until I

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.279 
gonna bother putting guessing until I
actually<00:00:11.040> need<00:00:11.370> them<00:00:12.200> the<00:00:13.370> older<00:00:15.139> 1960s<00:00:16.139> or

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
actually need them the older 1960s or

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.380 
actually need them the older 1960s or
whenever<00:00:17.090> 50s<00:00:18.090> maybe<00:00:18.439> 60s<00:00:19.439> probably<00:00:20.240> see<00:00:21.240> or

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
whenever 50s maybe 60s probably see or

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.310 
whenever 50s maybe 60s probably see or
so<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.720> our<00:00:22.080> product<00:00:22.529> engine<00:00:23.600> this<00:00:24.600> must<00:00:25.170> be

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
so to our product engine this must be

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
so to our product engine this must be
kind<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.590> cranky<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.039> start<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.609> bear<00:00:27.029> with<00:00:27.060> me

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.640 

here's<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.480> there's<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.080> filter<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.529> was

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
here's that there's that filter I was

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.260 
here's that there's that filter I was
telling<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.009> about<00:00:34.880> I'm<00:00:35.880> not<00:00:36.000> really<00:00:36.149> sure

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
telling you about I'm not really sure

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.520 
telling you about I'm not really sure
what<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:41.329> it's<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.390> little<00:00:42.480> piece<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.840> kind

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
what this is it's a little piece of kind

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.170 
what this is it's a little piece of kind
of<00:00:43.559> curling<00:00:43.860> off<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.219> very<00:00:44.250> thin<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.090> I'm

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
of curling off it's very thin so I'm

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.520 
of curling off it's very thin so I'm
looking<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.950> misfire<00:00:46.950> all<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.399> way<00:00:47.489> around

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
looking a misfire all the way around

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.700 
looking a misfire all the way around
almost<00:00:49.530> feels<00:00:49.860> like<00:00:50.010> some<00:00:50.190> kind<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:51.440> tree<00:00:52.440> bark

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
almost feels like some kind of tree bark

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.740 
almost feels like some kind of tree bark
or<00:00:52.980> something<00:00:53.399> some<00:00:53.610> kind<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.850> paper<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.660> don't

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
or something some kind of paper I don't

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.819 
or something some kind of paper I don't
know<00:00:56.660> that's<00:00:57.660> that's<00:00:57.930> not<00:00:58.079> bolted<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.620> right

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
know that's that's not bolted on right

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.090 
know that's that's not bolted on right
now<00:01:00.050> we'll<00:01:01.050> run<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.320> real<00:01:01.469> quick<00:01:01.680> without<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
now we'll run it real quick without the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.969 
now we'll run it real quick without the
air<00:01:02.190> filter<00:01:02.550> just<00:01:02.670> because<00:01:02.940> there's<00:01:03.329> no

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
air filter just because there's no

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.440 
air filter just because there's no
there's<00:01:04.979> no<00:01:05.040> dust<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.580> particulate<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> air

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
there's no dust a particulate in the air

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.320 
there's no dust a particulate in the air
so<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.810> won't<00:01:06.990> harden<00:01:07.850> it's<00:01:08.850> no<00:01:09.090> quick<00:01:09.330> run<00:01:11.330> see

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
so it won't harden it's no quick run see

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.710 
so it won't harden it's no quick run see
here<00:01:12.659> that's<00:01:13.439> good<00:01:14.509> joke

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
here that's good joke

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.650 
here that's good joke
