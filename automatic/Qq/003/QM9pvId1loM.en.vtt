00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.540
 lcd hit lc bank robberies as 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.099
 it's boiling we're in a game 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.200
 created by Carlos Codas headquarters 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.550
 you will have your channel in the description and 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.210
 I come to tell you that many thanks 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.770
 by yesterday's video of tuning the 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.930
 guardian that says a challenge and you have 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.310
 surpassed or is it worth but they have more than 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.510
 come faster the like in the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.789
 visits I do not know how you did it 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.410
 but in mortal and I come here to bring you and 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.199
 thank you but I come to bring a 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.359
 departure with three hidden vehicles is worth 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.769
 three vehicles and a surprise that is 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.090
 one the visit but as having the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.550
 trash vehicle a lot is me 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.710
 saying fury that no what not if it is 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.210
 different because because in the trailer to 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.340
 bank robberies appears this 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.719
 vehicle but the back in the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.610
 Normally I did not have it before 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.289
 rusty is worth now if it has rusted 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.969
 it's a new vehicle that they have put a 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.010
 vehicle that will have gotten it I do not know why 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.289
 What the back rusty will 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.090
 given a little bit more of reality to 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.969
 game and have also gotten as is 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.710
 living is lalan lost is worth 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.350
 would be the two as having in 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.110
 black completely and appears on the map 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.270
 as a point is worth a point 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.540
 marked when I entered the game in the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.400
 Map 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.920
 will appear with a marked point I do not know by 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.500
 what if we have to take it in a 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.880
 mission and we will have to take it I do not know 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.650
 still if only it will be in the mode 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.330
 campaign but here as having the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.100
 we can use in online mode in 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.840
 a game created and here you can 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.220
 use whenever you want to be worth yes 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.480
 when robberies happen to banks that 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.670
 it takes well I did not get it because the 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.530
 true they are quite complicated and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.720
 I'm trying to pass it I can 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.400
 upload is everything to the channel is worth if you want 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.130
 see the first broadcast and the second one already 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.380
 they are complete in the channel and as you can see 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.479
 here I still do not have it unlocked 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.460
 for we can catch it in this mission it's worth 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.860
 here as he is living they have nothing 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.080
 difference with the good has no place to 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.720
 difference is valid because the previous one is 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.000
 the most normal account is worth in the part 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.800
 you have it removed and now the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.530
 The new ones have the 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.660
 back part worth ok let's go with another 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.880
 serial vehicle barrack 3 because they have 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.530
 post barratt 3 because this vehicle already 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.600
 It was measured and was very subtle 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.310
 previously but now they have 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.960
 modified several little things worth one of 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.179
 them some of the things that have 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.979
 modified is that you have put armchairs 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.150
 in the back is to say if now 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.140
 that our friend want to ride 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.510
 several people 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.920
 in the back of wood and the 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.420
 it's really cool because it looks 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.610
 how are you going you can see the armchairs 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.490
 back and it's pretty white because 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.350
 now we can sit down and we can 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.270
 route a route by gta 5 look 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.220
 make a route by gta 5 you can do 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.980
 a route for 7 to 5 we entertain 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.440
 We were happy and we eat partridges and it's worth 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.120
 then I bring more video worth from 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.410
 now this new video has to 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.239
 pop the light button because the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.250
 true that it's pretty cool I've done it in a 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.989
 Private game you already know that also 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.120
 after a private game if you want to see 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.920
 if you want valkyrie if you want 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.390
 see good there are quite a few things and 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.880
 also many previous videos 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.470
 it's worth a lot of gameplay from the holdups 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.420
 teaching the masks teaching everything 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.430
 everything and then I'm going to bring new videos 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.590
 here as having we are going to go by the 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.019
 boat by a semi-rigid as you are 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.790
 seeing previously we had to catch 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.530
 the semi-rigid but only had two 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.810
 seats are worth two front seats 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.120
 now he will have four because because in the 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.010
 third main robbery in the third 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.209
 main blow we have to go to 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.830
 carrier and how the 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.290
 carrier I'm going to make you a little 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.350
 a small spoiler but the aircraft carrier 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.720
 we have to go with this we have it 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.340
 you know that after the traction for 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.470
 four people then here we 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.420
 we can ride the four and we can go 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.190
 to the aircraft carrier that also appears in 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.000
 the trailer of bank robberies of 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.590
 lcd hayes is worth in this boat mounted 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.660
 those that the aircraft carriers wins to make 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.100
 and steal the leader endorsements because we have 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.530
 to go to the aircraft carrier to steal from 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.120
 bunk beds and we will go with this boat a 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.710
