originally submitted to machinima sports
only<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:44.010> don't<00:00:44.070> even<00:00:44.250> think<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.520> one<00:00:44.700> was

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
only and I don't even think this one was

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.310 
only and I don't even think this one was
on<00:00:44.940> my<00:00:45.059> Nonna's<00:00:45.239> fan<00:00:45.480> channel<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.960> later

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
on my Nonna's fan channel I later

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.650 
on my Nonna's fan channel I later
started<00:00:46.829> putting<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.280> series<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.510> not

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
his fan channel but I thought that I

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.010 
his fan channel but I thought that I
would<00:00:50.010> take<00:00:50.190> some<00:00:50.250> time<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.940> go<00:00:51.600> back<00:00:51.780> and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
would take some time and go back and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.720 
would take some time and go back and
redo<00:00:52.530> commentary<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.219> some<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> classic

redo commentary on some of the classic
videos<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.690> kind<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.530> tell<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.800> about<00:00:55.949> what<00:00:56.129> I

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
videos and kind of tell you about what I

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.010 
videos and kind of tell you about what I
was<00:00:56.309> doing<00:00:56.610> at<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> time<00:00:57.360> or<00:00:57.690> what<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
was doing at the time or what the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.310 
was doing at the time or what the
inspiration<00:00:58.590> was<00:00:59.390> so<00:01:00.390> anyway<00:01:00.690> there<00:01:00.840> isn't<00:01:01.020> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
inspiration was so anyway there isn't a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.410 
inspiration was so anyway there isn't a
better<00:01:01.530> place<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.309> start<00:01:02.520> doing<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.120> than

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
better place to start doing this than

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.090 
better place to start doing this than
with<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.719> Joe<00:01:03.930> Broadway<00:01:04.350> series<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.890> very

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
as series that were up on YouTube so

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.620 
as series that were up on YouTube so
this<00:01:55.229> was<00:01:55.380> brand<00:01:55.619> new<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.920> me<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.450> all<00:01:57.450> his

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
this was brand new to me and all his

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.359 
this was brand new to me and all his
future<00:01:57.840> features<00:01:58.469> everything<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.009> did<00:01:59.189> was

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
future features everything I did was

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.609 
future features everything I did was
just<00:01:59.399> completely<00:01:59.939> random<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.509> my<00:02:01.170> commentary

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
just completely random and my commentary

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.170 
just completely random and my commentary
was<00:02:01.799> definitely<00:02:02.219> not<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.369> saw<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.790> back<00:02:02.909> then<00:02:03.149> I

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
was definitely not a saw it back then I

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.149 
was definitely not a saw it back then I
was<00:02:03.420> really<00:02:03.750> kind<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.409> unsure<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.920> what<00:02:05.070> to

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
was really kind of unsure and what to

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.859 
was really kind of unsure and what to
talk<00:02:05.310> about

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
talk about

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.660 
talk about
things<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.680> changed<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> little<00:02:08.160> since<00:02:08.280> then

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
things have changed a little since then

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.400 
things have changed a little since then
so<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.360> little<00:02:09.629> interesting<00:02:09.810> going<00:02:10.140> back

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
so it's a little interesting going back

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.980 
so it's a little interesting going back
and<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.709> see<00:02:11.030> what<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.060> had<00:02:12.209> done<00:02:12.360> back<00:02:12.569> then

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
and to see what I had done back then

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.260 
and to see what I had done back then
and<00:02:13.260> now<00:02:13.500> kind<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.920> coming<00:02:14.580> full<00:02:14.700> circle<00:02:14.880> on<00:02:15.180> it

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
and now kind of coming full circle on it

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.480 
and now kind of coming full circle on it
and<00:02:15.420> just<00:02:15.570> kind<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.920> update<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.070> what<00:02:17.190> happened

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
and just kind of update in what happened

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.430 
and just kind of update in what happened
with<00:02:17.610> this<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.000> here<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.330> see<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:19.020> it

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
with this so here you see that the it

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.710 
with this so here you see that the it
took<00:02:19.710> quite<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.920> time<00:02:20.190> showing<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.270> creation

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
took quite a time showing the creation

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.230 
took quite a time showing the creation
here<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.400> finding<00:02:23.400> out<00:02:23.520> later<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:24.150> know

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
here and finding out later that you know

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.910 
here and finding out later that you know
the<00:02:24.450> show<00:02:24.690> does<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.960> much<00:02:25.140> better<00:02:25.170> job<00:02:25.410> in

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
the show does a much better job in

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.310 
the show does a much better job in
letting<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:26.910> create<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:27.300> player<00:02:27.570> these<00:02:27.870> guys

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
letting you create a player these guys

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.810 
letting you create a player these guys
are<00:02:28.470> pretty<00:02:28.620> hideous<00:02:29.100> looking<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.610> 2k

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
are pretty hideous looking in the 2k

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.450 
are pretty hideous looking in the 2k
series<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.960> I<00:02:31.290> think<00:02:31.350> on<00:02:31.680> all<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:31.920> did<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.190> pretty

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
series so I think on all I did a pretty

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.550 
series so I think on all I did a pretty
good<00:02:32.640> job<00:02:32.700> with<00:02:32.940> gel<00:02:33.240> Broadway<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.810> found<00:02:34.440> out

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
good job with gel Broadway I found out

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.350 
good job with gel Broadway I found out
later<00:02:34.710> with<00:02:34.950> Jaco<00:02:35.340> Merman<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:36.180> could

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
later with Jaco Merman that you could

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.270 
later with Jaco Merman that you could
really<00:02:37.050> really<00:02:37.320> make<00:02:37.470> some<00:02:37.650> ugly<00:02:38.010> look<00:02:38.190> at

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
really really make some ugly look at

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.640 
really really make some ugly look at
people<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.930> know<00:02:40.020> he<00:02:40.140> turned<00:02:40.290> out<00:02:40.470> all

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
people so you know he turned out all

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.680 
people so you know he turned out all
right<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:41.250> know<00:02:41.370> all<00:02:41.760> things<00:02:42.000> considered

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
right you know all things considered

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.800 
right you know all things considered
so<00:02:42.900> got<00:02:43.650> him<00:02:43.800> all<00:02:43.920> set<00:02:44.250> up<00:02:44.460> and<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.570> took<00:02:45.780> a

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
so got him all set up and it took a

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.620 
so got him all set up and it took a
while<00:02:46.050> I<00:02:46.880> probably<00:02:47.880> wish<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.120> were<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.390> redo

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
while I probably wish I were to redo

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.060 
while I probably wish I were to redo
this<00:02:48.780> again<00:02:49.110> today<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.560> probably<00:02:49.800> wouldn't

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
this again today I probably wouldn't

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.340 
this again today I probably wouldn't
show<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.460> much<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:50.910> creation<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.600> kind<00:02:52.290> of

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
show this much of the creation I kind of

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.920 
show this much of the creation I kind of
skip<00:02:52.620> over<00:02:52.740> those<00:02:52.950> things<00:02:53.220> because<00:02:53.610> well<00:02:54.570> it

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
skip over those things because well it

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.740 
skip over those things because well it
gets<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.260> little<00:02:55.410> boring<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.340> little<00:02:56.550> long<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:57.450> I

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
gets a little boring a little long but I

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.240 
gets a little boring a little long but I
just<00:02:57.960> kind<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.170> left<00:02:58.320> this<00:02:58.410> video<00:02:58.680> as<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:58.920> was

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
just kind of left this video as it was

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.910 
just kind of left this video as it was
and<00:02:59.610> doing<00:02:59.940> commentary<00:03:00.480> over<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.900> top<00:03:01.110> so<00:03:01.410> you

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
and doing commentary over the top so you

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.250 
and doing commentary over the top so you
see<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:03.000> choosing<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.050> all<00:03:04.140> the

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
see the the choosing of all the

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.410 
see the the choosing of all the
equipment<00:03:04.770> and<00:03:04.860> everything<00:03:05.060> getting<00:03:06.060> going

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
equipment and everything getting going

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.790 
equipment and everything getting going
with<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.570> series<00:03:07.050> but<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.440> meat<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.740> potatoes

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
with a series but the meat and potatoes

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.410 
with a series but the meat and potatoes
obviously<00:03:08.460> is<00:03:08.550> when<00:03:08.700> he<00:03:08.790> starts<00:03:09.120> his<00:03:09.240> career

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
obviously is when he starts his career

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.180 
obviously is when he starts his career
and<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:10.860> think<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.340> maybe<00:03:11.790> get<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.240> first

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
and I think I maybe get to the first

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.130 
and I think I maybe get to the first
clutch<00:03:14.190> at-bat<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:14.880> he<00:03:15.030> gets<00:03:15.630> in<00:03:15.780> his<00:03:15.930> minor

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140

there's others that I can hit upon I can

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.710 
there's others that I can hit upon I can
kind<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.590> think<00:03:28.710> of<00:03:28.860> like<00:03:28.920> Land<00:03:29.310> O'Lakes<00:03:29.720> Road

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
kind of think of like Land O'Lakes Road

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.660 
kind of think of like Land O'Lakes Road
to<00:03:30.840> Glory<00:03:31.110> my<00:03:31.740> very<00:03:31.980> first<00:03:32.220> road<00:03:32.370> to<00:03:32.490> glory

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
to Glory my very first road to glory

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.250 
to Glory my very first road to glory
with<00:03:32.790> Land<00:03:33.090> O'Lakes<00:03:33.180> who<00:03:33.570> was<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.750> running<00:03:34.110> back

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
with Land O'Lakes who was a running back

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.650 
with Land O'Lakes who was a running back
at<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.250> University<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.760> Minnesota<00:03:35.940> with<00:03:36.630> the

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
at the University of Minnesota with the

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.360 
at the University of Minnesota with the
Gophers<00:03:37.140> I'll<00:03:37.440> probably<00:03:37.650> try<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:37.980> bring<00:03:38.250> that

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
Gophers I'll probably try to bring that

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.550 
Gophers I'll probably try to bring that
back<00:03:38.550> as<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.790> classic<00:03:39.240> series<00:03:39.540> as<00:03:39.660> well<00:03:39.840> maybe

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
back as a classic series as well maybe

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.740 
back as a classic series as well maybe
redo<00:03:40.920> some<00:03:41.130> of<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.280> commentary<00:03:41.790> on<00:03:41.910> that<00:03:41.940> but

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
redo some of the commentary on that but

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.080 
redo some of the commentary on that but
I<00:03:42.780> just<00:03:42.960> think<00:03:43.140> that<00:03:43.500> some<00:03:43.620> of<00:03:43.710> these<00:03:43.770> videos

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
I just think that some of these videos

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.420 
I just think that some of these videos
really<00:03:45.090> are<00:03:46.080> probably<00:03:46.440> being<00:03:46.620> probably<00:03:47.250> being

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
really are probably being probably being

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.700 
really are probably being probably being
missed<00:03:47.700> out<00:03:47.850> by<00:03:48.030> people<00:03:48.170> who<00:03:49.170> did<00:03:49.320> not<00:03:49.440> follow

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
missed out by people who did not follow

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.800 
missed out by people who did not follow
my<00:03:49.950> channel<00:03:50.310> back<00:03:50.490> when<00:03:50.670> I<00:03:50.700> was<00:03:50.940> on<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.510> nadas

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
my channel back when I was on the nadas

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.140 
my channel back when I was on the nadas
fan<00:03:51.990> channel<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:53.250> I<00:03:53.280> would<00:03:53.550> like<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.880> kind<00:03:54.030> of

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
fan channel so I would like to kind of

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.330 
fan channel so I would like to kind of
give<00:03:54.330> them<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.600> chance<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.960> see<00:03:55.260> where<00:03:56.070> a<00:03:56.100> lot<00:03:56.310> of

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
give them a chance to see where a lot of

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.220 
give them a chance to see where a lot of
these<00:03:56.490> came<00:03:56.790> from<00:03:57.030> so<00:03:57.330> I<00:03:57.360> get<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.750> lot<00:03:58.080> of

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
these came from so I get a lot of

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.800 
these came from so I get a lot of
questions<00:03:58.560> on<00:03:58.740> what<00:03:58.770> the<00:03:59.190> bad<00:04:00.000> instance<00:04:00.480> was

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
questions on what the bad instance was

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.260 
questions on what the bad instance was
for<00:04:01.410> Joel<00:04:02.130> Broadway<00:04:02.460> and<00:04:02.640> I<00:04:02.670> think<00:04:02.850> I<00:04:02.910> carried

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
for Joel Broadway and I think I carried

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.160 
for Joel Broadway and I think I carried
it<00:04:03.360> over<00:04:03.570> into<00:04:04.530> his<00:04:04.620> MLB<00:04:05.160> 11<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:05.940> show<00:04:06.150> days<00:04:06.390> he

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
it over into his MLB 11 the show days he

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.370 
it over into his MLB 11 the show days he
started<00:04:07.710> off<00:04:07.980> as<00:04:08.340> will<00:04:08.880> Clark<00:04:09.300> but<00:04:09.990> I<00:04:10.050> think

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
started off as will Clark but I think

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.730 
started off as will Clark but I think
that<00:04:10.620> changed<00:04:11.190> over<00:04:11.370> time<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:12.480> Mike<00:04:12.690> Lowell<00:04:12.990> so

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
that changed over time to Mike Lowell so

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.380 
that changed over time to Mike Lowell so
the<00:04:13.890> very<00:04:14.100> first<00:04:14.340> batting<00:04:14.820> stance<00:04:15.000> was<00:04:15.240> will

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
the very first batting stance was will

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.930 
the very first batting stance was will
Clark<00:04:16.010> because<00:04:17.010> I<00:04:17.070> liked<00:04:17.310> him<00:04:17.460> a<00:04:17.489> lot<00:04:17.670> back<00:04:17.910> in

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
Clark because I liked him a lot back in

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.900 
Clark because I liked him a lot back in
his<00:04:18.150> Giants<00:04:18.690> days<00:04:18.960> you<00:04:19.650> know<00:04:19.739> he<00:04:19.859> was<00:04:20.010> a<00:04:20.040> kind

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
his Giants days you know he was a kind

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.540 
his Giants days you know he was a kind

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.230 
random who he was going to play with and
as<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:28.710> see<00:04:28.890> I<00:04:28.920> searched<00:04:29.220> through<00:04:29.400> did

I<00:05:09.930> not<00:05:10.200> only<00:05:10.230> planned<00:05:10.740> to<00:05:10.890> bring<00:05:11.070> back<00:05:11.310> the

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
I not only planned to bring back the

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.130 
I not only planned to bring back the
classic<00:05:11.940> episodes<00:05:12.360> but<00:05:12.570> I'm<00:05:12.660> hoping<00:05:13.080> that

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
classic episodes but I'm hoping that

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.500 
classic episodes but I'm hoping that
even<00:05:13.680> though<00:05:13.800> this<00:05:13.950> game<00:05:14.160> is<00:05:14.220> a<00:05:14.610> couple<00:05:15.330> years

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
even though this game is a couple years

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.560 
even though this game is a couple years
old<00:05:15.750> now<00:05:15.900> I'm<00:05:16.170> still<00:05:16.500> hoping<00:05:16.830> to<00:05:17.360> further<00:05:18.360> his

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
old now I'm still hoping to further his

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.800 
old now I'm still hoping to further his
career<00:05:18.810> whether<00:05:19.170> it<00:05:19.290> be<00:05:19.410> in<00:05:19.800> live<00:05:20.040> streams<00:05:20.370> or

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
career whether it be in live streams or

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.200 
career whether it be in live streams or
also<00:05:21.810> in<00:05:22.370> continuing<00:05:23.370> episodes<00:05:24.000> of<00:05:24.150> the

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
also in continuing episodes of the

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.530 
also in continuing episodes of the
series<00:05:24.570> so<00:05:24.810> look<00:05:25.530> for<00:05:25.680> that<00:05:25.710> as<00:05:25.920> well<00:05:26.070> I'll<00:05:26.310> be

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
series so look for that as well I'll be

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.490 
series so look for that as well I'll be
supplementing<00:05:27.540> on<00:05:27.630> both<00:05:27.810> ends<00:05:28.110> really<00:05:28.290> I'll

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
supplementing on both ends really I'll

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.170 
supplementing on both ends really I'll
be<00:05:28.620> bringing<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:29.040> classics<00:05:29.490> back<00:05:29.700> like<00:05:29.910> I<00:05:29.940> did

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
be bringing the classics back like I did

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.090 
be bringing the classics back like I did
right<00:05:30.360> here<00:05:30.690> as<00:05:30.870> you<00:05:31.470> see<00:05:31.620> his<00:05:31.740> very<00:05:31.860> first

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
right here as you see his very first

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.460 
right here as you see his very first
at-bat<00:05:32.610> he's<00:05:33.240> going<00:05:33.630> to<00:05:33.810> ground<00:05:34.080> into<00:05:34.410> a

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
at-bat he's going to ground into a

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.120 
at-bat he's going to ground into a
double<00:05:34.530> play<00:05:34.800> not<00:05:35.580> a<00:05:35.610> very<00:05:35.880> good<00:05:36.030> start<00:05:36.300> so<00:05:37.130> but

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
double play not a very good start so but

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.010 
double play not a very good start so but
that's<00:05:38.310> that's<00:05:38.910> how<00:05:39.060> it<00:05:39.120> works<00:05:39.300> sometimes<00:05:39.780> so

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
that's that's how it works sometimes so

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.590 
that's that's how it works sometimes so
to<00:05:40.320> the<00:05:40.440> field<00:05:40.680> he<00:05:40.980> is<00:05:41.670> the<00:05:41.850> first<00:05:42.090> baseman<00:05:42.510> at

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
to the field he is the first baseman at

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.850 
to the field he is the first baseman at
least<00:05:42.780> that's<00:05:42.990> how<00:05:43.140> he<00:05:43.200> started<00:05:43.590> his<00:05:43.710> career

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
least that's how he started his career

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.760 
least that's how he started his career
and<00:05:44.450> it<00:05:45.450> makes<00:05:45.630> a<00:05:45.750> play<00:05:45.930> there<00:05:46.140> so<00:05:46.500> I'm<00:05:46.650> not

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
and it makes a play there so I'm not

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:47.540 
and it makes a play there so I'm not
going<00:05:46.920> to<00:05:46.980> talk<00:05:47.070> too<00:05:47.190> much<00:05:47.280> about<00:05:47.460> the

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
going to talk too much about the

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.490 
going to talk too much about the
gameplay<00:05:47.760> I've<00:05:48.120> done<00:05:48.330> that<00:05:48.510> been<00:05:49.230> there<00:05:49.380> had

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
gameplay I've done that been there had

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.170 
gameplay I've done that been there had
done<00:05:49.680> that<00:05:49.800> but<00:05:50.040> I<00:05:50.400> just<00:05:50.700> wanted<00:05:50.910> to<00:05:50.970> kind<00:05:51.150> of

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
done that but I just wanted to kind of

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.600 
done that but I just wanted to kind of
talk<00:05:51.330> about<00:05:51.390> more<00:05:51.720> the<00:05:51.840> inspiration<00:05:52.410> so<00:05:52.610> you

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
talk about more the inspiration so you

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.350 
talk about more the inspiration so you
know<00:05:53.700> I<00:05:53.760> really<00:05:53.790> didn't<00:05:54.090> know<00:05:54.150> what<00:05:54.240> to<00:05:54.330> expect

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
know I really didn't know what to expect

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.800

the initial reception was pretty good

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.330
