very dark very our one office of stuff

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.000 
very dark very our one office of stuff
trying<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:07.960> feel<00:03:08.170> for<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.380> wind<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.620> tell<00:03:08.830> me

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
trying to feel for the wind to tell me

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.350 
trying to feel for the wind to tell me
is<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.190> there<00:03:09.430> was<00:03:09.520> never<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.760> consistent

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
is that there was never a consistent

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.430 
is that there was never a consistent
with<00:03:10.480> where<00:03:10.570> we<00:03:10.720> knew<00:03:10.990> what<00:03:11.110> we<00:03:11.230> were<00:03:11.290> getting

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
with where we knew what we were getting

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.200 
with where we knew what we were getting
it<00:03:12.010> was<00:03:12.130> blowing<00:03:12.460> in<00:03:12.550> the<00:03:12.640> swirling<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.120> was

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
it was blowing in the swirling it was

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.280 
it was blowing in the swirling it was
hard<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:13.450> really<00:03:13.570> understand<00:03:14.020> where<00:03:14.200> I<00:03:14.230> was

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
hard to really understand where I was

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.900 
hard to really understand where I was
coming<00:03:14.440> from<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.280> think<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.580> can<00:03:15.640> introduce

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
coming from and I think it can introduce

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.340 
coming from and I think it can introduce
some<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:16.330> drops<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:16.810> that<00:03:16.930> because<00:03:17.230> the

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
some of the drops to that because the

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.430 
some of the drops to that because the
ball<00:03:17.560> is<00:03:17.800> probably<00:03:18.430> knuckling<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:18.970> little<00:03:19.210> bit

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
ball is probably knuckling a little bit

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.810 
ball is probably knuckling a little bit
there's<00:03:20.440> certainly<00:03:20.740> that<00:03:21.310> effective<00:03:21.670> play

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
there's certainly that effective play

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:30.540 
there's certainly that effective play
