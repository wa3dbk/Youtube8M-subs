00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.460
 hello everyone with you meteor and this 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.440
 training video for all known not 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.809
 variations of a coffin well, or a hatchet 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.809
 element on the turnstile let's see 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:34.130
 and so the first failing exercise 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:37.790
 who needs to learn it here pronose 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:42.739
 feet for what it is needed for different 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:48.340
 cases at least in order to be able to 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.340
 throw yourself further try to throw 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.440
 under the knee on the horizontal bar and let go hands 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.860
 if terrible started for safety net 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.820
 with hands like for example here 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.100
 to feel the beauty of it 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.729
 of the moment 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.070
 head to you will have to blush terribly 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:14.720
 it is worth the next moment it is already 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:18.440
 a slight buildup on his knees and here 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.119
 learn to let go so much 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.909
 painted a little 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.280
 Scary at first of course can be 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:32.020
 without this element is not like on the sly 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:37.810
 increase the amplitude of rotation here 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.880
 saw myself backing it up 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.520
 don't go too far that if you won't 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.200
 configured to make chapters you can just 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.869
 fall under your neck if you already feel 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.789
 what are ready to do if places but afraid 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:54.729
 You can easily do this by 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:58.420
 on uchke insurance feel that here 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:03.220
 map they in contour niki do so here 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.530
 chip that is to caress me, he suffered 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.569
 throws me up with my muscular strength 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.539
 up this is just done go here for 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:12.280
 man's forehead, keep him here washed 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.049
 muscular strength you raise it 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.120
 and he lands even sometimes 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:19.860
 twist people like that so not 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.860
 be afraid to do business 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.300
 but 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.200
 like from sitting to learn 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.959
 this simple chip 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.160
 kneel down as much as possible 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.690
 lean back at first you can 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.690
 I can make an element 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:50.060
 understood the technique of forgiveness and in the same way 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.799
 as on the normal coffin coffin in 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.200
 the difference 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:57.170
 done exactly the same way first let go 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:02.329
 one leg let's say left then right 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:04.879
 goes dogonochku element is not particularly difficult 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:10.700
 2 physical sensation of doing it even 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:16.730
 lighter than standard time two three 4 5 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:19.419
 six coffins with half-screw can do 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.419
 interception 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.970
 he is easily landing 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:36.560
 element is just another thing that 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.560
 I like very much this media repair 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.410
 a lot of adrenaline is very dynamic a 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.020
 Now let 's look at the details or 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:50.370
 element consists of two parts first 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:54.860
 the monkey 2 then no sister coffin 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:57.720
 who are there time you have to learn 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:06.120
 wear a monkey do on a small fence 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:09.090
 first on accuracy based on everything 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:17.579
 little by little if there is such a new fence 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:19.169
 house learn the next topic main 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.840
 the moment that needs to be understood 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:28.770
 use of inertia but here's a wave 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.900
 max back the main mistake that 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.800
 some try to make straight 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:38.160
 kicking at the expense of strength and make it very 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.979
 very problematic so here 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.720
 use inertia to the maximum here and 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.720
 back up 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.620
 So 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:58.160
 repeat until you are sure 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.160
 sauce can get up without safety net 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.780
 these places are also very difficult 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.780
 order 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:19.640
 from even different position sharply 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:23.840
 straighten your legs as if with both 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:26.540
 kicking want someone to hit very much 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.790
 strongly and finally the most difficult variation 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.790
 who can do it with a mouth full of crab 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:39.250
 then the moment to start 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.820
 twist 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.820
 here two times 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:52.399
 three here is such a twist under 45 degrees and 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:56.129
 it turns out it is not much more complicated than 

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:59.610
 normal turn recommend it 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:00.179
 either on the mats or in the winter I personally studied 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.029
 in the winter 

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:05.999
 the point is to correctly catch the moment 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:08.580
 when you need to unwind correctly 

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:11.759
 twist and put your feet on 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:14.009
 cotton is the moment you need 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:22.439
 it is necessary to lower the legs simultaneously with 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:25.729
 this begins the twist here two times here 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:29.219
 something like this it looks above all 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:30.240
 feet let go get out stronger than 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:34.169
 regular lesson 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:37.069
 sense to distribute your knees as well as 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.069
 hands spin 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.360
 can with straight arms can spin them 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:46.030
 a little harder to press the body but 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.590
 not completely different so not so much 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.590
 good pay
