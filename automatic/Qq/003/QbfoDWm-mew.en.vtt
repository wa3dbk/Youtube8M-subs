the mg 3 we were surprised how much fun
it<00:01:35.060> is<00:01:35.150> to<00:01:35.360> drive<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:36.200> suspension<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.800> slice<00:01:37.010> of

it is to drive the suspension a slice of
fir<00:01:37.400> but<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.700> steering<00:01:38.030> is<00:01:38.150> quite<00:01:38.360> heavy

fir but the steering is quite heavy

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.260 
fir but the steering is quite heavy
which<00:01:38.930> means<00:01:39.170> it<00:01:39.290> feels<00:01:39.440> quite<00:01:39.620> supporting

the<00:01:44.270> flip<00:01:44.510> side<00:01:44.540> of<00:01:44.780> this<00:01:45.020> is<00:01:45.260> that<00:01:45.290> it's

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
the flip side of this is that it's

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.830 
the flip side of this is that it's

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
harder to maneuver at low speed so if

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.010 
harder to maneuver at low speed so if
