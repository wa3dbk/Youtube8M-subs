00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
this universe approach is one that is

to<00:01:09.630> these<00:01:09.780> characters<00:01:10.350> they<00:01:10.619> would<00:01:10.770> want<00:01:10.979> to

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.740 
to these characters they would want to
maximize<00:01:11.670> them<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> fullest

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
maximize them to the fullest

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.840 
maximize them to the fullest
