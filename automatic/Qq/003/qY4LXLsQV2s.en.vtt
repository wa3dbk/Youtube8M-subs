that<00:00:29.650> the<00:00:29.830> composer<00:00:30.220> has<00:00:30.640> set<00:00:30.849> down<00:00:31.000> for<00:00:31.060> us

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
that the composer has set down for us

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.820 
that the composer has set down for us
very<00:00:32.379> much<00:00:32.860> like<00:00:33.270> actors<00:00:34.270> in<00:00:34.390> a<00:00:34.450> play<00:00:34.650> we<00:00:35.650> have

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
very much like actors in a play we have

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.070 
very much like actors in a play we have
to<00:00:35.980> we<00:00:36.190> have<00:00:36.280> predetermined<00:00:36.760> lines<00:00:37.330> most<00:00:37.900> of

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
to we have predetermined lines most of

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.439 
to we have predetermined lines most of
the<00:00:38.140> time<00:00:38.320> that<00:00:38.470> we<00:00:38.559> have<00:00:38.680> to<00:00:38.830> speak<00:00:39.070> but<00:00:39.449> at

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
the time that we have to speak but at

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.420 
the time that we have to speak but at
the<00:00:40.540> same<00:00:40.720> time<00:00:41.020> what<00:00:41.800> makes<00:00:42.010> it

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
the same time what makes it

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.850 
the same time what makes it
music<00:00:42.910> so<00:00:43.059> unique<00:00:43.360> and<00:00:43.480> special<00:00:43.600> is<00:00:44.110> the<00:00:44.590> fact

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
music so unique and special is the fact

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.700 
music so unique and special is the fact
that<00:00:45.010> we<00:00:45.220> give<00:00:45.430> our<00:00:45.580> own<00:00:45.699> little<00:00:46.030> twist<00:00:47.020> to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
that we give our own little twist to

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.310 
that we give our own little twist to
these<00:00:47.860> lines<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.460> way<00:00:48.580> we<00:00:48.729> speak<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:50.080> way<00:00:50.199> we

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
these lines the way we speak the way we

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.160 
these lines the way we speak the way we
are<00:00:50.620> voice<00:00:50.830> rises<00:00:51.430> and<00:00:51.670> lowers<00:00:52.180> and<00:00:52.420> the

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
are voice rises and lowers and the

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.660 
are voice rises and lowers and the
emphasis<00:00:53.530> we<00:00:53.680> put<00:00:53.830> on<00:00:53.920> different<00:00:54.070> words<00:00:54.460> and

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
emphasis we put on different words and

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.640 
emphasis we put on different words and
of<00:00:55.000> course<00:00:55.210> that's<00:00:55.300> what<00:00:55.540> makes<00:00:55.750> pieces<00:00:56.500> like

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
of course that's what makes pieces like

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.869 
of course that's what makes pieces like
the<00:00:56.769> heightened<00:00:57.040> trumpet<00:00:57.309> concerto<00:00:57.460> such<00:00:57.850> a

true in jazz performance now I'm going
to<00:01:06.010> give<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:06.220> a<00:01:06.280> couple<00:01:06.520> of<00:01:06.549> excerpts<00:01:06.970> of

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
to give you a couple of excerpts of

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.300 
to give you a couple of excerpts of
people<00:01:07.960> that<00:01:08.110> are<00:01:08.229> sort<00:01:08.470> of<00:01:08.500> indelible<00:01:09.040> in

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
people that are sort of indelible in

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.820 
people that are sort of indelible in
mine<00:01:10.060> in<00:01:10.330> my<00:01:10.479> mind<00:01:10.750> even<00:01:11.080> though<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.590> sound

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
mine in my mind even though the sound

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.020 
mine in my mind even though the sound
might<00:01:12.010> not<00:01:12.130> be<00:01:12.250> exactly<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.729> same<00:01:12.760> but<00:01:12.970> I

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
might not be exactly the same but I

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.899 
might not be exactly the same but I
think<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.920> study<00:01:14.920> of<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.310> character<00:01:15.760> is

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
think the the study of the character is

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.370 
think the the study of the character is
and<00:01:16.240> that<00:01:16.479> helps<00:01:16.750> me<00:01:16.900> to<00:01:17.080> be<00:01:17.170> a<00:01:17.200> more

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
and that helps me to be a more

00:01:17.380 --> 00:02:17.500 
and that helps me to be a more
individual<00:01:17.890> character<00:01:18.250> as<00:01:18.340> well

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.840 

so<00:02:18.510> basically<00:02:18.900> you're<00:02:19.110> learning<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.470> speak<00:02:19.850> in

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
so basically you're learning to speak in

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.970 
so basically you're learning to speak in
a<00:02:21.060> vernacular<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.900> language<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.680> really

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
a vernacular a language that really

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.309 
a vernacular a language that really
isn't<00:02:23.190> your<00:02:23.459> own<00:02:23.640> but<00:02:24.420> at<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.569> same<00:02:24.780> time<00:02:25.050> most

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
isn't your own but at the same time most

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.800 
isn't your own but at the same time most
musical<00:02:25.860> styles<00:02:26.340> require<00:02:26.880> us<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.150> have<00:02:27.480> a

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
musical styles require us to have a

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.680 
musical styles require us to have a
knowledge<00:02:28.319> of<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.739> vernacular<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.880> whether

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
knowledge of the vernacular and whether

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.630 
knowledge of the vernacular and whether
you're<00:02:30.870> when<00:02:31.230> you're<00:02:31.410> interpreting<00:02:31.980> an<00:02:32.310> opera

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
you're when you're interpreting an opera

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.720 
you're when you're interpreting an opera
Aria<00:02:33.060> or<00:02:33.800> you're<00:02:34.800> in<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.950> specific<00:02:35.400> type<00:02:35.580> of

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
Aria or you're in a specific type of

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.880 
Aria or you're in a specific type of
jazz<00:02:35.940> being<00:02:36.180> like<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.360> bebop<00:02:36.780> band<00:02:37.140> or<00:02:37.709> you're

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
jazz being like a bebop band or you're

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.070 
jazz being like a bebop band or you're
in<00:02:37.980> an<00:02:38.069> old-style

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
in an old-style

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.810 
in an old-style
band<00:02:40.080> like<00:02:40.260> Louie<00:02:40.410> Armstrong<00:02:40.890> was<00:02:41.100> in<00:02:41.130> or<00:02:41.730> you

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
band like Louie Armstrong was in or you

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.000 
band like Louie Armstrong was in or you
were<00:02:41.910> in<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.269> free<00:02:42.450> music<00:02:42.840> ensemble<00:02:43.410> there<00:02:43.920> are

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
were in a free music ensemble there are

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.350 
were in a free music ensemble there are
certain<00:02:44.250> parameters<00:02:44.670> for<00:02:44.970> which<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.180> have<00:02:45.330> to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
certain parameters for which you have to

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.800 
certain parameters for which you have to
have<00:02:45.570> knowledge<00:02:45.810> in<00:02:46.230> order<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.690> interact<00:02:48.690> with

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
have knowledge in order to interact with

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.509 
have knowledge in order to interact with
the<00:02:48.959> other<00:02:49.080> musicians<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.830> then<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
the other musicians and then the

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.910 
the other musicians and then the
composition<00:02:50.850> itself<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.320> think<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:52.650> very

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
composition itself so I think it's very

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.910 
composition itself so I think it's very
important<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:54.209> listen<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.900> if<00:02:55.470> there's<00:02:55.650> any

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
important to listen and if there's any

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.070 
important to listen and if there's any
advice<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.519> I<00:02:56.580> have<00:02:56.820> before<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:57.840> practice

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
advice that I have before you practice

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:10.460 
advice that I have before you practice
listen<00:02:59.120> listening<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.390> key<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:01.560> all<00:03:01.590> music

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.530 

you
