from<00:01:13.619> rotting<00:01:13.799> as<00:01:14.640> quickly<00:01:16.100> just<00:01:17.360> bolts<00:01:18.360> on

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
from rotting as quickly just bolts on

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.960 
from rotting as quickly just bolts on
the<00:01:18.570> side<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.049> anyway<00:01:20.009> after<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.700> get<00:01:20.850> this

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the side so anyway after you get this

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.340 
the side so anyway after you get this
screwed<00:01:21.270> onto<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> bottom<00:01:21.900> go<00:01:22.080> ahead<00:01:22.110> and

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
screwed onto the bottom go ahead and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.140 
screwed onto the bottom go ahead and
flip<00:01:22.590> your<00:01:22.740> trough<00:01:22.979> over<00:01:23.009> set<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.670> top<00:01:23.700> and

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
flip your trough over set it on top and

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.910 
flip your trough over set it on top and
then<00:01:24.360> from<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> bottom<00:01:24.960> side<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.350> screw<00:01:25.619> this

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
then from the bottom side you screw this

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.370 
then from the bottom side you screw this
plywood<00:01:26.189> into<00:01:26.880> your<00:01:26.970> trough<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:28.080> doesn't

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
plywood into your trough so it doesn't

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.510

tip<00:01:28.530> over<00:01:30.619> just<00:01:31.619> got<00:01:31.770> some<00:01:31.920> bungee<00:01:32.100> cords

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
tip over just got some bungee cords

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.390 
tip over just got some bungee cords
drill<00:01:33.390> some<00:01:33.540> holes<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.350> ask<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:35.009> found

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
feet in here and as you can see there's

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.319 
feet in here and as you can see there's
just<00:01:49.890> two<00:01:50.430> little<00:01:50.579> holes<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> bottom

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
just two little holes on the bottom

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.789 
just two little holes on the bottom
there's<00:01:51.780> one<00:01:51.960> over<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.320> side<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.649> one

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
there's one over on this side and one

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.830 
there's one over on this side and one
over<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.189> side<00:01:53.250> just<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:54.299> gravity<00:01:54.630> feeder

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
over on that side just a gravity feeder

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.620 
over on that side just a gravity feeder
put<00:01:55.799> your<00:01:55.950> lid<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.490> away<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.180> go

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
put your lid on and away you go

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.080 
put your lid on and away you go
and<00:01:58.290> I'm<00:01:58.469> probably<00:01:58.829> going<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.219> have<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.640> trail

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
and I'm probably going to have a trail

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.700 
and I'm probably going to have a trail
cam<00:02:00.299> set<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.840> just<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.170> see<00:02:01.320> what<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.500> got

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
cam set on this just to see what I got

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.010 
cam set on this just to see what I got
cruising<00:02:02.070> through<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.310> area<00:02:02.780> probably<00:02:03.780> not

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
cruising through the area probably not

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.359 
cruising through the area probably not
going<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.229> use<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> bunch<00:02:04.710> right<00:02:04.860> now<00:02:05.070> with

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
going to use the bunch right now with

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.880 
going to use the bunch right now with
with<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:06.060> soybeans<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.049> corn<00:02:07.380> still<00:02:07.649> green

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
with the soybeans and corn still green

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.910 
with the soybeans and corn still green
so<00:02:08.629> this<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.810> probably<00:02:10.379> going<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.560> be<00:02:10.649> more<00:02:10.860> of

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
so this is probably going to be more of

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.400 
so this is probably going to be more of
a<00:02:11.009> late<00:02:11.190> season<00:02:11.400> feeder

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
a late season feeder

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.170 
a late season feeder
gets<00:02:12.680> harsh<00:02:12.890> whether<00:02:13.130> it'll<00:02:13.400> be<00:02:13.580> their<00:02:13.910> form

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
gets harsh whether it'll be their form

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.390 
gets harsh whether it'll be their form
and<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:15.230> don't<00:02:15.410> have<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.710> use<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:15.890> for<00:02:16.100> hunting

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
and you don't have to use it for hunting

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.280 
and you don't have to use it for hunting
some<00:02:16.940> states<00:02:17.270> you're<00:02:17.450> not<00:02:17.570> allowed<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.840> use<00:02:18.140> it

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
some states you're not allowed to use it

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.670 
some states you're not allowed to use it
for<00:02:18.410> hunting

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.300 
for hunting
it's<00:02:19.130> called<00:02:19.790> baiting<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.300> is<00:02:20.690> illegal<00:02:21.020> so

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
it's called baiting and is illegal so

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.410 
it's called baiting and is illegal so
