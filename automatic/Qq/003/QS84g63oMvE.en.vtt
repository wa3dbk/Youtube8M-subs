working your chest more specifically the

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.160 
working your chest more specifically the
chest<00:00:08.460> fly<00:00:08.700> if<00:00:09.030> we<00:00:09.269> break<00:00:09.450> down<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.809> chest<00:00:10.050> and

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
chest fly if we break down the chest and

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.839 
chest fly if we break down the chest and
the<00:00:10.260> muscle<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.769> action<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.130> actual<00:00:11.460> muscle

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
the muscle the action of actual muscle

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.009 
the muscle the action of actual muscle
the<00:00:12.210> main<00:00:12.360> action<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.780> going<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.960> be

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
the main action is going to be

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.959 
the main action is going to be
horizontal<00:00:13.290> adduction<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.160> humerus<00:00:14.490> so

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
horizontal adduction of the humerus so

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.550 
horizontal adduction of the humerus so
basically<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:15.540> motion<00:00:16.049> right<00:00:16.170> here<00:00:16.230> that's

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
basically this motion right here that's

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.810 
basically this motion right here that's
why<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.740> see<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.039> happen<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.430> our<00:00:17.520> press

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
why you see this happen in our press

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.790 
why you see this happen in our press
this<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.510> why<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.690> see<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:18.930> happen<00:00:19.289> also<00:00:19.590> in

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
this is why you see this happen also in

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.710 
this is why you see this happen also in
our<00:00:20.189> fly<00:00:20.520> but<00:00:21.119> one<00:00:21.240> little<00:00:21.449> tip<00:00:21.570> we're<00:00:21.689> going

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
our fly but one little tip we're going

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.359 
our fly but one little tip we're going
to<00:00:21.840> do<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.170> how<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.350> over<00:00:22.800> exaggerate<00:00:23.010> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
to do is how to over exaggerate the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.910 
to do is how to over exaggerate the
range<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.670> motion<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.119> lot<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.600> people<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.140> you

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
range of motion a lot of people and you

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.720 
range of motion a lot of people and you
know<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.160> example<00:00:26.400> if<00:00:26.460> you're<00:00:26.550> doing<00:00:26.609> a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
know for example if you're doing a

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.790 
know for example if you're doing a
barbell<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.480> can<00:00:27.630> really<00:00:27.840> only<00:00:27.990> go<00:00:28.230> right

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
barbell you can really only go right

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.050 
barbell you can really only go right
here<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.250> where<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.550> full<00:00:29.730> elbow

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
here to where you have full elbow

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.400 
here to where you have full elbow
extension<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.539> can't<00:00:30.750> really<00:00:30.929> contract<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
extension you can't really contract the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.930 
extension you can't really contract the
humerus<00:00:31.710> anymore<00:00:32.040> you're<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> fixed<00:00:32.759> bar

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
humerus anymore you're on a fixed bar

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.910 
humerus anymore you're on a fixed bar
when<00:00:33.420> you're<00:00:33.480> doing<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.719> dumbbell<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.710> can

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
when you're doing a dumbbell you can

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.889 
when you're doing a dumbbell you can
come<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.430> little<00:00:35.640> bit<00:00:35.850> closer<00:00:36.090> because<00:00:36.660> usually

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
come a little bit closer because usually

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.209 
come a little bit closer because usually
you<00:00:37.110> can<00:00:37.230> bring<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> dumbbells<00:00:37.739> closer<00:00:38.010> to

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
you can bring the dumbbells closer to

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.350 
you can bring the dumbbells closer to
hang<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.520> sides<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.760> your<00:00:38.820> dumbbells<00:00:39.030> but

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
hang on the sides of your dumbbells but

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.119 
hang on the sides of your dumbbells but
you<00:00:39.450> get<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> little<00:00:39.840> bit<00:00:39.899> more<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.200> there

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
you get a little bit more in there

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.920 
you get a little bit more in there
you<00:00:41.579> know<00:00:41.700> cables<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.329> much<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
you know cables and so much but and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.420 
you know cables and so much but and
fly's<00:00:43.440> you're<00:00:43.649> also<00:00:43.890> limited<00:00:44.190> because<00:00:44.280> you

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
fly's you're also limited because you

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.970 
fly's you're also limited because you
get<00:00:44.550> here<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:44.879> by<00:00:45.239> doing<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.660> one<00:00:45.989> arm<00:00:46.200> basically

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
get here so by doing a one arm basically

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.209 
get here so by doing a one arm basically
cable<00:00:47.579> fly<00:00:48.570> you're<00:00:49.020> able<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.379> over<00:00:49.680> exaggerate

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
cable fly you're able to over exaggerate

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.130 
cable fly you're able to over exaggerate
the<00:00:50.399> range<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.730> motion<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.180> get<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.020> better

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
the range of motion and get a better

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.170 
the range of motion and get a better
contraction<00:00:52.890> by<00:00:53.579> actually<00:00:54.000> just

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
contraction by actually just

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.430 
contraction by actually just
exaggerating<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.899> motion<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.260> we're<00:00:55.350> doing

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
exaggerating the motion that we're doing

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.479 
exaggerating the motion that we're doing
here<00:00:55.620> with<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.800> humerus<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.250> instead<00:00:56.430> of

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
here with the humerus so instead of

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.490 
here with the humerus so instead of
stopping<00:00:56.910> right<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.090> with<00:00:57.960> one<00:00:58.140> arm<00:00:58.289> we're

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
stopping right here with one arm we're

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.630 
stopping right here with one arm we're
actually<00:00:58.620> going<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.920> be<00:00:58.980> able<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.190> come<00:00:59.489> a

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
actually going to be able to come a

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.920 
actually going to be able to come a
little<00:00:59.910> bit<00:01:00.000> farther<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.570> even<00:01:00.719> just

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
little bit farther you can even just

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.660 
little bit farther you can even just
stand<00:01:01.140> there<00:01:01.199> right<00:01:01.410> now<00:01:01.559> watching<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.460> video

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
stand there right now watching the video

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.119 
stand there right now watching the video
and<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.329> come<00:01:03.510> across<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.320> see<00:01:04.619> you

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
and you can come across you can see you

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.410 
and you can come across you can see you
get<00:01:05.250> more<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.670> contraction<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.390> muscle

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
get more of a contraction the muscle

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.300 
get more of a contraction the muscle
gets<00:01:06.840> tighter<00:01:07.080> as<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.590> bring<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.830> father<00:01:08.070> so

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
gets tighter as you bring a father so

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.500 
gets tighter as you bring a father so
rather<00:01:08.430> than<00:01:08.580> ending<00:01:08.880> right<00:01:09.030> here<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.479> just

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
rather than ending right here and just

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.690 
rather than ending right here and just
having<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.049> 90<00:01:10.260> degree<00:01:10.560> range<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.890> motion<00:01:11.159> you

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
having a 90 degree range of motion you

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.270 
having a 90 degree range of motion you
can<00:01:11.790> go<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> little<00:01:11.970> bit<00:01:12.780> farther<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.680> got<00:01:14.159> to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
can go a little bit farther so I got to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.149 
can go a little bit farther so I got to
set<00:01:14.400> up<00:01:14.490> right<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.970> guys<00:01:16.009> like<00:01:17.009> I

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
I'm machines like this it's kind of nice

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.350 
I'm machines like this it's kind of nice
because<00:01:20.580> when<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.820> go<00:01:20.909> heavy<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.210> can

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
because when you go heavy you can

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.510 
because when you go heavy you can
actually<00:01:21.479> grab<00:01:21.780> onto<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> opposite<00:01:22.530> side<00:01:22.710> but

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
actually grab onto the opposite side but

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.950 
actually grab onto the opposite side but
generally<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.150> stop<00:01:24.360> right<00:01:24.570> here<00:01:24.750> because

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
generally you stop right here because

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.630 
generally you stop right here because
you<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.140> your<00:01:25.229> other<00:01:25.320> hand<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.490> can

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
you have your other hand so what you can

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.130 
you have your other hand so what you can
do<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.540> boom

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
do now is boom

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.929 
do now is boom
I<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.590> exaggerated<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.280> range<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.610> motion<00:01:29.880> I

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
I just exaggerated the range of motion I

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.899 
I just exaggerated the range of motion I
can<00:01:30.090> feel<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.420> contraction<00:01:31.460> way<00:01:32.460> more<00:01:32.759> than

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
can feel that contraction way more than

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.929 
can feel that contraction way more than
I<00:01:33.000> would<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.479> was<00:01:33.600> limited<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.020> right<00:01:34.170> here

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
I would if I was limited to right here

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.039 
I would if I was limited to right here
so<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> couple<00:01:36.420> reps<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.869> for<00:01:36.990> you

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
so just get a couple reps in for you

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.560 
so just get a couple reps in for you
guys<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.320> see

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570

boom<00:01:39.350> right<00:01:39.740> there<00:01:40.010> I<00:01:40.220> tend<00:01:40.910> to<00:01:40.940> like<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.210> throw

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
boom right there I tend to like to throw

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.450 
boom right there I tend to like to throw
this<00:01:41.540> in<00:01:41.780> towards<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:42.680> end<00:01:42.770> of<00:01:42.950> my<00:01:43.070> workouts

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.560 
get the most stimulation but I know a
lot<00:01:49.910> of<00:01:49.940> people<00:01:50.150> like<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.270> call<00:01:50.390> this<00:01:50.510> a

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
lot of people like to call this a

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.240 
lot of people like to call this a
shaping<00:01:50.810> exercise<00:01:51.320> but<00:01:51.560> by<00:01:51.650> throwing<00:01:51.890> that<00:01:52.070> in

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
shaping exercise but by throwing that in

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.160 
shaping exercise but by throwing that in
more<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.120> at<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.270> end<00:01:53.330> of<00:01:53.420> your<00:01:53.510> workout<00:01:53.840> or<00:01:54.080> if

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
more so at the end of your workout or if

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.970 
more so at the end of your workout or if
you<00:01:54.230> want<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.410> pre-exhaust

wherever you honestly want to fit into

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.310 
wherever you honestly want to fit into
your<00:01:56.150> program<00:01:56.570> you<00:01:56.690> can<00:01:56.810> probably<00:01:56.960> find<00:01:57.170> a

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
your program you can probably find a

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.870 
your program you can probably find a
real<00:01:57.470> reason<00:01:57.770> for<00:01:57.800> it<00:01:57.979> but<00:01:58.490> this<00:01:58.580> is<00:01:58.700> going<00:01:58.820> to

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
real reason for it but this is going to

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.380 
real reason for it but this is going to
allow<00:01:59.000> you<00:01:59.060> to<00:01:59.510> get<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:01.310> bigger<00:02:01.760> range<00:02:02.180> of

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
allow you to get a bigger range of

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.790 
allow you to get a bigger range of
motion<00:02:02.720> and<00:02:02.900> get<00:02:03.050> a<00:02:03.080> better<00:02:03.229> contraction

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
motion and get a better contraction

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.990 
motion and get a better contraction
throw<00:02:04.040> that<00:02:04.190> in<00:02:04.250> with<00:02:04.340> your<00:02:04.370> training<00:02:04.670> let<00:02:04.940> me
