00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
very very nice team so in the goalkeeper

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.030 
very very nice team so in the goalkeeper
position<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.230> start<00:00:43.469> off<00:00:43.559> with<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> decent

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
position we start off with a decent

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.520 
position we start off with a decent
goalkeeper<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.059> my<00:00:45.360> opinion<00:00:45.719> because<00:00:46.050> i<00:00:46.260> am<00:00:46.469> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
goalkeeper in my opinion because i am a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.260 
goalkeeper in my opinion because i am a
Liverpool<00:00:46.950> fan<00:00:46.980> even<00:00:47.789> though<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:47.910> wasn't<00:00:48.149> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
Liverpool fan even though it wasn't a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.380 
Liverpool fan even though it wasn't a
decent<00:00:48.600> goalkeeper<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.500> McNally<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:51.149> just

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
decent goalkeeper it is McNally and just

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.299 
decent goalkeeper it is McNally and just
for<00:00:51.570> chemistry<00:00:51.899> reasons<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.829> does<00:00:53.039> add

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
for chemistry reasons and it does add

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.709 
for chemistry reasons and it does add
the<00:00:53.489> ability<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.910> get<00:00:54.030> into<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> forced<00:00:54.629> a
