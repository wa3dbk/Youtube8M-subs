okay right in this video I'm testing out

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.420 
okay right in this video I'm testing out
the<00:00:02.689> brightness<00:00:03.799> supposed<00:00:04.799> brightness

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
the brightness supposed brightness

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.110 
the brightness supposed brightness

difference
yeah<00:00:06.359> with<00:00:06.540> GoPro<00:00:06.899> hero3<00:00:07.200> versus<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.010> GoPro

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
yeah with GoPro hero3 versus the GoPro

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.150 
yeah with GoPro hero3 versus the GoPro
hero2<00:00:08.580> so<00:00:08.849> just<00:00:09.059> now<00:00:09.210> this<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.500> in<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.769> GoPro

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160

October so half past six in Scotland in

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.170 
October so half past six in Scotland in
October<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.649> pretty<00:00:35.070> darn<00:00:35.399> dark<00:00:35.730> all<00:00:35.940> you're

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
October is pretty darn dark all you're

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.630 
October is pretty darn dark all you're
really<00:00:36.420> seeing<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.899> light<00:00:37.620> from<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.160> outdoor

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
really seeing is light from the outdoor

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.209 
really seeing is light from the outdoor
street<00:00:39.510> lights<00:00:39.690> but<00:00:40.320> also<00:00:40.469> with<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> car

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
street lights but also with the car

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.840 
street lights but also with the car
lights<00:00:41.460> on

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
lights on

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.400 
lights on
that's<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.600> brightness<00:00:42.899> there<00:00:43.050> isn't<00:00:43.260> however

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
that's a brightness there isn't however

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.590 
that's a brightness there isn't however
the<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.460> main<00:00:44.610> thing<00:00:44.640> about<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.360> want

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
the the main thing about this is I want

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.450 
the the main thing about this is I want
to<00:00:45.629> see<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.989> difference<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.070> quality<00:00:47.190> that

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
to see the difference in quality that

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.139 
to see the difference in quality that
you<00:00:47.579> get<00:00:48.140> but<00:00:49.140> when<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:49.829> swap<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.520> GoPro<00:00:50.850> hero3

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
you get but when we swap the GoPro hero3

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.410 
you get but when we swap the GoPro hero3
from<00:00:51.629> its<00:00:51.780> normal<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.530> camera<00:00:53.309> settings<00:00:53.730> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
from its normal in camera settings to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.990 
from its normal in camera settings to
its<00:00:54.570> protuding<00:00:55.350> settings<00:00:56.010> okay<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.520> what<00:00:56.879> to

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
its protuding settings okay so what to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.180 
its protuding settings okay so what to
do<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:58.289> couple<00:00:58.559> seconds<00:00:58.800> we'll<00:00:58.920> change

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
do is in a couple seconds we'll change

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.660 
do is in a couple seconds we'll change
it<00:00:59.280> over<00:00:59.460> here<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.820> goes<00:01:01.190> okay<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.250> now<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
it over here it goes okay so now the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.230 
it over here it goes okay so now the
GoPro<00:01:03.120> Hero<00:01:03.180> 3<00:01:03.660> plus<00:01:03.989> by<00:01:04.170> Edition<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.769> now

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
GoPro Hero 3 plus by Edition is now

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.570 
GoPro Hero 3 plus by Edition is now
recording<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.619> protune<00:01:07.619> settings<00:01:08.250> this

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
recording in protune settings this

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.609 
recording in protune settings this
should<00:01:08.850> mean<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.420> there's<00:01:09.869> more<00:01:10.140> dynamic

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
should mean that there's more dynamic

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.710 
should mean that there's more dynamic
range<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.760> whole<00:01:11.939> file<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.479> should<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.689> a

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
range in the whole file it should be a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.780 
range in the whole file it should be a
flatter<00:01:13.080> file<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.710> less<00:01:13.950> punchy<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:14.640> that

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
flatter file so less punchy and all that

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.760 
flatter file so less punchy and all that
stuff<00:01:15.090> however<00:01:15.930> there's<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> potential<00:01:16.619> that

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
stuff however there's the potential that

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.760 
stuff however there's the potential that
there's<00:01:17.009> more<00:01:18.110> more<00:01:19.110> information<00:01:19.290> that's

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
there's more more information that's

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.649 
there's more more information that's
being<00:01:19.890> caught<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.460> my<00:01:20.700> face<00:01:21.090> maybe<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.540> can

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
being caught on my face maybe you can

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.760 
being caught on my face maybe you can
see<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.020> was<00:01:22.140> large<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.650> was<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
see that that was large and that was a

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.899 
see that that was large and that was a
green<00:01:23.009> light<00:01:23.040> from<00:01:23.490> me<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.729> go<00:01:23.909> forward<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.860> and

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
green light from me to go forward on and

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.359 
green light from me to go forward on and
it's<00:01:26.909> more<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.229> test<00:01:28.590> really<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.159> see

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
it's more so this test really is to see

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.190 
it's more so this test really is to see
that<00:01:29.880> there<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.329> difference<00:01:30.810> between<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
that there is a difference between the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.490 
that there is a difference between the
GoPro<00:01:31.500> Hero<00:01:31.530> 2<00:01:32.390> versus<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.450> GoPro<00:01:33.689> Hero<00:01:33.720> 3<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
GoPro Hero 2 versus the GoPro Hero 3 and

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.710 
GoPro Hero 2 versus the GoPro Hero 3 and
then<00:01:34.770> even<00:01:35.040> within<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.700> 3<00:01:35.970> there<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.689> a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
then even within the 3 there is a

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.990 
then even within the 3 there is a
difference<00:01:37.079> between<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.650> protein<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
difference between the protein and the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.980 
difference between the protein and the
non<00:01:39.290> protein<00:01:40.290> settings<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:42.360> more<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.780> see

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
non protein settings so it's more to see

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.780 
non protein settings so it's more to see
Walda<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.500> also<00:01:43.770> all<00:01:43.890> edit<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.399> protein

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
Walda is also all edit the protein

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.910 
Walda is also all edit the protein
settings<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.869> see<00:01:46.229> if<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.500> make<00:01:46.649> them<00:01:46.799> any

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
settings and see if I can make them any

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.969 
settings and see if I can make them any
better<00:01:48.229> that<00:01:49.229> because<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.590> might<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:49.829> be<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
better that because it might just be a

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.649 
better that because it might just be a
bit<00:01:50.100> too<00:01:50.250> flat<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:51.000> otherwise<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:51.479> Lee

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
bit too flat but otherwise I think Lee

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.230 
bit too flat but otherwise I think Lee
is<00:01:51.689> capturing<00:01:52.649> more<00:01:52.860> detail<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.670> shadows

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
is capturing more detail in the shadows

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.569 
is capturing more detail in the shadows
and<00:01:54.689> your<00:01:55.049> your<00:01:55.290> there<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.860> lot<00:01:56.100> more<00:01:56.250> light

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
and your your there is a lot more light

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.910 
and your your there is a lot more light
which<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.909> being<00:01:57.090> captured<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:58.259> from<00:01:58.500> things

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
which is being captured just from things

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.649 
which is being captured just from things
raised<00:01:59.189> all<00:01:59.399> these<00:01:59.579> cars<00:01:59.820> are<00:01:59.969> driving<00:02:00.420> past

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
raised all these cars are driving past

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.780 
raised all these cars are driving past
maybe<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.649> cars<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.040> front<00:02:02.159> me<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.549> street

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
maybe the cars in front me the street

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.780 
maybe the cars in front me the street
lights<00:02:03.000> maybe<00:02:03.509> there

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
lights maybe there

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.620 
lights maybe there
is<00:02:03.940> definitely<00:02:04.720> more<00:02:04.930> detail<00:02:05.410> being<00:02:06.010> captured

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
is definitely more detail being captured

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.280 
is definitely more detail being captured
so<00:02:07.630> there<00:02:07.930> you<00:02:07.990> go

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
so there you go

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.880 
so there you go
hope<00:02:08.590> that<00:02:08.860> helps<00:02:09.430> bye-bye
