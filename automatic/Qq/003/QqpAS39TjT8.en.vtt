bone<00:00:13.910> marrow<00:00:14.209> is<00:00:14.599> the<00:00:14.839> spongy<00:00:15.349> material

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
bone marrow is the spongy material

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.839 
bone marrow is the spongy material
inside<00:00:16.580> bones<00:00:16.939> that<00:00:17.900> houses<00:00:18.710> various<00:00:19.220> kinds

inside bones that houses various kinds
of<00:00:19.970> cells<00:00:20.180> like<00:00:20.480> stem<00:00:20.840> cells<00:00:21.289> and<00:00:21.740> precursor

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
of cells like stem cells and precursor

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.269 
of cells like stem cells and precursor
cells<00:00:22.970> that<00:00:23.689> make<00:00:24.050> up<00:00:24.079> the<00:00:24.470> other<00:00:24.619> cells<00:00:25.039> of

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
cells that make up the other cells of

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.550 
cells that make up the other cells of
our<00:00:25.430> body<00:00:25.699> like<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:26.419> immune<00:00:26.720> system<00:00:27.289> cells

our body like the immune system cells
stem<00:00:28.550> cells<00:00:28.970> specifically<00:00:29.720> are<00:00:29.990> important

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
stem cells specifically are important

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.700 
stem cells specifically are important
because<00:00:30.730> those<00:00:31.730> are<00:00:31.939> the<00:00:32.059> cells<00:00:32.360> that

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
because those are the cells that

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.560 
because those are the cells that
differentiate<00:00:33.710> or<00:00:34.010> change<00:00:34.400> into<00:00:34.820> other<00:00:35.000> cells

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
differentiate or change into other cells

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.470 
differentiate or change into other cells
let<00:00:36.080> me<00:00:36.199> give<00:00:36.379> you<00:00:36.470> an<00:00:36.559> example<00:00:36.650> if<00:00:37.460> a<00:00:37.760> red

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
let me give you an example if a red

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.319 
let me give you an example if a red
blood<00:00:38.780> cell<00:00:39.140> dies<00:00:39.410> it<00:00:39.769> has<00:00:39.949> to<00:00:40.129> be<00:00:40.309> replaced<00:00:40.670> so

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
blood cell dies it has to be replaced so

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.869 
blood cell dies it has to be replaced so
eventually<00:00:41.680> there'll<00:00:42.680> be<00:00:42.710> a<00:00:42.860> stem<00:00:43.250> cell<00:00:43.640> that

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
eventually there'll be a stem cell that

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.439 
eventually there'll be a stem cell that
will<00:00:44.030> change<00:00:44.329> into<00:00:44.870> a<00:00:44.900> red<00:00:45.260> blood<00:00:45.530> cell<00:00:45.590> and

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
will change into a red blood cell and

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.420 
will change into a red blood cell and
replace<00:00:47.449> that<00:00:47.809> red<00:00:48.050> blood<00:00:48.350> cell<00:00:48.710> well<00:00:49.280> the

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
replace that red blood cell well the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.250 
replace that red blood cell well the
main<00:00:49.640> reason<00:00:49.879> that<00:00:50.239> stem<00:00:50.570> cells<00:00:50.899> are<00:00:51.050> so

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
main reason that stem cells are so

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.930 
main reason that stem cells are so
important<00:00:51.800> is<00:00:51.920> that<00:00:52.129> these<00:00:52.309> are<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:52.640> cells

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
important is that these are the cells

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.299 
important is that these are the cells
that<00:00:53.149> are<00:00:53.300> used<00:00:53.719> by<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.020> body<00:00:54.379> to<00:00:54.710> turn<00:00:54.949> into

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
that are used by the body to turn into

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.150 
that are used by the body to turn into
other<00:00:55.460> cells<00:00:55.969> every<00:00:56.719> cell<00:00:57.350> has<00:00:57.379> a<00:00:57.680> specific

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
other cells every cell has a specific

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.509 
other cells every cell has a specific
life<00:00:59.000> span<00:00:59.539> like<00:01:00.350> red<00:01:00.590> blood<00:01:00.920> cells<00:01:01.219> are<00:01:01.370> only

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
life span like red blood cells are only

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.279 
life span like red blood cells are only
going<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:01.760> be<00:01:01.910> around<00:01:02.149> for<00:01:02.480> a<00:01:02.539> few<00:01:02.780> months<00:01:02.989> and

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
going to be around for a few months and

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.919 
going to be around for a few months and
then<00:01:03.379> they<00:01:03.530> have<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:03.739> be<00:01:04.039> replaced<00:01:04.630> stem<00:01:05.630> cells

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:05.929 
then they have to be replaced stem cells

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:07.830 
then they have to be replaced stem cells
are<00:01:06.110> very<00:01:06.320> important<00:01:06.800> in<00:01:06.860> musculoskeletal

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
are very important in musculoskeletal

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.410 
are very important in musculoskeletal
conditions<00:01:08.840> because<00:01:09.289> the<00:01:10.190> cells<00:01:10.520> that<00:01:10.970> form

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
conditions because the cells that form

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.889 
conditions because the cells that form
ligaments<00:01:12.259> and<00:01:12.380> tendons<00:01:12.470> called<00:01:13.190> fibroblasts

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
ligaments and tendons called fibroblasts

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.710 
ligaments and tendons called fibroblasts
have<00:01:14.899> to<00:01:15.140> be<00:01:15.289> replaced<00:01:15.800> every<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:16.490> often<00:01:16.759> so

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
have to be replaced every so often so

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.980 
have to be replaced every so often so
ligaments<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:18.440> tendons<00:01:18.530> can<00:01:19.190> be<00:01:19.369> repaired

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
ligaments and tendons can be repaired

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.680 
ligaments and tendons can be repaired
there's<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.080> lot<00:01:21.170> of<00:01:21.349> excitement<00:01:21.890> in

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
there's a lot of excitement in

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.330 
there's a lot of excitement in
orthopedic<00:01:23.690> medicine<00:01:23.959> as<00:01:24.649> it<00:01:24.890> relates<00:01:24.920> to

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
orthopedic medicine as it relates to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.820 
orthopedic medicine as it relates to
cartilage<00:01:26.030> because<00:01:26.470> chondrocytes<00:01:27.470> which

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
cartilage because chondrocytes which

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.910 
cartilage because chondrocytes which
makes<00:01:28.130> cartilage<00:01:28.880> cells<00:01:29.590> basically<00:01:30.590> get

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
makes cartilage cells basically get

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.449 
makes cartilage cells basically get
fewer<00:01:31.250> and<00:01:31.520> fewer<00:01:31.759> in<00:01:32.030> number<00:01:32.479> as<00:01:32.690> we<00:01:32.959> age<00:01:33.459> so

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:34.459 
fewer and fewer in number as we age so

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:36.900 
fewer and fewer in number as we age so
the<00:01:34.640> thought<00:01:34.880> is<00:01:34.940> if<00:01:35.509> we<00:01:35.840> could<00:01:36.140> stimulate

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
the thought is if we could stimulate

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.109 
the thought is if we could stimulate
stem<00:01:37.910> cells<00:01:38.410> to<00:01:39.410> form<00:01:39.739> cartilage<00:01:40.520> cells<00:01:40.759> and

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
stem cells to form cartilage cells and

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.900 
stem cells to form cartilage cells and
we<00:01:41.209> inject<00:01:41.599> these<00:01:41.869> cells<00:01:42.440> into<00:01:43.099> joints<00:01:43.789> like

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
we inject these cells into joints like

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.180 
we inject these cells into joints like
the<00:01:44.119> knee<00:01:44.300> joint<00:01:44.470> that<00:01:45.470> there's<00:01:45.920> great

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
the knee joint that there's great

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.580 
the knee joint that there's great
potential<00:01:46.670> for<00:01:46.910> cartilage<00:01:47.539> repair<00:01:47.959> and

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
potential for cartilage repair and

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.800 
potential for cartilage repair and
obviously<00:01:49.489> if<00:01:49.759> we<00:01:49.910> could<00:01:50.090> repair<00:01:50.479> cartilage

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
obviously if we could repair cartilage

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.559 
obviously if we could repair cartilage
then<00:01:51.410> conditions<00:01:51.950> like<00:01:52.330> osteoarthritis<00:01:53.330> or

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
then conditions like osteoarthritis or

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:55.749 
then conditions like osteoarthritis or
when<00:01:53.840> athletes<00:01:54.020> get<00:01:54.470> cartilage<00:01:55.069> lesions<00:01:55.369> or

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
when athletes get cartilage lesions or

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.210 
when athletes get cartilage lesions or
cartilage<00:01:56.119> injuries<00:01:56.810> then<00:01:57.470> they<00:01:57.979> wouldn't

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
cartilage injuries then they wouldn't

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.180 
cartilage injuries then they wouldn't
have<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.429> undergo<00:01:58.910> very<00:01:59.899> expensive<00:02:00.770> invasive

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
have to undergo very expensive invasive

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.660 
have to undergo very expensive invasive
surgeries<00:02:01.970> we<00:02:02.119> could<00:02:02.330> just<00:02:02.509> inject<00:02:03.250> up<00:02:04.250> either

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
surgeries we could just inject up either

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.029 
surgeries we could just inject up either
cartilage<00:02:05.360> cells<00:02:05.629> or<00:02:05.959> stem<00:02:06.200> cells<00:02:06.590> into<00:02:06.950> the

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
cartilage cells or stem cells into the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.460 
cartilage cells or stem cells into the
body<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:07.729> it<00:02:07.879> is<00:02:08.000> a<00:02:08.030> pretty<00:02:08.479> exciting<00:02:09.050> time<00:02:09.259> as

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
body so it is a pretty exciting time as

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.970 
body so it is a pretty exciting time as
it<00:02:09.590> relates<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:10.009> prolotherapy
