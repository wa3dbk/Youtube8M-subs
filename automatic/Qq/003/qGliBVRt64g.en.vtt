00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.100 
wonder why Carl Edwards would make a
move<00:02:25.860> like<00:02:26.070> that<00:02:26.100> on<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.430> straightaway<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:28.020> I

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
move like that on the straightaway and I

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.690 
move like that on the straightaway and I
made<00:02:28.260> an<00:02:28.560> abrupt<00:02:28.740> move<00:02:28.980> up<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.310> outside

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
made an abrupt move up to the outside

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.830 
made an abrupt move up to the outside
lane<00:02:29.970> there<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.210> don't<00:02:30.420> know<00:02:30.480> if<00:02:30.540> he<00:02:30.600> thought<00:02:30.720> it

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
lane there I don't know if he thought it

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.570 
lane there I don't know if he thought it
was<00:02:30.870> clear<00:02:31.230> now<00:02:31.620> sometimes<00:02:32.040> you're<00:02:32.250> moving

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
was clear now sometimes you're moving

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.360 
was clear now sometimes you're moving
over<00:02:32.850> just<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.150> get<00:02:33.300> against<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:33.780> car<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:35.190> try

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
over just to get against that car to try

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.760 
over just to get against that car to try
to<00:02:35.430> slow<00:02:36.210> that<00:02:36.360> car<00:02:36.420> down<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:37.140> momentum<00:02:37.650> to

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
to slow that car down that momentum to

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.260 
to slow that car down that momentum to
where<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.100> can<00:02:38.250> get<00:02:38.370> your<00:02:38.430> line<00:02:38.760> moving<00:02:39.180> a

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
where you can get your line moving a

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.020 
where you can get your line moving a
little<00:02:39.420> bit<00:02:39.540> quicker<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.700> maybe<00:02:41.700> he<00:02:42.000> just

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
little bit quicker and maybe he just

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.150 
little bit quicker and maybe he just
misjudged<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.380> has<00:02:43.680> happened<00:02:43.920> before

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
misjudged that it has happened before

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.220 
misjudged that it has happened before
but<00:02:45.120> that's<00:02:45.270> what<00:02:45.420> these<00:02:45.540> guys<00:02:45.720> are<00:02:45.780> trying<00:02:46.110> to

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
but that's what these guys are trying to

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.640 
but that's what these guys are trying to
do<00:02:46.410> is<00:02:46.590> just<00:02:46.800> side<00:02:47.460> draft<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.410> slow<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.620> car

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
do is just side draft and slow that car

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.620 
do is just side draft and slow that car
beside<00:02:50.400> them<00:02:50.550> down<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.970> where<00:02:51.180> their<00:02:51.390> line

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
beside them down to where their line

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.140 
beside them down to where their line
will<00:02:51.780> move<00:02:51.810> quicker<00:02:52.340> Greg<00:02:53.340> Biffle<00:02:53.730> also

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
will move quicker Greg Biffle also

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.360 
will move quicker Greg Biffle also
involved<00:02:54.660> let's<00:02:54.810> go<00:02:54.930> on<00:02:55.080> board<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:56.220> the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
involved let's go on board this is the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.790 
involved let's go on board this is the
view<00:02:56.520> from<00:02:56.580> jr.<00:02:57.110> that's<00:02:58.110> where<00:02:58.350> he<00:02:58.470> just<00:02:58.620> got

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
view from jr. that's where he just got

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.230 
view from jr. that's where he just got
turned<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.460> when<00:02:59.670> you<00:02:59.730> get<00:02:59.820> hit<00:02:59.910> in<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.090> right

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
turned it when you get hit in the right

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.760 
turned it when you get hit in the right
rear<00:03:00.510> there's<00:03:00.840> nothing<00:03:01.080> you<00:03:01.170> can<00:03:01.290> do<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.620> of

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
rear there's nothing you can do and of

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.290 
rear there's nothing you can do and of
course<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.100> air<00:03:02.280> automatically<00:03:03.030> gets

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
course the air automatically gets

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.050 
course the air automatically gets
underneath<00:03:04.050> that<00:03:04.260> car<00:03:04.500> right<00:03:04.740> then<00:03:04.980> let's<00:03:05.820> see

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
underneath that car right then let's see

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.180 
underneath that car right then let's see
here

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
here

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.440 
here
see<00:03:08.850> Carl<00:03:09.120> moving<00:03:09.600> over<00:03:11.000> yeah<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.030> think<00:03:12.300> he

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
see Carl moving over yeah I think he

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.090 
see Carl moving over yeah I think he
just<00:03:12.480> his<00:03:12.870> intentions<00:03:13.410> were<00:03:13.530> just<00:03:13.770> to<00:03:13.860> get

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
just his intentions were just to get

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.620 
just his intentions were just to get
over<00:03:14.250> there<00:03:14.550> but<00:03:14.730> he<00:03:14.790> could<00:03:14.910> see<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:15.210> outside

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
over there but he could see that outside

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.570 
over there but he could see that outside
line<00:03:15.840> moving<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.290> little<00:03:16.470> bit<00:03:16.590> just<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.400> slow

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
line moving a little bit just to slow

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.370 
line moving a little bit just to slow
them<00:03:17.790> down<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.600> don't<00:03:18.660> know<00:03:18.840> if<00:03:18.930> Brad<00:03:19.140> came

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
them down and I don't know if Brad came

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.290 
them down and I don't know if Brad came
down<00:03:19.590> just<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:20.010> little<00:03:20.250> nothing<00:03:20.910> that<00:03:21.060> Brad<00:03:21.270> was

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
down just a little nothing that Brad was

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.840 
down just a little nothing that Brad was
doing<00:03:21.690> Rome<00:03:21.870> but<00:03:22.110> it<00:03:22.410> only<00:03:22.530> takes<00:03:22.950> just<00:03:23.730> a

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
doing Rome but it only takes just a

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.000 
doing Rome but it only takes just a
split<00:03:24.210> second<00:03:24.780> of<00:03:24.930> both<00:03:25.350> of<00:03:25.380> these<00:03:25.590> drivers

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
split second of both of these drivers

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.220 
split second of both of these drivers
moving<00:03:26.190> in<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:26.580> same<00:03:26.790> direction<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:27.630> that

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
moving in the same direction and that

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:36.770 
moving in the same direction and that
creates<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.800> content

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.270 

so<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.900> work<00:03:38.080> context<00:03:38.410> is<00:03:38.590> go<00:03:38.739> on<00:03:38.890> board<00:03:39.040> just

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
so the work context is go on board just

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:49.390 
so the work context is go on board just
listen

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:57.390 

gather<00:03:50.000> up

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.820 

it's<00:03:58.400> from<00:03:58.550> high<00:03:58.700> above<00:03:59.080> yeah<00:04:00.080> Carl<00:04:00.470> may<00:04:00.680> have

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
it's from high above yeah Carl may have

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.020 
it's from high above yeah Carl may have
actually<00:04:01.010> been<00:04:01.220> trying<00:04:01.580> to<00:04:01.640> get<00:04:01.730> in<00:04:01.790> the

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
actually been trying to get in the

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.520 
actually been trying to get in the
outside<00:04:02.450> lane<00:04:02.510> there<00:04:03.050> it<00:04:03.140> looked<00:04:03.320> like<00:04:03.410> he

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
outside lane there it looked like he

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.130 
outside lane there it looked like he
thought<00:04:03.710> he<00:04:03.830> judged<00:04:04.610> and<00:04:05.540> was<00:04:05.720> trying<00:04:05.900> to<00:04:05.960> get

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
thought he judged and was trying to get

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.570 
thought he judged and was trying to get
in<00:04:06.230> that<00:04:06.260> hole<00:04:06.500> before<00:04:06.710> it<00:04:06.890> closed<00:04:07.100> up<00:04:07.340> but<00:04:07.520> he

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
in that hole before it closed up but he

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.000 
in that hole before it closed up but he
misjudged<00:04:08.420> the<00:04:08.510> front<00:04:08.750> of<00:04:08.840> his<00:04:08.930> car<00:04:09.140> you<00:04:09.920> know

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
misjudged the front of his car you know

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.740 
misjudged the front of his car you know
we've<00:04:10.160> seen<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:10.490> a<00:04:10.550> number<00:04:10.880> of<00:04:11.060> times<00:04:11.210> down

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
we've seen that a number of times down

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.150 
we've seen that a number of times down
here<00:04:11.960> this<00:04:12.140> week<00:04:12.410> in<00:04:12.620> both<00:04:12.770> the<00:04:12.920> Cup<00:04:13.130> Series

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
here this week in both the Cup Series

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.400 
here this week in both the Cup Series
and<00:04:13.790> now<00:04:14.330> in<00:04:14.390> this<00:04:14.600> series<00:04:14.870> to<00:04:14.960> where<00:04:15.200> guys<00:04:15.380> are

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
and now in this series to where guys are

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.160 
and now in this series to where guys are
misjudging<00:04:16.220> just<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.549> little<00:04:16.880> bit<00:04:17.090> and<00:04:17.810> it<00:04:17.959> only

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
misjudging just a little bit and it only

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.620 
misjudging just a little bit and it only
takes<00:04:18.470> a<00:04:18.620> little<00:04:18.650> bit<00:04:19.120> there<00:04:20.120> it<00:04:20.150> is<00:04:20.330> in<00:04:20.480> real

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
takes a little bit there it is in real

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:28.360 
takes a little bit there it is in real
time<00:04:26.470> I'm<00:04:27.470> going<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.680> say<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:27.830> think<00:04:27.980> it's<00:04:28.310> just

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
time I'm going to say I think it's just

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.790 
time I'm going to say I think it's just
