00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 the glorious third flock 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.560
 of the Italian air force born 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.750
 in 1931 in time of war ha 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:15.000
 participated in all campaigns up to 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.859
 September 1943 from 1945 the flock comes 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.180
 hosted in various military airports 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.460
 Italians from 1954 and after 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.859
 taken at the military airport 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.410
 of verona villafranca and up to some 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.820
 year ago the flock lived the grownups 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.820
 changes in the aeronautical field 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.670
 passing by propeller-driven aircraft 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.460
 to the jets currently although not 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.410
 equipped with its own aerial components 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.510
 flock has the main task of 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.120
 ensure the survival capacity 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.399
 operational and logistical support to 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.010
 departments to the mobile components of the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.289
 command and control system 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.870
 out of their own offices in particular 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.219
 in military operations beyond the borders 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.590
 national 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.109
 in these days the command of the third 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.719
 flock was hired by the colonel 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.869
 maximum cicerone replaces the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.840
 Colonel Mark Maistrello I leave 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.850
 airport with a beautiful memory is a 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.830
 a bit of nostalgia right now because it is 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.960
 it was a very intense experience e 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.500
 challenging but that I will always carry in 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.229
 heart 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.540
 so both for activities we have 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.500
 carried out but above all for relationships 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.299
 humans that I managed to get here 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.070
 in short with the people both inside the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.939
 relationship that out then really the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.490
 real experience 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.680
 the third flock as we have seen 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.780
 is of particular importance for 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.030
 ensure the survival of the troops 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.220
 employed in peace operations and outside 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.430
 of Italy in particular in these years 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.630
 at this time in Afghanistan as 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.049
 we face as I said in the speech 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.479
 with so much determination and with 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.210
 the awareness of having staff 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.740
 trained and ready prepared to 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.560
 commitments that the superior authorities there 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.270
 they will want to entrust future commitments 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.860
 but as the master commander said 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.390
 in his farewell speech we do not 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.979
 we are always busy 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.500
 always present everywhere 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.390
 therefore we prefer not to appear 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.860
 we are engaged in the re-deployment of 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.660
 of Afghanistan as I said in mine 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.370
 settlement speech and so this 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.370
 surely it will be the main goal
