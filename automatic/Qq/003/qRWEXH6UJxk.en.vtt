like that this is a standard grip for
almost<00:00:28.800> all<00:00:29.039> bluegrass<00:00:29.730> mandolin<00:00:30.150> players

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
probably not invented by Barney McKenna

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.190 
probably not invented by Barney McKenna
but<00:00:35.880> certainly<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.239> one<00:00:36.420> he's<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:37.050> who

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
but certainly the one he's the one who

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.380 
but certainly the one he's the one who
showed<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.710> everybody<00:00:37.920> as<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.670> bet<00:00:39.059> thumb

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
showed it to everybody as a bet thumb

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.740 
showed it to everybody as a bet thumb
and<00:00:40.399> the<00:00:41.399> bent<00:00:41.640> thumb<00:00:41.940> has<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> lot<00:00:42.570> of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
and the bent thumb has a lot of

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.330 
and the bent thumb has a lot of
advantages<00:00:43.320> here's<00:00:43.620> what<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.920> looks<00:00:44.160> like

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
advantages here's what it looks like

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.430 
advantages here's what it looks like
there's<00:00:45.149> actually<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.480> lot<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.780> variations<00:00:46.320> of

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
there's actually a lot of variations of

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.540 
there's actually a lot of variations of
this<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.649> don't<00:00:46.710> know<00:00:46.860> I'll<00:00:46.980> show<00:00:47.190> them<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.430> you

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
this I don't know I'll show them to you

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.500 
this I don't know I'll show them to you
as<00:00:47.700> time<00:00:47.910> goes<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:49.550> now<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.610> main<00:00:50.969> reason<00:00:51.000> why

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
as time goes on now the main reason why

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.510 
as time goes on now the main reason why
the<00:00:51.570> mechanic's<00:00:52.140> grip<00:00:52.260> works<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.039> well<00:00:53.219> is

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
the mechanic's grip works so well is

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.959 
the mechanic's grip works so well is
stability<00:00:54.260> if<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.440> look<00:00:55.620> at<00:00:55.739> my<00:00:55.860> hand<00:00:56.160> mmm

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
stability if you look at my hand mmm

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.729 
stability if you look at my hand mmm
you'll<00:00:57.149> see<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.600> you'll<00:00:58.230> see<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.559> when<00:00:58.710> I

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
you'll see that you'll see that when I

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.250 
you'll see that you'll see that when I
bend<00:00:59.070> my<00:00:59.129> thumb<00:00:59.489> like<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:00.930> lay<00:01:01.140> it

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
bend my thumb like this and just lay it

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.329 
bend my thumb like this and just lay it
against<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> finger<00:01:02.600> it's<00:01:03.600> very<00:01:03.930> stable<00:01:04.339> and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
against the finger it's very stable and

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.070 
against the finger it's very stable and
I'm<00:01:05.519> not<00:01:05.700> exerting<00:01:06.210> much<00:01:06.360> force<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.780> all<00:01:06.869> it's

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
I'm not exerting much force at all it's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.500 
I'm not exerting much force at all it's
mostly<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> weight<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:08.790> finger<00:01:09.330> my

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
mostly just the weight of my finger my

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.280 
mostly just the weight of my finger my
thumb<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.310> natural<00:01:11.760> flexing<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.360> my<00:01:12.540> my

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
thumb and the natural flexing of my my

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.890 
thumb and the natural flexing of my my
muscle<00:01:13.740> stuff<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.460> put<00:01:14.700> two<00:01:14.820> pick<00:01:15.750> in

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
muscle stuff like if I put two pick in

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.960 
muscle stuff like if I put two pick in
between<00:01:16.259> there<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.430> what<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.700> looks<00:01:17.880> like

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
between there this is what it looks like

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.109 
between there this is what it looks like
now<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.869> may<00:01:19.080> seem<00:01:19.610> like<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.790> not<00:01:20.909> very

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
now this may seem like it's not very

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.050 
now this may seem like it's not very
stable<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:22.200> when<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.409> whip<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.490> back<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.850> forth

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
stable but when I whip it back and forth

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.760 
stable but when I whip it back and forth
like<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.869> very<00:01:25.110> hard<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.619> I'm

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
like this and this is very hard and I'm

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.249 
like this and this is very hard and I'm
still<00:01:26.040> relaxing<00:01:26.549> my<00:01:26.640> hand<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.750> doesn't<00:01:28.140> move

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
still relaxing my hand it doesn't move

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.800 
still relaxing my hand it doesn't move
whereas<00:01:28.770> with<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> natural<00:01:29.520> grip<00:01:29.810> especially

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
whereas with the natural grip especially

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.359 
whereas with the natural grip especially
if<00:01:30.869> you're<00:01:30.990> hitting<00:01:31.259> something<00:01:31.500> I'll<00:01:32.100> hit<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
if you're hitting something I'll hit the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.140 
if you're hitting something I'll hit the
strings<00:01:35.930> you<00:01:36.930> start<00:01:37.590> rotating<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.159> pick<00:01:38.430> it's

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
strings you start rotating the pick it's

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.420 
strings you start rotating the pick it's
the<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.509> with<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.079> particular<00:01:40.409> grip<00:01:40.860> there's

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
the it with this particular grip there's

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.039 
the it with this particular grip there's
a<00:01:41.520> slight<00:01:41.880> tightening<00:01:42.360> when<00:01:42.540> there's<00:01:42.720> any

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
a slight tightening when there's any

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.690 
a slight tightening when there's any
pressure<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.530> there<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:43.890> that's<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.220> natural

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
pressure on there and that's a natural

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.730 
pressure on there and that's a natural
thing<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.030> not<00:01:45.210> something<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.689> do<00:01:45.869> just

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
thing it's not something you do just

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.060 
thing it's not something you do just
because<00:01:46.920> you're<00:01:47.280> getting<00:01:47.399> nervous<00:01:47.729> or<00:01:48.240> upset

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
because you're getting nervous or upset

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.020 
because you're getting nervous or upset
because<00:01:50.070> you're<00:01:50.310> playing<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.729> public<00:01:53.030> now

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
because you're playing in public now

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.969 
because you're playing in public now
actually<00:01:54.450> there's<00:01:54.630> more<00:01:54.689> than<00:01:55.020> one<00:01:55.290> McKenna

these<00:01:59.880> various<00:02:00.630> variations<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.619> grip<00:02:01.920> is

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
these various variations of this grip is

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.380 
these various variations of this grip is
the<00:02:02.430> bent<00:02:02.820> thumb<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:05.040> pictures<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.670> saw<00:02:05.909> early

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the bent thumb the pictures I saw early

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.930 
the bent thumb the pictures I saw early
Barney<00:02:06.750> McKenna<00:02:07.110> he<00:02:08.039> was<00:02:08.220> at<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.520> straight

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
Barney McKenna he was at a straight

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.350 
Barney McKenna he was at a straight
finger<00:02:09.390> which<00:02:09.750> which<00:02:10.080> was<00:02:10.790> pushed<00:02:11.790> up<00:02:11.970> against

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
finger which which was pushed up against

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.750 
finger which which was pushed up against
the<00:02:12.450> thumb<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:13.020> he<00:02:13.650> would<00:02:13.830> he<00:02:14.370> would<00:02:14.520> play

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
the thumb and he would he would play

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.229 
the thumb and he would he would play
like<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:15.239> it's<00:02:15.599> possible<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.379> the<00:02:17.239> pick

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
like this it's possible that the pick

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.150 
like this it's possible that the pick
may<00:02:18.390> have<00:02:18.510> been<00:02:18.629> over<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.959> little<00:02:19.170> bit<00:02:19.319> more<00:02:19.560> but

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
may have been over a little bit more but

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.150 
may have been over a little bit more but
that<00:02:20.280> looks<00:02:20.520> sort<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.849> awkward<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.360> me<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:22.160> and

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
that looks sort of awkward to me and and

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.589 
that looks sort of awkward to me and and
maybe<00:02:23.340> unstable<00:02:24.000> but<00:02:24.150> actually<00:02:24.450> it's<00:02:24.540> quite

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
maybe unstable but actually it's quite

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.900 
maybe unstable but actually it's quite
stable<00:02:25.050> later<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.370> see<00:02:26.400> pictures<00:02:26.879> of

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
stable later on you see pictures of

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.080 
stable later on you see pictures of
bending<00:02:27.870> his<00:02:27.959> thumb<00:02:28.700> I'm<00:02:29.700> bending<00:02:29.970> his

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
bending his thumb I'm bending his

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.759 
bending his thumb I'm bending his
forefinger<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.930> into<00:02:31.230> his<00:02:31.319> thumb<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:31.709> this

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
forefinger and into his thumb like this

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.530 
forefinger and into his thumb like this
but<00:02:32.250> he<00:02:32.340> always<00:02:32.489> plays<00:02:32.819> with<00:02:32.849> an<00:02:33.060> open<00:02:33.360> hand

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
but he always plays with an open hand

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.479 
but he always plays with an open hand
like<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.319> you<00:02:34.860> can<00:02:34.980> tell<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.310> because

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
like this and you can tell that because

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.910 
like this and you can tell that because
it's<00:02:35.879> this<00:02:36.120> area<00:02:36.330> here<00:02:36.989> is<00:02:37.140> always<00:02:37.440> worn<00:02:37.739> out

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
it's this area here is always worn out

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.780 
it's this area here is always worn out
now<00:02:38.670> later<00:02:38.970> on<00:02:39.060> other<00:02:39.599> other<00:02:40.530> musicians<00:02:41.190> would

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
now later on other other musicians would

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.479 
now later on other other musicians would
go<00:02:41.940> higher<00:02:42.209> up<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.230> point<00:02:43.500> where<00:02:43.769> when<00:02:44.400> you

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
go higher up to the point where when you

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.759 
go higher up to the point where when you
look<00:02:44.670> at<00:02:44.790> John<00:02:45.030> Carney<00:02:45.450> he<00:02:46.260> looks<00:02:46.500> like<00:02:46.650> his

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
look at John Carney he looks like his

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.550 
look at John Carney he looks like his
hand<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.129> frozen<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.910> know<00:02:48.840> he<00:02:48.989> plays<00:02:49.230> this

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
hand is frozen you know he plays this

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
hand is frozen you know he plays this
and<00:02:49.830> he<00:02:50.040> plays<00:02:50.610> completely<00:02:52.190> with<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.370> with<00:02:53.550> a

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
and he plays completely with it with a

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.150 
and he plays completely with it with a
pick<00:02:54.360> locked<00:02:54.690> in<00:02:54.900> like<00:02:54.930> this<00:02:55.349> using<00:02:56.010> only

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
pick locked in like this using only

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.520 
pick locked in like this using only
wrist<00:02:56.610> strokes<00:02:56.940> not<00:02:57.659> using<00:02:57.989> any<00:02:58.140> finger

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
wrist strokes not using any finger

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.820 
wrist strokes not using any finger
action<00:02:58.920> whatsoever<00:02:59.690> at<00:03:00.690> first<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.260> a

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
action whatsoever at first this is a

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.860 
action whatsoever at first this is a
little<00:03:02.099> difficult<00:03:02.550> for<00:03:02.580> me<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.970> use<00:03:03.150> but<00:03:03.540> after

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
little difficult for me to use but after

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.449 
little difficult for me to use but after
a<00:03:03.900> while<00:03:04.080> that<00:03:04.290> got<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.590> be<00:03:04.680> almost<00:03:05.010> natural

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
a while that got to be almost natural

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.809 
a while that got to be almost natural
and<00:03:05.849> again<00:03:06.510> it's<00:03:07.230> very<00:03:07.620> relaxed<00:03:08.400> it's<00:03:08.610> not

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
and again it's very relaxed it's not

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.690 
and again it's very relaxed it's not
real<00:03:09.180> tight<00:03:09.480> like<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.720> it's<00:03:10.680> very<00:03:11.010> relaxed

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
real tight like that it's very relaxed

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.790 
real tight like that it's very relaxed
because<00:03:11.879> you<00:03:12.120> need<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.390> have<00:03:12.569> a<00:03:12.840> relaxed<00:03:13.620> wrist

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
because you need to have a relaxed wrist

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.960 
because you need to have a relaxed wrist
to<00:03:14.010> play<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.340> music<00:03:16.340> I'm<00:03:17.340> going<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.790> play

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
to play this music I'm going to play

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.240 
to play this music I'm going to play
George<00:03:18.300> White's<00:03:18.599> favorite<00:03:19.080> using<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.920> Kenna

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
George White's favorite using the Kenna

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:49.030 
George White's favorite using the Kenna
grip<00:03:20.489> let's<00:03:20.819> see<00:03:20.970> if<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.120> can<00:03:21.300> do<00:03:21.450> it

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.910 

I'm<00:03:50.040> using<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.969> grip<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.230> John<00:03:52.230> card<00:03:52.530> uses

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
I'm using the grip that John card uses

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.289 
I'm using the grip that John card uses
and<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.670> like<00:03:53.939> it

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
and I like it

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.069 
and I like it
that's<00:03:54.569> because<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.939> it<00:03:56.939> reinforces<00:03:57.510> my<00:03:57.750> hand

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
that's because it it reinforces my hand

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.349 
that's because it it reinforces my hand
I<00:03:58.260> really<00:03:58.530> really<00:04:00.470> just<00:04:01.470> puts<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.579> tick

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
I really really just puts that tick

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.229 
I really really just puts that tick
right<00:04:03.540> into<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.870> vise<00:04:04.739> that's<00:04:05.099> that's<00:04:05.549> totally

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
right into a vise that's that's totally

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.050 
right into a vise that's that's totally
relaxed<00:04:06.930> but<00:04:07.439> as<00:04:07.560> you<00:04:07.680> can<00:04:07.829> saw<00:04:08.010> before<00:04:08.250> it

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
relaxed but as you can saw before it

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.030 
relaxed but as you can saw before it
works<00:04:09.239> great<00:04:09.569> now<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.290> main<00:04:10.739> difference

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
works great now the main difference

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.270 
works great now the main difference
between<00:04:11.099> this<00:04:12.079> technique<00:04:13.079> and<00:04:13.409> the<00:04:13.920> natural

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
between this technique and the natural

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.849 
between this technique and the natural
technique<00:04:14.670> is<00:04:15.420> that<00:04:15.510> is<00:04:16.349> that<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.680> natural

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
technique is that is that the natural

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.670 
technique is that is that the natural
technique<00:04:17.400> promotes<00:04:18.299> more<00:04:18.780> finger<00:04:19.259> movement

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
technique promotes more finger movement

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.199 
technique promotes more finger movement
and<00:04:20.099> you<00:04:20.220> get<00:04:20.370> that<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:20.639> McTwist<00:04:20.880> type

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
and you get that and McTwist type

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.670 
and you get that and McTwist type
triplet<00:04:21.690> in<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:22.229> other<00:04:22.380> thing<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.650> does

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
triplet in the other thing it does

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.260 
triplet in the other thing it does
though<00:04:23.070> is<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.340> change<00:04:23.729> in<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.000> center<00:04:24.240> of

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
though is a change in the center of

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.620 
though is a change in the center of
gravity<00:04:24.560> from<00:04:25.560> here<00:04:26.130> from<00:04:26.970> here<00:04:27.270> which<00:04:27.509> is

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
gravity from here from here which is

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.409 
gravity from here from here which is
where<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:27.990> McKenna<00:04:28.320> is<00:04:28.500> to<00:04:28.979> here<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.729> you<00:04:30.060> go

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
where the McKenna is to here and you go

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.969 
where the McKenna is to here and you go
back<00:04:30.660> and<00:04:30.690> forth<00:04:30.930> so<00:04:31.380> that<00:04:31.410> when<00:04:31.650> you<00:04:31.740> want<00:04:31.889> to

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
back and forth so that when you want to

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.850 
back and forth so that when you want to
get<00:04:32.070> those<00:04:32.250> wrist<00:04:32.550> triplets<00:04:33.060> in<00:04:33.210> you<00:04:34.020> work

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
get those wrist triplets in you work

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.020 
get those wrist triplets in you work
from<00:04:35.039> here<00:04:35.220> if<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:35.370> use<00:04:35.460> those<00:04:35.759> finger

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
from here if you use those finger

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.499 
from here if you use those finger
triplets<00:04:36.449> you<00:04:36.570> go<00:04:36.690> from<00:04:36.900> here<00:04:37.169> with<00:04:37.830> the

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509 
triplets you go from here with the

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:40.999 
triplets you go from here with the
Mackay<00:04:39.509> grip<00:04:39.780> it's<00:04:39.990> almost<00:04:40.259> it's<00:04:40.530> entirely

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
Mackay grip it's almost it's entirely

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.279 
Mackay grip it's almost it's entirely
wrist<00:04:41.729> triplets<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:42.570> therefore<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.110> have<00:04:43.139> a

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
wrist triplets and therefore you have a

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.890 
wrist triplets and therefore you have a
so<00:04:43.530> much<00:04:43.680> stronger<00:04:44.180> tone<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:45.599> a<00:04:45.660> little

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
so much stronger tone and a little

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.810 
so much stronger tone and a little
louder<00:04:46.080> tone<00:04:46.410> for<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.159> same<00:04:47.370> amount<00:04:47.550> of<00:04:47.639> work

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
louder tone for the same amount of work

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.800 
louder tone for the same amount of work
I<00:04:48.440> hope<00:04:49.440> this<00:04:49.650> helps<00:04:49.949> um<00:04:50.159> if<00:04:51.090> those<00:04:51.389> of<00:04:51.539> you<00:04:51.659> who

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
I hope this helps um if those of you who

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.080 
I hope this helps um if those of you who
are<00:04:52.110> willing<00:04:53.039> to<00:04:53.159> try<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.460> mechanic's<00:04:54.000> grip

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
are willing to try the mechanic's grip

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.360 
are willing to try the mechanic's grip
give<00:04:54.750> it<00:04:54.870> a<00:04:54.930> chance<00:04:55.169> I<00:04:55.530> think<00:04:56.039> you'll<00:04:56.159> find
