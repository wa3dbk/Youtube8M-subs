00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.840 

alright<00:00:08.850> now<00:00:08.970> let's<00:00:09.180> talk<00:00:09.389> about<00:00:09.980> the<00:00:10.980> the

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:11.850 
alright now let's talk about the the

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.030 
alright now let's talk about the the
filtration<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.900> because<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.410> moves<00:00:13.799> the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
filtration of it because this moves the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.060 
filtration of it because this moves the
water<00:00:14.219> around<00:00:14.790> or<00:00:15.200> pushes<00:00:16.200> the<00:00:16.320> water<00:00:16.470> up<00:00:16.650> or

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
water around or pushes the water up or

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.850 
water around or pushes the water up or
dazzles<00:00:17.520> us<00:00:17.700> with<00:00:18.000> all<00:00:18.779> sorts<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.380> things<00:00:19.619> but

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
dazzles us with all sorts of things but

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.920 
dazzles us with all sorts of things but
what<00:00:20.189> about<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.700> keeping<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.390> water<00:00:21.570> claims

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
what about the keeping the water claims

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.170 
what about the keeping the water claims
well<00:00:22.380> we<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.740> several<00:00:23.550> different<00:00:23.700> types<00:00:24.029> of

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
well we have several different types of

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.710 
well we have several different types of
filtration<00:00:24.480> available<00:00:25.110> one<00:00:25.290> of<00:00:25.380> them<00:00:25.640> there's

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
filtration available one of them there's

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.120 
filtration available one of them there's
we<00:00:27.720> have<00:00:27.810> mechanical<00:00:28.320> filtration<00:00:28.590> now<00:00:28.950> this

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
we have mechanical filtration now this

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.130 
we have mechanical filtration now this
is<00:00:29.250> from<00:00:29.369> another<00:00:29.579> filter<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.180> we<00:00:30.300> offer<00:00:30.480> but

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
is from another filter that we offer but

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.870 
is from another filter that we offer but
you<00:00:31.259> filter<00:00:31.800> pads<00:00:32.009> are<00:00:32.189> gonna<00:00:32.279> take<00:00:32.550> out<00:00:32.730> your

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
you filter pads are gonna take out your

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.600 
you filter pads are gonna take out your
physical<00:00:33.360> debris<00:00:33.660> pure<00:00:33.930> water<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:35.040> also<00:00:35.220> have

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
physical debris pure water we also have

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.729 
physical debris pure water we also have
what<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.030> refer<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.420> as<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.710> of

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
what we refer to as and this is one of

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.709 
what we refer to as and this is one of
our<00:00:37.890> large<00:00:38.100> pressurized<00:00:38.730> filters<00:00:39.210> Wow<00:00:39.420> look

see<00:00:55.769> a<00:00:55.800> pond<00:00:56.670> clean<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.210> love<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.809> part<00:00:58.140> of

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
see a pond clean I love that part of

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.899 
see a pond clean I love that part of
this<00:00:58.409> whole<00:00:58.710> system<00:00:59.249> because<00:00:59.399> you're<00:00:59.730> really

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
this whole system because you're really

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.819 
this whole system because you're really
working<00:01:00.239> with<00:01:00.629> nature<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.589> pond

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
working with nature with this pond

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.160 
working with nature with this pond
system<00:01:02.129> yes<00:01:02.579> you're<00:01:02.850> using<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.629> natural

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
system yes you're using the natural

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.440 
system yes you're using the natural
bacteria<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.370> beneficial<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.210> pond

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
bacteria that are beneficial in a pond

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.330 
bacteria that are beneficial in a pond
as<00:01:06.780> they<00:01:07.020> are<00:01:07.170> all<00:01:07.560> part<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> nitrogen

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
as they are all part of the nitrogen

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.250 
as they are all part of the nitrogen
cycle<00:01:08.370> yeah<00:01:08.970> that's<00:01:09.210> our<00:01:09.330> life<00:01:09.690> sentence<00:01:10.110> yeah

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
cycle yeah that's our life sentence yeah

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.690 
cycle yeah that's our life sentence yeah
yeah<00:01:10.590> yeah<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.250> your<00:01:11.340> own<00:01:11.490> little

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
yeah yeah you have your own little

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.789 
yeah yeah you have your own little
ecosystem<00:01:11.820> there<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.810> your<00:01:12.899> exact<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.619> want

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
ecosystem there and your exact we want

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.649 
ecosystem there and your exact we want
to<00:01:13.860> honor<00:01:14.009> that<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.759> very<00:01:14.909> good<00:01:15.030> thing<00:01:15.420> for

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
to honor that it's a very good thing for

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.590 
to honor that it's a very good thing for
the<00:01:15.810> planet<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.560> then<00:01:16.890> speaking<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.759> natural

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the planet and then speaking of natural

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.319 
the planet and then speaking of natural
ways<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.259> taking<00:01:19.920> care<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.159> algae<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.700> love<00:01:21.090> this

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
ways of taking care of algae I love this

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.630 
ways of taking care of algae I love this
device<00:01:21.720> yeah<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> UV<00:01:23.219> or<00:01:23.520> an

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
device yeah this is a UV or an

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.330 
device yeah this is a UV or an
ultraviolet<00:01:24.060> sterilizer<00:01:24.750> inside<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.829> light

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
ultraviolet sterilizer inside is a light

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.940 
ultraviolet sterilizer inside is a light
bulb<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.790> gives<00:01:27.000> off<00:01:27.149> UVA<00:01:27.630> light<00:01:28.020> waves<00:01:28.290> that

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
bulb that gives off UVA light waves that

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.200 
bulb that gives off UVA light waves that
they're<00:01:29.100> going<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.490> kill<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> chlorophyll

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
they're going to kill the chlorophyll

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.569 
they're going to kill the chlorophyll
inside<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.719> algae<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.350> then<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.100> think<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.430> is

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
inside the algae so then I think this is

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.010 
inside the algae so then I think this is
fantastic<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.360> biggest<00:01:33.659> problem<00:01:33.990> people

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
fantastic the biggest problem people

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.749 
fantastic the biggest problem people
have<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.619> green<00:01:34.950> water<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.369> right<00:01:35.640> with

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
have is that green water and right with

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.420 
have is that green water and right with
discourages<00:01:36.479> them<00:01:36.600> yeah<00:01:36.899> yeah<00:01:37.110> again<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.189> is

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
discourages them yeah yeah again this is

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.760 
discourages them yeah yeah again this is
set<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.299> forget<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.659> mentality<00:01:40.350> hook<00:01:40.590> it

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
set it and forget it mentality hook it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.469 
set it and forget it mentality hook it
up<00:01:40.890> we're<00:01:41.369> on<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> right<00:01:41.729> water<00:01:41.969> flow<00:01:42.270> through

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
up we're on the right water flow through

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.029 
up we're on the right water flow through
it<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.990> won't<00:01:43.140> see<00:01:43.409> green<00:01:43.560> water<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
it and you won't see green water in the

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.679 
it and you won't see green water in the
pond<00:01:44.219> and<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:44.700> people<00:01:44.729> understand<00:01:45.509> what

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
pond and just so people understand what

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.270 
pond and just so people understand what
happens<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.500> water<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.950> constantly

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
happens is the water is constantly

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.359 
happens is the water is constantly
flowing<00:01:48.119> through<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.960> tube<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:50.159> being

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
flowing through this tube and it's being

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.090 
flowing through this tube and it's being
bombarded<00:01:50.549> with<00:01:51.060> UV<00:01:51.990> light<00:01:52.020> correct<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.070> that

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
bombarded with UV light correct and that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.120 
bombarded with UV light correct and that
UV<00:01:53.549> light<00:01:53.579> kills<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.600> algae<00:01:55.079> exactly<00:01:55.859> and<00:01:55.979> so

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
UV light kills the algae exactly and so

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.740 
UV light kills the algae exactly and so
there's<00:01:56.280> no<00:01:56.460> chemicals<00:01:57.030> involved<00:01:57.509> at<00:01:57.600> all

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
there's no chemicals involved at all

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.139 
there's no chemicals involved at all
none<00:01:58.109> whatsoever<00:01:58.289> and<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.890> light<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.609> on<00:01:59.880> all

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
none whatsoever and the light is on all

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.990 
none whatsoever and the light is on all
the<00:02:00.270> time<00:02:00.680> you<00:02:01.680> very<00:02:01.979> little<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.399> energy<00:02:02.759> used

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
the time you very little the energy used

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.510 
the time you very little the energy used
for<00:02:03.149> this

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
for this

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.599 
for this
well<00:02:03.700> for<00:02:04.299> this<00:02:04.420> as<00:02:04.570> well<00:02:05.530> our<00:02:05.799> actual<00:02:06.280> unit

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
well for this as well our actual unit

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:09.210 
well for this as well our actual unit
has<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:06.960> helix<00:02:07.960> design<00:02:08.110> in<00:02:08.470> there<00:02:08.619> so<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:08.920> has<00:02:09.069> to

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
has a helix design in there so it has to

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.979 
has a helix design in there so it has to
spiral<00:02:09.670> around<00:02:09.879> the<00:02:10.060> bulb<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.479> give<00:02:10.599> more

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
spiral around the bulb to give more

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.589 
spiral around the bulb to give more
contact<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.709> see<00:02:12.190> more<00:02:12.760> contour<00:02:13.330> surface

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
contact I see more contour surface

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.140 
contact I see more contour surface
surface<00:02:14.349> area<00:02:14.709> contact<00:02:15.040> time<00:02:15.459> yeah<00:02:15.700> there's<00:02:15.940> a

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
surface area contact time yeah there's a

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.570 
surface area contact time yeah there's a
bit<00:02:16.360> better<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.840> kill<00:02:17.050> ratio<00:02:17.440> yeah<00:02:17.890> change<00:02:18.459> a

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
bit better to kill ratio yeah change a

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.610 
bit better to kill ratio yeah change a
