00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.940
 hello welcome to a new review and in 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.100
 this time I will review the tome 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.900
 number 2 of fairytale this tome is in 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.670
 circulation from Wednesday 17 of 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.769
 December although it cost me a little more 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.300
 get it because it ran out on the spot 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:21.929
 where I buy the sleeves and well we go 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.519
 quickly to what this volume brings and what 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.949
 which is the interior has two small 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.839
 errors or failures that I found but 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.819
 first I will mention a small 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.409
 change of quality that this volume had in 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:32.040
 comparison with the previous the number 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:35.370
 one 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.500
 the pasta retains its very good texture 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.930
 of course as I mentioned in the review 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.180
 of the previous volume and also its thickness in 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.600
 these there was no change and we have the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.949
 cover the back and the back cover all 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.340
 very well here good simply in the 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:54.000
 mine the loin like that the image is a 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.379
 little run back here you can tell if 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.210
 yours is so good and leave the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.760
 comment and good what change in this 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.039
 I take it because they were the leaves there was a 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.699
 slight change of blade with respect to 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.640
 previous shot 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.890
 this is a scratchy sheet 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.540
 not so much but good if you feel if you 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.159
 compare with the previous volume for the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.490
 Take number 1 is a very smart sheet 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.409
 quite friendly to the touch equal to the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.540
 of volume number 2 because if it is a leaf 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.150
 very much respected compared to this the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.950
 I take number 1 however this does not affect 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.500
 for nothing the impression in my opinion the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.869
 impression that was the same there are some places 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.180
 that if you notice and well I notice this and 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.340
 I hope not to be wrong but especially in 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.619
 the blacks when you see everything if black 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.259
 pretty good good to me is a good 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.270
 impression but there are times that they look like 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.950
 some little white dots and in this volume there 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.960
 parts like that in blacks suddenly 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.789
 They have little white dots and that's good 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.770
 for me, the impression did not come out 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.070
 also thing that in volume number one 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.110
 I did not notice as I said in the review of 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.070
 he took the blacks who were 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.869
 pretty good 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.250
 They came out pretty good but good at 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.960
 final account these changes of 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.570
 quality as I said in videos 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.429
 previous does not affect of course in 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.590
 nothing that is enjoyed the sleeve everything is 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.350
 read perfectly well what happened to me 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.880
 with this manga and here if I want to ask 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.739
 please tell me if your volume is 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.120
 the same thing to begin with is that it's a bit 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.580
 harder to open is battle 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.459
 a little more when opening even some 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.709
 parts of dialogs that are pasted here 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.860
 I have to open it a little more for 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.599
 can read them for example here although 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.970
 there are some a little more stuck not so much 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.769
 like in the one number one but 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.440
 well if he forced me to open a little more 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.659
 the manga to read and it's also that 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.819
 as I was reading the sheets here 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.730
 happened this is open the sleeve 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.980
 said if I grab it so see how it 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.420
 they did and they had done worse when 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.060
 I read the first time I was going leaf 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.849
 per page it opened up rather ugly when 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.819
 finish that one thing all open of the 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.430
 pretty ugly leaves looked like old or 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.500
 that had been wet or not done 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.990
 you can see it and it shows a little bit 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.210
 wrong 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.130
 how it is open and more than I tried 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.800
 bad sleeves I'm pretty careful 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.930
 with my things and with the sleeves even 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.300
 more because they are literally things 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.440
 collectibles that in the future no longer 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.210
 they will be available very 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.920
 probably and maybe the only way 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.020
 to get it, be it with someone who 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.790
 sell and used like that for example right now 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.820
 the vine then I'll take care of 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.100
 quite my stuff my sleeves even at 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.870
 read the two carefully and then this 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.850
 the first time it happens in a 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.310
 good panini sleeve I started writing 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.590
 a book in the review I was sunk a 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.080
 little here in this not what happened is that 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.390
 they open up pretty much was the leaves so 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.340
 good if you also happened to them 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.890
 leave me in the comments if not then 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.320
 it means that maybe it's a mistake of 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.210
 my tome although good does not bother me and does not 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.190
 I plan to change it but if something was done to me 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.660
 ugly that is done like this contrary to 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.030
 I take number one that is all pretty 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.100
 well and it's even one of those that can be 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.230
 open quite easily pass the 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.440
 leaves this good form in this volume 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.900
 number two is not quite hard and 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.030
 as they see they are mistreated even when 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.160
 I read that it just opened 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.630
 they gave the leaves a little when they opened it 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.510
 it improved what you have described to me 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.450
 of the sleeves of the world bill but good 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.760
 that as I told you before, leave me in the 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.770
 comments if I take number 2 is the same 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.690
 that the volume number 1 well I think that 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.669
 if I'm going to write to bread and me so that 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.440
 change it there I order them to tell me 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.780
 how is your volume and well now yes the 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.030
 details that this manga brings are two the 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.340
 first is that just like in the fence 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.740
 devil 4 a small change between the 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.510
 name of the chapter that appears in the 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.580
 index with the name of the chapter that 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.280
 appears at the beginning of the chapter itself 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.290
 in this case it is chapter 12 in the 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.720
 index appears as a song of 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.180
 curse and at the beginning of the chapter we 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.130
 appears as cursed song of these 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.590
 strange things that happen that we do not know 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.050
 explain it because they are given but good 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.600
 neither is it something that affects reading 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.030
 and it's not as hooked as in the the 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.590
 fence devil 4 that brought names of the 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.570
 chapters of another volume that was 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.970
 just change curse song 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.030
 by cursed song keeps what is 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.969
 the subject of chapter 1 the second mistake 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.369
 or rather as incoherence for this 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:11.719
 sorry if by saying this I will do 

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:13.999
 something spoiler in case someone has not 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:15.439
 read but good is I have to say it 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:17.659
 because it is an error in this part it 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:20.360
 mention that the reward is 2 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:21.799
 millions and later I lost the 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.619
 page but I'm going to put a 

00:05:21.799 --> 00:05:26.569
 image from there it is mentioned that the 

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:29.149
 reward is 20 million and after 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:31.489
 later it is again given to handle 

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:34.099
 the amount of 2 million then good 

00:05:31.489 --> 00:05:36.019
 there was that little mistake of changing the 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:38.599
 amount of 2 million to 20 million in 

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:40.729
 a dialogue and those were the two things 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.099
 that brings this manga and good also the 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:46.099
 sheet change and this I already mentioned 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:47.599
 so good to fairytale tome number 2 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:49.429
 of panini comics I'm going to give you a 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:50.839
 rating of 3 and a half stars and 

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:53.059
 because well I 'm not taking into account 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:54.319
 much what was this called the 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:57.019
 I try the manga that is a bit more 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:58.849
 hard because I do not know if it's something 

00:05:57.019 --> 00:06:01.339
 general or if it's just from my volume and 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.409
 I do not want to go through the mistakes that 

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:05.269
 I did when reviewing the face the devil 3 that 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:07.669
 I poured a lot of panini and in 

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:09.799
 errors were actually my take so 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.629
 well you do not make mistakes twice that's why 

00:06:09.799 --> 00:06:13.969
 now I better ask you 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:16.819
 support me if it's a general error or yes 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:18.949
 I take and well this would be all for this 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:20.839
 review of Fairytale 2 I invite you 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:23.029
