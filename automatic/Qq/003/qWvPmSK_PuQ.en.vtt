00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 Hello everyone, let's talk about in 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.340
 principle 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:11.910
 essential things before pouring warm 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.000
 sex this is a heroically tested system for 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.590
 what is not needed to determine leaks 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.289
 which we can happen 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.100
 these damage pipes that could 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.779
 happen during styling either 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.460
 factory marriage, that is, in principle, everything 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:33.989
 this reveals hydraulic tests and 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:36.440
 so what should have been done in this 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.340
 case that is my case before 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:45.180
 filling the system with water this tap 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:49.230
 which we add water to the system 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.329
 in principle, the pressure does not hold that is 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.870
 Basically enough while working 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.129
 shut off so that there is only water as 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.500
 such pressure he does not hold 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.680
 accordingly had to screw that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.810
 it was such a plastic arm 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:09.570
 screen well yes kramz to go with 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.030
 plastic pipe flew nova low 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.210
 pressure on ordinary metal ie it 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.159
 screwed take also here we still with 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.460
 the other side of the rector also has someone 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:26.400
 mom principle too pressure doesn't hold that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:30.270
 I did not twist it that twisted here 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.420
 here is the ruff she was wearing here 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.560
 plan silicone went to that already 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.210
 was directly 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.759
 connected to the water supply and so have 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.869
 us yet 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:49.350
 successive holes here and again 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:52.170
 took out the top was dressed. 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.320
 silicone hose we have sewer this 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.880
 in order to pro on the system kick out 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.710
 her statute alone petra me business that is 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.770
 water will go a lot to find 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:11.160
 all the air from the system and so by the way 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.280
 the collector was delivered here this faucet 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.450
 the same tap is here 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:23.360
 on the bottom is very similar to faucets on 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.370
 Samovar that is, from the hell are you across 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.349
 water movement saying the faucet is closed and 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.110
 sisters along tap 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:36.269
 the same 2 tapes we have on 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:41.130
 connecting the pump connection points then 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:43.320
 the same thing is a feature that shows 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.820
 condition of the crane complete with 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.590
 collector she came here so here 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.150
 the key that is on the one hand he 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:55.230
 flat on the other side 6 faces 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:59.010
 Hexagon can not adjust here 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.940
 these are taps for setting collectors 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.120
 Here we open this flat part 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.980
 close this tap either this boss 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.100
 the Koran, that is, this key, the principle 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.040
 need to make all the settings by 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.920
 collector so what do we need like me 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.139
 said as usual such 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.450
 tests that is 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:26.190
 put the pressure gauge naturally with 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.989
 the collector bleeds because the water 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.000
 filled with water system or on 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.440
 chase the pressure 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.410
 about 22 and a half times higher 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.340
 design pressure in the system at 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.500
 case so I do not have a manometer I know 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.350
 what about in the house 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.660
 and the system is about 200 sma over working 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:49.010
 pressure will be 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:50.680
 judging by the boiler punch some 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.610
 fatherland 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:58.220
 judging by the boiler instructions 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.650
 spring wrong whether 07 further 0 8 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.200
 atmospheres respectively pressure in 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.140
 plumbing will be enough for us 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.020
 checking the floor heating system 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.360
 that is, I just wear the barbell open 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.390
 tap and i leave the system under pressure 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.609
 that is, with an open tap so that we 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.230
 we need to start we need 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:21.400
 shut off these faucets through the pump then 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.840
 there we are blocking ie divide 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.970
 contour 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.880
 that is, the child falling 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.010
 raising also close this one 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.970
 tap 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:38.960
 which closes this one here jumper 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:42.230
 for the post and so respectively 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.550
 close all the faucets on the upper child 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:48.710
 close all the faucets on the lower child 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.360
 we can open the air vent 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.400
 principle closes open lower 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.410
 the world here through her will not go on the air 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.890
 will be inserted and so all the crane we have 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:01.160
 open and serve water on the bottom 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:06.310
 on the lower manifold comb open 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:09.740
 first one tap open the second screen 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.850
 open here is that tap tap all 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.650
 the water went through the pipes we are waiting when 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.460
 from here the air will cease to go that is 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.440
 go just water without air bubbles 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.600
 the water stopped we close this 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.930
 the circuit that is this crane to this quran 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:31.370
 go to the next counter is the same 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:33.740
 all the same operations the air stopped 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.580
 move on 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.270
 Here is all the right amount 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:43.250
 contours 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:46.400
 expelled year in from all basically possible in 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.169
 principle can not but need to open on 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.430
 pump 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:53.990
 tees about expel pump air 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:59.660
 drive out of here just in case 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:01.880
 also open and basically leave 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.750
 system by the bottom as I left it under 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:10.599
 pressure of the order of the day at the bar she 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.599
 stood during this time can be controlled 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:18.229
 streams of water and I don't know the conquest somewhere 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:21.409
 there were fractures corpse factory marriage like a 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:23.000
 I have a valid junction in 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:25.099
 In principle, everything here is cleaned, that is, on 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.069
 collector all these here are nuts 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:29.360
 american women all this in principle is not 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:32.330
 scary if the collector will 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.300
 dig that is always possible 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.419
 pull up but let's say a pipe failure either 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.370
 some 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:41.509
 kinks that will be in the floor of the same 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.080
 critical it will not work just like that 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:44.289
 to fix 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.690
 Well, in principle, that's all that is 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:50.509
 supported everything is dry no where everything is not dripping 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:55.070
 everything is fine you can proceed 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:57.710
 concreting accordingly chances are we 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:02.690
 eliminated all risks all pipe from us 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:04.940
 the whole we are flooding as they say the type you need 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.490
 keep the pipes constantly under pressure 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:11.960
 Well, in principle, you can and constantly under 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:16.310
 pressure type pipe under pressure like 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:18.020
 would expand and take in concrete then 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.150
 eat when heated then you will not 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.250
 where will expand as with such 

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:26.509
 pressure this pipe doubt that 

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:30.259
 will have to get exactly any 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:31.969
 a little crush them pressure to 

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:35.240
 it increases, that is, in my opinion 

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:37.529
 Still delirium is common need never know 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.569
 in your process you damaged the pipes 

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:42.089
 saw on the water flowed one can 

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:44.549
 stop building that is, we are on 

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:47.759
 the rest of concreting there, well, in short, I 

00:07:44.549 --> 00:07:49.909
 somehow fight this principle here and 

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:52.519
 all that is 

00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:55.889
 checked let out 

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:57.809
 bleed the air everyone prepared the system 

00:07:55.889 --> 00:08:00.239
 and you can fill that is, I like to repeat 

00:07:57.809 --> 00:08:04.499
 I held it did not support even less and 

00:08:00.239 --> 00:08:06.869
 pressed literally a couple of hours under 

00:08:04.499 --> 00:08:08.819
 it was enough pressure for me 

00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:14.009
 looked everything is ok nothing flows 

00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:17.869
 and principles embarked concreting on 

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:17.869
 today everything is new
