it<00:00:08.160> occurred<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.580> me<00:00:08.900> maybe<00:00:09.900> about<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.650> decade

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
it occurred to me maybe about a decade

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.539 
it occurred to me maybe about a decade
ago<00:00:11.360> when<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.389> looked<00:00:12.719> at<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.200> skill<00:00:14.040> sets<00:00:14.400> that

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
ago when I looked at the skill sets that

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.670 
ago when I looked at the skill sets that
we<00:00:14.700> had<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.000> creative<00:00:15.299> skill<00:00:15.780> sets<00:00:16.020> we<00:00:16.199> had<00:00:16.379> at

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
we had the creative skill sets we had at

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.210 
we had the creative skill sets we had at
what<00:00:17.310> was<00:00:17.490> then<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.699> very<00:00:17.789> different<00:00:18.449> IgA<00:00:19.220> that

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
what was then a very different IgA that

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.509 
what was then a very different IgA that
that<00:00:20.910> if<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.270> were<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.720> be<00:00:21.990> sort<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.289> brutal<00:00:23.100> in

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
that if you were to be sort of brutal in

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.349 
that if you were to be sort of brutal in
your<00:00:23.760> subdivision<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:25.099> skill<00:00:26.099> sets<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:27.210> you

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
your subdivision of skill sets then you

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.410 
your subdivision of skill sets then you
would<00:00:27.510> sort<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.750> cleave<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.470> world<00:00:28.680> into

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
would sort of cleave the world into

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.470 
would sort of cleave the world into
storytelling<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.990> systematic<00:00:31.710> thinking<00:00:32.480> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
storytelling and systematic thinking the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.380 
storytelling and systematic thinking the
important<00:00:34.020> point<00:00:34.860> about<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.610> not<00:00:36.120> just

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
important point about that is not just

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.180 
important point about that is not just
that<00:00:36.540> these<00:00:36.719> two<00:00:37.020> ways<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.410> thinking<00:00:37.559> exist

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
that these two ways of thinking exist

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.459 
that these two ways of thinking exist
but<00:00:38.879> also<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.300> recognize<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.079> they're<00:00:40.260> both

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
but also to recognize that they're both

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.619 
but also to recognize that they're both
creative<00:00:41.070> ways<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.399> thinking<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.879> if<00:00:42.390> you're

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
creative ways of thinking so if you're

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.319 
creative ways of thinking so if you're
from<00:00:42.809> Madison<00:00:43.230> Avenue<00:00:43.620> then<00:00:44.309> you've<00:00:44.520> over<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
from Madison Avenue then you've over the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.940 
from Madison Avenue then you've over the
last<00:00:45.450> 50<00:00:45.780> years<00:00:45.809> what<00:00:46.230> has<00:00:46.350> been<00:00:46.500> considered

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
last 50 years what has been considered

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.130 
last 50 years what has been considered
creative<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.879> storytelling<00:00:48.570> because<00:00:48.780> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
creative is storytelling because the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.529 
creative is storytelling because the
mediums<00:00:49.500> have<00:00:49.680> refused<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.430> asked<00:00:51.300> their

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.470 
mediums have refused it asked their
narrative<00:00:51.930> mediums<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.940> since<00:00:54.329> the

acida advent of digital you know this

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.799 
acida advent of digital you know this
more<00:00:59.219> sort<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.460> architectural<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.359> spacial

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
more sort of architectural and spacial

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.380 
way of thinking has has has become very
important<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:05.280> advertising<00:01:05.760> world<00:01:05.909> I

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
important in the advertising world I

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.390 
important in the advertising world I
think<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.900> problem<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:08.010> hasn't<00:01:08.310> been

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
think the problem is that it hasn't been

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.429 
think the problem is that it hasn't been
considered<00:01:08.610> creative<00:01:09.390> it's<00:01:09.720> been<00:01:09.900> relegated

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
considered creative it's been relegated

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.560 
considered creative it's been relegated
to<00:01:10.860> us<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.100> execution<00:01:11.729> upon<00:01:11.820> right<00:01:12.330> or

technical so when people talk about the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.390

about<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.549> interactive<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:26.640> think<00:01:26.850> about

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
about the interactive they think about

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.730 
about the interactive they think about
it<00:01:27.240> from<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.509> technical<00:01:27.780> point<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.380> view<00:01:28.409> so

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
it from a technical point of view so

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.740 
it from a technical point of view so
then<00:01:28.890> having<00:01:29.490> having<00:01:30.090> come<00:01:30.270> up<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> big

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
then having having come up with the big

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.020 
then having having come up with the big
idea<00:01:31.049> how<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.229> we<00:01:31.409> push<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.770> down<00:01:32.009> into<00:01:32.579> this

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
idea how do we push that down into this

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.230 
idea how do we push that down into this
in<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.479> new<00:01:33.750> set<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.079> formats<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.000> channels

in this new set of formats and channels

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.770 
in this new set of formats and channels
for<00:01:37.810> what<00:01:37.960> I<00:01:37.990> realized<00:01:38.560> was<00:01:38.799> that<00:01:38.940> was<00:01:39.940> that<00:01:40.180> is

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
for what I realized was that was that is

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.289 
for what I realized was that was that is
that<00:01:41.049> the<00:01:41.229> sort<00:01:42.130> of<00:01:42.159> creativity<00:01:42.549> associated

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
that the sort of creativity associated

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.510 
that the sort of creativity associated
with<00:01:43.390> systemic<00:01:43.540> thinking<00:01:44.110> was<00:01:45.070> very<00:01:45.280> powerful

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
with systemic thinking was very powerful

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.380 
with systemic thinking was very powerful
very<00:01:45.790> different<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:48.070> I<00:01:48.670> know<00:01:48.820> it<00:01:48.970> was<00:01:49.090> it<00:01:49.270> was

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
very different and I know it was it was

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.630 
very different and I know it was it was
important<00:01:49.960> thing<00:01:50.200> to<00:01:50.740> recognize<00:01:50.920> because<00:01:51.400> if

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
important thing to recognize because if

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.160 
important thing to recognize because if
you<00:01:51.759> didn't<00:01:52.180> recognize<00:01:52.659> the<00:01:52.690> difference

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
you didn't recognize the difference

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.290 
you didn't recognize the difference
between<00:01:53.229> storytelling<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.670> systemic

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
between storytelling and systemic

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.260 
between storytelling and systemic
thinking<00:01:55.770> then<00:01:56.770> creatives<00:01:57.369> because<00:01:57.759> they're

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
thinking then creatives because they're

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.960 
thinking then creatives because they're
all<00:01:58.420> vain<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:58.990> because<00:01:59.770> this<00:02:00.009> this<00:02:00.700> is<00:02:00.850> the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
all vain and because this this is the

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.630 
all vain and because this this is the
hubris<00:02:01.330> associated<00:02:02.110> with<00:02:02.290> with<00:02:03.220> creative

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
hubris associated with with creative

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.600 
hubris associated with with creative
people<00:02:03.670> is<00:02:04.270> if<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:04.930> didn't<00:02:05.310> recognize<00:02:06.310> those

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
people is if you didn't recognize those

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.219 
people is if you didn't recognize those
a<00:02:06.640> sort<00:02:07.000> of<00:02:07.060> category<00:02:07.540> the<00:02:07.659> categorically

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
a sort of category the categorically

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.660 
a sort of category the categorically
different<00:02:08.319> ways<00:02:08.590> of<00:02:08.770> thinking<00:02:08.890> then<00:02:09.519> they

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
different ways of thinking then they

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.979 
different ways of thinking then they
would<00:02:09.850> say<00:02:10.060> because<00:02:10.239> they're<00:02:10.600> creative<00:02:10.899> they

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
would say because they're creative they

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.199 
would say because they're creative they
should<00:02:11.170> be<00:02:11.290> doing<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.680> all<00:02:11.800> right<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:12.790> would

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
should be doing it all right so I would

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.229 
should be doing it all right so I would
have<00:02:13.450> an<00:02:14.140> instance<00:02:14.530> where<00:02:14.970> someone<00:02:15.970> who's

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
have an instance where someone who's

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.240 
have an instance where someone who's
through<00:02:16.420> grew<00:02:16.660> up<00:02:16.780> designing<00:02:17.290> interfaces<00:02:17.650> and

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
through grew up designing interfaces and

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.940 
through grew up designing interfaces and
so<00:02:18.790> was<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.000> systematic<00:02:19.660> thinker<00:02:19.989> couldn't

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
so was a systematic thinker couldn't

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.190 
so was a systematic thinker couldn't
wait<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.280> get<00:02:21.430> over<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.180> content<00:02:22.600> studio

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
wait to get over to the content studio

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.190 
wait to get over to the content studio
and<00:02:23.519> and/or<00:02:24.519> film<00:02:24.880> even<00:02:25.180> though<00:02:25.420> for<00:02:25.720> 10<00:02:25.900> years

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
and and/or film even though for 10 years

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.020 
and and/or film even though for 10 years
that<00:02:26.410> wasn't<00:02:27.190> with<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.670> way<00:02:27.790> they<00:02:27.940> were

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
that wasn't with it the way they were

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.570 
that wasn't with it the way they were
thinking<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.510> vice<00:02:29.170> versa<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:29.709> think<00:02:29.980> early<00:02:30.459> on

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
thinking and vice versa I think early on

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.460 
thinking and vice versa I think early on
in<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:30.910> little<00:02:31.120> did<00:02:31.360> in<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.989> industry<00:02:32.410> of

in this little did in the industry of

in this little did in the industry of

emergent digital world there was a lot

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.590 
emergent digital world there was a lot

right<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:43.150> won't<00:02:43.420> mention<00:02:43.900> any<00:02:44.170> big<00:02:44.920> platforms

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
right I won't mention any big platforms

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.789 
right I won't mention any big platforms
but<00:02:45.820> there's<00:02:46.000> quite<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.299> few<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.620> lot<00:02:47.769> of

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
but there's quite a few and a lot of

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.940 
but there's quite a few and a lot of
money<00:02:48.070> was<00:02:48.459> wasted<00:02:48.640> and<00:02:49.030> Dan<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:49.989> so<00:02:50.890> if

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
money was wasted and Dan it and so if

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.020 
money was wasted and Dan it and so if
you<00:02:51.070> look<00:02:51.160> at<00:02:51.310> a<00:02:51.510> human<00:02:52.510> brain<00:02:53.340> this<00:02:54.340> I<00:02:54.640> sort<00:02:55.000> of

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
you look at a human brain this I sort of

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.390 
you look at a human brain this I sort of
found<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.810> out<00:02:56.019> later<00:02:56.290> as<00:02:56.590> we<00:02:57.160> don't<00:02:57.250> know

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
found this out later as we don't know

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.949 
found this out later as we don't know
what<00:02:57.549> about<00:02:57.760> neuroscience<00:02:58.540> but<00:02:58.600> what<00:02:58.720> we<00:02:58.810> do

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
what about neuroscience but what we do

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.380 
what about neuroscience but what we do
know<00:02:59.140> is<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.500> left<00:02:59.709> hand<00:02:59.980> brain

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
know is that the left hand brain

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.300 
know is that the left hand brain
processes<00:03:01.390> things<00:03:01.570> one<00:03:01.840> at<00:03:01.989> a<00:03:02.079> time<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.590> the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
processes things one at a time and the

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.160 
processes things one at a time and the
right<00:03:03.489> hand<00:03:03.760> brain<00:03:04.030> processes<00:03:04.660> things<00:03:04.870> all<00:03:04.989> at

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
right hand brain processes things all at

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.640 
right hand brain processes things all at
once

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
once

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.130 
once
so<00:03:06.310> it's<00:03:06.430> this<00:03:06.549> play<00:03:06.820> between<00:03:07.060> time<00:03:07.660> and<00:03:07.870> space

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
so it's this play between time and space

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.930 
so it's this play between time and space
between<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.680> temporal<00:03:09.010> way<00:03:09.100> of<00:03:09.160> thinking<00:03:09.670> and

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
between the temporal way of thinking and

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.540 
between the temporal way of thinking and
a<00:03:10.060> special<00:03:10.510> way<00:03:10.630> of<00:03:10.720> thinking

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
a special way of thinking

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.760 
a special way of thinking
and<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.600> stands<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:13.050> reason<00:03:13.140> that<00:03:13.590> if

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
and so it stands to reason that if

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.380 
and so it stands to reason that if
you've<00:03:14.100> been<00:03:14.280> doing<00:03:14.460> something<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:15.210> you've

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
you've been doing something and you've

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.760 
you've been doing something and you've
got<00:03:15.570> good<00:03:15.720> at<00:03:15.870> something<00:03:16.200> from<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.410> creative

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
got good at something from a creative

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.200 
got good at something from a creative
point<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:17.070> view<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.550> pods<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:18.060> your

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
point of view that the pods in your

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.930 
point of view that the pods in your
brain<00:03:18.480> are<00:03:18.630> in<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.780> very<00:03:18.990> specific<00:03:19.200> place<00:03:19.940> so

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
brain are in a very specific place so

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.970 
brain are in a very specific place so
for<00:03:21.360> me<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.480> explains<00:03:22.290> why<00:03:22.620> it's<00:03:22.770> very

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
for me that explains why it's very

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.230 
for me that explains why it's very
difficult<00:03:23.370> for<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:24.030> narrative<00:03:24.510> thinker<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:26.240> to

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
difficult for a narrative thinker to to

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.190 
difficult for a narrative thinker to to
connect<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.440> design<00:03:28.800> from<00:03:29.040> systematic

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
connect and and design from systematic

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.440 
connect and and design from systematic
some<00:03:31.200> work<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.770> by<00:03:32.550> subversives<00:03:33.090> because

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
some work and by subversives because

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.290 
some work and by subversives because
there<00:03:33.840> happen<00:03:34.320> so<00:03:34.530> so<00:03:35.070> for<00:03:35.340> us<00:03:35.460> at<00:03:35.760> r/ga<00:03:35.970> at

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
there happen so so for us at r/ga at

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.140 
there happen so so for us at r/ga at
least<00:03:36.620> we<00:03:37.620> we<00:03:38.370> think<00:03:38.580> that<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.910> sort<00:03:39.090> of

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
least we we think that the sort of

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.620 
least we we think that the sort of
atomic<00:03:39.420> team<00:03:39.900> is<00:03:40.710> not<00:03:41.370> an<00:03:41.970> art<00:03:42.240> director<00:03:42.510> and

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
atomic team is not an art director and

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.600 
atomic team is not an art director and
copywriter<00:03:43.050> it's<00:03:43.350> a<00:03:43.560> it's<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:44.070> it's<00:03:44.310> a

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
copywriter it's a it's a it's a

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.930 
copywriter it's a it's a it's a
storyteller<00:03:45.300> and<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.540> systematic<00:03:46.050> thinker

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
storyteller and the systematic thinker

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.830 
storyteller and the systematic thinker
another<00:03:47.940> way<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.090> looking<00:03:48.270> at<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:48.660> as

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
another way of looking at that as

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.670 
another way of looking at that as
attention<00:03:49.440> is<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.940> look<00:03:51.090> at<00:03:51.300> storytelling<00:03:52.170> as

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
attention is to look at storytelling as

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.130 
attention is to look at storytelling as
a<00:03:52.710> sort<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.250> act<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.640> simplifying<00:03:54.300> because

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
a sort of the act of simplifying because

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.900 
a sort of the act of simplifying because
it's<00:03:55.290> about<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.710> revealed<00:03:56.070> moment<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:56.730> good

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
it's about the revealed moment and good

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.030 
it's about the revealed moment and good
storytelling<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:58.440> good<00:03:58.710> brand

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
storytelling and and good brand

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.530 
storytelling and and good brand
storytelling<00:03:59.430> is<00:03:59.850> really<00:04:00.120> about<00:04:00.270> that

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
storytelling is really about that

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.890 
storytelling is really about that
distilled<00:04:01.080> moment<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.890> how<00:04:02.070> it's<00:04:02.220> revealed

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
distilled moment and how it's revealed

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.480 
distilled moment and how it's revealed
and<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.800> there's<00:04:04.950> this<00:04:05.100> tension<00:04:05.370> between

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
and and there's this tension between

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.350 
and and there's this tension between
that<00:04:05.940> simplicity<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.610> possibility

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
that simplicity and and the possibility

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.390 
that simplicity and and the possibility
that<00:04:09.390> systemic<00:04:10.110> thinking<00:04:10.320> so<00:04:10.920> what's<00:04:11.310> a

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
that systemic thinking so what's a

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.490 
that systemic thinking so what's a
semantic<00:04:11.700> thinkers<00:04:12.030> a<00:04:12.060> good<00:04:12.480> at<00:04:12.600> because<00:04:13.470> I

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
semantic thinkers a good at because I

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.200 
semantic thinkers a good at because I
understand<00:04:13.980> how<00:04:14.070> each<00:04:14.370> node<00:04:14.670> players<00:04:14.970> of<00:04:15.090> each

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
understand how each node players of each

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.670 
understand how each node players of each
other<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.630> can<00:04:15.870> look<00:04:16.140> at<00:04:16.290> all<00:04:16.440> of<00:04:16.590> these

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
other and can look at all of these

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.890 
other and can look at all of these
relationships<00:04:17.690> simultaneously<00:04:18.690> and

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
relationships simultaneously and

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.110 
relationships simultaneously and
generate<00:04:19.290> lots<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.590> ideas<00:04:19.709> is<00:04:20.220> that<00:04:20.850> they're

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
generate lots of ideas is that they're

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.950 
generate lots of ideas is that they're
very<00:04:21.150> good<00:04:21.419> at<00:04:21.590> possibility<00:04:22.590> so<00:04:23.580> so<00:04:24.210> what<00:04:24.720> you

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
very good at possibility so so what you

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.900 
very good at possibility so so what you
get<00:04:25.260> when<00:04:25.470> you<00:04:25.590> get<00:04:25.680> a<00:04:25.740> system<00:04:26.100> system<00:04:26.640> I<00:04:26.700> think

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
get when you get a system system I think

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.340 
get when you get a system system I think
or<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.030> narrative<00:04:27.360> thinker<00:04:27.780> is<00:04:27.960> you<00:04:28.080> get<00:04:28.200> this

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
or a narrative thinker is you get this

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.550 
or a narrative thinker is you get this
lovely<00:04:28.700> tension<00:04:29.700> between<00:04:30.380> simplicity<00:04:31.380> and

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
lovely tension between simplicity and

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.779 
lovely tension between simplicity and
possible

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
possible

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.420 
possible
when<00:04:33.360> that<00:04:33.900> is<00:04:33.960> off<00:04:34.319> when<00:04:34.919> all<00:04:35.069> you've<00:04:35.249> got<00:04:35.400> a

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
when that is off when all you've got a

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.129 
when that is off when all you've got a
simplicity<00:04:35.909> have<00:04:36.210> just<00:04:36.389> got<00:04:36.539> simple<00:04:36.900> brand

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
simplicity have just got simple brand

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.399 
simplicity have just got simple brand
storytellers<00:04:38.150> then<00:04:39.150> then<00:04:39.569> you<00:04:39.689> get<00:04:39.900> really

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:40.409 
storytellers then then you get really

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.829 
storytellers then then you get really
through<00:04:40.740> a<00:04:41.129> lucid<00:04:41.939> brand<00:04:42.210> thinking<00:04:42.689> but

00:04:42.829 --> 00:04:42.839 
through a lucid brand thinking but

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:45.589 
through a lucid brand thinking but
without<00:04:43.050> innovation<00:04:43.339> and<00:04:44.339> when<00:04:44.520> you<00:04:44.639> get<00:04:44.759> just

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
without innovation and when you get just

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:47.799 
without innovation and when you get just
this<00:04:45.870> possibility<00:04:46.860> of<00:04:46.949> systematic<00:04:47.430> thinkers

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:47.809 
this possibility of systematic thinkers

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:50.149 
this possibility of systematic thinkers
then<00:04:48.809> you<00:04:48.960> get<00:04:49.139> really<00:04:49.319> interesting<00:04:49.979> and

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
then you get really interesting and

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:51.829 
then you get really interesting and
multiple<00:04:50.580> tactics<00:04:50.819> that<00:04:51.089> don't<00:04:51.330> some<00:04:51.569> ladder

00:04:51.829 --> 00:04:51.839 
multiple tactics that don't some ladder

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:54.619 
multiple tactics that don't some ladder
up<00:04:52.110> to<00:04:52.139> a<00:04:52.349> simple<00:04:52.710> brand<00:04:52.949> ain't<00:04:53.159> so<00:04:54.059> so<00:04:54.449> that's

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
up to a simple brand ain't so so that's

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:55.700 
up to a simple brand ain't so so that's
how<00:04:54.749> I<00:04:54.779> can<00:04:54.900> tell<00:04:55.199> whether<00:04:55.349> we<00:04:55.499> have<00:04:55.620> the

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
how I can tell whether we have the

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.320 
how I can tell whether we have the
balance<00:04:56.039> right<00:04:56.189> on<00:04:56.400> whether<00:04:56.909> you<00:04:57.150> know

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
balance right on whether you know

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.829 
balance right on whether you know
whether<00:04:57.809> things<00:04:58.050> are<00:04:58.669> simple<00:04:59.669> they<00:04:59.759> are<00:04:59.839> but

00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:00.839 
whether things are simple they are but

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:02.959 
whether things are simple they are but
not<00:05:00.990> innovative<00:05:01.559> or<00:05:01.740> innovative<00:05:02.550> but<00:05:02.729> not

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:02.969 
not innovative or innovative but not

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.540 
not innovative or innovative but not
lucid<00:05:03.569> so<00:05:04.319> that<00:05:04.469> balance<00:05:04.770> becomes<00:05:05.339> very

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
lucid so that balance becomes very

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.309 
lucid so that balance becomes very
