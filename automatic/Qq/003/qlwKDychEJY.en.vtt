if<00:00:00.530> you<00:00:01.530> need<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.829> extrude<00:00:02.190> components<00:00:02.850> you

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
if you need to extrude components you

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.760 
if you need to extrude components you
have<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.090> few<00:00:03.360> options<00:00:03.389> available<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.290> you<00:00:04.440> you

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
have a few options available to you you

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.289 
have a few options available to you you
can<00:00:04.920> find<00:00:05.160> them<00:00:05.279> under<00:00:05.549> the<00:00:05.670> model<00:00:05.970> toolbar

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
can find them under the model toolbar

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.560 
can find them under the model toolbar
under<00:00:06.690> modify<00:00:07.490> poly<00:00:08.490> mesh<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.269> can<00:00:09.420> see

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
under modify poly mesh and you can see

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.810 
under modify poly mesh and you can see
we<00:00:09.809> have<00:00:09.840> extra<00:00:10.410> long<00:00:10.590> axis<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.340> extra<00:00:11.610> long

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
we have extra long axis and extra long

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.509 
we have extra long axis and extra long
curve<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.809> extrude<00:00:13.110> options<00:00:13.590> work<00:00:13.920> for<00:00:14.309> all

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
curve the extrude options work for all

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.189 
curve the extrude options work for all
of<00:00:14.549> your<00:00:14.849> components<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.540> can<00:00:15.780> extrude

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
of your components so you can extrude

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.800 
of your components so you can extrude
you<00:00:17.130> can<00:00:17.279> extrude<00:00:17.699> edges<00:00:18.359> as<00:00:18.630> well<00:00:19.380> as<00:00:20.810> faces

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
you can extrude edges as well as faces

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.109 
you can extrude edges as well as faces
and<00:00:22.050> vertices<00:00:24.740> there<00:00:25.740> we<00:00:25.980> go<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.519> here's<00:00:26.760> an

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
and vertices there we go and here's an

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.529 
and vertices there we go and here's an
extrovert<00:00:27.810> each<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.740> which<00:00:28.890> have<00:00:29.539> have

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
so we're going to go ahead and look at

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.940 
so we're going to go ahead and look at
be<00:00:36.020> extra<00:00:37.020> long<00:00:37.230> access<00:00:38.090> so<00:00:39.260> we'll<00:00:40.260> select<00:00:40.710> a

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
be extra long access so we'll select a

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.540 
be extra long access so we'll select a
couple<00:00:41.250> faces<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.910> we'll<00:00:42.719> go<00:00:42.930> ahead<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.649> just

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
couple faces and we'll go ahead and just

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.229 
couple faces and we'll go ahead and just
go<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> polygon<00:00:45.149> mesh<00:00:45.920> extra-long<00:00:46.920> access<00:00:47.460> now

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
go to polygon mesh extra-long access now

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.900 
go to polygon mesh extra-long access now
these<00:00:48.750> options<00:00:49.489> you<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.610> few<00:00:50.789> options

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
these options you have a few options

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.610 
these options you have a few options
available<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> length<00:00:52.289> which

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
available to you you have a length which

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.229 
available to you you have a length which
will<00:00:52.800> determine<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.250> length<00:00:53.399> width<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.850> units

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
will determine the length width in units

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.130 
will determine the length width in units
of<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:55.320> extrude<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:57.000> have<00:00:57.210> an<00:00:57.390> inset<00:00:57.780> amount

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
of the extrude you have an inset amount

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.849 
of the extrude you have an inset amount
which<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.399> roughly<00:00:59.879> its<00:01:00.090> scale<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:01.680> scale

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
which is roughly its scale the scale

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.429 
which is roughly its scale the scale
offset<00:01:02.489> from<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:03.059> original<00:01:03.120> selection<00:01:03.600> so

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
offset from your original selection so

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.530 
offset from your original selection so
here<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.339> go<00:01:05.610> ahead<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.330> see

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
here we can go ahead and you can see

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.670 
here we can go ahead and you can see
that<00:01:06.740> we're<00:01:07.740> scaling<00:01:08.070> we're<00:01:08.850> scaling<00:01:09.680> these

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.890 

you<00:02:09.979> can<00:02:10.310> set<00:02:11.090> which<00:02:12.220> which<00:02:13.540> axes<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.780> would

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
you can set which which axes you would

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.530 
you can set which which axes you would
like<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.260> extrude<00:02:15.530> along<00:02:15.770> in<00:02:16.069> this<00:02:16.610> case<00:02:16.880> we're

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
like to extrude along in this case we're

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.780 
like to extrude along in this case we're
using<00:02:17.569> y<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.260> z<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:19.280> can<00:02:19.430> set<00:02:19.640> any

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
using y and z you can set any

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.570 
using y and z you can set any
combination<00:02:20.450> of<00:02:20.709> of<00:02:21.709> axes<00:02:22.610> that<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:23.150> like

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
combination of of axes that you like

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.930 
combination of of axes that you like
this<00:02:25.580> merge<00:02:25.940> option<00:02:26.540> will<00:02:27.370> unmerge<00:02:28.370> all<00:02:28.730> of

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
this merge option will unmerge all of

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.699 
this merge option will unmerge all of
these<00:02:29.090> polygons<00:02:29.569> so<00:02:29.870> essentially<00:02:30.380> you'll<00:02:30.530> get

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
these polygons so essentially you'll get

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.570 
these polygons so essentially you'll get
an<00:02:30.800> extrude<00:02:31.190> /<00:02:31.459> polygon<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:33.260> if<00:02:33.349> we<00:02:33.470> brought<00:02:33.709> we

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
an extrude / polygon so if we brought we

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.000 
an extrude / polygon so if we brought we
brought<00:02:34.940> in<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.690> y<00:02:35.930> axis<00:02:36.319> you<00:02:36.440> can<00:02:36.470> see<00:02:36.769> that

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
brought in the y axis you can see that

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.070 
brought in the y axis you can see that
we're<00:02:37.580> going<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.760> extrude<00:02:38.060> /<00:02:38.300> polygon<00:02:40.690> if<00:02:41.690> we

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
we're going to extrude / polygon if we

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.979 
we're going to extrude / polygon if we
go<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.319> our<00:02:42.530> transform<00:02:43.370> settings<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:44.660> will

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
go to our transform settings you will

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.430 
go to our transform settings you will
have<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.620> ability<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:46.840> transform<00:02:47.840> your

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
have the ability to transform your

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.120 
have the ability to transform your
extrude<00:02:49.160> so<00:02:49.549> if<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:49.880> were<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.120> go<00:02:50.660> ahead<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.170> do

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
extrude so if I were to go ahead and do

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.729 
extrude so if I were to go ahead and do
a<00:02:52.160> little<00:02:52.310> rotate<00:02:52.730> here<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:54.049> can<00:02:54.200> see<00:02:54.470> that

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
a little rotate here you can see that

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.190 
a little rotate here you can see that
it's<00:02:55.190> rotating<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.090> end<00:02:56.299> of<00:02:56.450> our<00:02:56.569> extrude<00:02:56.930> and

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
it's rotating the end of our extrude and

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.520 
it's rotating the end of our extrude and
the<00:02:57.319> more<00:02:57.500> subdivisions<00:02:57.739> you<00:02:58.250> have<00:02:59.530> the

the more subdivisions you have the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.559 
the more subdivisions you have the
different<00:03:00.890> kinds<00:03:01.549> of<00:03:01.610> looks<00:03:01.790> you'll<00:03:02.299> be<00:03:02.480> able

to perform different types of operations

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.949 
to perform different types of operations
cool<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:09.140> those<00:03:09.739> are<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:10.750> extrude<00:03:11.750> along

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
subdivisions the more closely your your

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.910 
subdivisions the more closely your your
extrude<00:03:57.500> will<00:03:57.680> match<00:03:57.859> your<00:03:58.340> curve<00:03:59.680> you<00:04:00.680> have

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
extrude will match your curve you have

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.729 
extrude will match your curve you have
an<00:04:01.069> in<00:04:01.220> sentiment<00:04:02.859> you<00:04:03.859> can<00:04:04.510> auto<00:04:05.510> rotate<00:04:06.230> so

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
an in sentiment you can auto rotate so

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.620 
an in sentiment you can auto rotate so
it<00:04:07.130> will<00:04:07.430> align<00:04:08.139> the<00:04:09.280> curve<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:11.120> be<00:04:11.209> tangent

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
it will align the curve to be tangent

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.939 
it will align the curve to be tangent
with<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:12.910> faces<00:04:13.910> that<00:04:13.940> you<00:04:14.060> have<00:04:14.269> selected

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949 
with the faces that you have selected

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:18.660 
with the faces that you have selected
that<00:04:15.949> would<00:04:16.100> turn<00:04:16.250> that<00:04:16.430> option<00:04:17.419> on<00:04:17.540> here

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
that would turn that option on here

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.070 
that would turn that option on here
the<00:04:19.860> perpendicular<00:04:20.860> will<00:04:21.250> take<00:04:21.850> each<00:04:22.210> polygon

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
the perpendicular will take each polygon

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.560 
the perpendicular will take each polygon
here<00:04:23.560> so<00:04:24.160> if<00:04:24.280> we<00:04:24.400> turn<00:04:24.610> this<00:04:24.760> option<00:04:24.970> on<00:04:25.300> it

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
here so if we turn this option on it

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.050 
here so if we turn this option on it
will<00:04:26.140> have<00:04:26.440> all<00:04:26.800> of<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:27.400> polygons

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
will have all of the polygons

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.530 
will have all of the polygons
perpendicular<00:04:29.020> to<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.680> curve<00:04:30.060> so<00:04:31.060> it<00:04:31.360> will

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
perpendicular to the curve so it will

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.290 
perpendicular to the curve so it will
kind<00:04:31.900> of<00:04:32.050> remain<00:04:32.400> it<00:04:33.400> will<00:04:33.610> maintain<00:04:34.090> its

kind of remain it will maintain its
volume<00:04:34.780> your<00:04:35.440> extrude<00:04:35.770> will<00:04:35.950> maintain<00:04:36.160> the
