00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.330
 it's difficult because there are great players 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:19.550
 Today I had the good fortune to share with 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:22.160
 Some that you have shared with them 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.020
 Move from the memory game very worthy as 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.080
 they spoke apprentice in case one does not stop 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.690
 learn in this from football are they 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.430
 approaching them and they as such 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.440
 also that experience try to 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.719
 communicate it to one and that's good for 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.929
 one because one tries to learn from 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.929
 they 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.899
 I hope they have the confidence even if 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.969
 a few minutes and make the most 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.979
 I'm working hard I'm trying 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.799
 to win me a field we know what good 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.350
 missing integrate save the saurians that 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:03.100
 It is a great 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.189
 I totally hope that one wants to wish 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.770
 can ask for a field and one comes here to 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.350
 try to make things the best 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.060
 way to quickly adapt to the idea 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.030
 what 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.880
 what do you want because the mind does not want 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.619
 because it's a totally different thing 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.750
 It is totally different 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.060
 to the most diagonal goal that comes out most 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.100
 pivot that goes out to look for the ball to 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.170
 change with saints he wants rather than 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.630
 be inside you would only be looking for the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.090
 centers Juan Diego Madrigal Raisa but 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.149
 here it is totally different and I wish 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.619
 better adapt as quickly as possible to 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.619
 have the happiness to participate 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.990
 and if they are not things that I do not know how 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.300
 work is boring because in the little 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.979
 that I have been with conflict he wants 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.550
 something totally different from what 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.550
 practice 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.910
 yesterday when the match ended against 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.590
 vÃ©lez told me that I had to 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:13.920
 introduce myself at seven thirty in the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.920
 hotel now I had to go paraguay 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.170
 to integrate the selection but thanks 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.540
 to God everything went in the best way and 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.940
 I was able to arrive yesterday in very good 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.700
 conditions to the hotel and already today for said 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.459
 I train and I felt really good I want 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.920
 take clothes with the family that come to 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.370
 pick up personal things because it did not come 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.650
 prepared I did not know anything I had to go to 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.080
 team also put personal things 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.850
 but thanks to God, I had the happiness 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.459
 the memory of the best way to 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.620
 integrate fills me with the equipment I had it 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.460
 by saying today I trained and I felt very 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.350
 all right 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.320
 and I am physically very well because 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.660
 we had a good preseason and 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:00.250
 I am in a very good way and as I say 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.680
 I'm running but the two forwards 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.200
 that are taken into account for this commitment 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.540
 all taken into account 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.700
 thanks the teacher is watching the 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.670
 work that one is doing and for 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.430
 said that you are seeing the results 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.320
 that one is having inside the field 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.850
 of game the regularity that I had 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.190
 thank god can achieve a 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.600
 scoring championship and now in this 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.580
 championship I think I'm doing 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.550
 very well things has already scored two 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.010
 annotations and I think that little to 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.320
 little one is gaining the confidence of the 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.090
 teacher and I hope you keep taking me on 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.090
 account for for the tie 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.500
 and if it's totally different start 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.530
 you are more exhausting but thanks to 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.440
 God physically I feel good and now 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.440
 I was doing it 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.370
 with other players who arrived today and 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.500
 no no I did not feel very well I feel a 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.990
 I like the scheme that is 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.330
 posing and I wish it was grabbing 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.910
 quickly to get the best 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:10.250
 and I hope I can put it in 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.250
 practice of the rector in requested sheets
