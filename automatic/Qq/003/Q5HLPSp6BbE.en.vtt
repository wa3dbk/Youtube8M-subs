see that one wheel motion we're only one
wheel<00:01:22.020> moves<00:01:23.180> so<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.330> able<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:24.990> turn

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
wheel moves so it's able to can turn

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.670 
wheel moves so it's able to can turn
this<00:01:25.770> one's<00:01:26.009> kind<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.700> loose<00:01:26.909> see<00:01:27.680> so
