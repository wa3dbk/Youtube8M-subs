yeah oh and something I've been
experimenting<00:02:59.400> with<00:03:01.550> is<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:04.430> new<00:03:08.510> exhaust

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.140 

which<00:03:12.569> is<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.780> silencer<00:03:13.440> it's<00:03:14.130> called<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.640> SMS

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
which is a silencer it's called the SMS

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.670 
which is a silencer it's called the SMS
shorty<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:16.610> shaved<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.850> off<00:03:18.060> with<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:18.989> file<00:03:19.290> I

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
shorty I shaved that off with a file I

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:30.430 
shorty I shaved that off with a file I
was<00:03:20.580> thinking<00:03:20.940> about<00:03:21.090> putting<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:27.830> like<00:03:28.830> this

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
was thinking about putting it like this

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.490 
was thinking about putting it like this
can't<00:03:31.440> see<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.769> tool<00:03:31.950> but<00:03:32.640> yes<00:03:33.319> someone<00:03:34.319> like

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
can't see the tool but yes someone like

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.229 
can't see the tool but yes someone like
that<00:03:34.670> and<00:03:35.670> taking<00:03:36.000> off<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.150> one<00:03:36.680> because

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
that and taking off that one because

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:45.740 
that and taking off that one because
this<00:03:39.239> one<00:03:40.280> see<00:03:41.280> if<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.459> can<00:03:41.579> see<00:03:41.790> it

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.650 

see<00:03:46.320> how<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.500> can<00:03:46.680> see<00:03:46.830> straight<00:03:47.100> through<00:03:47.130> it

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
see how you can see straight through it

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.530 
see how you can see straight through it
so<00:03:48.660> I<00:03:48.720> thought<00:03:48.930> this<00:03:49.080> one<00:03:49.290> would<00:03:49.380> be<00:03:49.440> louder

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
so I thought this one would be louder

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.500 
so I thought this one would be louder
but<00:03:51.540> actually<00:03:52.490> when<00:03:53.490> I<00:03:53.520> did<00:03:53.790> some<00:03:53.940> testing<00:03:54.330> and

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
but actually when I did some testing and

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.940 
but actually when I did some testing and
I<00:03:54.960> put<00:03:55.200> it<00:03:55.320> in<00:03:55.440> this<00:03:55.620> one<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:58.260> put<00:03:58.590> this<00:03:58.740> in

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
I put it in this one and put this in

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.620 
I put it in this one and put this in
that<00:03:59.990> without<00:04:00.990> this<00:04:01.320> course<00:04:02.300> it

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
that without this course it

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.930 
that without this course it
it's<00:04:03.990> a<00:04:04.110> silencer<00:04:04.800> not<00:04:05.190> really<00:04:05.460> an<00:04:05.580> exhaust

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
it's a silencer not really an exhaust

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.970 
it's a silencer not really an exhaust
more<00:04:06.360> of<00:04:06.420> a<00:04:06.480> silencer<00:04:06.990> it<00:04:07.140> completely<00:04:07.830> makes

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
more of a silencer it completely makes

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.390 
more of a silencer it completely makes
it<00:04:08.190> quiet<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:08.550> I<00:04:08.880> don't<00:04:09.210> know<00:04:13.010> maybe<00:04:14.010> it<00:04:14.250> was

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
it quiet so I don't know maybe it was

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.630 
it quiet so I don't know maybe it was
because<00:04:14.580> I<00:04:14.760> put<00:04:15.120> this<00:04:15.540> as<00:04:15.780> an<00:04:15.900> attachment<00:04:16.640> at

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
because I put this as an attachment at

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.099 
because I put this as an attachment at
the<00:04:17.910> end<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.269> that's<00:04:18.390> what<00:04:18.540> made<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:18.750> like

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
the end and that's what made it like

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.220 
the end and that's what made it like
completely<00:04:20.090> completely<00:04:21.090> quiet<00:04:21.450> and<00:04:21.720> maybe<00:04:22.080> it

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
completely completely quiet and maybe it

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.890 
completely completely quiet and maybe it
would<00:04:22.350> be<00:04:22.470> different<00:04:22.680> if<00:04:23.040> I<00:04:23.480> get<00:04:24.480> the<00:04:24.660> pipe

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
would be different if I get the pipe

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.310 
would be different if I get the pipe
adjusters<00:04:25.470> or<00:04:25.800> pipe<00:04:26.520> adaptors<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.320> connect

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
adjusters or pipe adaptors and connect

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.720 
adjusters or pipe adaptors and connect
it<00:04:28.440> directly<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.980> the<00:04:29.100> head<00:04:29.280> but<00:04:31.310> I'm<00:04:32.310> not<00:04:32.520> head

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
it directly to the head but I'm not head

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.580

supposed<00:04:35.310> to<00:04:35.400> be<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.520> silencer<00:04:35.850> but<00:04:36.180> I<00:04:37.310> thought

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
supposed to be a silencer but I thought

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.500 
supposed to be a silencer but I thought
it<00:04:38.430> would<00:04:38.520> be<00:04:38.640> a<00:04:38.670> little<00:04:38.850> bit<00:04:39.090> louder<00:04:39.270> because

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
it would be a little bit louder because

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.490 
it would be a little bit louder because
it's<00:04:39.720> straight<00:04:40.020> pipe<00:04:41.930> mmm<00:04:42.930> that's<00:04:43.200> what<00:04:43.320> it
