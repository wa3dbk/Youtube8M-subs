00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello welcome to dj from asia 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.930
 international in Spanish in this 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.530
 tutorial I want to show you how to do 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.809
 beautiful little balls or balls with gummies 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.509
 see that the link of the technique to 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.900
 use is very simple and for that 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.840
 we need gummies many gummies 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.210
 the colors that you like the most 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.910
 of gummies will depend on the size that 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.090
 you want to make the little ball in this case 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.969
 I used approximately 200 or a little 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.739
 more it is important that you have many to the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.410
 hand so that if they want to do it 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.809
 bigger or more chubby can do it 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.239
 and a good part of the gummies we need 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.820
 a piece of paper we start doing 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.700
 These cute balls with gummies 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.010
 taking that piece of paper to which 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.980
 we also give it a more or less 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.059
 circulate a round shape and about it 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.630
 we will place the bent gummies of a 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.570
 extreme towards the other extreme 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.880
 look how I do it and this process what 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.100
 let's go do it first if you want 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.500
 with a rubber band later you can go taking 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.350
 two to accelerate the process is 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.600
 basically the same thing you're taking gummies 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.060
 the subject as in this case your finger 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.730
 thumb you take a turn and raisins 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.820
 towards the other extreme and so you go 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.300
 placing gummies to increase the 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.370
 size of the ball that you are doing 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.450
 if it's easier for you to take just one 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.060
 Gummy at the same time you can do it 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.399
 if you can take two or three gummies 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.460
 same time then also the important thing 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.549
 is that you are reaching that form 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.000
 round that you see here and that size that 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.000
 you want 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:30.380
 we continue putting gummies in a way 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:33.980
 double around that paper 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.400
 and here we see that paper no longer 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.370
 View is already covered completely by 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.340
 gumdrops and this is good because the 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.560
 way to go covering the complete thing you 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.570
 we are going to give small returns to 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.570
 as the gummies are placed 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:56.769
 we are going to be doing this same process 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.769
 until we reach the size we want 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.430
 when we have reached the size of the 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.939
 ball or ball that we wanted then 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.360
 to give it that beautiful look that 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:17.360
 we want to start placing him not two 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.329
 gummies or three gummies at the same time but one 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.409
 for one and this we will do without 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:26.450
 place double or double gummies 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:30.019
 with our games simply 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:34.069
 we put rubber band around the ball or 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:37.579
 ball we give a little twist to the 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:41.870
 ball and we put a new rubber band and 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:43.780
 we go around the ball placing 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.150
 new comets 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.360
 exactly in the center will follow a little 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.989
 the ball or the ball and a 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.989
 new food and so we go until the 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:00.290
 colors that we are combining remain in 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.390
 the position we want or if the ball 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.240
 it is one color until the lists 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:09.210
 they are distributed evenly 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.500
 and good since then we have this 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:15.660
 nice little ball with finished gummies 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:19.500
 these balls of gummies are in addition to 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:22.230
 pretty very very elastic if you hit them 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.810
 against the wall or the floor they jump 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.720
 really immediately to be taken 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.840
 be careful with them and good if you wish 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.350
 You can also give them as 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:36.060
 anti-stress are very flexible and good 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.940
 I hope you enjoyed it so much 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.590
 ball as the tutorial and if easy not 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.480
