 motivates to keep alive what 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.400
 that is the circus culture look at the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.320
 true that I was born based practically 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.180
 I grew up in a circus in fact Pablo Ruz is 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.810
 the guy who does the routines with me 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.640
 let's say the one who taught me and this is how 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.350
 a love that I have that I want to have already 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.180
 always whenever I can I'll 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.680
 keep coming in this case we are 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.229
 including people like in this case 'the 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.210

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.440

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.510

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.640

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.740

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.400
 all January in punta lara we will be 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.540
 on weekends because I have 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.930
 I just have the marley program 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.330
 is that we were going to be there only 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.619
 let's say Saturdays and Sundays again the 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.090
 municipality is not good at opening the 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.680
 doors to a cultural show in 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.259
 this case a circus that has already been in 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.850
 this city if the circus bulnes had 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.220
 the possibility will be dealing with the year 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.680
 carl inlet of which he had a great 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.600
 repercussion and through the management of 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.910
 Intendant's exercise could return 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.770
 and now the town of Punta Lara with 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.600
 a very special seasoning not to extract 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.600
 a nationally recognized artist 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.470
 one of the most important there is today 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.210
 in Argentina, which is the motor 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.040
 is an artist that are uncoded is 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.680
 something not bad and good has been chosen 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.230
 inked mainly by the 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.600
 conditions and how one treats all this 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.640
 type of art comes out and encourages culture 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.110
 it is a possibility that they will have no 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.580
 only the passion to inlet but the 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.140
 tourists that arrive on the weekend 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.780
 circus goes to dawn during all the 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.940
 month of January the idea is that power 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.340
 do it and expand it throughout the region 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.800
 that not only remains in cove and tip 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.930
 lara but also how it happened in 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.360
 today that people came from the silver 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.190
 came good berisso people all the 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.870
 people who spend the weekend 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.130
 you will find you are going to find the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.860
 possibility of enjoying a 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.260
 important and beautiful show and 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.840
 cultural like the circus this culture 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.480
 that is not lost and if you could continue 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.100
 fostering all this I believe that all 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.310
 districts should open the doors 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.740
 because it's a beautiful culture is something that 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.209
 we were all once a circus when 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.610
 we were kids and it was what we most 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.320
 I liked watching the clowns and all that and 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.540
 I 'm going to repeat this seasoning of this 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.460
 national artist who has chosen 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.710
 this circus kool next 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.870
 and has chosen punta lara to be able 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.080
 represent it and make it massive in all 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.080
 the argentina
