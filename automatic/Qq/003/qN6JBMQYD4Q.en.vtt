 at the time of the order it cost 1500 rubles 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.160
 the parcel went 23 days 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.430
 let's open let's see the complete set 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:56.329
 and then check it on 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:58.949
 health console for tuner 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.940

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.940
 battery powered 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:16.430
 Further small manual in English 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:20.700
 language further 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:25.340
 the adapter should be in my 5 volts 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:29.670
 up to really 5 volts and 2 amps and 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.790
 here it is the tuner itself is quite small 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.000
 box I honestly thought he would 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.009
 a little bigger on the front panel 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.770
 there is a standard usb input 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.399
 infrared receiver and two LEDs 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.350
 to indicate power and standby 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:50.009
 rear panel antenna input 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.200
 antenna output socket hdmi and 3 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.720
 standard tulip and video right 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.479
 channel and left channel also on the back 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.579
 panel is a socket for connection 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.320
 power adapter 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.229
 well let's plug it into the TV and 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.899
 let's see what he can do since in my 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.979
 TV has a hdmi input I connected 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.819
 you tuner through the corresponding cable 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.840
 also connected the power adapter 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.749
 and external collective antenna to run 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.670
 hitting takes about 15 seconds when 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:23.790
 the first time you turn on, you need to press 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:30.030
 menu button 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:33.900
 then the settings select the Russian language 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.879
 after that go to the channel settings and 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.069
 run auto scan from me 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.930
 channel scan already done tuner 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:46.569
 I found 20 TVs without problems 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:48.400
 channels and 3 radio stations shoot out 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.200
 quite understandable with it 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.689
 make adjustments adjust 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.090
 volume switch channels and if in 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:57.060
 yusb port tuners inserted flash drive or 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.469
 hard drive using the remote can 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.949
 start recording television broadcast 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:04.780
 or audio video player 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:06.659
 channels switch in about 2 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.250
 seconds 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:13.180
 image quality is good enough 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.189
 I can not say the form or not but 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.189
 Personally, the image quality is quite 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:20.379
 let's arrange for comparison I'm 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:23.229
 Large show some logo 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:26.370
 channel and compare digital tv and 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:29.500
 analog is the TV channel logo 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:33.220
 Russia-24 and such image quality 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.259
 coming from a chinese tv tuner this is a logo 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.859
 same channel and currently 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:40.569
 broadcast comes from analog signal 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.220
 this quality is obtained by recording 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.519
 TV broadcast to USB flash drive 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.189
 connected to the usb port then go to 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:51.189
 the real size of the picture is 720 by 576 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:53.889
 points record is made in mts format 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:59.099
 30 minutes of television take 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:04:04.870
 on a flash drive 670 megabytes tuner size 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:08.290
 height 119 mm width 76 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.979
 millimeters and a thickness of about 25 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.969
 millimeters 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:14.859
 it weighs only 113 grams remote 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.419
 remote control medium 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:19.199
 size 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:24.710
 its width is 43 millimeters 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:27.650
 length 140 8 millimeters and thickness 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:31.190
 17 millimeters as I expected 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.710
 it is powered by two 3a batteries 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.630
 to the main advantage of this then you tuner i 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.699
 I'll take a small size and weight 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.870
 the ability to connect to a TV with 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.870
 using hdmi 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.210
 either tulips presence of embedded audio 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.150
 video player recording capability 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.789
 TV broadcasts intuitively 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.050
 clear menu and quite acceptable 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:55.789
 image quality to the minuses I'll take 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.190
 quite a long run time of 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.470
 standby and two-second 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.539
 switching channels if the channel 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.030
 would switch for half a second it would be 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:07.250
 much better this tuner i use 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.110
 already about three weeks and watch 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.810
 analog television to be honest 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.090
 no longer want to link to the seller as 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.930
 usually in the description of the video put the Huskies 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.930
