00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
don't really understand looks like a

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.640 
don't really understand looks like a
star<00:02:25.480> input<00:02:26.110> with<00:02:26.380> like<00:02:26.590> some<00:02:26.920> sort<00:02:27.160> o<00:02:28.410> is<00:02:29.410> out

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
star input with like some sort o is out

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.010 
star input with like some sort o is out
of<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.830> phones<00:02:30.100> possibly<00:02:30.880> do<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:31.690> plug<00:02:31.900> your

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
of the phones possibly do you plug your

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.800 
of the phones possibly do you plug your
phone<00:02:32.080> into<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.590> television<00:02:32.830> too<00:02:33.690> but<00:02:34.690> we'll

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
phone into the television too but we'll

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.350 
phone into the television too but we'll
get<00:02:34.900> into<00:02:35.020> that<00:02:35.170> later<00:02:35.850> one<00:02:36.850> side<00:02:37.090> now<00:02:37.270> yes

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.440 

so<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.230> TV's<00:02:41.560> got<00:02:41.740> a<00:02:42.100> unique<00:02:42.460> monolith<00:02:42.910> design

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450

anti<00:03:51.110> glare<00:03:51.230> technology<00:03:51.829> on<00:03:51.950> there<00:03:52.220> I<00:03:53.170> think

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
anti glare technology on there I think

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.259 
anti glare technology on there I think
that<00:03:54.350> you're<00:03:54.829> up<00:03:55.069> to<00:03:55.220> contrast<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.819> panel<00:03:56.180> is

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
that you're up to contrast the panel is

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.740 
that you're up to contrast the panel is
what's<00:03:56.480> called<00:03:56.720> on<00:03:57.139> the<00:03:57.410> sides<00:03:58.569> you<00:03:59.569> can<00:03:59.690> see

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
what's called on the sides you can see

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.069 
what's called on the sides you can see
all<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.049> ports<00:04:00.260> so<00:04:01.329> down<00:04:02.329> here<00:04:02.600> we've<00:04:02.810> got<00:04:02.900> an

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
all the ports so down here we've got an

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:03.900 
all the ports so down here we've got an
emergency

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910

energy<00:04:04.910> savings<00:04:05.329> switch<00:04:06.340> which<00:04:07.340> I<00:04:07.579> don't<00:04:07.760> know

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
energy savings switch which I don't know

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.000 
energy savings switch which I don't know
what<00:04:07.970> that<00:04:08.060> does<00:04:08.299> but<00:04:08.660> I'm<00:04:09.470> sure<00:04:09.680> it<00:04:09.799> saves

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
what that does but I'm sure it saves

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.349 
what that does but I'm sure it saves
energy<00:04:10.130> and<00:04:10.340> we'll<00:04:10.519> have<00:04:10.639> a<00:04:10.670> look<00:04:10.819> at<00:04:10.910> it<00:04:11.000> later

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
energy and we'll have a look at it later

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.210 
energy and we'll have a look at it later
you<00:04:11.810> also<00:04:11.930> got<00:04:12.200> physical<00:04:12.859> buttons<00:04:13.099> on<00:04:13.160> the

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
you also got physical buttons on the

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.370 
you also got physical buttons on the
side<00:04:13.459> in<00:04:13.609> case<00:04:13.790> you<00:04:14.060> are<00:04:14.690> closer<00:04:14.930> to<00:04:15.139> the<00:04:15.230> TV

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
side in case you are closer to the TV

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.199 
side in case you are closer to the TV
than<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.650> remote<00:04:15.920> obviously<00:04:16.340> don't<00:04:17.060> be<00:04:17.209> lazy

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
than the remote obviously don't be lazy

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:29.379 
than the remote obviously don't be lazy
on<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.660> back<00:04:23.470> you<00:04:24.470> have<00:04:24.830> got<00:04:27.310> two<00:04:28.310> HDMI<00:04:28.789> ports

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
on the back you have got two HDMI ports

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.540 
on the back you have got two HDMI ports
I<00:04:29.599> believe<00:04:30.500> this<00:04:30.650> is<00:04:30.710> for<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.039> Sony<00:04:31.280> Ericsson

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
I believe this is for the Sony Ericsson

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.210 
I believe this is for the Sony Ericsson
Arc<00:04:32.090> and<00:04:32.930> that's<00:04:33.200> why<00:04:33.380> it<00:04:33.440> says<00:04:33.680> arc<00:04:33.979> on<00:04:34.190> it

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
Arc and that's why it says arc on it

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.760 
Arc and that's why it says arc on it
which<00:04:34.820> must<00:04:35.120> be<00:04:35.210> what<00:04:35.419> that<00:04:35.570> cable<00:04:36.020> my<00:04:36.380> before

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
which must be what that cable my before

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.219 
which must be what that cable my before
and<00:04:37.180> but<00:04:38.180> I<00:04:38.210> don't<00:04:38.419> have<00:04:38.539> that<00:04:38.660> phone<00:04:38.930> to

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
and but I don't have that phone to

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.010 
and but I don't have that phone to
demonstrate<00:04:40.070> anyway<00:04:40.460> down<00:04:41.300> here<00:04:41.539> you've<00:04:41.720> got

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
demonstrate anyway down here you've got

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.520 
demonstrate anyway down here you've got
your<00:04:42.380> RF<00:04:43.250> input<00:04:43.780> an<00:04:44.780> AV<00:04:45.139> input<00:04:45.470> there<00:04:45.620> too

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
your RF input an AV input there too

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.870 
your RF input an AV input there too
and<00:04:48.530> also<00:04:48.740> a<00:04:49.070> landing<00:04:49.430> but<00:04:49.550> even<00:04:49.729> though<00:04:49.789> it's

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
and also a landing but even though it's

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.060 
and also a landing but even though it's
got<00:04:50.030> Wi-Fi<00:04:50.210> built-in<00:04:50.780> you<00:04:51.560> have<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.830> option

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
got Wi-Fi built-in you have the option

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.100 
got Wi-Fi built-in you have the option
to<00:04:52.130> plug<00:04:52.340> in<00:04:52.490> Ethernet<00:04:52.940> as<00:04:53.000> well<00:04:53.150> which

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
to plug in Ethernet as well which

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.560 
to plug in Ethernet as well which
is<00:04:54.170> good<00:04:54.920> for<00:04:54.950> faster<00:04:55.460> connections<00:04:55.850> and<00:04:56.060> then

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
is good for faster connections and then

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:57.550 
is good for faster connections and then
I<00:04:56.660> should<00:04:56.780> probably<00:04:56.930> show<00:04:57.140> you<00:04:57.170> that<00:04:57.410> on<00:04:57.530> the
