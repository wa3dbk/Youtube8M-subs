00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.010
 hello good afternoon to all and all 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.660
 these will seem silly like cocoon a screenshot in the 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.529
 sea 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:16.070
 they passed in diameter there are people who after years using is a neighborhood of 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.949
 madrid that still has no idea how it is 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.839
 there 3 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:24.019
 basic ways you should make these screenshots a 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.899
 full full screen capture 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:26.730
 capture 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.369
 the selection of the screen and we hope to show 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.650
 oo a screenshot of a window that we want 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.670
 2 I'm going to draw before each game is easier 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.110
 to make a screenshot to complete 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.920
 we simply want command 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.800
 and the 3 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.230
 automatically 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.230
 would be our desktop a screenshot of our entire screen 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.490
 let's resume 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.030
 now a screenshot of a selection of commands and screen 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.050
 and 4 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.800
 another variant not only this pointer 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.650
 and we will decide what part of the screen as soon as we release it will be taken 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.110
 The capture 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.350
 so be careful with doing this 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.580
 because we know how macarthur andes a pixel 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.290
 in this case two 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.560
 and here we can see that it is uncertain was a capture of this section that 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.670
 we had done 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.170
 i'm going to see a couple of front windows heroes 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.300
 for do 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.300
 a window capture we will return 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.700
 It is worth from this tribune mounted on another well liked 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.230
 commands and 4 then space does not get this amount 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.670
 and even though it extends further back, they are completely 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.040
 cover we do not know 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.790
 prose of those who remain 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.790
 and we already have our screen share of that same window 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.020
 well this has been very simple 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.380
 I hope you liked it or at least those people who comment on it in the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.050
 social networks or in the cost of their products 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.440
 you already know valenti 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.810
 as well as people who ask about everything 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.790
 write the comments 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.550
 what do you want and that is what you do not know how to do 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.850
 and so I can keep making videos about this 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.760
 many challenges to see it I salute
