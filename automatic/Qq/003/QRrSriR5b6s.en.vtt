00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
I lose it at all altitude

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.200 
I lose it at all altitude
to<00:00:44.120> figure<00:00:44.300> out<00:00:44.420> where<00:00:44.600> is<00:00:44.690> hat<00:00:46.000> for<00:00:47.000> if<00:00:47.089> I've

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
to figure out where is hat for if I've

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.729 
to figure out where is hat for if I've
really<00:00:47.480> gone<00:00:47.600> a<00:00:47.660> long<00:00:47.839> ways<00:00:48.019> then<00:00:48.260> I'll<00:00:48.409> use
