00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.790
 Yes 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:34.210
 The purchasing power of the paper money is very high 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.880
 sharply lower than gold award 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.470
 Oil price is stable but the currencies 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.870
 have lost in value 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:47.230
 it was another matter of opinion and me 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.320
 suppose that if you measure correctly 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.500
 how the amount of money has increased in the 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.740
 Last 20 years in the world and how 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.000
 the debt has risen in the 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:03.970
 last 20 years and the wealth 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.470
 Increases in countries like Russia China 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.410
 and india 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.240
 that one could argue that the 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.240
 Oil price today is not higher than 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:19.050
 ten years ago when he was still under 300 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:21.729
 dollar the way to look at it 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.850
 Now I believe that the gold price 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:30.930
 high reached on 6 september last 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:34.060
 year when he was a 1921 dollar 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.180
 Risen at that time and that we still 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.670
 so in a corrective phase ourselves 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.510
 but I sell so my 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.880
 never golf 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.060
 because if i have the quality of 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.430
 Governments look and the clowns the 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.210
 at the central banks in the central banks 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.820
 So I really sit 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.780
 not feel like me ever by my gold 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.780
 disconnect
