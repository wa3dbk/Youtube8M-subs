you guys can see this is not going to

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.730 
you guys can see this is not going to
work<00:02:05.100> due<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:06.030> thickness<00:02:06.630> thickness<00:02:07.049> due

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
work due to the thickness thickness due

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.249 
work due to the thickness thickness due
to<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.220> thickness<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.119> new<00:02:09.300> ipad<00:02:09.720> so

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
to the thickness of the new ipad so

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.170 
to the thickness of the new ipad so
unfortunately<00:02:10.800> snap<00:02:11.069> on<00:02:11.250> cases<00:02:11.520> won't<00:02:11.940> work

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
unfortunately snap on cases won't work

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.790 
unfortunately snap on cases won't work
with<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.200> new<00:02:13.440> IP

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
with the new IP

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.200 
with the new IP
which<00:02:13.980> kind<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.280> sucks<00:02:14.490> who<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.820> means<00:02:14.970> case

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
which kind of sucks who that means case

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.550 
which kind of sucks who that means case
companies<00:02:15.630> pretty<00:02:15.870> much<00:02:15.990> have<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.170> redesign

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
companies pretty much have to redesign

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.680 
companies pretty much have to redesign
every<00:02:17.010> case<00:02:17.250> just<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.030> make<00:02:18.210> it<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.390> little<00:02:18.540> bit

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
every case just to make it a little bit

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.840 
every case just to make it a little bit
thicker<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.530> accommodate<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.130> new<00:02:20.310> iPad

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
thicker to accommodate the new iPad

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.840 
thicker to accommodate the new iPad
thickness<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.740> snap<00:02:22.740> on<00:02:22.950> cases<00:02:23.160> will<00:02:23.460> not<00:02:23.610> work

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
thickness so snap on cases will not work

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.580 
thickness so snap on cases will not work
with<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.180> new<00:02:24.300> iPad<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.110> let's<00:02:25.290> go<00:02:25.380> ahead<00:02:25.440> and

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
with the new iPad so let's go ahead and

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.920 
with the new iPad so let's go ahead and
see<00:02:25.770> if<00:02:25.950> one<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.220> these<00:02:26.480> cases<00:02:27.480> work<00:02:27.690> basically

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
see if one of these cases work basically

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.860 
see if one of these cases work basically
these<00:02:28.230> just<00:02:28.530> fold<00:02:29.070> over<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.640> ipad<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.240> i'm

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
these just fold over the ipad and i'm

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.480 
these just fold over the ipad and i'm
assuming<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.500> won't<00:02:31.800> work<00:02:32.010> either<00:02:32.220> because

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
assuming this won't work either because

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.940 
assuming this won't work either because
it<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.210> little<00:02:33.390> bit<00:02:33.540> thicker<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.500> hopefully

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
it is a little bit thicker but hopefully

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.680 
it is a little bit thicker but hopefully
it<00:02:35.040> can<00:02:35.130> prove<00:02:35.310> me<00:02:35.430> wrong<00:02:35.610> we'll<00:02:35.970> find<00:02:36.270> out<00:02:36.420> i

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
it can prove me wrong we'll find out i

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.990 
it can prove me wrong we'll find out i
haven't<00:02:37.500> put<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.770> on<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.220> ipad<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.850> new

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
haven't put this on the ipad the new

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.120 
haven't put this on the ipad the new
ipad<00:02:39.330> at<00:02:39.450> all<00:02:39.540> yet<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:39.960> this<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.680> an<00:02:40.740> experience

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
ipad at all yet so this is an experience

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.750 
ipad at all yet so this is an experience
for<00:02:41.370> me<00:02:41.490> too<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:43.680> far<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.340> looks<00:02:44.400> like<00:02:44.640> i'm

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
for me too and so far it looks like i'm

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.330 
for me too and so far it looks like i'm
having<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:45.090> little<00:02:45.210> bit<00:02:45.390> issues<00:02:46.080> but<00:02:46.380> i<00:02:46.560> think

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
having a little bit issues but i think

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.820 
having a little bit issues but i think
if<00:02:47.550> i<00:02:47.730> really<00:02:48.060> tried<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.470> Snug<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:49.680> there

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
if i really tried to Snug it in there

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.830 
if i really tried to Snug it in there
that<00:02:49.980> i<00:02:50.010> could<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.520> fact<00:02:51.210> i<00:02:51.360> know<00:02:51.420> i<00:02:51.540> could

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
that i could in fact i know i could

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.020 
that i could in fact i know i could
because<00:02:52.170> this<00:02:52.410> is<00:02:52.620> just<00:02:53.400> kind<00:02:53.520> of<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.700> hard<00:02:53.880> case

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
because this is just kind of a hard case

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.430 
because this is just kind of a hard case
to<00:02:54.090> get<00:02:54.330> on<00:02:54.510> right<00:02:54.810> there<00:02:54.990> you<00:02:55.140> can<00:02:55.260> already

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
to get on right there you can already

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.460 
to get on right there you can already
see<00:02:55.740> that<00:02:55.770> it's<00:02:56.040> going<00:02:56.190> on<00:02:57.080> just<00:02:58.080> got<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.350> get

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
see that it's going on just got to get

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.320 
see that it's going on just got to get
this<00:02:58.620> corner<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.490> then<00:02:59.580> we<00:02:59.730> can<00:02:59.910> confirm

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
this corner in and then we can confirm

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.480 
this corner in and then we can confirm
that<00:03:00.630> these<00:03:01.170> types<00:03:01.470> of<00:03:01.590> cases<00:03:01.770> would<00:03:02.190> work

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
that these types of cases would work

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.910 
that these types of cases would work
with<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.660> new<00:03:03.810> ipad<00:03:04.350> all<00:03:04.680> right

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
with the new ipad all right

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.560 
with the new ipad all right
unfortunately<00:03:05.070> i<00:03:05.520> cannot<00:03:05.820> get<00:03:05.970> this<00:03:06.180> corner

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
unfortunately i cannot get this corner

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.450 
unfortunately i cannot get this corner
on<00:03:06.780> i'm<00:03:07.380> not<00:03:07.650> sure<00:03:07.830> if<00:03:07.950> that's<00:03:08.070> just<00:03:08.340> because

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
on i'm not sure if that's just because

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.420 
on i'm not sure if that's just because
of<00:03:08.640> this<00:03:08.730> case<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.240> a<00:03:09.270> little<00:03:09.510> bit<00:03:09.630> thicker<00:03:09.870> or

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
of this case is a little bit thicker or

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.740 
of this case is a little bit thicker or
i'm<00:03:11.430> not<00:03:11.610> sure<00:03:11.760> if<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:11.970> because<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.300> iPads<00:03:12.660> a

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
i'm not sure if it because the iPads a

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.670 
i'm not sure if it because the iPads a
little<00:03:12.930> bit<00:03:13.020> thicker<00:03:13.200> or<00:03:13.320> if<00:03:13.500> it's<00:03:13.620> because

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
little bit thicker or if it's because

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.730 
little bit thicker or if it's because
the<00:03:14.520> case<00:03:14.700> itself<00:03:15.120> is<00:03:15.390> just<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:16.260> case<00:03:16.500> because

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
the case itself is just the case because

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.520 
the case itself is just the case because
I<00:03:16.800> do<00:03:16.860> remember<00:03:17.070> this<00:03:17.370> case<00:03:18.050> fitting<00:03:19.050> tight<00:03:19.290> on

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
I do remember this case fitting tight on

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.130 
I do remember this case fitting tight on
the<00:03:19.800> second-generation<00:03:20.580> iPad<00:03:20.910> but<00:03:21.300> looks

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
the second-generation iPad but looks

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.810 
the second-generation iPad but looks
like<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:22.560> type<00:03:22.770> of<00:03:22.800> case<00:03:23.100> you<00:03:23.340> might<00:03:23.520> be<00:03:23.730> able

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
like this type of case you might be able

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.060 
like this type of case you might be able
to<00:03:23.970> get<00:03:24.090> away<00:03:24.180> with<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.600> I<00:03:25.110> don't<00:03:25.980> know<00:03:26.040> I

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
to get away with it I don't know I

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.310 
to get away with it I don't know I
personally<00:03:26.250> would<00:03:26.940> maybe<00:03:27.180> test<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:27.989> out<00:03:28.080> or

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
personally would maybe test it out or

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.310 
personally would maybe test it out or
contact<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:28.920> company<00:03:29.330> who<00:03:30.330> sold<00:03:31.050> it<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.170> you

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
contact the company who sold it to you

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.620 
contact the company who sold it to you
and<00:03:31.650> see<00:03:31.950> if<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.220> could<00:03:32.340> work<00:03:32.400> but<00:03:32.850> otherwise

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
and see if it could work but otherwise

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.360 
and see if it could work but otherwise
that<00:03:34.080> looks<00:03:34.380> like<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.620> could<00:03:34.709> maybe<00:03:34.950> get<00:03:35.220> it

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
that looks like you could maybe get it

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.710 
that looks like you could maybe get it
to<00:03:35.489> fit<00:03:35.640> if<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:35.940> really<00:03:36.209> stretched<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.630> out

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
to fit if you really stretched it out

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.110 
to fit if you really stretched it out
but<00:03:37.020> otherwise<00:03:37.620> no<00:03:37.980> these<00:03:38.430> cases<00:03:38.850> will<00:03:38.970> not

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
but otherwise no these cases will not

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.210 
but otherwise no these cases will not
work<00:03:39.270> and<00:03:39.690> of<00:03:39.810> course<00:03:39.840> we<00:03:40.110> got<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.500> last<00:03:40.770> case

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
work and of course we got the last case

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.760 
work and of course we got the last case

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
fits perfectly just as if it was the

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.470 
fits perfectly just as if it was the
ipad<00:03:57.930> 2<00:03:58.110> because<00:03:58.350> it<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.890> same<00:03:59.040> design

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
ipad 2 because it is the same design

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.840 
ipad 2 because it is the same design
still<00:04:00.480> works<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.140> everything<00:04:01.200> so<00:04:02.040> pretty

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
still works and everything so pretty

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.150 
still works and everything so pretty
much<00:04:02.940> uh<00:04:03.180> most<00:04:04.020> cases<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.620> will<00:04:04.770> work<00:04:04.950> with

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
much uh most cases that will work with

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.970 
much uh most cases that will work with
the<00:04:05.310> new<00:04:05.640> ipad<00:04:06.120> they<00:04:06.360> have<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.780> be<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:07.170> little

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
the new ipad they have to be a little

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.710 
the new ipad they have to be a little
bit<00:04:08.130> thicker<00:04:08.400> like<00:04:08.880> kind<00:04:09.150> of<00:04:09.180> like<00:04:09.239> this<00:04:09.510> zoo

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
bit thicker like kind of like this zoo

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.870 
bit thicker like kind of like this zoo
who<00:04:09.870> case<00:04:10.110> right<00:04:10.769> here<00:04:10.800> that's<00:04:11.580> me<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:11.790> little

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
who case right here that's me a little

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.280 
who case right here that's me a little
bit<00:04:12.000> thicker<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.450> be<00:04:12.570> able<00:04:12.660> to<00:04:12.870> accommodate

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
bit thicker to be able to accommodate

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.490 
bit thicker to be able to accommodate
more<00:04:13.950> of<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.690> ipad<00:04:16.109> because<00:04:16.320> it<00:04:16.410> is

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
more of the the ipad because it is

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.099 
more of the the ipad because it is
thicker<00:04:16.739> what<00:04:17.459> cases<00:04:17.730> like<00:04:18.120> this<00:04:18.330> snap<00:04:18.720> on<00:04:18.930> one

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
thicker what cases like this snap on one

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.650 
thicker what cases like this snap on one
they<00:04:19.290> already<00:04:19.530> built<00:04:19.830> specifically<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:21.090> the

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
they already built specifically to the

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.800 
they already built specifically to the
design<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:23.039> actual<00:04:23.460> size<00:04:23.789> of<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.510> device

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
design the actual size of the device

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.719 
design the actual size of the device
that<00:04:25.169> it<00:04:25.289> fits<00:04:25.440> floor<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.860> unfortunately

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
that it fits floor and unfortunately

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.590 
that it fits floor and unfortunately
this<00:04:26.880> will<00:04:27.060> not<00:04:27.180> fit<00:04:27.390> your

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
this will not fit your

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.630 
this will not fit your
ipad<00:04:27.960> so<00:04:28.230> you<00:04:28.290> will<00:04:28.500> have<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.860> buy<00:04:29.010> a<00:04:29.220> new<00:04:29.250> one

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
ipad so you will have to buy a new one

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.940 
ipad so you will have to buy a new one
if<00:04:29.820> you<00:04:29.940> have<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.180> case<00:04:30.630> like<00:04:30.870> this<00:04:31.110> but<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:31.860> just

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
if you have a case like this but I just

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.590 
if you have a case like this but I just
wanted<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.400> make<00:04:32.550> this<00:04:32.700> quick<00:04:33.000> video<00:04:33.210> because

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
wanted to make this quick video because

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.700 
wanted to make this quick video because
I<00:04:33.630> haven't<00:04:33.780> seen<00:04:33.990> one<00:04:34.140> of<00:04:34.170> these<00:04:34.260> yet<00:04:34.500> so<00:04:34.680> I

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
I haven't seen one of these yet so I

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.800 
I haven't seen one of these yet so I
thought<00:04:34.980> maybe<00:04:35.220> I<00:04:35.640> could<00:04:35.700> get<00:04:35.910> it<00:04:36.030> out<00:04:36.150> first

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
thought maybe I could get it out first

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.570 
thought maybe I could get it out first
but<00:04:37.350> otherwise<00:04:37.590> that's<00:04:38.040> pretty<00:04:38.250> much<00:04:38.340> it<00:04:38.520> i

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
but otherwise that's pretty much it i

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.950 
but otherwise that's pretty much it i
