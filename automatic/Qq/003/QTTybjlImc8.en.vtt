way<00:00:53.589> to<00:00:53.620> check<00:00:53.949> is<00:00:54.159> with<00:00:54.430> a<00:00:54.460> fork<00:00:54.820> being<00:00:55.510> very

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
way to check is with a fork being very

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.600 
way to check is with a fork being very
careful<00:00:56.019> when<00:00:56.589> you<00:00:56.710> release<00:00:57.040> the<00:00:57.070> steam<00:00:57.489> from

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
ready when you can just put a fork

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.210 
ready when you can just put a fork
through<00:01:01.449> it<00:01:01.659> so<00:01:02.110> they're<00:01:02.229> still<00:01:02.589> too<00:01:02.799> tough<00:01:03.010> to

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
through it so they're still too tough to

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.460
