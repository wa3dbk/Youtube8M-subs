because<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.729> looks<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:51.320> thousand<00:01:53.000> 62.5<00:01:54.000> X

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.999 

I've<00:01:57.479> read<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.110> many<00:01:58.229> studies<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.770> say<00:01:58.979> that

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
I've read so many studies that say that

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.310 
I've read so many studies that say that
if<00:01:59.400> somebody's<00:01:59.940> able<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.330> explain<00:02:00.690> and<00:02:01.020> teach

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
if somebody's able to explain and teach

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.950 
if somebody's able to explain and teach
a<00:02:01.470> concept<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:02.040> another<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:03.240> actually<00:02:03.720> takes

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
a concept to another that actually takes

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.570 
a concept to another that actually takes
their<00:02:04.200> level<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.530> understanding<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> new

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
their level of understanding to a new

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.240 
their level of understanding to a new
level<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.939> mastery<00:02:06.259> in<00:02:07.259> order<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.770> make<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.160> a

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
level of mastery in order to make it a

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.460 
level of mastery in order to make it a
little<00:02:08.459> bit<00:02:08.700> more<00:02:09.000> beneficial<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.600> them<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:10.319> I

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
little bit more beneficial to them if I

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.809 
little bit more beneficial to them if I
can<00:02:10.619> have<00:02:10.800> them<00:02:11.039> teach<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.580> another

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
can have them teach it to another

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.220 
can have them teach it to another
student<00:02:12.180> then<00:02:13.050> they're<00:02:13.319> able<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:15.230> actually

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
student then they're able to actually

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.199 
student then they're able to actually
enrich<00:02:16.680> themselves<00:02:16.950> further<00:02:17.610> than<00:02:17.880> just<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
enrich themselves further than just the

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.449 
enrich themselves further than just the
material<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.989> that<00:02:19.020> just<00:02:19.380> takes<00:02:20.160> them<00:02:20.310> to

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
material and that just takes them to
