00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
sound goes on forever so it is the live

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.610 
sound goes on forever so it is the live

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
ending the five consonant sounds we've

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.010 
ending the five consonant sounds we've
learned<00:03:34.890> are<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.520> only<00:03:35.670> ones<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.330> can<00:03:36.540> end<00:03:36.840> a

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
learned are the only ones that can end a

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.250 
learned are the only ones that can end a
syllable<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.680> make<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.250> ending<00:03:38.580> life<00:03:39.260> for

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
syllable and make the ending life for

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.440 
syllable and make the ending life for
example<00:03:40.740> you<00:03:41.070> can<00:03:41.280> keep<00:03:41.520> making<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:42.060> sounds

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
example you can keep making the sounds

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.510 
example you can keep making the sounds
hmm<00:03:43.050> or<00:03:44.270> mm<00:03:45.270> for<00:03:46.020> as<00:03:46.110> long<00:03:46.290> as<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.590> like<00:03:46.800> but

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
hmm or mm for as long as you like but

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.800 
hmm or mm for as long as you like but
you<00:03:47.640> could<00:03:47.910> not<00:03:48.120> do<00:03:48.420> it<00:03:48.540> with<00:03:48.870> or<00:03:49.710> SHhhh

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
you could not do it with or SHhhh

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.390 
you could not do it with or SHhhh
so<00:03:51.810> now<00:03:51.960> that<00:03:52.080> we<00:03:52.230> know<00:03:52.260> what<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.650> live<00:03:52.890> sound<00:03:53.160> is

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
so now that we know what a live sound is

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.760 
so now that we know what a live sound is
we<00:03:53.820> can<00:03:54.030> learn<00:03:54.180> our<00:03:54.390> first<00:03:54.600> tone<00:03:54.870> rule<00:03:55.110> which

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
we can learn our first tone rule which

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.670 
we can learn our first tone rule which

now let's use a tone rule to make some

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.840 
now let's use a tone rule to make some
