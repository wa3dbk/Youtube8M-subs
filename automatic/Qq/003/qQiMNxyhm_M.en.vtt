00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.880
 auguste stoll of repercussions of the 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.350

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.180
 repercussions the other characters that 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.510

 the min yong kim are all the characters 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.590
 that the game brings by default is 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.290
 really militates and I do not know what it is that 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.970
 because they are here this good forgiveness for 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.350

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.960
 boats do not go out in bed at all 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.479
 moment so I do not know why they are here 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.280
 then we have a damon bert of 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.259
 repercussions achieved through 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.600
 of a code for the usa as a cell 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.880
 one thing if it really is a bit easy 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.979
 to get it if you have a phone 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.470
 from the USA some relative or if you have 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.910
 someone will have fun, it's very easy then 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.210
 we have love with zinc is how good it was 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.470
 my presale character this jackson 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.690

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.360
 marketing and he 's young or as he was known 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.220
 before giving it thai callisto from the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.420
 jungle or the jungle such that good this one yes 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.009
 it's a little harder to 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.470
 get it from you by buying a 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.970
 meat equal in the USA and that recently 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.920
 they say everything is done and I do not know 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.800

 to ask in the video because I have 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.880

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.170
 level 12 some say they do not know that we 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.000

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.660

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.730
 let's move on to what is being the 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.530
 skins in this case to use 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.959
 let's use the sofia model 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.330
 henrik to model the skin as the 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.330
 great model that is and we're going to move on to 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.560
 first that is copper see how the 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.700
 armor is filled with copper that's very 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.350
 important I know who can be used 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.330
 both in cold and domination form of 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.860
 the teams as they adapt them to 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.160
 game mode and I walk a little 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.140
 we have chrome 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.750
 to the bee that is still very good but 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.120
 well I think this should know 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.730
 kilometers distance route is 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.860
 would locate and with this for worse more in 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.860
 streets that is a dark map this is 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.540
 look I'm going here I'm kill me and then 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.200
 we have the mummy that good is very 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.840
 good skin we have the cartoon that 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.460
 it is more or less counted pretzel deal with 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.950
 the putt down when it locates 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.110
 your friends more or less like that it looks good 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.940
 according to me, we have the ham that I do not know 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.130
 why is it called ham but good i think 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.130
 which is like simulating or wanting to simulate 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.500
 like that inner muscles this one 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.690
 and good states board we have the 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.550
 paintball that the truth is horrible not 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.250
 I think nobody wants to play like that but 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.350
 there will never be that taste we do not have the 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.280
 pictures what good is a little bit of how 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.110
 a camouflage are yesterday we talked in the 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.020
 in the podcast that is how it is a kind 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.240

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.770
 out of the córdoba and if it was not 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.420
 I liked the corbatita more 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.550

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.610

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.290
 alarm the arctic hard alarm that good 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.880
 really this is the one I like the most 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.160
 me because mostly I who used the unique 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.710

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.580

 brightness and a tone of white tone this 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.970

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.319

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:46.780
 cool is the same as the skin of the gun 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.729

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.949
