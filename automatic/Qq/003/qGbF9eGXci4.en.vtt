00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
comparatively if the developers haven't

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.450 
comparatively if the developers haven't
expanded<00:01:54.450> upon<00:01:54.869> their<00:01:55.079> play<00:01:55.350> styles<00:01:55.860> I'm<00:01:56.189> very

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
expanded upon their play styles I'm very

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.219 
expanded upon their play styles I'm very
much<00:01:56.610> hoping<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.090> both<00:01:57.270> Dante<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.960> Nero

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
much hoping that both Dante and Nero

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.020 
much hoping that both Dante and Nero
have<00:01:58.500> been<00:01:58.649> given<00:01:58.920> new<00:01:59.100> weapons<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.700> attack

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
have been given new weapons and attack

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.880 
have been given new weapons and attack
so<00:02:00.299> as<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.509> flesh<00:02:00.750> out<00:02:00.869> their<00:02:01.079> game<00:02:01.350> mechanics

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
so as to flesh out their game mechanics

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.069 
so as to flesh out their game mechanics
because<00:02:02.430> as<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.610> stands<00:02:03.000> right<00:02:03.119> now<00:02:03.329> Virgil

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
because as it stands right now Virgil

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.899

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
as her but again I'm not sure how much

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.099 
as her but again I'm not sure how much
she<00:03:40.440> is<00:03:40.560> going<00:03:40.739> to<00:03:40.859> have<00:03:41.100> at<00:03:41.310> our<00:03:41.340> disposal<00:03:42.109> but

she is going to have at our disposal but

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.380 
she is going to have at our disposal but
again<00:03:43.920> I'm<00:03:44.130> very<00:03:44.430> much<00:03:44.549> intrigued<00:03:44.970> by<00:03:45.329> these

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
again I'm very much intrigued by these

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.819 
again I'm very much intrigued by these
two<00:03:46.109> ladies<00:03:46.380> in<00:03:46.620> DMC<00:03:47.220> for<00:03:47.609> SE<00:03:48.239> so<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.959> can't<00:03:49.620> wait

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
two ladies in DMC for SE so I can't wait

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.800 
two ladies in DMC for SE so I can't wait
to<00:03:49.859> get<00:03:50.070> my<00:03:50.220> hands<00:03:50.459> on<00:03:50.609> the<00:03:50.730> game<00:03:50.940> all<00:03:51.299> in<00:03:51.660> all

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
to get my hands on the game all in all

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.460 
to get my hands on the game all in all
though<00:03:52.049> I<00:03:52.320> I<00:03:52.350> do<00:03:52.799> feel<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.880> if<00:03:54.299> Dante<00:03:55.140> and

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
though I I do feel that if Dante and

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.430 
though I I do feel that if Dante and
Nero<00:03:56.100> are<00:03:56.489> not<00:03:56.670> given<00:03:57.060> some<00:03:57.420> extra<00:03:57.780> abilities

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
Nero are not given some extra abilities

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.160 
Nero are not given some extra abilities
they<00:03:59.069> are<00:03:59.370> going<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.910> be<00:04:00.060> forgotten<00:04:00.540> in<00:04:00.959> this

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
they are going to be forgotten in this

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.430 
they are going to be forgotten in this
edition<00:04:01.470> of<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.739> game<00:04:01.910> I<00:04:03.019> suppose<00:04:04.019> that's<00:04:04.170> not

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
edition of the game I suppose that's not

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.770 
edition of the game I suppose that's not
necessarily<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:05.069> bad<00:04:05.280> thing<00:04:05.340> because<00:04:05.730> for<00:04:06.660> many

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
necessarily a bad thing because for many

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.539 
necessarily a bad thing because for many
of<00:04:06.959> us<00:04:07.079> we<00:04:07.200> have<00:04:07.440> been<00:04:07.620> playing<00:04:07.799> through<00:04:08.220> devil

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
of us we have been playing through devil

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.690 
of us we have been playing through devil
may<00:04:08.640> cry<00:04:08.910> for<00:04:09.440> quite<00:04:10.440> a<00:04:10.470> bit<00:04:10.739> with<00:04:10.920> both<00:04:11.130> Dante

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
may cry for quite a bit with both Dante

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.539 
may cry for quite a bit with both Dante
and<00:04:12.060> Nero<00:04:12.420> so<00:04:12.959> it's<00:04:13.200> about<00:04:13.319> time<00:04:13.739> for<00:04:13.769> a<00:04:14.190> change

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
and Nero so it's about time for a change

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.900 
and Nero so it's about time for a change
up<00:04:14.880> but<00:04:15.420> I<00:04:15.450> do<00:04:15.540> very<00:04:15.989> much<00:04:16.109> hope<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.910> Capcom

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
up but I do very much hope that Capcom

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.180 
up but I do very much hope that Capcom
gives<00:04:18.389> them<00:04:18.630> some<00:04:18.930> extra<00:04:19.380> abilities<00:04:19.950> or

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
gives them some extra abilities or

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.260 
gives them some extra abilities or
weapons<00:04:20.639> or<00:04:20.820> tax<00:04:21.269> or<00:04:21.630> styles<00:04:22.520> to<00:04:23.520> sort<00:04:24.060> of

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
weapons or tax or styles to sort of

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.510 
weapons or tax or styles to sort of
level<00:04:24.659> the<00:04:24.840> playing<00:04:25.110> field<00:04:25.260> when<00:04:25.890> it<00:04:25.919> comes<00:04:26.190> to

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
level the playing field when it comes to

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.450 
level the playing field when it comes to
you<00:04:26.580> playing<00:04:27.150> as<00:04:27.330> characters<00:04:27.960> because<00:04:28.319> I<00:04:28.560> do

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
you playing as characters because I do

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.820 
you playing as characters because I do
feel<00:04:29.639> as<00:04:30.240> though<00:04:30.479> with<00:04:31.169> the<00:04:31.199> way<00:04:31.410> things<00:04:31.470> are

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
feel as though with the way things are

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.159 
feel as though with the way things are
going<00:04:31.860> right<00:04:32.099> now<00:04:32.460> Dante<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.479> neuro<00:04:33.780> will

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
going right now Dante and neuro will

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.249 
going right now Dante and neuro will
feel<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.830> least<00:04:35.120> complete<00:04:36.120> in<00:04:36.419> the<00:04:36.479> game

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
feel the least complete in the game

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.129 
feel the least complete in the game
because<00:04:37.830> they<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:39.030> developers<00:04:39.750> have<00:04:39.930> done

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
because they the developers have done

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.700 
because they the developers have done
quite<00:04:40.740> a<00:04:40.889> job<00:04:41.039> with<00:04:41.669> flushing<00:04:42.240> outs<00:04:42.710> Virgil

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
quite a job with flushing outs Virgil

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
seems like a very very complete

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.040 
seems like a very very complete
character<00:04:52.460> which<00:04:53.460> is<00:04:53.729> not<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:54.659> case<00:04:54.690> with

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:08.819 
worried about how Dante and Nero will be

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:11.600 
worried about how Dante and Nero will be
are<00:05:09.750> you<00:05:09.930> worried<00:05:10.319> that<00:05:10.349> Capcom<00:05:11.099> will<00:05:11.280> not<00:05:11.490> be

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
are you worried that Capcom will not be

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.460

adding<00:05:12.060> anything<00:05:12.300> to<00:05:12.720> those<00:05:13.020> two<00:05:13.229> characters

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
adding anything to those two characters

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.520 
adding anything to those two characters
and<00:05:14.099> will<00:05:14.490> leave<00:05:14.699> them<00:05:14.880> as<00:05:15.090> they<00:05:15.120> are

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530
