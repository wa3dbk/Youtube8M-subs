 Hello friends, today I am going to 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.090
 talk about osteoporosis health 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.300
 female an extremely 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.880
 frequent after menopause 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.150
 osteoporosis when the bones ask 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.820
 help women have acquired 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.730
 risky habits like consuming little 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.849
 calcium for your bone health match 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.949
 specialists your early diagnosis is 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.790
 the fundamental tool to prevent 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.920
 fractures today there are treatments that 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.399
 they prevent bone reabsorption or 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.739
 stimulate their training one can be seen and 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.379
 feel barbaric but maybe our 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.050
 Bones are asking for help from experts 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.329
 affirms Dr. Claire and Amagar il 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.570
 charge of the climacteric section of the 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.879
 hospital is a fundamental 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.850
 early diagnosis because when the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.100
 osteoporosis present some symptom this one 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.660
 It will be the fracture and it will be too late 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.690
 prevent it 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.510
 in Argentina the disease causes 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.940
 expenses for more than 300 million pesos 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.860
 annuals only one of each is diagnosed 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.340
 two vertebral fractures 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.979
 osteoporosis a new report indicates that 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.770
 this type of injury is more frequent than 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.740
 the hip in the young population the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.450
 international osteoporosis foundation 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.540
 warns that evil does not only affect 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.340
 elderly the population economically 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.790
 active at risk in europe the us and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.860
 Canada more than 50% of the 48,000 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.320
 millions of dollars spent 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.509
 annually to treat fractures by 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.509
 osteoporosis in the population that works 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.820
 could be saved as in the 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.240
 Argentina where the cost is estimated 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.090
 total for fractures exceeds 297 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.119
 million pesos a year because such 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.220
 figures partly because only one of each 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.070
 two vertebral fractures is 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.110
 diagnosed by a doctor as indicated 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.930

 the grandmother breaking her hip is the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.490
 clearest example of the consequences 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.980
 of osteoporosis a badly characterized 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.930
 for significant bone loss the 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.880
 deterioration of its architecture and 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.600
 increased susceptibility to 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.790
 fractures however a new report 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.130
 released yesterday by the iof highlights that 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.050
 vertebral fractures are more serious 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.630
 as a problem in the workplace 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.060
 than the hip because they affect the 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.980
 Younger people 50 years old or younger 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.560

 will be held in May in Rio de Janeiro for

 lederman osteoporosis is catching up 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.380
 epidemic proportions in america

 different estimates suggest that in 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.060
 the next 50 years will double the 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.670
 number of hip fractures one of the 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.530
 more closely associated with the loss 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.530
 of bone mass that characterizes the 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.530
 osteoporosis nowadays in america 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.770
 Latin and asia occurs on 25th 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:38.510
 percent of osteoporotic fractures 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:40.550
 in 2050 they will hoard 50 percent one 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.970
 of every five men will suffer from 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.780
 osteoporosis new studies show 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.760
 that is not uncommon among males 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.000
 advise a densitometry at 70 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.490
 years for decades it was thought that the 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.850
 osteoporosis was a women's thing 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.920
 now recent studies reveal that the 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.350
 risk of males suffering from this evil 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.200
 that mines the health of the bones is a lot 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.950
 greater than what was believed it is estimated that 1 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.820
 of every 5 men over 50 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.840
 will experience an osteoporotic fracture 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.180
 traditionally considered a 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.370
 women's disease in the last 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.729
 decade has emerged the notion that 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.960
 bone loss also an inevitable 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:26.260
 consequence of the aging of the 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.570
 man points out the report of the foundation 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.600
 International Osteoporosis iof by 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.830
 its acronym in English the risk of a 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.560
 male suffering from a fracture 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.240
 osteoporotic at some point in your 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.900
 life is greater than your risk of 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.540
 develop prostate cancer 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.540
 results of a survey on 538 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:51.260
 none cases reached the intake 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.860
 recommended the Argentines consume little 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.020
 calcium this lack puts at risk the 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.880
 strength of your bones and increases the 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.889
 the possibility of osteoporosis 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.350
 specialists claim that it is for 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.169
 ignorance or lack of resources 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.300
 to buy food there is no 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.840
 differences between patients centers 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.180
 public and private according to a study 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.479
 performed in seven cities of the 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.690
 Argentina nine out of ten over 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:23.360
 65 years have vitamin deficiency 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.430
 This nutrient is essential for 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.870
 bones and their lack favors 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.970
 fractures between 95 and 97 percent 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.460
 of the population does not cover 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.440
 daily calcium requirements a 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.380
 new ally in the fight against 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.900
 Obesity studies show that their 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.419
 consumption reduces by up to 70 percent 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.220
 the risk of suffering this mineral 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.370
 accelerates lipid metabolism 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.250
 How are these good things explained? 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.949
 revealed we have discovered that at 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.900
 optimize calcium intake that 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.970
 person who had a poor diet in 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.460
 this mineral ignites a hormone 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.620
 called calcitriol that in addition to acting 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.680
 over the bones causes the cells 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.530
 fats the adipocytes accelerate their 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.240
 metabolism and burn more fat said to the 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.639
