research here has taken off in the last
10<00:01:43.870> years<00:01:44.110> in<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:44.620> way<00:01:44.740> I<00:01:44.770> didn't<00:01:45.100> thinking<00:01:45.400> I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
10 years in a way I didn't thinking I

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.980 
10 years in a way I didn't thinking I
didn't<00:01:45.820> think<00:01:45.940> it<00:01:46.060> was<00:01:46.120> possible<00:01:46.420> and<00:01:46.870> the

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
didn't think it was possible and the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.540 
didn't think it was possible and the
publications<00:01:47.680> that<00:01:47.830> they're<00:01:48.010> getting<00:01:48.130> out<00:01:48.400> of

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
publications that they're getting out of

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.340 
publications that they're getting out of
it<00:01:48.640> very<00:01:48.670> very<00:01:49.150> interesting<00:01:49.810> this<00:01:50.080> is<00:01:50.260> the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
it very very interesting this is the

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.260 
it very very interesting this is the
kind<00:01:50.560> of<00:01:50.620> research<00:01:50.950> that<00:01:51.010> could<00:01:51.790> easily<00:01:51.940> be

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
kind of research that could easily be

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.680 
kind of research that could easily be
master's<00:01:52.750> degrees<00:01:53.140> that<00:01:53.800> can<00:01:54.280> expand<00:01:55.270> and

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
master's degrees that can expand and

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.110 
master's degrees that can expand and
become<00:01:55.810> doctoral<00:01:56.440> dissertations<00:01:57.220> this<00:01:57.820> is

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
become doctoral dissertations this is

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.800 
become doctoral dissertations this is
quality<00:01:58.990> research<00:01:59.560> it's<00:02:00.100> not<00:02:00.810> undergraduate

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
quality research it's not undergraduate

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.650 
quality research it's not undergraduate
research<00:02:02.200> its<00:02:02.770> undergraduates<00:02:03.670> doing

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
research its undergraduates doing

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.450 
research its undergraduates doing
research<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:05.380> just<00:02:05.770> think<00:02:05.920> it's<00:02:06.040> kind<00:02:06.280> of<00:02:06.340> a

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
research I just think it's kind of a

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.240 
research I just think it's kind of a
smaller<00:02:06.760> I<00:02:07.150> would<00:02:08.050> say<00:02:08.140> almost<00:02:08.350> family<00:02:08.709> rather

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
smaller I would say almost family rather

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.740 
smaller I would say almost family rather
