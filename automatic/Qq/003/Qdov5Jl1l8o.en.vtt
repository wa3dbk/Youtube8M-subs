00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
the fry are starting forward for food I

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.180 
the fry are starting forward for food I
go<00:00:55.000> ahead<00:00:55.090> and<00:00:55.180> put<00:00:55.649> algae<00:00:56.649> wafers<00:00:56.770> in<00:00:57.100> the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190

wafer for 100 fry the first week okay

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.030 
wafer for 100 fry the first week okay
that<00:01:07.300> gets<00:01:07.540> them<00:01:07.659> growing<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.259> they<00:01:08.800> grow

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
that gets them growing and they grow

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.899 
that gets them growing and they grow
doing<00:01:09.880> this<00:01:10.000> they<00:01:10.180> grow<00:01:10.390> amazingly<00:01:10.720> fast

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
doing this they grow amazingly fast

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.490 
doing this they grow amazingly fast

week day seven date somewhere in there I

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.130 
week day seven date somewhere in there I
change<00:01:19.270> it<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.479> two<00:01:19.780> wafers<00:01:20.649> per<00:01:20.680> 100<00:01:21.399> fried<00:01:22.140> by

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
change it to two wafers per 100 fried by

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.050 
change it to two wafers per 100 fried by
now<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:23.410> fish<00:01:23.800> are<00:01:24.009> close<00:01:24.340> to<00:01:24.520> what<00:01:24.670> happened

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
now the fish are close to what happened

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.300 
now the fish are close to what happened
it's<00:01:25.210> long<00:01:25.450> and

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
it's long and

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.670 
it's long and
they're<00:01:27.549> just<00:01:28.119> what<00:01:28.540> happens<00:01:28.900> as<00:01:29.020> we<00:01:29.049> value<00:01:29.350> it

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
they're just what happens as we value it

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.399 
they're just what happens as we value it
sink<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.310> bottom<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.909> they<00:01:31.780> soften<00:01:32.229> up

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
sink to the bottom and they soften up

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.950 
sink to the bottom and they soften up
and<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:33.190> fish<00:01:33.340> just<00:01:33.790> crowd<00:01:34.270> around<00:01:34.299> them<00:01:34.780> and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
and the fish just crowd around them and

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.590 
and the fish just crowd around them and
just<00:01:35.380> eat<00:01:35.590> them<00:01:35.740> till<00:01:35.950> they're<00:01:36.070> gone<00:01:36.220> and<00:01:36.600> like

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
just eat them till they're gone and like

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.050 
just eat them till they're gone and like
I<00:01:37.690> said<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:38.049> growth<00:01:38.470> rate<00:01:38.770> is<00:01:39.340> amazing<00:01:39.880> you

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
I said the growth rate is amazing you

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.670 
I said the growth rate is amazing you
should<00:01:40.090> be<00:01:40.390> able<00:01:40.509> to<00:01:40.720> get<00:01:40.960> doing<00:01:41.380> this<00:01:41.530> you

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
should be able to get doing this you

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.230 
should be able to get doing this you
should<00:01:41.740> be<00:01:41.920> able<00:01:42.040> to<00:01:42.190> get<00:01:42.310> these<00:01:42.460> fry<00:01:42.759> up<00:01:42.940> to<00:01:43.119> an

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
should be able to get these fry up to an

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.060 
should be able to get these fry up to an
inch<00:01:43.509> in<00:01:43.750> about<00:01:44.020> three<00:01:44.500> three<00:01:44.800> and<00:01:44.830> a<00:01:44.950> half

inch in about three three and a half

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.870 
inch in about three three and a half
weeks<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:47.369> then<00:01:48.369> when<00:01:48.550> they<00:01:48.670> get<00:01:48.820> to

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
weeks and then when they get to

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.120 
weeks and then when they get to
fingerling<00:01:49.780> state<00:01:50.020> which<00:01:50.350> is<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:50.740> it's<00:01:51.070> a

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
fingerling state which is and it's a

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.070 
fingerling state which is and it's a
little<00:01:51.250> bit<00:01:51.430> over<00:01:51.729> an<00:01:51.790> inch<00:01:51.940> you<00:01:52.810> can<00:01:52.840> go<00:01:53.020> ahead

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
little bit over an inch you can go ahead

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.260 
little bit over an inch you can go ahead
and<00:01:53.350> change<00:01:53.530> them<00:01:53.710> over<00:01:53.920> to<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.190> aqua<00:01:54.460> max<00:01:54.670> 300

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
and change them over to the aqua max 300

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.570 
and change them over to the aqua max 300
and<00:01:55.659> they'll<00:01:55.869> be<00:01:55.990> fine<00:01:56.259> or<00:01:57.070> you<00:01:57.220> can<00:01:57.369> still

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
and they'll be fine or you can still

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.789 
and they'll be fine or you can still

tilapia web algae they eat it all the
time<00:02:03.310> with<00:02:03.549> if<00:02:03.759> they<00:02:03.850> can<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:05.909> that's<00:02:06.909> what<00:02:07.119> I

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
time with if they can and that's what I
