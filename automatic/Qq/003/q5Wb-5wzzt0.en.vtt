00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.219

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.399
 I'm interested in those who watch me 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.890
 still if you want to see the basel 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.910

 computer laptop but in any case me 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.470

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.970
 only two pieces of information do you want that 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.100
 Seeing at all suits me 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.869
 you would look at me firstly 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.340
 and second, maybe from the people 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.369
 have already played by so because 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.150

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.590
 ordered the box is the same and 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.810

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.400
 you want to play at all is good enough 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.659
 I see on 1 place I mean so 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.009
 something like walkways or something like that anyway 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.820
 cut out because you've got to not 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.229
 to worry about 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.299
 I would not either and as so often 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.250
 a hundred percent go and mostly that 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.570
 play has gone through and joy is the whole 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.560
 time the cats in between over on with 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.860
 Somehow I had found 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.860
 I'm fine 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.010
 yes, do not complain why I am now 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.440
 unaware or what else I stand for 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:00.690
 just follow this, do not say anything against it 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:03.180
 are great that actually do something 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.540
 should not tell you to break it 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.290
