00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
year but originally he looked like this

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.280 
year but originally he looked like this
and<00:00:47.110> he<00:00:47.830> had<00:00:48.010> red<00:00:48.280> eyes<00:00:48.489> and<00:00:48.519> red<00:00:49.000> ears<00:00:49.300> and<00:00:49.690> no

gold<00:00:50.820> trim<00:00:51.820> around<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.420> cassette<00:00:52.809> deck<00:00:53.070> where

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
gold trim around the cassette deck where

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.710 
gold trim around the cassette deck where
the<00:00:54.190> new<00:00:54.339> issue<00:00:54.519> does<00:00:54.820> have<00:00:55.030> gold<00:00:55.269> trim<00:00:55.510> and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
the new issue does have gold trim and

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.210 
the new issue does have gold trim and
has<00:00:55.809> silver<00:00:56.230> in<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:56.440> face<00:00:56.620> instead<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:57.070> the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
has silver in the face instead of the

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.460 
has silver in the face instead of the
red<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:01.120> this<00:01:01.329> one<00:01:01.510> here<00:01:01.780> you<00:01:01.900> could<00:01:02.110> say<00:01:02.290> is<00:01:02.440> a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
red so this one here you could say is a

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.170 
red so this one here you could say is a
second<00:01:02.860> generation<00:01:03.000> generation<00:01:04.000> one

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180

second generation generation one
oversized<00:01:04.690> Soundwave<00:01:05.140> I<00:01:05.290> suppose<00:01:05.650> we<00:01:06.430> can

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
oversized Soundwave I suppose we can

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.850 
oversized Soundwave I suppose we can
compare<00:01:06.970> them<00:01:07.090> to<00:01:07.119> the<00:01:07.630> original<00:01:07.860> Soundwave

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
compare them to the original Soundwave

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.000 
compare them to the original Soundwave
this<00:01:09.610> is<00:01:09.729> a<00:01:09.760> toys-r-us<00:01:10.540> reissue<00:01:10.960> so<00:01:11.619> he's<00:01:11.830> like

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
this is a toys-r-us reissue so he's like

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.039 
this is a toys-r-us reissue so he's like
blaster<00:01:12.549> he's<00:01:13.030> got<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.360> double<00:01:13.479> tape<00:01:13.810> deck

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
blaster he's got the double tape deck

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.670 
blaster he's got the double tape deck
and<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:14.830> does<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.340> oversize<00:01:15.820> here<00:01:16.380> same<00:01:17.380> thing

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
and so does the oversize here same thing

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.590 
and so does the oversize here same thing
I<00:01:17.920> don't<00:01:18.189> have<00:01:18.460> his<00:01:18.729> weapons<00:01:19.150> lugging<00:01:19.510> around

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
I don't have his weapons lugging around

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.710 
I don't have his weapons lugging around
so<00:01:20.140> I'll<00:01:20.890> take<00:01:21.130> his<00:01:21.189> weapons<00:01:21.729> off<00:01:22.000> you<00:01:22.240> can<00:01:22.420> get

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
so I'll take his weapons off you can get

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.649 
so I'll take his weapons off you can get
a<00:01:22.750> better<00:01:22.990> look<00:01:23.110> and<00:01:23.740> a<00:01:24.040> little<00:01:24.159> bit<00:01:24.369> easier<00:01:24.760> we

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
a better look and a little bit easier we

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.740 
a better look and a little bit easier we
can<00:01:25.689> also<00:01:25.990> compare<00:01:26.439> ravage<00:01:26.890> and<00:01:27.070> laser<00:01:27.400> big

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
can also compare ravage and laser big

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:43.370 
can also compare ravage and laser big
put<00:01:28.750> them<00:01:28.900> side-by-side

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.060 

and<00:01:44.070> they<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.670> pretty<00:01:44.850> much<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.270> same<00:01:45.450> molds

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
and they are pretty much the same molds

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.289 
and they are pretty much the same molds
except<00:01:47.070> he<00:01:47.430> doesn't<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> feet<00:01:48.060> and

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
except he doesn't have the feet and

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:55.880 
except he doesn't have the feet and
there's<00:01:48.630> no<00:01:48.780> metal<00:01:49.080> parts<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.500> them

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.690 

but<00:01:56.520> otherwise<00:01:56.700> they're<00:01:57.000> pretty<00:01:57.180> nice

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
stickers pretty much the same detailing

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.910 
stickers pretty much the same detailing
is<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.190> same<00:02:05.430> nice<00:02:05.790> clapping<00:02:06.480> this<00:02:06.920> couldn't

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
is the same nice clapping this couldn't

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:16.610 
is the same nice clapping this couldn't
ask<00:02:08.160> for<00:02:08.310> more<00:02:14.570> weapons<00:02:15.570> do<00:02:15.750> open<00:02:16.050> up<00:02:16.140> also

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.230 
ask for more weapons do open up also
this<00:02:17.010> doesn't<00:02:17.340> fire<00:02:17.520> just<00:02:18.000> pull<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.240> out

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.070 

transformation<00:02:24.240> is<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.450> course<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.840> famous

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
transformation is of course the famous

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.980 
transformation is of course the famous
g'wan<00:02:25.850> I'll<00:02:26.850> start<00:02:27.120> with<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.360> cassette<00:02:27.690> since

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
g'wan I'll start with the cassette since

00:02:27.990 --> 00:03:04.649 
g'wan I'll start with the cassette since
they're<00:02:28.370> smaller

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:25.710 

goes<00:03:05.659> together<00:03:06.019> nice<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.290> tight

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720

he has his belt strapped all the little
bells<00:03:29.740> and<00:03:29.950> whistles<00:03:30.250> if<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.460> other<00:03:30.580> one<00:03:30.790> does

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
bells and whistles if the other one does

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.460 
bells and whistles if the other one does
like<00:03:33.820> I<00:03:33.940> said<00:03:34.180> he's<00:03:34.300> got<00:03:34.450> blasters<00:03:34.930> Kage<00:03:35.170> so

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
like I said he's got blasters Kage so

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.710 
like I said he's got blasters Kage so
both<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.860> sets<00:03:36.100> can<00:03:36.280> fit<00:03:36.460> in<00:03:36.690> without<00:03:37.690> a

both the sets can fit in without a
problem<00:03:40.710> close<00:03:41.710> up

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.990 

we<00:03:47.819> can<00:03:47.970> compare<00:03:48.330> them<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.660> generation<00:03:49.410> 1

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
we can compare them to the generation 1

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.210 
we can compare them to the generation 1
